Sign up for the free newsletter to get important environmental news by registering at this link.

It’s been about 20 years since Minnesota where the chemical giant 3M is based first began investigating drinking water contamination around a 3M factory that made the class of chemicals known as PFAS or per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances. Around the same time a lawyer named Rob Bilott was looking into similar pollution from a DuPont factory in West Virginia that was causing the gruesome deaths of nearby cows.

This was the beginning of the public consciousness around what we now call “forever chemicals.” In the wake of these investigations 3M and DuPont pledged to stop making PFOA and PFOS which are only two out of thousands of different types of PFAS. Minnesota settled with 3M for $850 million and DuPont spun off its PFAS business into the company now called Chemours.

Since then PFAS hotspots have arisen like a game of whack-a-mole in states including Maine where the chemicals have tainted sludge fertilizer that the state long encouraged for use on farms and seeped into waterways from military firefighting foam use. Marina Schauffler reported on topics like these in-depth in The Maine Monitor’s recent series “Invisible and Indestructible.” Regulators in places like New England have said that PFAS issues identified so far are only the tip of the iceberg for what’s to come.

3M and DuPont along with companies that bought PFAS from them now face scores of lawsuits — from states towns fire departments and individuals — accusing them of marketing the chemicals for use in all manner of other household and industrial products all while knowing the risks. The chemicals persist for decades in the environment and are linked to a range of deadly human health problems. Reporting by The Intercept has shown the 3M knew this and sought to bury it using a similar playbook to that of Exxon in regards to climate change. Now state and federal regulation of PFAS is finally on the rise years after Rob Bilott first began calling for these reforms.

It was likely with this massive legal liability in mind that 3M announced this week it will stop making and using PFAS altogether by 2025. “While PFAS can be safely made and used we also see an opportunity to lead in a rapidly evolving external regulatory and business landscape to make the greatest impact for those we serve” said 3M CEO Mike Roman in a press release.

It’s a splashy headline but what does it really mean? In many ways the PFAS cat is out of the bag — in Maine and worldwide the chemicals have been shown to be in drinking water wastewater rivers our bodies breast milk crops soil compost food packaging pets wildlife. Removing and destroying PFAS is an evolving challenge and towns states and water utilities are struggling to figure out how to fund testing and treatment. After 3M’s announcement some called for the company to go much further in helping fund this effort.

In the U.S. 3M has made the chemicals at factories in Minnesota Illinois and Alabama — all of which are or have been the subject of drinking water contamination investigations. Illinois is the most recent of these — there federal authorities stepped in to order a response to PFAS in the Mississippi River after reporting has shown state regulators failed to take action for years. And 3M and DuPont are not the only companies that have caused PFAS pollution. Factories that use the chemicals to make their own products — such as Saint-Gobain in New Hampshire — are the subject of similar investigations and PFAS in firefighting foam has polluted water at scores of airports and military installations.

The chemicals are used in paper-making which has caused some of Maine’s PFAS pollution and attracted class-action lawsuits as Mainers begin to ask how the chemicals have harmed their health land and water and who will pay to make it right. Maine has not yet joined the huge raft of federal lawsuits against 3M DuPont and firefighting foam makers which is being heard in combination in South Carolina but state Attorney General Aaron Frey said in May that the state planned to do so soon.

Billions in eventual legal settlements with 3M DuPont and other companies that used PFAS could help cover testing cleanup and health costs. But those cases may stretch for decades as has DuPont’s fight with cancer patients and others whose health problems are linked to PFAS in the Ohio River Valley. 3M has also opposed some state PFAS regulations in court — they successfully delayed New Hampshire’s limits for the chemicals by a year for example by suing over the rules’ use of Minnesota science on PFAS and pregnant people.

It’s unclear from this week’s 3M announcement what will become of the lawsuits the company is facing for past manufacture and sale of PFAS. “3M will continue to remediate PFAS and address litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions” the company said in its release.

It’s also unclear what the future holds for the successor chemicals to PFAS known as GenX — shorter chains of molecules that have been shown to have some of the same problems and risks. GenX chemicals have already been the subject of at least one settlement around a Chemours factory in North Carolina. According to New Hampshire Public Radio 3M declined to answer questions about what its PFAS announcement meant for GenX manufacturing.

“I think the devil is in the details here because PFAS is such a large class of chemicals” New Hampshire-based PFAS activist Andrea Amico whose family was exposed to the chemicals in Portsmouth N.H. told NHPR’s Mara Hoplamazian. “I’m really curious as to how 3M defines PFAS and if they’re truly going to stop making all PFAS chemicals or if it’s just a certain type of PFAS.”

Other advocates agreed that 3M’s move raised more questions than it answered both about the company’s next steps and the fate of PFAS throughout society.

“After telling everyone — their neighbors their workers and their regulators — that PFAS are safe while poisoning the entire planet 3M is now pledging to slink out the back door with no accountability. Congress and the courts cannot allow this to happen” said Scott Faber a senior vice president with the Environmental Working Group in comments sent to media. “No one should trust 3M’s commitment to do the right thing. They never have before.”

Several busloads of migrants were dropped off in front of Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence in Washington DC on Christmas Eve in 18 degree weather late Saturday.

An initial two busloads were taken to local shelters according to an administration official. More buses arrived outside the vice president’s residence later Saturday evening. A CNN team saw migrants being dropped off with some migrants wearing only T-shirts in the freezing weather. They were given blankets and put on another bus that went to a local church.

Amy Fischer a volunteer with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network which has been receiving migrants sent to DC since the spring said the organization had been prepared for Saturday night’s arrivals having been informed about it earlier by an NGO working at the border in Texas.

The arrivals included asylum seekers from Ecuador Cuba Nicaragua Venezuela Peru and Colombia according to Fischer who told CNN the buses were supposed to go to New York but were diverted to DC due to the weather. Busloads of migrants have been arriving in Washington weekly since April.

“The DC community has been welcoming buses from Texas anytime they’ve come since April. Christmas Eve and freezing cold weather is no different” Fischer said. “We are always here welcoming folks with open arms.”

SAMU First Response a nonprofit that has been assisting migrants since the buses began coming to Washington earlier this year was also on the ground Saturday night helping arrivals. The organization’s managing director Tatiana Laborde described the stunt as “extremely inhumane” but said if done properly it could provide a road map to easing tensions at the southern border.

“What they’re seeing is much worse than what we see here. The three buses are just a small portion of what they experience on a day to day” Laborde said in an interview with Sara Sidner on “CNN This Morning” on Monday.

“If things like this are done in a coordinated and humane manner it could really be a good option for those border towns that are struggling” she added.

Laborde said most migrants were aware of the buses’ destinations and she said about 60% were headed to New York either to shelters or to stay with friends and family. She described this as “a pattern we’ve been seeing over the past couple months.”

It’s not clear who is responsible for sending the migrants to the Naval Observatory where the vice president’s residence is located though CNN reported earlier this year that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had sent buses of migrants north including to a location outside Harris’ home. CNN has reached out to Abbott’s office for comment on the latest arrivals.

The White House however put the blame on the Texas governor calling it a “cruel dangerous and shameful stunt.”

“Governor Abbott abandoned children on the side of the road in below freezing temperatures on Christmas Eve without coordinating with any Federal or local authorities” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said in a statement.

“As we have repeatedly said we are willing to work with anyone – Republican or Democrat alike – on real solutions like the comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures President Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office but these political games accomplish nothing and only put lives in danger” Hasan said.

Abbott is one of at least three Republican governors who have taken credit for busing or flying migrants north this year to protest the Biden administration’s immigration policies. He previously confirmed in September that his state had sent the buses to Harris’ residence at that time.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified the person who spoke about her group being prepared for the migrant arrivals. It was Amy Fischer a volunteer with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network.

It's a scary time to be an investor with the markets languishing and the threat of additional interest rate hikes next year weighing on stock prices. In this environment it is important to control risk and one way to do that is by investing in quality healthcare companies with consistent sustainable dividends.

Cardinal Health (CAH 1.50%) and AbbVie (ABBV 0.22%) offer dependable revenue growth with above-average dividends. These are the type of value companies investors turn to in tough times and they are likely to be among the first stocks to bounce back when the economy improves.

Cardinal is in the middle of everything

Cardinal Health's stock is up more than 60% over the past year. The drug and laboratory products distributor operates in two segments: pharmaceutical and medical. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023 it reported revenue of $49.6 billion up 13% year over year with income from operations of $137 million down 67% over the same period in 2022 and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 down 57% year over year. The pharmaceutical segment is the one fueling growth bringing in $46 billion of the company's first-quarter revenue up 15% year over year. Medical saw revenue fall by 9% to $3.8 billion with lower product and distribution sales.

The company's bottom line was hurt by supply chain issues and inflation because many of its contracts are long-term limiting how fast the company can raise prices. New CEO Jason Hollar however is focusing on raising prices.

Cardinal is also looking at improving its medical segment sales. In November the company in a collaborative effort with Medically Home launched a supply chain network and last-mile fulfillment solution Velocare. The point is to deliver hospital-level care at home for patients bringing critical products and services to patients within an hour or two saving money and bringing more efficient care.

What I like about Cardinal is it doesn't have the expenses that pharmaceutical and medical device makers do in developing and making drugs and medical devices. It carves out its own profits from being the middleman. With inflation rising so fast this past year that put a short-term strain on the company but it is built for long-term success with less risk than most healthcare companies.

Cardinal also offers an above-average quarterly dividend which it raised by 1% last year to $0.4957 per share the 36th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. Its current yield is roughly 2.5%.

AbbVie is prepared for its next phase

AbbVie has proven its doubters wrong for so long that they're even joining the shareholder ranks. Over the past year the pharmaceutical stock is up more than 20%.

The looming patent cliff for Humira has made AbbVie a better company. The immunology blockbuster's sales will likely decline beginning in 2023 when it faces biosimilar competition in the U.S. for the first time. CEO Richard Gonzalez said he expects sales for Humira to drop 45% by 2024. The anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy has long been the standard of care for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.

However AbbVie already has two drugs that are lining up to replace the $20 billion in revenue that Humira earned last year: Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Just as Humira did the two biologics are steadily adding approvals. Skyrizi gained its third Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval this summer to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease and it also picked up that approval this fall in Europe. Rinvoq already has approvals to treat active ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis along the spine) Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis atopic dermatitis rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.

AbbVie said last year that the two drugs should deliver $15 billion in annual revenue by 2025. They're well on the way as they combined to bring in $5.3 billion in the first nine months of this year with Skyrizi's sales up 75.6% year over year and Rinvoq's up 54.5% in that same period.

Thanks in no small part to a big research and development budget fueled by Humira profits the company has a huge pipeline particularly in oncology with 26 molecules currently in trials. Another drug with huge potential is Vraylar which earned its fourth indication this month by the FDA as an add-on therapy for major depressive disorder. An estimated 21 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2020 according to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The drug was already approved to treat schizophrenia manic or mixed episodes from bipolar I disorder and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.

The company is raising its dividend by 5% next quarter to $1.48 per share offering a yield of around 3.7% more than double the average S&P 500 dividend of 1.82%. AbbVie because it spent years as part of Abbott Laboratories is a Dividend King that is on schedule to raise its dividend for the 51st straight year. The one downside to AbbVie stock is the pain of knowing you could have gotten a lower share price a few months ago but that annoyance ends when you consider the company's potential for growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ACN,Accenture,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaWxlc3lydXAuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvYWotZmVybmFuZGV6LXJpdmVyYXMtcHVzaC10by1tYWtlLXF1ZWVyLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtYS1ub3JtLWluLXRlY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AJ Fernandez Rivera's push to make queer leadership a norm in tech,"Hopefuls aiming to enter the tech industry don’t have to look further than AJ Fernandez Rivera for inspiration. The industry trailblazer has modest roots starting as a computer programmer in the ’90s and working her way through the U.S. U.K. and Asia-Pacific. She is now a managing director at Accenture Canada.

But working in IT isn’t the only thing she’s known for. While certainly a passion she also advocates for queer people in tech talking about the many challenges they face. From experience she knows this industry is a good one to work in but if ongoing barriers go unaddressed the tech industry will miss out on talented individuals looking to do what they love.

This “personal passion” stems from challenges Fernandez Rivera faced herself once feeling alone in a space that refused to understand her.

Unconscious biases are one of the biggest challenges Fernandez Rivera told MobileSyrup. The thought process involves people using unconscious beliefs and stereotypes to categorize people into different groups. Everyone has them but they may not know when they’re using them.

“When you are a queer person and you join the industry you can’t be your true self” Fernandez Rivera said. “If we eliminate that barrier and make it an accepting environment the potential of queer people to actually eliminate the chatter in [their] head and just come as [their] authentic self…[they’ll] be looked at on skills and talent rather than how [they] package themselves.”

Hiding her true authentic self is a struggle Fernandez Rivera experienced. When she started working at Accenture in 1997 Fernandez Rivera didn’t reveal her identity as a trans-woman. Her professional life differed from her personal; she felt like the industry wasn’t ready for her.

But she didn’t let the unconscious doubt the industry held stop her from doing a job she loved. She quickly moved through the ranks of the company and established an LGBTQ+ network in Accenture’s Asia-Pacific region. Fernandez Rivera was a strong voice for the LGBTQ+ community at her company but doubt was still there.

Coming out in her professional life was a big decision. She knew the industry wouldn’t change if she continued to hide who she was. Being alone in the tech industry put a “burden” on her shoulders and she didn’t want others to be in the same position. “The challenge has always been being a unique individual a unique person in the industry. I don’t want it to be [a challenge] in the future” she said.

The final push came through a phone call with her best friend in the U.K. last year. That friend told Fernandez Rivera that visibility matters. “If you don’t tell your story I don’t think things will change” Fernandez Rivera recalls her friend as saying.

She took a big step and was pleasantly surprised. When she did come out to her company she received nothing but support. She felt safe.

But Fernandez Rivera acknowledges that everyone has their own journey of coming out. The best the industry can do is make it a safe environment for people to be themselves.

Training for unconscious bias is helpful Fernandez Rivera said. Accenture rolled out training to its offices around the world and many employees found it helpful. Training is now mandatory at the company. Allowing employees to declare their pronouns also goes a long way a practice that can be done regardless of industry.

In November Fernandez Rivera was part of a panel at the QT Qonference. It was the first conference put on by QueerTech an organization that focuses on making the tech industry inclusive for LGBTQ2S+ people. The panel also contained speakers from the federal government who shared they were also taking up the practice of allowing employees to share personal pronouns.

Fernandez Riveria said she was “impressed” to hear this. “If we normalize it…I feel like it would encourage more and more people to feel safe in the tech industry.”

Making it easier to work in tech also requires a landscape change with different sectors including private government academic and non-profit organizations. “Because if we want a landscape change everyone needs to work together. The end goal is making sure that tech space is number one a safe space for queer people to build careers on and be proud of it.”

The panel was also a preview of what is possible and the ability of various players to work together to make a change. But there isn’t a singular answer to why it took so long for a gathering like the QT Qonference to come together at a large scale.

Fernandez Riveria believes timing played a role as it took people in leadership roles time to realize the barriers. She believes having queer people in leadership positions played a role in creating more visibility and realization.

So what can the tech industry and others like it do moving forward? Fernandez Riveria says they need to revisit their policies. Displaying personal pronouns “matters a lot.” Mentoring and providing benefits employees are happy with also play a role. Tech companies should also create ally programs.

“I actually want to look forward to the day when there are actually more [queer] people in leadership positions because there is power in numbers.”

CLAYTON Mo. — The U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday bypassed Centene Corp. (NYSE: CNC) in awarding $136 billion in contracts for the health insurance provided to active-duty military members a blow to the Clayton giant and St. Louis' largest public company by revenue which has long held some of the work.

The Defense Health Agency said it was awarding the TRICARE contract for its west region to TriWest Healthcare Alliance of Phoenix owned by Blue Cross Blue Shield nonprofits including Blue Shield of California Regence Blue Shield and BCBS of Arizona along with the University of Colorado Hospital Authority and the University of New Mexico Hospital.

The $65.1 billion contract held by Centene for years through its Health Net Federal Services subsidiary includes a 12-month transition-in period plus eight one-year option periods a Defense Department spokesman said. The west includes 1.5 million beneficiaries in Arkansas Illinois Louisiana Oklahoma Texas and Wisconsin.

Centene said in a statement that ""we are disappointed by the DHA's decision.""

""We have a debriefing scheduled with the DHA in early January and have requested details to which we are entitled under the government's procedure rules"" it said. ""Following receipt of this information we will be in a position to determine our options regarding the Agency's decision.""

Centene this year lost another major award when the California Department of Health Care Services announced in August its intent to award contracts for Medicaid managed care contracts to Centene’s subsidiary Health Net of California Inc. in nine counties but not in others including Los Angeles and Sacramento counties. Centene is preparing to take legal action if a California state agency rejects its protest over how bidders were chosen.

Indore (Madhya Pradesh): Did you know that Indore Municipal Corporation was the first municipal body to come up with a public issue as a green bond? It will be launched in the coming days! The person collaborating for the same is a young officer from Indore who is now principal policy officer at United Nations New York.

Meet 31-year-old Siddharth Rajhans an Indori who made it big in the world at the age 31 and feels that every Indori has the potential for the same but needs to execute the vision and study the market thoroughly.

Discussing green bonds Rajhans said “I have personally collaborated with Pushyamitraji and Smart cities Indore. I think there is a great scope and vision with the team here.”

In his plans for Indore Rajhans said “I have been working with the central and state governments to bring in the latest technologies including the A-I backed Smart city deployment tools Satellite Internet and backend development ops platforms for better civic engagement.” He is going to invest and bring these technologies as part of the Pravasi Bhartiya Diwas 2023.

Strategic presence makes Indore a Smart City

Indeed

Indore has developed rapidly in the last 10 years. Today Indore is as developed as any city in the US with good roads great cleanliness and good civic sense and infrastructure.

The strategic presence of Indore as a commercial capital makes it a great reason to be a smart city. Further civic administration from IMC to Indore Smart cities are doing a great job.

IT cos see bigger hope in Indore than in

Mumbai

It is completely possible at least for the IT sector in Indore to surpass Hyderabad and Bangalore in the coming decade. The companies here - TCS Infosys Accenture are all working in full capacity now. They have much bigger campuses in Indore than the ones in Mumbai and Trivandrum. Also we have a boom in the start-up sector. I think in the next part of this decade we have a brilliant opportunity to be number one on the IT map of the country.

Learn geopolitics for global biz

Young Indoris who want to expand their businesses globally need to understand global geopolitics and market strategies. You cannot aim to succeed without thorough market knowledge. An essential reminder is “Do not fail to experiment”.

You cannot learn from books what you can from practice. So go out there and explore things.

Indori lives on… suggestions for visitors

I love adding a little bit of spice or Jeeravan to whatever I eat. I think that is something quintessentially Indori in me.

ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcGV0YXBpeGVsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2hhcy1hbnl0aGluZy1yZWFsbHktY2hhbmdlZC1pbi1waG90by1lZGl0aW5nLXNvZnR3YXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Has Anything Really Changed in Photo Editing Software?,"I guess I’m the sucker that keeps a lot of the digital photography software companies in business. In order to “stay current” in my recommendations I have to keep looking at new versions of software products and that requires a near endless tithing that’s getting old.



Adobe Photoshop

Let me just say up front that all the Adobe Disaster Scenarios that people worried about when they changed over to the Creative Cloud licensing program turned out to be Paranoid Dystopia. The price for the photography plan hasn’t really changed. We get regular useful updates that include excellent new features. You don’t have to store your images in the cloud. And so on.

As far as I’m concerned Photoshop went from a product I had to buy a massive upgrade to every 18-24 months to one that gets upgraded regularly though not as massively in each iteration because those happen more frequently now. I’ve looked at how much I was paying on average in the old Creative Suite version versus what I’m now paying on average per year with Creative Cloud. If anything the Creative Cloud option seems to be a few dollars less expensive when averaged out over five-year periods.

Your mileage may vary of course as you might not have been updating every time like I was and you might be paying more for the cloud version depending upon where you live and what options you’ve selected.

Still my first conclusive statement to the headline’s question is this: Photoshop is still iterating still getting better still the best tool overall and oh it also comes with Bridge and Lightroom Classic and some cloud storage space too. As long as things continue as they are with Creative Cloud Adobe has me as a customer. Given my advancing age that’s probably for life.

That’s far less true of any other equivalent software product.

Capture One

Capture One’s latest “re-pricing and revising” is a good example. Capture One would love to have the same customer base and loyalty as Adobe. Well actually not so much that as wanting the same predictable and profitable revenue stream. Once customers are bought into a SaaS (software as a service) subscription you have a predictable revenue stream and can match development costs against that more easily. But it also makes it a little more difficult to do promotions to “juice the coffers” (because your subscribers will complain about not getting the same deal).

That’s put Capture One—and others read on—in a tough spot. They’ve conditioned themselves on using a constant stream of marketing promotions affiliate commission programs attempts at segmenting (version for only one brand) and a raft of commercial presets to keep the money stream coming and fuel their “keep up with Adobe” aspirations. All while keeping their Axcel Fund owners happy. That’s right Capture One has a venture fund partner (Axcel V fund) that owns 56%. On Axcel’s pages you’ll find statements like “Our proven Accelerating Value Creation model…” and “sharpen the commercial focus.” You are the product.

Axcel’s actual customer is not you. It’s corporate private investors asset managers pension funds life insurers banks and financial institutions. I have little doubt that Capture One’s ongoing changes to their business model are tweaking and tuning driven by Axcel.

Is that a bad thing? It’s difficult to tell but something’s a little amiss methinks.

For example the current annual cost of the Adobe Creative Cloud Photography Plan is $120 per year. Capture One Pro’s similar plan is $179 per year (substantially more if you pay month to month). We’ve had 15 major revisions of Capture One in its lifetime even though the current version is numbered 23. Looking at the things added in each major version I’d say that feature-wise Capture One is still in “catch up” mode to Photoshop/Lightroom though getting closer recently.

The problem I have is that I feel like Capture One is trying to get more money for less. Their iPad version for instance requires another $4.99 per month subscription. Capture One Pilot is a smart device tethering program that yes costs another $14.99 (not a subscription but what is the likelihood that it converts to a subscription at some point?).

The latest customer-unfriendly thing Capture One has done—and this isn’t their first time at the slap-the-user bar—is to make their perpetual license version ($299 with “reduced price [33% off] every time you upgrade” [sic]) no longer receive feature upgrades for a period of time (was one year).

Disclaimer: As of today the Capture One Web site still says that perpetual license users still get “minor software updates included.” That will change on February 1 2023.

Nothing is different in Capture One’s attempt to move to SaaS subscriptions than Adobe’s. We’re seeing the same negative feedback. That’s to be expected. But again my primary complaint is that I feel that Capture One is offering somewhat less for more money than Adobe now. I just don’t see the value proposition though obviously Axcel does.

My best guess is that attempting to make the change from perpetual to SaaS is going to cost Capture One customers. I’m pretty sure they’ll lose me as it makes no sense to pay more for less.

Disclaimer: I was almost convinced via extended one-on-one training with Capture One to make the change from Photoshop. Almost. There’s much to like about their approach particularly when it comes to color model. But in the end it was “too little for too much” for me. Your mileage may vary.

Skylum Luminar

We have other players that are effectively SaaS wannabes now: Luminar is attempting the $119 annual subscription but retains the $249 perpetual license. Of course that’s almost never what you actually pay. As I write this the Luminar Neo license is $99 for a year and the perpetual license is $149. Skylum (Luminar’s maker) even seems to be confused themselves because the $99 subscription appears to include nothing extra while the $149 perpetual license does. They’re totally confused now in their marketing campaigns plus they’re a well-known affiliate commission provider and have multi-times-a-year sales. I have no idea how much you’ll pay for Neo.

Of course we’ve also had Luminar Luminar 2018 Luminar 3 Luminar Flex Luminar 4 and now Luminar Neo which seems to indicate that they either don’t know how to develop and name an ongoing product or that they are using naming confusion to trigger new sales of ostensibly similar products. Personally I’m no longer impressed by Skylum’s products. Both the products and their marketing of them seem gimmicky to me. Personally I’d love to just have their Intensify plug-in back (no longer runs properly in some Photoshop/macOS installations). I tended to use that plug-in over the Nik Color Efex Pro one for some tonality changes.

ON1 Photo RAW

ON1 is another possibility. The basic ON1 Photo RAW subscription is $90 billed annually or $8 a month. The perpetual license is $99 (often discounted) but doesn’t include their plug-in suite. The plug-in suite is $150 perpetual (often discounted). Then there’s their 1TB cloud storage option but they seem to have backed off of clearly explaining why you might want that (hint: mobile devices). At least their pricing strategy isn’t “more than Adobe for less.” (Clicking on the “Mobile” icon on their Web page at first didn’t seem to do anything: that’s because nothing changes in the above-the-fold view with certain browser window sizes; the additional information is below the fold and you have to scroll to it.)

I’m not overly impressed by the ON1 Photo RAW program itself though. It feels a little disorganized has a great deal of UI clutter with no clear theme their automatic masking tends to need lots of adjustments and I don’t like their hidden panel style. But the product works reasonably well these days.

Meanwhile their plug-in suite caters to those who love to browse through hundreds of presets. There are actually a couple that I like for specific things in the suite which is enough to have me leave it installed in my Photoshop Filters menu. But it’s not a great value. I don’t get $150 of value from it (I paid less through one of their many promotions).

DxO PhotoLab

Next up we have DxO PhotoLab 6. It’s a perpetual license program ($219 currently though discounts are available from time to time). I must admit that I kind of like PhotoLab these days. It’s approachable deep in features yet broadly applies things automatically and I find it very consistent across different camera models. That was their whole approach in the first place: figure out what the photo should be (sans vignetting and linear distortion and apply a consistent color/tonal model) and just apply that.

These days DxO PhotoLab seems to get a major update about once a year so keeping it current can be more expensive than an Adobe Photographer’s Plan if you don’t watch their promotion pricing carefully.

Serif Affinity Photo

Finally we have the program that you should pay more attention to if you’re really looking for value. That’s Serif’s Affinity Photo. Serif has Photoshop (Photo) Illustrator (Designer) and InDesign (Publisher) knockoffs that are extremely good and only available through perpetual licenses.

Photo has just gone from Photo to Photo 2 (as have the other Serif products). Regularly priced at $70 there’s an introductory discount of 40% off through January 25 2023 and an “all products all platforms” offer of $99. That’s Photo 2 Designer 2 and Publisher 2 on macOS Windows and iPadOS. Yikes. Take that Adobe. While Photo 2 still doesn’t quite match the current Photoshop CC 2023 in features all the basic Photoshop capabilities are there including compatibility with PSD files layers blend modes focus merge extensive masking non-destructive editing and more.

So here’s a suggestion: if you’re worried about your Photoshop CC capabilities when your subscription ends make sure you have a Photo 2 perpetual license. While they’ve raised their prices a bit with their new versions A Photoshop near equivalent for $70 is still a bargain right? Moreover Serif hasn’t been trolling their user base for constant upgrading. Photo lasted from 2015 until 2022 after all.

So there you have it. Some basic thoughts on where we’re at with photo editing tools at the moment. I’ll update my software recommendations page early in 2023.

But research is beginning to reveal the mediating potential for maintaining “hopeful” states of thinking related to everything from cancer to trauma. Feldman and Corn (2022) state the following from their investigations on cancer patients and hopeful thinking:

Growing evidence demonstrates that hope is associated with a number of psychological variables in individuals with cancer including depression distress coping symptom burden and post traumatic growth and the emerging evidence suggests that hope may actually predict the probability of survival in advanced stages of cancer.

In my life I must add anecdotally that I have also witnessed cases where individuals suffering from similar issues whose primary living disposition remained “hopeful” were able to actively challenge the progression of their illness improve their own immune systems’ responsivity and even move into active remission. These individuals had some common denominators such as goal-setting focusing on the here and now avoiding catastrophizing appreciation of clear diagnostic communication from their doctors utilizing social anchors around them (family friends and church) and regulating their physical world through sleep healthy eating and daily meaning-making. To this end from the frame of research conducted by Satici et al. (2022) their results revealed that ""hope"" is directly correlated to psychological health and that hopeful individuals had higher levels of psychological well-being. But this however is only the beginning.

Champions of hope

Recently I had the chance to interview Dr. Chan Hellman a professor from the University of Oklahoma and founding Director of the Hope Research Center. He has been featured as part of TedX and has a current book on the subject of hope called Hope Rising: How the Science of HOPE Can Change Your Life. Below is an excerpt from that interview.

How would you define hopelessness Dr. Hellman?

Dr. Chan Hellman: “I believe it is more closely aligned with apathy from the perspective of ""giving up.""

What does the diametric of ""hope"" look like when compared to hopelessness?

Dr. Chan Hellman: Hope is more than wishing and is really centered on the belief that tomorrow will be better than today and that we will have a role to play in that future pursuit. It’s a cognitive process a mindset that is more than a feeling or emotion.

How do you see hopelessness play out in someone's life?

Dr. Chan Hellman: An interesting aspect of this research is what we have seen take place when people are exposed to adversity and stress and that is that they are more likely to set avoidant type goals or goals of outcomes that simply reinforce their current state which may sound counterintuitive to getting better but is really part of the insidious nature of living in hopelessness. However once we are able to nurture and restore hope this changes and we may begin to see a transition to more of an ""achievement"" mindset in those same people.

I’m wondering if there is a useful metaphor from your work on hope that might resonate with others?

Dr. Chan Hellman: I’ve developed a set of what I call ""guiding principles"" around hope and I think a few of those might address this particular question well. One is the idea that ""imagination"" is the instrument of hope. This is the ability to ""imagine the future"" which I borrowed from the work in self-psychology literature and how we might begin to see how this also affects intentionality and motivation. Another one is the idea that “hope begets hope.” This is the idea that once we experience a bit of success toward our goals it also enhances our willpower and inherent pathways to thinking. And then finally the last one is that hope is a ""social gift"" because hope tends to flourish in relationship with others and the connections we maintain rather than occurring in isolation.

Do you think that hope is an ""innate"" potential we possess?

Dr. Chan Hellman: I believe that hope is something that can actually be taught and additionally it is also malleable as research supports these ideas. In our publications around trauma and adversity where things like insecure attachments shame rumination and anxiety flourish we also see the capacity of such issues to diminish hope in people. And as it turns out therapy has gotten really good at helping us to navigate through those tough spaces and restore hope.

What are some ways that a person can start to tap into hope?

Dr. Chan Hellman: We should first recognize that setting goals is the cornerstone of hope most especially focusing on short-term specific goals and actually thinking of very specific domains where we might implement such goals. We can ask questions to help realize those domains such as: What might be a small goal I could set with my family this week? What would be a goal I could set in my work? What would be a goal I would set for my leisure time? What would be a goal I could set for my health? What we found is that short-term specific goals are a stronger promoter of hope over time than longer-term envisioned goals.

Then once we establish a short-term goal I think it’s important to take a moment and simply ""imagine"" what success is going to look like within that specific goal we have set. We might actively imagine that specific picture of goal attainment and who exactly is going to benefit from it and who is going to be there to maybe celebrate it with us.

Around goals we should also consider the strategies or ""pathways"" that we will use to attain each of those small short-term goals. For instance if my goal is to get healthy I might sit down and look at the pathway to that goal which might include first joining a gym maybe adding a trainer or simply starting to run or exercise maybe modifying my diet. I think listing these elements is important as well as understanding that every aspect will have pros and cons attached and figuring out which is the most viable pathway for yourself.

And then finally really leaning into the idea that hope is a ""social gift."" This might mean identifying somebody you can connect with someone who has a shared experience or interest you can talk to and maybe even pursuing the goal together.

These are simple ""pathways"" that connect one success to the next. Each step that is taken and achieved always helps bring the bigger goal into focus.

Hope is not an ethereal notion but rather a transformative agent and a functional way of thinking that can have great prospects for our life. And as Dr. Hellman teaches hope begins with one small step.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the electronics industry and go straight to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics.

Electronics encompasses one of the broadest ranges of products in the modern world from TVs computers music players smartphones tablets and watches among many others. It has been one of the most transformative industries in the world for the past 50 years.

How Moore’s Law Will Impact the Electronics Industry?

Currently the latest chips are made on the 5 nm fabrication process and companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited (NYSE:TSMC) and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (KSE:005930.KS) have set up their timelines for 2 nm chips in 2025. However experts predict that a fundamental limit would be reached in two or three upcoming iterations.

Many believe quantum computing is the answer to Moore’s law ending. However it's an ill-informed opinion since quantum computers are limited to a very narrow range of computing problems almost all of which have no commercial potential.

Instead companies like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have come up with some of the most realistic solutions by moving to specialized chips intended for specific purposes.

For instance Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has introduced DGX Systems with the objective to accelerate machine learning programs at a higher efficiency than offered by general purpose computers.

The future of electronics that compute is likely to lie in specialized chips. It is reflected in the fact that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have also moved in that direction with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) coming up with task-specific processors like Xeon an architecture designed for AI.

Similarly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been rolling out ‘Neural Engine’ since 2017 in its iPhones to accelerate AI applications like facial recognition. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the neural engine in its line of computers with the M1 chip architecture in 2020.

The trend suggests that the electronics industry will survive the ending of Moore’s law and adapt to the paradigm shift.

When the Chips are Down: What Semiconductor Shortage and Stagflation Mean for Electronics Industry

The outlook for the electronics industry in the wake of chip shortage is bleak. It is not expected to subside anytime soon. Pat Gelsinger the CEO of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) says shortage may last until 2024

However a more reasonable timeframe for the shortage to end is 2025 per Ondrej Burkacky from McKinsey primarily due to the complexities associated with the manufacturing infrastructure.

Story continues

The post-pandemic stagflation has also slumped the high demand in consumer electronics which had picked up pace during the pandemic as people learned worked and entertained themselves digitally at homes during lockdowns. The weak demand is expected to ease the supply-chains problems and shortage.

Companies like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have cut their annual-sales outlooks as reported by the WSJ.

In China the sales of both smartphones and PCs among other electronic products have dropped with the Consumer Electronics Index down by 32% as of July 2022. Globally the shipment of PCs and smartphones have fallen by 4.7% and 10% respectively.

2030 Outlook

The market for consumer electronics has been showing a long-term cooling trend and is expected to shift from growth to cycle in the near to medium term. However according to Yang Liuqing an analyst at CITIC the opportunities in Augmented and Virtual Reality hardware still represent a huge potential for growth.

According to Precedence Research the market for electronics is valued at $724.48 billion as of 2021 and is expected to reach $1.13 trillion by 2030 growing at a modest CAGR of 5.1%.

The market will experience its fastest growth in countries in the Asia-Pacific but the largest market share will still be retained by countries in North America per the report.

Japan South Korea and the US are some of the most advanced countries in electronics. Below we list the 12 most advanced countries in electronics.

12 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics

Our Methodology

For our list of the 12 most advanced countries in electronics we’ve ranked them based on their electronics-manufacturing infrastructure technology and research institutes. For this purpose we’ve gathered data from various sources including an FDI Intelligence report that evaluated countries’ locations for the quality of R&D in electronics based on infrastructure talent availability and business environment.

We’ve also accounted for the top electronics companies in these countries.

Here are the 12 most advanced countries in electronics:

12. Finland

Finland is known for a strong and innovative electronics industry. One of the most well-known Finnish companies in the sector is Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) which is a global leader in the development and production of mobile phones and other telecommunications equipment.

Other notable Finnish electronics companies include Vaisala a provider of environmental and industrial measurement systems and Elisa a telecommunications and digital services provider.

In addition Finland also has a strong ecosystem of R&D and academic institutions that are focused on advancing the field of electronics.

For example the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (HIIT) is a leading research institute that conducts research on a wide range of topics related to information and communication technology.

11. United Kingdom

The UK is home to a thriving electronics industry. In terms of innovation in electronics the United Kingdom is known for the company ARM Holdings which has pioneered the ARM family of chips. Their RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture makes them simpler more durable and more cost effective.

In September 2020 Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced its plans to acquire ARM Holdings from SoftBank Group Corp. (TOKYO:9984.T) for $40 billion. The deal was later terminated due to regulatory challenges.

As far as the UK's electronics-R&D is concerned its infrastructure in the country is robust. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) is a UK government agency that supports research in engineering and physical sciences including electronics.

London is ranked 10th top city by FDI Intelligence for quality of research and development in electronics with a high score of 145.

10. France

France is one of the most advanced countries in electronics. The top companies in the French electronics industry include Thales a notable name in the defense and security sectors.

The company produces a wide range of electronics-based products. Schneider Electric an energy management and automation-solutions provider is another major French company.

Valeo a manufacturer of automotive components and systems including electronic systems is another major electronics company in the country.

Further France has a well established R&D ecosystem in the electronics sector. For instance the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) is a leading research organization involved in electronics research.

Note: This review was first published on 13 December 2022.

Time for Team Red to play

Ladies and gentlemen Team Red has entered the match.

With the new Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT graphics cards officially launching today AMD has joined NVIDIA in a two-way battle for the hearts and minds (and wallets) of PC gamers.

We have already covered the technology behind both card and the RDNA 3 microarchitecture powering it so be sure to read it here first if you have not.

While both RX 7900 cards are claimed to be powerful enough to provide 4K maxed-out gaming AMD says it is offering this capability at a much lower price. Broadly speaking AMD is not touting its latest RDNA 3-based cards as the fastest or most powerful options that compete with NVIDIA’s flagship GeForce RTX 4090. The company literally wants you to know that it may not have the most expensive and most powerful graphics card for you but it might have a powerful graphics card that won’t cost an arm and leg and still gives you the kind of performance befitting a next-gen GPU.

You see while Team Green’s top-of-the-line RTX 4090 is priced north of US$1599 AMD feels that the bulk of the serious gamers are really going to shell their money for top-tier cards within the US$1000 budget threshold. That’s why they have priced the 7900 XTX and 7900 XT at US$999 and US$899 respectively. Incredulously this also means that unlike NVIDIA which has raised the prices of its cards over the last three generations AMD has kept the pricing of its 7900 series in line with the 6900 counterparts.

The key question is at US$999 does the Radeon RX 7900 XTX offer better performance and value over the more expensive US$1199 RTX 4080? In this review we intend to find out exactly that.

Meanwhile let’s have a look at the card’s specifications.

But first let’s talk about the Radeon RX 7900 XTX reference card.

An evolved reference design

Unlike NVIDIA’s RTX 40 series Founders Edition which looks very overly engineered with its supersized build to house an equally supersized cooling system AMD has a more traditional approach to its reference-design graphics cards. To be clear NVIDIA’s founders edition cards are not reference-design cards but rather a first-party custom design that the company sells to gamers under the NVIDIA brand.

The Radeon RX 7900 XTX reference design is an evolution of the Radeon RX 6900 series. The two-tone silver and black on the older 6900 makes way for a mostly-black scheme with some gunmetal accents. The cooler shroud and backplate are made entirely of a die-cast aluminium alloy and have a solid premium feel. While the looks and aesthetics may be subjective the build quality of these cards is right in the league of NVIDIA's Founders Edition cards in my opinion.

Unlike NVIDIA’s commitment to a single-cable 16-pin 12VHPWR connector AMD has stuck with the standard dual 8-pin PCIe power connectors (see above image) on the card. No adapters are required. But like NVIDIA AMD has also stuck with a PCIe 4.0 interface on its RDNA 3 cards as AMD engineers acknowledged that the interface has plenty of bandwidth and isn't necessary to move on to PCIe 5.0.

That said it's not all “old” tech that AMD has stuck with. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX gets two full-size DisplayPort 2.1 connectors beside an HDMI 2.1b and a USB-C with DP 2.1 passthrough. NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are still on the older DisplayPort 1.4a standard which while it's not outdated and is still sufficient to pair with displays that are on the market now AMD's updated display connectivity options are designed to pair with the industry's latest and speedier screens that will come out in 2023.

Now that you have had a good overview of the Radeon RX 7900 XTX let’s check out the card’s performance on the next page.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zaW1pbGFyLWRpZmZlcmVudC1pbnRlcm1hcmNoLXdhbnR5LTIwMjMtMDcxNjAwMjAzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Similar but different for Intermarché-Wanty 2023 team kits,"This article originally appeared on Velo News

Intermarche-Wanty-Gobert-Materiaux saw some new team kits arrive on Christmas Day.

The Belgian team revealed Sunday its new uniform for the 2023 season with a similar-but-different white yellow and blue pattern and sponsor-laden style.

With the WorldTour squad set to rebrand to Intermarche-Circus-Wanty for the new year the logo of online casino platform Circus moves to the center. Construction firm Wanty’s logo moves down to make space.

The Nalini-produced kits also give space for branding from new helmet and glasses partner Uvex and shoe specialist Gaerne.

“For 2023 we unreservedly reaffirm our support for Team Intermarche-Circus-Wanty which in 2022 has been an amazing revelation for us to say the least” said Nalini founder Claudio Mantovani.

“Indeed in its second WorldTour year it won an impressive 24 victories and we can’t help but feel a surge of pride for the talent and perseverance it has shown.”

The Intermarche team was one of the revelations of 2022.

Victories from riders like Biniam Girmay Jan Hirt and Alexander Kristoff along with grand tour top-10s from Hirt Louis Meintjes and Domenico Pozzovivo saw the team finish comfortably in the mid-pack of the UCI points league in what was only its second WorldTour season.

Next year will see the arrival of a swathe of young talents alongside headline names Mike Teunissen Lilian Calmejane and former world champion Rui Costa.

Key riders from the 2022 season Kristoff and Hirt both move on as the team looks to back up its successes so far.

""Across the board we have made faster progress than we estimated in advance [in 2022]. In fact you can turn it back even further. I don’t think anyone would have believed two years ago that we wouldn’t be relegated. You must know that the ‘Sword of Damocles’ was above us” team manager Aike Visbeek told Wielerflits.

“We had an exceptionally good year and I am incredibly proud of that! As a team we have really delivered a very nice performance a year that gets a special place.""

This call for conservation was brought on by increased demand due to the snow and near-zero temperatures.

PJM Senior Vice President of Operations Mike Bryson took to Twitter explaining the importance of these energy conservation efforts.

AES Ohio is requesting that its customers limit their electricity use voluntarily from Christmas Eve until 10 a.m. on December 25.



Here are a few ways that customers can conserve energy:

-Set thermostat slightly lower than usual if your health permits.

-Delay the use of major electric appliances such as stoves dishwashers and dryers.

-Turn off non-essential lights equipment and appliances.

“We sincerely appreciate the cooperation and patience of our customers who can help ensure the stability and reliability of the system for all by taking these steps” said Kristina Lund president and CEO AES Ohio. “Public conservation can make a difference and every little bit counts.”

If additional actions are required AES Ohio would begin emergency temporary interruptions of service to customers to extend available power generation and help maintain operations until additional power is available.

These brief outages would alternate between customers and last until more electricity became available and the power grid began to function normally.

The move prohibits rentals of less than 30 consecutive days targeting short-term rental hosts who use vacation rental companies like Airbnb and Booking.com to rent out units for short periods of time as opposed to renting to a long-term tenant.

Weehawken a waterfront community right on the Hudson River with eye candy views of New York City is a hotspot for short-term or vacation rentals. As of December 20 there were plenty of listings for short-term rentals on Airbnb ranging from anywhere $92 to $375 and beyond.

Banning short-term and vacation rentals

The short-term rentals were previously allowed if the rental hosts maintain a permit. That permit had to be renewed annually for a small fee and the host was allowed to offer listing on Airbnb and other such services

At its December 21 meeting Mayor Richard Turner and the Weehawken Township council adopted an ordinance that would effectively ban short-term rentals in the township.

Prior to the meeting Turner told the Hudson Reporter that the ordinance bans short-term rentals less than 30 consecutive days but that the township was looking into potentially allowing them again with stringent regulations at a later date.

“We’re going to examine all the ordinances all the other towns have put in but right now we’re going to ban them because it really is starting to get out of control” Turner said.

According to Turner the township is having issues with the short-term rentals taking away affordable housing from long-term use in rent-controlled buildings.

“The bigger problem we’re having now is some of our affordable housing buildings and the buildings under rent-control are starting to do Airbnb” Turner said. “What that does is it takes affordable units off the market. We are losing affordable apartments to Airbnb and we decided to take some action because we have several buildings that are getting carried away with it.”

Turner said that in new buildings the condominium associations usually ban Airbnbs. Instead they are prevalent in the affordable housing with one instance of five Airbnbs in one building as recent as last year Turner said.

Residents uncomfortable and strangers bringing crime?

In addition to taking affordable units off the market Turner argued that the short-term rentals are making residents uncomfortable at the apartment buildings where they occur. Although located in densely populated Hudson County the small township is still mostly suburban in nature prompting complaints from residents about strangers coming and going he said.

“We get complaints all over town from people that are not comfortable with their neighbors renting on Airbnb if it’s a three-unit rental building and there’s strangers coming and going” Turner said. “We live in an urban area and it’s a small town and people are just not comfortable.”

Another reason behind the proposed ban on short-term rentals is crime. He said that sometimes people offer these short-term rentals and realize their property and even furniture has gone missing.

“People rent out their apartments and they complain that something was missing” Turner said. “That’s prevalent. We’ve had people complain about heirlooms being taken and furniture being taken and pictures being taken and this and that.”

According to Turner this ban would not be affecting mom-and-pop hosts as much as it would be investors looking to profit off of the short-term rentals.

“The industry says I’m depriving the mom-and-pop owners of the house” Turner said. “I’m not aware of any mom-and-pop owners somebody that lives in the house looking forward to renting it out on a regular basis. It’s so rare and it’s just not that type of town.”

Turner said that most short-term rentals in Weehawken are owned by absentee landlords who often don’t live in the township.

“The problem comes from absentee landlords of the multi-families the affordable ones or the regular houses” Turner said. “You can have six houses in a row that are owner occupied and the seventh house is three units of Airbnb. Most people that do it are absentee landlords and they make more money than if they just rent it to regular people.”

Stiff penalties aim to curb short-term rentals

The penalties for each violation of the ordinance began at $1000 for the first time $1500 for the second time and $2000 for the third time with the possibility of 90 days of jail time. Turner said this was to discourage the practice through significant loss of income with the fine being equivalent to what he said was the income of bookings for two short-term rentals.

“We have to make the fine as hefty as the lawyers think we can get away with so that people don’t say it’s worth it to just pay the fine” Turner said. “If they start getting hit with some $2000 dollar fines I think the significant income loss would discourage it.”

Turner said the township was comfortable with the ban doing so now in the Winter to prepare for what is usually a rush in Weehawken in the Spring. However the township will examine other policies from neighboring municipalities such as Jersey City which passed strict regulations on short-term rentals in the past to see if Weehawken would benefit from them.

“We’re doing this now before the Spring comes that’s when it really starts up again not too much in the Winter” Turner said. “We’re very comfortable with this. But we’ll take a look at everything just to see if there’s anything else that makes sense.”

A woman who stayed in an Airbnb in France has made a formal complaint to police after finding hidden cameras in the property.

Larissa Angaman 24 from Dieppe (Seine-Maritime) came to spend a weekend with her partner and two friends in Rouen on December 9. She booked and stayed in an apartment on Airbnb which had a rating of 4.56 out of 5.

Upon arrival Ms Angaman went to take a shower to freshen up. Later in the night at around 03:00 she went to the bathroom. She then noticed a digital clock which was directly facing the shower.

She told BFMTV: “After investigating it a bit I realised that there was a sort of circle there like you get on cameras.”

She then woke her partner and together they took the clock apart to reveal a camera inside with an SD card attached.

She said: “It was really lecherous because it was facing right towards the shower.”

After searching the rest of the apartment the friends discovered another similar device on a piece of furniture in the bedroom. The camera was positioned so you could see the bed.

Ms Angaman then decided to take the SD cards and look at them on her computer. She found a folder named “December 2022” which contained a video of her in the bathroom and videos of her friends going to the toilet.

She said: “I realised that it was completely messed up it felt like a big slap in the face.”

Ms Angaman reported the issue to the Dieppe police station and made a formal complaint. Police are now investigating. The report has also been sent to the police station in Rouen.

The cameras also have a video showing the man who installed them.

Ms Angaman said: “I don’t know if these cameras were connected by WiFi and if they could look at their view in real-time? What has this pervert done if he watched the videos? I feel dirty.

“I think about it all the time I’ve even dreamt about it! It’s so stressful.”

When contacted by 76Actu Airbnb confirmed that it had refunded the woman in full and said it was taking the incident “very seriously”.

It said: “We immediately suspended the host’s account and we will cooperate with the police in their inquiries.”

It added that it has “strict policies against using any kind of recording devices inside the properties rented on our platform and we take firm measures against anyone who breaks the rules”. It especially bans “the use of hidden surveillance devices or their use in private spaces such as the bathroom bedrooms or relaxing areas”.

It said that “less than 0.1% of reservations give rise to a security report by hosts or travellers”.

Airbnb is often controversial in France with some cities introducing more stringent property rules against them in a bid to keep local accommodation more affordable for residents. One property developer in Annecy (Haute-Savoie) even banned Airbnb-style lets in their properties.

However Airbnb is still popular among some in France. In October the company launched a €1million eco-friendly plan in France with funds going to help hosts make sustainable renovations to their rentals.

The plan was dubbed ‘win-win’ by the French government.

Those interested in working and living in Dubai can now access the hub for local long-term listings and helpful information on entry requirements and visa policy.

Recently Airbnb launched its Live and Work Anywhere initiative in an effort to identify some of the world’s most remote worker-friendly destinations. Dubai was chosen as one of 20 global destinations alongside Canary Islands Thailand and the Caribbean.

The Live and Work Anywhere programme will see Airbnb and Dubai’s DET promote the city to remote workers seeking accommodation and guidance for their long-term stays.

“Dubai is a global leader in facilitating remote working. As this trend continues to accelerate we want to work together to make it easier for people to enjoy the newfound flexibility to work and travel and help the city harness the economic benefits of this new type of tourism” said Velma Corcoran regional lead for Middle East and Africa at Airbnb.

Issam Kazim CEO of Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing commented: “The city is already home to over 200 nationalities that enjoy unrivalled career opportunities and lifestyle offerings. From world-class retail experiences to Michelin-starred restaurants and local cuisine sandy beaches theme parks and a cultural scene second to none Dubai is yet again ready to welcome the world this time in collaboration with Airbnb.” Meanwhile the number of people who choose to live and work in different places has increased dramatically over the past few years.

THE SHOW | Fleishman Is in Trouble

More from TVLine

THE EPISODE | “Me-Time” (Dec. 22 2022)

THE PERFORMANCE | So far this season Hulu’s witty divorce dramedy had mostly concentrated on Jesse Eisenberg’s mopey single dad Toby casting his ex-wife Rachel as a shrill status-obsessed villain. But this week we heard Rachel’s side of the story which provided a spectacular showcase for Danes reminding us that she’s one of the very best TV actresses of our time.

Rachel had vanished from Toby’s life without explanation essentially abandoning her two children and Libby found her nibbling on a bagel on a park bench with Danes lost in a vacant-eyed-daze. At first Rachel was addled and incoherent with Danes layering her rants with tics and twitches. But then Rachel explained what happened — “I got dumped… by everyone” — setting off a swirling series of flashbacks that showed us why Rachel abruptly went off the grid. (It didn’t excuse her actions mind you but it allowed us to understand them.) Danes radiated impressive smarts when Rachel was wheeling and dealing as a high-powered talent agent but we also saw Rachel at her lowest struggling through a traumatic birth and post-partum depression. Yes Danes broke out her signature Cry Face throughout the hour and it even built to an anguished howl of grief when Rachel let out her pent-up emotions in group therapy.

She later got caught up in an affair with her married friend Sam and Danes glowed with giddy infatuation. But that went south during an impromptu yoga retreat excursion and Danes vented Rachel’s frustrations with another haunting primal scream that even seemed to shake the trees outside. Rachel also broke down in apologetic sobs when her biggest client cut ties with her following her disappearing act. Fleishman smartly showed us that there are always two sides to every divorce story and Danes told Rachel’s side in a loud clear voice and with stunning clarity.

THE PERFORMER | Billie Piper

THE SHOW | I Hate Suzie

THE EPISODE | “Fear” (Dec. 22 2022)

THE PERFORMANCE | We all knew things would get worse for Suzie Pickles before they got better but we never thought her image rehab ploy on a celebrity dancing show would’ve exploded with such consequential fireworks.

In the Season 2 finale Suzie’s personal and professional lives collided as on-set drama at Dance Crazee became entwined with her messy divorce proceedings. At the show-within-the-show’s big finale we saw fear panic and insecurity paint Piper’s face as rumors of her character’s on-set hook-up threatened to surface. But that wasn’t the only stressor looming. The results of her drug test (which would determine her right to custody) hung in the air her friendship with Naomi hit the rocks again and Suzie and Cob’s constant warring was upending her son’s wellbeing. And as the dominoes horrifically fell one by one Piper’s body language and shaky energy gave us the play-by-play of just how much her character’s screw was tightening.

And that’s when a breakdown became a full-on meltdown. Suzie didn’t botch the dance routine as we half expected. Rather she won the show grabbed the mic and began babbling about everything tearing off a wig to reveal a true shocker: her bald head. When she finally truly cracked it was a mental break that had us feeling all of the feelings. As Suzie disassociated a glammed-up Piper pulled a 180 basking in the limelight and gallivanting across the stage. But back in reality the actress was teary-eyed and manic; her stone-cold sober ramblings sounded like a belligerent drunkard. It was an utter disaster in the best possible way. Watching Piper exercise such physical prowess such control — from her well-choreographed dance routines (which were no joke fire) to her near hyperventilation and shrieking panicked delivery — shook us to our cores.

Highlights:

According to the New York Times Google posted a “code red” warning about the increasing threat posed by the artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT.

According to the article CEO Sundar Pichai reallocated certain resources to work on expanding the company’s artificial intelligence offerings.

Is Google’s Business Model in Danger?

A potential new model for internet search has been presented by ChatGPT the enormously well-liked artificial intelligence application from OpenAI. The chatbot provides thorough explanations in response to queries on subjects like political science and computer programming and because it uses a question-and-answer structure users can go deeper until they fully grasp it.

Similar searches on Google often require users to study the results and browse several websites before coming to their own judgments. Contrarily ChatGPT provides a definitive (or at least definitive-sounding) response in a matter of seconds.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT has quickly become the dominant messaging platform online. OpenAI has made its AI-powered chatbot publicly available for testing and anyone can try it out and get a feel for how it works without having to pay anything.

Many even assert that ChatGPT has a strong chance of dislodging Google Search due to its responses being more interactive and human-like. The fact that ChatGPT can analyze and generate programs in a couple of seconds is discouraging for prospective programmers. It allows for the solution of even difficult math problems.

There has been talking of a “code red” being posted by Google’s upper echelons because of the rising prominence of ChatGPT AI.

The advent of ChatGPT the popular conversational AI chatbot developed by OpenAI reportedly prompted Google management to issue a “code red” raising concerns about the future of the Google search engine.

The Times studied an internal report and recording device that said Sundar Pichai CEO of Alphabet Google‘s parent organization participated in multiple meetings about Google’s Business plan and directed multiple departments to shift their concentration to counteracting ChatGPT’s danger to Google’s core competency.

The Times reports that multiple Google departments including R&D Trust & Safety and others have been told to shift focus in order to facilitate the development and launch of new artificial intelligence (AI) prototypes and products. The Times reports that certain workers have been assigned the task of creating an artificial intelligence product that can generate artwork and photos on par with OpenAI’s DALL-E which is used by millions around the world.

A Google representative did not respond promptly to an inquiry from Insider. In the midst of an internal and external debate over whether ChatGPT led by former Y Combinator president Sam Altman can dethrone the search engine and threaten Google’s tv commercial marketing strategy Google had opted to increase its focus on artificial intelligence (AI) products.

Sridhar Ramaswamy who supervised Google’s marketing group from 2013 to 2018 told Insider that ChatGPT could discourage users from interacting with Google ads. In 2021 ads generated $208 billion for Google or 81% of Alphabet‘s overall income.

Within the first five days of its release ChatGPT had more than a million active subscribers. ChatGPT generates personalized human-sounding responses to inquiries by analyzing the information gathered from thousands of web pages. As reported in a recent article by Insider the chatbot has been asked to do a wide variety of tasks including writing college essays teaching coding and even providing therapy.

However it has been observed by somehow often the bot gets things wrong. According to Insider’s interviews with AI specialists ChatGPT is not able to verify its claims or distinguish between true and fraudulent information. This ability to create new solutions is called “hallucinations” in the field of artificial intelligence.

Bloomberg reports that the bot can make offensive statements including ones of a sexist and racist nature. The Times reports that Google is wary of releasing its artificial intelligence chatbot LaMDA (short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications) to the world because of the chatbot’s high potential for inaccuracy and toxic effects. According to a recent CNBC story Google executives are apprehensive about making it broadly available in its current version due to “reputational risk.”

Head of Google’s artificial intelligence department Google Brain Zoubin Ghahramani informed the Times believed chatbots are “not a tool that consumers can utilize regularly on a routine basis” until ChatGPT was introduced.

Instead of removing its search engine Google might concentrate on enhancing it over time experts told the Times. Google is rumored to be researching feverishly innovative AI services so if they do indeed debut at the corporation’s yearly developer convention I/O which is scheduled for May it would be a huge deal.

AI Products And Prototypes From Google

Teams from Google research Trust and safety and other divisions have been asked to help with the creation and introduction of new AI prototypes and products.

Is Google’s Business Model in Danger?

ChatGPT according to Sridhar Ramaswamy who managed Google’s advertising division from 2013 to 2018 might stop people from clicking on Google links with adverts which in 2021 produced $208 billion or 81 percent of Alphabet’s total revenue.

Is ChatGPT a threat to Google?

There are some similarities between ChatGPT and Google search. The UI is helpful for gathering information and is fairly comparable to Google Search. Despite the fact that there are some key differences between the two.

Using Google Search and ChatGPT

It is inaccurate to imply that ChatGPT is a “Google killer” because the two technologies are distinct and have different uses. The GPT language paradigm has a variation called ChatGPT that was created exclusively for chatbot applications. By typing keywords or phrases into a search bar users of Google’s search engine can find information on the internet.

Google analyzes billions of websites sorts their material according to relevancy and afterward ranks the outcomes. Finally it generates a list of options for you to select from. ChatGPT offers an appealing alternative for time-pressed web surfers by providing only a coherent answer depending on its own searching and synthesizing of that information.

ChatGPT had been programmed on thousands of web pages to learn not just how to have natural conversations with humans in addition to the actual substance of those conversations provided that the material was published online until late 2021.

Google does offer its own kind of condensed responses to some inquiries however these responses are often brief compilations of the web pages with the top search engine rankings. Additionally it features a superior proprietary language model dubbed LaMDA that one of the company’s engineers mistakenly believed the system to be sentient.

Why then does Google not produce its own unique responses to inquiries like ChatGPT? Because anything that makes it difficult for users to read search results will harm Google’s transactional business model which depends on persuading users to click on advertisements. According to data gathered by Bloomberg 81% of Alphabet Inc.’s $257.6 billion in income in 2021 came from advertising and a large portion of it came from Google’s pay-per-click advertisements.

In just five days ChatGPT reached 1 million users. That is a remarkable achievement; Facebook needed ten months to get there compared to Instagram’s 2.5 months. Although OpenAI doesn’t publicly speculate about its potential uses Google may be in serious danger if its new chatbot starts sending connections to other websites especially those that offer goods.",,,

ChatGPT according to Sridhar Ramaswamy who managed Google’s advertising division from 2013 to 2018 might stop people from clicking on Google links with adverts which in 2021 produced $208 billion or 81 percent of Alphabet’s total revenue.

Is ChatGPT a threat to Google?

There are some similarities between ChatGPT and Google search. The UI is helpful for gathering information and is fairly comparable to Google Search. Despite the fact that there are some key differences between the two.

Using Google Search and ChatGPT

It is inaccurate to imply that ChatGPT is a “Google killer” because the two technologies are distinct and have different uses. The GPT language paradigm has a variation called ChatGPT that was created exclusively for chatbot applications. By typing keywords or phrases into a search bar users of Google’s search engine can find information on the internet.

Google analyzes billions of websites sorts their material according to relevancy and afterward ranks the outcomes. Finally it generates a list of options for you to select from. ChatGPT offers an appealing alternative for time-pressed web surfers by providing only a coherent answer depending on its own searching and synthesizing of that information.

ChatGPT had been programmed on thousands of web pages to learn not just how to have natural conversations with humans in addition to the actual substance of those conversations provided that the material was published online until late 2021.

Google does offer its own kind of condensed responses to some inquiries however these responses are often brief compilations of the web pages with the top search engine rankings. Additionally it features a superior proprietary language model dubbed LaMDA that one of the company’s engineers mistakenly believed the system to be sentient.

Why then does Google not produce its own unique responses to inquiries like ChatGPT? Because anything that makes it difficult for users to read search results will harm Google’s transactional business model which depends on persuading users to click on advertisements. According to data gathered by Bloomberg 81% of Alphabet Inc.’s $257.6 billion in income in 2021 came from advertising and a large portion of it came from Google’s pay-per-click advertisements.

In just five days ChatGPT reached 1 million users. That is a remarkable achievement; Facebook needed ten months to get there compared to Instagram’s 2.5 months. Although OpenAI doesn’t publicly speculate about its potential uses Google may be in serious danger if its new chatbot starts sending connections to other websites especially those that offer goods.",,,

For years the ecommerce giant has stuck its fingers into every pie going—Amazon wind farms and an Amazon airline are no longer something to Amazon Blink at. Yet now Jeff Bezos has stuck his finger in the pie pie: For £2.04 ($2.50) British Amazon customers can get six deep-filled “by Amazon” mince pies delivered to their door.

(For those unfamiliar a mince pie is an individual spiced fruit Christmas treat with absolutely no meat in it no matter what that one American food blog said in 2019.)

And yes the trouble is that Amazon’s taste great; they’re packed with orange peel French brandy port and apple mincemeat (thankfully not Apple mincemeat though it’s only a matter of time). The pastry is crumbly and sweet. The filling—rich and generous—shares at least one thing in common with Amazon’s founder. And so with every bite it becomes harder to resist the gradual monopolization of the entire planet by a man who throws his head back when he laughs.

Photograph: Amazon

In 2019 US senator Elizabeth Warren vowed to break up “big tech companies” that have “too much power over our economy our society our democracy and our little Christmas treats.” (She might not have said that last one.) Concerns were growing about Amazon rigging search results to favor its own brands over competitors’ products—a practice the company denied. Still Amazon seemingly scaled back promotions of its private-label products as a result.

Things looked good for third-party sellers when also in 2019 research by ecommerce analysts Marketplace Pulse found that “Amazon-owned private-label brands are not nearly as successful as many paint them to be.” The report found that only 1.7 percent of the top 500000 search terms on Amazon result in a customer clicking on an AmazonBasics-branded product.

Except … two years later in 2021 Amazon came out with its own mince pies. Does it matter that I don’t know who makes them—that their pretty purple box is ominously signed by an anonymous figure known only as “The Baker”? Alas no because they taste better than the pies offered by at least two major British supermarkets. With their humble silver-foiled bottoms and sugar-coated tops they could be the most disruptive tech product of the past decade.

In such an environment how can Mom’s home baking compete? Customers seem to agree. Amazon’s mince pies have a 4.4 rating out of 5 after 117 ratings; reviews indicate that someone named John and someone named Sandra continued to buy them well into January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzUyMDYyNS9jaGF0Z3B0LW9wZW5haS1hbWF6b24ta2luZGxlLW5vdmVs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Kindle novelists are using OpenAI’s ChatGPT,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzUyMDYyNS9jaGF0Z3B0LW9wZW5haS1hbWF6b24ta2luZGxlLW5vdmVs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226E93C70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Chip Eng Seng – which is being taken over by Singaporean billionaires Celine and Gordon Tang – has sold Mandurah’s Sebel hotel after five years.

The seven storey property with 84 suites and a two level restaurant has been picked up by Perth based Acure Asset Management for $18 million or $214286 per key.

The seller paid Amcor Asia Pacific $15m ($178571 per key) with a leaseback.

CBRE’s Aaron Desange and Ryan McGinnity were the agents; their result is 18 per cent over the November 2022 valuation.

The deal comes 15 months since ASX-listed co-work outfit WOTSO Property paid $2m – sight unseen – for the ex-Australian Sailing Museum later used as a convention centre about a hundred metres away.

Sebel Mandurah

The Sebel occupies a 6717 square metre site at 1 Marco Polo Drive opposite Mandjar Bay.

Accor manages the hotel which also contains three function rooms a conference space pool and gym.

The accommodation is rated 4.5 star.

A third party runs the eatery Peninsula Bar & Restaurant – or The Pen.

Mandurah is 65 kilometres south of Perth on the way to Margaret River (story continues below).

The asset is the latest waterside investment for Acure coming six months since it outlaid $21.2m for an office the Emerald Lakes Town Centre in Carrara six kilometres west of Surfers Paradise.

Maldives buy

Chip Eng Seng will use proceeds to buy the 30pc it didn’t control of a five-star Maldives resort The Lagoon (also known as Samarafushi Lagoon) on the North Malé Atoll from its joint venture partner Tropical Developments Pte affiliate Amin Construction.

It is paying $1.46m in cash and will assume full responsibility for the $3m debt.

The buyer said by controlling the lot management can be more efficient.

The leasehold expires in 2066.

North Malé Atoll is 20 minutes from the capital (Malé) by speedboat.

Mr and Mrs Tang are also behind a $1.88 billion mixed-use complex 8 Shenton Way Singapore set to accommodate a 63 level building that country’s tallest.

In January the couple outlaid $545.6m for residential developer SingHaiyi Group.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

American Airlines is vowing to work closely with law enforcement after an Alabama mother was caught on video throwing a computer monitor at one of its gate attendants at Miami International Airport this week.

Camilia McMillie had her bond set at $4500 after appearing before a judge Wednesday jail records show. The 25-year-old is charged with aggravated battery criminal mischief and disorderly conduct following the incident that unfolded Tuesday after she lost track of her children investigators said.

""Acts of violence against our team members are not tolerated by American Airlines and we are committed to working closely with law enforcement in their investigation"" the airline said in a statement. ""Our thoughts are with our team member and we are ensuring they have the support they need at this time.""

The Miami-Dade Police Department said McMillie of Birmingham was traveling to New York City and checked into her flight at gate D-39 after being rebooked for missing her previous flight.

MOTHER IN MIAMI AIRPORT HURLS COMPUTER AT AMERICAN AIRLINES WORKER AFTER LOSING KIDS: ‘WENT INTO A PANIC MODE’

""While the subject was with the gate agent her two minor children walked away without notice to use nearby restrooms"" police said in a statement. ""Once the subject noticed the children were not with her she became irate and began to scream demanding the gate agent to find her children.""

(Warning: Explicit language in tweets below)

Investigators said McMillie then ""pulled the boarding pass reader off the wooden counter damaging the equipment and countertop area"" and ""as she continued to scream she then grabbed the computer monitor and threw it at the gate agent striking her in the shoulder.""

A video captured by a witness shows the gate attendant – who is wearing festive reindeer antlers – bracing for cover as the monitor is hurled in her direction. Other footage reportedly shows McMillie knocking electronics to the ground.

A police affidavit obtained by FOX Business said the American Airlines employee suffered a bruise to her right shoulder while McMillie is believed to have caused over $10000 in damages.

Police also told FOX Business that the Florida Department of Children and Families is assisting McMillie's children.

Mavericks owner Mark Cuban joked he already poured his heart out at Dirk’s final game in 2019 when the city renamed a street “Nowitzki Way” and at the “41” jersey retirement in January.

But Cuban also made a promise at Dirk’s final game to place a statue in front of the AAC a promise he told Nowitzki 44 he was happy to honor today.

“You earned it for every fan of the Dallas Mavericks you earned it for every fan of Dirk Nowitzki” Cuban said.

Josh Soto came from Fort Worth and said he arrived at 7 a.m. to make sure he had a perfect spot to watch the statue unveiling ceremony.

“I almost cried when it came out” Soto said. “I remember seeing that so many times and now I can see it every time I walk to this arena.”

The statue features Nowitzki in his signature one-legged fadeaway jumper. Nowitzki told fans he added a special tribute to them too with a 21-letter phrase one for each of his 21 years with the team the longest for any player with one team in NBA history.

“Loyalty never fades away"" Nowitzki said. “Thank you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjEvdHJhdmVsL2hvbGlkYXktdHJhdmVsLXdpbnRlci1mbGlnaHQtZGVsYXktY2FuY2VsbGF0aW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to Know if the Winter Storm Wreaks Havoc on Your Holiday Travel (Published 2022),"Wind freezing rain and snow are predicted from the Northwest to the Northeast this week.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

Pennsylvania-based PJM which operates the power grid for 65 million people aks that customers do what they can to reduce electricity demand.

Senior Vice President of Operations Mike Bryson said the cold weather has increased energy consumption and is affecting power plants. Bryson said the risk of rotating customer outages is real.



AEP Ohio said customers can reduce energy consumption by:

Setting your thermostat lower than usual if health allows



Postponing use of major electric appliances such as stoves dishwashers and clothes dryers

Turning off non-essential electric lights equipment and appliances

AEP Ohio said if more emergency action is required PJM would direct them to begin intermittent grid protection power outages.



""The action will only be taken if necessary to avoid widespread power loss and to prevent long-term damage to the regional electric system"" AEP Ohio said.



“We are actively working with PJM and other regional utilities to minimize the impact of this event on our customers” said Marc Reitter president and chief operating officer of AEP Ohio. “We understand that cutting back on use of electricity can be inconvenient and uncomfortable especially during the holidays. This is a necessary step to prevent broader power interruptions and we appreciate our customers’ efforts.”

The blinding blizzards freezing rain and frigid cold that enveloped much of the country knocked out power to 1.7 million households and businesses while major electricity grid operator warned the 65 million people it serves across the eastern U.S. that rolling blackouts might be required.

WATCH: Winter storm creates treacherous holiday travel season

Pennsylvania-based PJM Interconnection said power plants are having difficulty operating in the frigid weather and has asked residents to refrain from unnecessary use of electricity. It issued an emergency call for conservation system-wide — asking residents in 13 states to set thermostats lower than usual to postpone use of major appliances like stoves and dishwashers and to turn off nonessential lights. Commercial and industrial power users have also been asked to cut back.

PJM officials said there is increased electricity demand across its system at the same time that some power plants are having difficulty operating in the extreme cold. They said they want people to be prepared for the possibility of rolling blackouts.

“It’ll be short-lived we’ll do everything we can to prevent it but it is a real possibility” said Mike Bryson PJM’s senior vice president for operations.

Adding to the woes were power outages that by early Saturday were still affecting more than 1.7 million homes and businesses according to the website PowerOutage which tracks utility reports.

The storm was nearly unprecedented in its scope stretching from the Great Lakes near Canada to the Rio Grande along the border with Mexico. About 60% of the U.S. population faced some sort of winter weather advisory or warning and temperatures plummeted drastically below normal from east of the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians the National Weather Service said.

Freezing rain coated much of the Pacific Northwest in a layer of ice while people in the Northeast faced the threat of coastal and inland flooding.

The frigid temperatures and gusty winds were expected to produce “dangerously cold wind chills across much of the central and eastern U.S. this holiday weekend” the weather service said adding that the conditions “will create a potentially life-threatening hazard for travelers that become stranded.”

“In some areas being outdoors could lead to frostbite in minutes” it said.

As millions of Americans were traveling ahead of Christmas more than 5700 flights within into or out of the U.S. were canceled Friday according to the tracking site FlightAware.

Multiple highways were closed and crashes claimed at least eight lives officials said. Four people died in a massive pileup involving some 50 vehicles on the Ohio Turnpike.

Such conversions are becoming more popular as battery technology gets better and the world turns toward cleaner energy sources.

EVs and classic cars

Kevin Erickson owns a 1972 Plymouth Satellite that he renamed ”Electrollite” after conversion. Now the car can go from a still position to 97 kilometers per hour in about three seconds. Its top speed is almost 250 kilometers per hour.

At the end of 2019 Erickson bought the car for $6500. He then began a year-and-a-half-long project to convert the car to electric. He used battery packs a motor and parts from a Tesla Model S that had been in a crash.

“This was my way of taking the car that I like — my favorite body — and then taking the modern technology and performance and mixing them together” said Erickson who has put about $60000 into the project.

Jonathan Klinger is vice president of car culture for Hagerty Insurance. He said converting classic cars into EVs is “definitely a trend” although research on the activity is limited.

In May the Michigan-based company did a web-based study of about 25000 automobile lovers in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom.

About one percent had at least partly converted an older model car to run on some form of electric power.

The top three reasons for converting the vehicles were for better performance for a fun project and because of environmental concerns. About 25 percent of respondents said they approve of older automobiles being partly or fully converted to electric vehicles.

Klinger who owns several vintage vehicles said he does not think electric motors will replace all gas engines — especially when considering historically important vehicles.

“There’s something satisfying about having a vintage car that has a carburetor” he said because it’s the same as when the car was new. Some car lovers want to keep the sound of older cars’ original engines.

Difficulties and the future

Electric conversions require special knowledge to complete. They also involve safety concerns and parts that are sometimes hard to find.

And then there is the price.

Sean Moudry who co-owns Inspire EV a small conversion business near Denver recently worked on a 1965 Ford Mustang. The year-and-a-half-long project cost more than $100000 and involved many difficulties.

Moudry and his partners replaced the gas engine with a motor from a crashed Tesla Model S. They also added 16 Tesla battery packs weighing a total of about 363 kilograms.

Most older cars including the Mustang were not designed to have that much weight or the increased performance of a powerful electric motor. So the team had to make changes to other parts of the car including the suspension system.

Moudry says many people do not have the resources necessary to carry out this kind of project. As a result he says it will take a while for electric conversions to become common.

“I think it’s going to be 20 years” he said. “It’s going to be a 20-year run before you go to a car show and 50 to 60 percent of the cars are running some variant of an electric motor in it.”

But that reality could be coming sooner than expected says Mike Spagnola president and CEO of the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) a trade group.

He said that electric vehicle products took about 1950 square meters of marketing space at SEMA’s yearly show in Las Vegas this fall. That was up from only 232 square meters at the 2021 show.

Even though it’s nearly silent the classic American muscle car isn’t broken. It’s electric.

Erickson is among a small but expanding group of tinkerers racers engineers and entrepreneurs across the country who are converting vintage cars and trucks into greener and often much faster electric vehicles.

Despite derision from some purists about the converted cars resembling golf carts or remote-controlled cars electric powertrain conversions are becoming more mainstream as battery technology advances and the world turns toward cleaner energy to combat climate change.

“RC cars are fast so that’s kind of a compliment really” said Erickson whose renamed ”Electrollite” accelerates to 0-60 mph (0-97 kph) in three seconds and tops out at about 155 mph (249 kph). It also invites curious stares at public charging stations which are becoming increasingly common across the country.

At the end of 2019 Erickson a cargo pilot who lives in suburban Denver bought the car for $6500. He then embarked on a year-and-a-half-long project to convert the car into a 636-horsepower electric vehicle (475 kW) using battery packs a motor and the entire rear subframe from a crashed Tesla Model S.

“This was my way of taking the car that I like — my favorite body — and then taking the modern technology and performance and mixing them together” said Erickson who has put about $60000 into the project.

Jonathan Klinger vice president of car culture for Hagerty an insurance company and automotive lifestyle brand that specializes in collector vehicles said converting classic cars into EVs is “definitely a trend” although research on the practice is limited.

In May the Michigan-based company conducted a web-based survey of about 25000 self-identified automobile enthusiasts in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom. About 1% had either partially or fully converted their classic to run on some sort of electrified drivetrain.

The respondents’ top three reasons for converting their vehicles were for faster acceleration and improved performance for a fun and challenging project and because of environmental and emissions concerns. About 25% of respondents said they approve of classic vehicles being partially or fully converted to EVs.

“Electric vehicles deliver some pretty astonishing performance just by the nature of the mechanics of how they work” Klinger said. So it’s not surprising to him that a small percentage of people converting classic cars to EVs are interested in improving performance. He compared the current trend to the hot-rod movement of the 1950s.

But Klinger who owns several vintage vehicles said he doesn’t think electric motors will replace all internal combustion engines — especially when considering historically significant vehicles.

“There’s something satisfying about having a vintage car that has a carburetor” he said because it’s the same as when the car was new. Some enthusiasts want to preserve the sound and rumble of older cars’ original engines.

Other barriers to converting cars include the knowledge it takes to delve into such a complicated project as well as safety concerns about tinkering with high-voltage components the availability of parts and the time it takes to realize a positive environmental impact. Because classic vehicles are driven for fewer than 1500 miles (2414 kilometers) a year on average it takes longer to offset the initial carbon footprint of manufacturing the batteries Klinger said.

And then there’s the price.

Sean Moudry who co-owns Inspire EV a small conversion business in suburban Denver recently modified a 1965 Ford Mustang that was destined for the landfill. The year-and-a-half-long project cost more than $100000 and revealed several other obstacles that underscore why conversions are not “plug-and-play” endeavors.

Trying to pack enough power into the pony car to “smoke the tires off of it” at a drag strip Moudry and his partners replaced the underpowered six-cylinder gas engine with a motor from a crashed Tesla Model S. They also installed 16 Tesla battery packs weighing a total of about 800 pounds (363 kilograms).

Most classic vehicles including the Mustang weren’t designed to handle that much weight — or the increased performance that comes with a powerful electric motor. So the team had to beef up the car’s suspension steering driveshaft and brakes.

The result is a Frankenstein-like vehicle that includes a rear axle from a Ford F-150 pickup and rotors from a Dodge Durango SUV as well as disc brakes and sturdier coil-over shocks in the front and rear.

Although Ford and General Motors have or are planning to produce standalone electric “crate” motors that are marketed to classic vehicle owners Moudry says it’s still not realistic for a casual car tinkerer to have the resources to take on such a complicated project. Because of this he thinks it will take a while for EV conversions to become mainstream.

“I think it’s going to be 20 years” he said. “It’s going to be a 20-year run before you go to a car show and 50 to 60% of the cars are running some variant of an electric motor in it.”

But that reality could be coming sooner than expected according to Mike Spagnola president and CEO of the Specialty Equipment Market Association a trade group that focuses on aftermarket vehicle parts.

He said that during SEMA’s annual show in Las Vegas this fall some 21000 square feet (1951 square meters) of convention space was dedicated to electric vehicles and their parts. That was up from only 2500 square feet (232 square meters) at the 2021 show.

Companies are developing universal parts as well as lighter smaller and more powerful battery packs. They’re also creating wiring components that are easier to install and myriad other innovations. Some are even building vehicle frames with the electric motor batteries and components already installed. Buyers can just install the body of a classic vehicle on top of the platform.

“The early adopters of this would take a crashed Tesla and pull the motor and harnesses and batteries and all that out of the vehicle and find a way to shoehorn it into whatever vehicle they wanted to build” Spagnola said. “But today there are many manufacturers now starting to make components. … We’re really excited about it.”"

After the pop star encouraged fans to vote in the 2018 midterm elections Ms. Smith registered. The 23-year-old’s most recent rite of passage — getting her first credit card — was also prompted by the singer.

When the 11-time Grammy winner announced her Eras Tour her first in five years Ms. Smith said she knew she had to “do everything in my power to be able to get tickets.” So she signed up for a card through Capital One which partnered with Ms. Swift to promote the tour and offered fans preferential access to presale tickets.

“Taylor Swift was once again that push” said Ms. Smith who lives in Pittsburgh. In addition to getting concert tickets she hoped the card would help her to build good credit. “As I signed up because of the Taylor presale I realized the importance of financial literacy and maybe it should be pushed more in schools and colleges” she said. Ms. Smith who has cerebral palsy was able to get four accessible seats for her and her friends for about $1013 though she used her debit card because the total exceeded her credit card’s limit.

Still getting a credit card was already a goal of Ms. Smith’s partially because her mother had encouraged her to start building credit so that she would have a good credit score when she moved into her own apartment and Ms. Swift’s concert deal led Ms. Smith to take that financial step.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcnkvb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5zL3lvdXItdm9pY2UvMjAyMi8xMi8yNS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1zd2lwZS1mZWVzLWh1cnQtc21hbGwtYnVzaW5lc3MvNjk3NTM2NTIwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Credit card swipe fees hurt small business,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcnkvb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5zL3lvdXItdm9pY2UvMjAyMi8xMi8yNS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1zd2lwZS1mZWVzLWh1cnQtc21hbGwtYnVzaW5lc3MvNjk3NTM2NTIwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223873970>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Credit card headaches abroad

Chase's highest-end credit card declines a distressing number of overseas transactions said Seth Kugel in The New York Times. On a trip to Brazil I ""had dozens of transactions declined"" with my Chase Sapphire Reserve and a Delta-branded American Express card. This isn't supposed to happen especially with the Chase card which is touted as ""one of the best travel cards out there"" with a $550 annual fee. A reader wrote to say that she had the same thing happen with her Sapphire card on a trip to Europe. I looked into her case. Chase said that on two of the occasions that her card didn't work there was a chip malfunction; another rejection was caused by a fraud warning for which she didn't get a text alert on her phone and customer service was no help. There's no good answer unfortunately for overeager fraud-detection algorithms — except to carry multiple cards when you go abroad.

A big payoff on a mystery investment

You've heard of house flipping. Now there's ""pallet flipping"" said Megan Sauer at CNBC​. In December 2020 Jamie and Sarah McCauley saw a Facebook post from a Michigan distributor offering to sell a pallet of returned goods from big-box retailers like Target Walmart and Amazon for $550. ""The caveat: You don't know what items are in the boxes."" The McCauleys took the gamble. Since then they ""estimate they've spent about $7150 on pallets"" and cashed that into $19500 in profit ""by reselling those items in those boxes on eBay and Facebook Marketplace."" Most of the returned items were ""opened and lightly used"" and the McCauleys resold them ""at roughly 60 percent of their original price.""

Hedge funds' favorite public college

Baruch College has built a pipeline to Wall Street that rivals the Ivy League's said Heather Perlberg in Bloomberg. The Manhattan-based institution a member of New York City's public university system boasts a master's in financial engineering program that tops those of Princeton MIT Cornell and Carnegie Mellon according to QuantNet an online forum for financial engineers. Only 25 students are accepted into the program per year and ""applicants go through several rounds of interviews."" About 70 percent of the graduates ""end up going to work for hedge funds."" The program's value proposition is also unbeatable. ""An 18-month Baruch MFE costs a New York City resident about $29000"" roughly a quarter the cost of a similar degree from MIT.

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.

In an ideal world companies would be supported by the general population. After all the economy of a country defines its standard of living and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all companies provide innovation ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?

Many corporations in the world and especially the bigger ones are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost. Even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more. This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders. Meanwhile employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid not to mention made to work in harsh conditions. Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so they are actually a detriment.

15 most hated companies in America

You might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company this is an important fact to consider. However Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier they often compromise on their beliefs.

Another reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.

Story continues

It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns data leaks and its influence on everyone but it still has 2 billion active monthly users and so is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business) public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).

Of course this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed or even increase it. According to PwC itself one of the largest firms in the world mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC it ""describes the stocks of knowledge skills experience health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships institutions shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus it will achieve success quickly. Of course this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.

Speaking of audit firms the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms while taking steps in some countries should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.

You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.

For our rankings of the most hated companies we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street TheStreet.com Bloomberg Business Insider and Fast Company giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America companies which need to work hard to regain public trust starting with number 15:

15. American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG)

American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG) with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.

14. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.

13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.

Number of times mentioned: 2

Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time growing massively over a short period of time. However hatred for Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.

11. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER)

Number of times mentioned: 2

The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.

10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.

9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.

Overall though we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.

8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)

Number of times mentioned: 2

One of the largest banking institutions in America Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes we know it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.

In 2018 Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.

7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)

Number of times mentioned: 2

BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world and in 2010 was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years but we don't think it is material anymore.

6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.

The hospitality industry is not just one of the largest industries in the world it is also one of the most important in driving tourism which is crucial to the economy of many countries. However no other industry felt the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic more than the hospitality industry. According to NPR during 2020 the hotel occupancy rate in the U.S. was just 44% and revenue per room versus 2019 was down by nearly half. Many smaller independent hotels had to close down while the major ones had to let go thousands of employees to ensure sustainability.

However 2022 has been a year of recovery for the hospitality industry. The hotel industry recovery beat estimates which resulted in higher than expected average daily hotel rates and revenue per available room. While growth will continue in 2023 the expected economic headwinds could put a cap on this growth. Inflation and higher interest rates have reduced the disposable income of many people while the threat of a recession has seen industries slowing down. However despite these issues hotel occupancy rate for 2023 is still expected to be around 63.6% much better than 2020.

20 largest hotel chains in the world

Another challenge being faced by hotels is Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) which was established in 2008. Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) saw significant growth over the next decade and a half emerging as a real competitor for the hotel industry. However there has been a significant impact on real estate because of Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) as more and more people look to rent out their properties through the platform to maximize earnings driving up rental prices in areas as well as the price of real estate which has priced out locals from being able to rent such properties. However Airbnb Inc. (ABNB) properties now include a lot of additional charges and tons of instructions. This has caused people especially families to turn to hotels.

To determine the largest hotel chains in the world we considered both the number of properties owned by each company as well as the number of rooms. Now it is a bit subjective on whether the size of a chain depends on number of properties or number of rooms. For us number of rooms should take priority. For example if a hotel chain has 5 properties and 20 rooms and the other hotel has 2 properties with 150 rooms the latter would be a bigger hotel chain. With this in mind we assigned 70% weightage to the number of rooms each hotel chain has and 30% weightage to the number of properties.

He was 61.

Doctors diagnosed de Cavel with a rare form of cancer called leiomyosarcoma in 2018; the disease eventually led to his death.

De Cavel was born in Roubaix France in 1961 and studied at Le Feguide culinary school in France before heading to New York to work as a chef.

""From an early teen I always wanted to be in the kitchen"" de CaveltoldCincinnati Editionin 2014. ""It was something I always enjoyed. I said to my parents 'I want to do an apprenticeship.' ""

He moved to Cincinnati in 1993 to work as head chef for Maisonette then a prestigious fine dining destination Downtown and Cincinnati's only restaurant with a Mobil five-star rating.

His first days were rocky — the airline lost his luggage and he had to delay his start at the Maisonette. Coming from New York Cincinnati's downtown seemed small. But he saw opportunity in the close-knit community.

""It was like everybody is from here"" he said. ""Everyone’s grandmother lives on the corner.""

But he wasn't satisfied to simply hold the top spot at one of the city's most well-regarded restaurants.

His own ventures were numerous spanning both formal fine dining and more causal French fare and included highly regarded restaurants like Chalk French Crust Frenchie Fresh Greenup Café Lavomatic JeanRo Pigalls and many others.

""It's a different era"" de Cavel told WVXU in 2016 as he opened up Restaurant L in Great American Tower. ""Our wish is really to make the new generation and the older generation feel like what we are giving them today is what the Maisonette gave the customers and their guests for many decades in the past.""

De Cavel’s work was recognized a number of times — he was named a semi-finalist four times for Best Chef in the Great Lakes Region and three times for Best Chef in the Midwest by the James Beard Foundation.

Often credited with helping kickstart Cincinnati's dining renaissance the city renamed the corner of Seventh and Vine Streets Downtown for de Cavel in 2021.

""Jean-Robert de Cavel made Cincinnati his home and then he changed us forever"" Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval tweeted Dec. 23. ""Through his life's work in the kitchen and in the community he taught us all to expect more. To believe Cincinnati was deserving of the very best. And thanks to him the very best is what we got.""

Jean-Robert‘s passion for bringing joy to this City and its people never once wavered. We will always hold his memory in our hearts.



Our love and sympathies go out to his family and friends. — Aftab Pureval (@AftabPureval) December 23 2022

His influence went beyond the culinary world. De Cavel participated in a number of charitable causes. After losing their first-born daughter Tatiana to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2002 he and his wife founded the de Cavel Family SIDS Foundation.

""I have a soft spot for charity and doing things for people"" he said in his Cincinnati Edition interview. ""When I came to Cincinnati I realized… you can make a difference as a big fish in a small pond. When I came to town I was in the spotlight as the head chef of the best restaurant in town. I'd never had that dimension before. That made me feel like I want to be connected with people.""

De Cavel leaves behind his wife Annette Pfund de Cavel and his daughter Leticia.

The new phase of construction on Salt Lake City's Block 67 is to include a 321-unit apartment complex and completion of a new mid-block walkway to be known as Quarter Row.

A cluster of new high-rises that has been going up next to the Salt Palace Convention Center in downtown Salt Lake City is about to get bigger and a little friendlier to pedestrians.

Developers recently won initial approval of designs for a new 16-story residential complex with 321 dwellings to be added to what is being called The West Quarter well underway on the city’s Block 67 at roughly 260 W. 200 South.

The new tower and supporting midblock street construction dubbed West Quarter Block C represents a second phase of the larger mixed-use project going up at a choice spot between the city’s urban heart and its rapidly growing warehouse district to the west according to The Ritchie Group and Garn Development Co.

(Dwell Design Studio via Salt Lake City) Rendering of The West Quarter Block C an apartment tower and pedestrian corridor proposed at 260 W. 200 South on Salt Lake City's Block 67 adjacent to the Salt Palace Convention Center.

The new apartment complex will be added on a 2.34 acre midblock lot next to The Charles an 11-story tower of 240 luxury rentals and another 11-story building with 272 guest rooms that has been shaped into two hotels Le Meridien and Element Salt Lake City Marriott — all of which are nearing completion.

Half the floors of The Charles which features an interior plaza and lavish rooftop amenities are now open to leasing with the other half expected to open before year’s end. Both The Charles and the hotel are to feature restaurants on the ground floor.

The development also forced a fresh look at Salt Lake City’s Japantown and ways to bolster the vestiges left along an adjacent stretch of 100 South of what was once a vibrant ethnic neighborhood spanning several blocks in each direction.

(GSBS Architects) Rendering of draft street designs and light fixtures proposed for Japantown in Salt Lake City. The one-block cultural hub is envisioned along downtown Salt Lake City’s 100 South between 200 and 300 West next to the Salt Palace in honor of what was once a thriving neighborhood for Utah’s Japanese American residents.

After extensive talks between developers and community members the city’s Redevelopment Agency released a carefully crafted vision in early 2021 for Japantown Street an Asian-themed festival street to run along 100 South between 200 West and 300 West.

Plans for the new tower on Block 67 call for 85 studios and 161 one-bedroom 68 two-bedroom and nine three-bedroom apartments along with 25000-plus square feet of ground floor space devoted for retail outlets a lobby leasing office and a pet care area the developers say.

The tower is also designed with an interior parking deck with 342 stalls and amenities such as a clubhouse exercise facilities covered outdoor terraces and a pool and courtyard on its ninth floor.

Supporters of Japantown along 100 South fear the project could overwhelm the historic cultural enclave.

The existing Royal Wood Office Plaza building and adjoining surface parking on Block 67 will be torn out as part of this new phase according to the designs.

Subsequent phases envisioned for Block 67 include two more towers one with offices and the other combining a hotel with luxury condominiums.

Stitching SLC together for pedestrians

In addition to new housing a key element of this latest phase is what it may offer downtown pedestrians.

This second phase involves completing a partially built midblock street by extending it from 200 South through the block’s southwest corner to 300 West also known as John Stockton Drive essentially creating a shortcut for those walking to and from The Gateway and Vivint Arena and the downtown core using 200 South.

To be called Quarter Row the street will be publicly accessible via an easement. Lots of attention is being paid the developers say to making it an active and engaging city street with shops and potentially new eateries.

(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Construction crews gather for a group photo as they wait for the crane to lift the final beam ""topping out"" the first phase he West Quarter project near Vivint Arena on Thursday Aug. 26 2021.

Ryan Ritchie owner of The Ritchie Group said Block 67 is seen as “critical” for the east-west pedestrian flows it will foster from the central business district to a rapidly developing neighborhoods and entertainment district west of the Salt Palace.

Those pedestrian flows are likely to amp up too with the recent opening of the 26-story Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City hotel with its 700 hotel rooms and meeting spaces aimed at drawing large conventions.

(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Ryan Ritchie Co-Founder and Managing Partner of The Ritchie Group talks to the crowd before the crane to lifts the final beam ""topping out"" the first phase he West Quarter project near Vivint Arena on Thursday Aug. 26 2021.

“The West Quarter fits as we try to stitch our city back together” Ritchie said referring to the way the Salt Palace’s footprint has bifurcated the downtown area “for 65-plus years.”

“We’re continuing that vision” Ritchie told city planners. “Block C is the next part of that ... The whole intent of Quarter Row is to be an active pedestrian walkway.”

The strategy he added is to populate the corridor with appealing shops and restaurants spread across most of new building’s ground floor.

City approves additional building height

City zoning rules for that part of downtown usually would limit building heights to 75 feet but developers successfully sought to lift that to just over 185 feet — and secured approval in mid-December from the city’s planning commission.

The city is allowing the new building to be taller in part because the newly constructed midblock street will have a public easement.

(Salt Lake City Planning Department) A map of Salt Lake City's Block 67 including The West Quarter Block C a new apartment building and pedestrian corridor proposed at 260 W. 200 South.

Planners also say the added height is in keeping with what is already on nearby properties. The impacts on Block 67 also will be offset by the building’s design.

Ashvini Dinoy an associate principal with Dwell Design Studio in Salt Lake City and project manager of this phase said ground-level materials for the new building will be primarily beige brick matching the color palate of prior Block 67 construction. Upper floors of the facade will be metal panels with glazing.

Parking levels between floors two and eight will be wrapped with a flexible mesh facade with a customizable exterior Dinoy said although exact details on its design are to be determined.

John Landis’ 1981 hit was that rare horror comedy that actually pulled off both the horror and the comedy put makeup on the Oscars map and developed the kind of cult status that only the foolhardy would dare mess with. Yet that didn’t stop more than a dozen screenwriters and directors including Landis himself from giving it a go.

Stuck in development hell for much of the ‘90s An American Werewolf in Paris finally made it into theaters 16 years after the original. That explains why instead of two clean-cut middle-class hikers the film’s travelers are a trio of thrill-seeking bros who seem to have escaped from MTV’s Spring Break. Vince Vieluf’s Brad and Phil Buckman’s Chris in particular are so obnoxious with their opening scene talk of “sex points” that you immediately start praying for them to get mauled by a wild-eyed lycanthrope.

Thankfully their other traveling companion is a little more likable. Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott recapturing the nice guy charm of his breakthrough performance in That Thing You Do!) also becomes an instant hero after saving Julie Delpy’s suicidal Sérafine from getting splattered below the Eiffel Tower with a quick-thinking bungee jump.

This dramatic meet-cute sets the Parisian tale on a more romantic path than its earlier visions. Landis wanted to center the sequel on an investigation into the tragic deaths of David Naughton and Griffin Dunne’s backpackers bailing on the project when Polygram snubbed his first draft. John Lafia’s (Child’s Play) concept of a turned schoolteacher trailed by the original’s Dr. Hirsch was also reportedly turned down and then Tom Stern was briefly appointed to helm a story about a tourist whose uncle falls victim to a mysterious critter. The latter however did receive a screenwriting credit alongside collaborator Tim Burns and Anthony Waller the man who replaced Marco Brambilla (Demolition Man) in the director’s chair.

Sérafine and Andy’s love story is hampered by the fact that Delpy – who’d just starred in perhaps the decade’s finest transatlantic big-screen romance Before Sunrise – and Scott share zero chemistry. Even when the Parisian gratuitously goes topless while straddling the American in bed the pair still look like they’d rather be feasting on human heart smoothies.

Of course the two unconvincing lovebirds do get to enjoy some liquified flesh: By this point it’s been revealed that Sérafine starts growing fangs and an inordinate amount of body hair whenever there’s a full moon. Andy meanwhile is just learning that the mutant that bit him the night before has handed him the same fate.

You might expect that Andy’s metamorphosis from mild-mannered human into uncontrollable all-devouring beast would be the one area that An American Werewolf in Paris improves on its London-based counterpart. Although Rick Baker’s prosthetics astounded at the time deservedly picking up the inaugural Academy Award for Best Make-Up and Effects they’d inevitably become dated. But the over-reliance on shoddy CGI renders the sequel’s transformations entirely unconvincing: The victims always look like they’re being attacked by a PS1 monster rather than a flesh-and-blood creature.

Waller whose more impressive 1995 directorial debut Mute Witness had ironically focused on a horror movie makeup artist is far more successful inducing laughs than scares. Future Modern Family star Julie Bowen gets many of the best lines as Andy’s first slay Amy an amusingly annoying airhead who returns to haunt her killer in rotting zombie form (“It took me four years on a Stairmaster to get a package like this. You ripped through it like a lamb chop!”).

He also makes interesting use of the Gallic setting largely eschewing the more obvious reference points for lesser-known landmarks. Before ripping her to shreds Andy gets carnal with Amy at Pere Lachaise cemetery (and no doubt to the horror of Doors fans specifically on Jim Morrison’s grave). Later we descend into the labyrinthian catacombs of the capital’s underground.

Disappointingly Waller also eschews the sucker punch that had 1981 audiences leaving the cinema shell-shocked for a much happier ending. Whereas An American Werewolf in London concluded with its lupine antihero dying in his lover’s arms its follow-up concludes with Andy and Sérafine — both presumably cured — getting hitched atop the Statue of Liberty.

The drastic change in tone and the lack of any real ties to its predecessor means the movie is only a sequel in name. Even this brand recognition couldn’t tempt many to their nearest multiplex: Paris entered the domestic box office chart at a lowly seven grossing only $2.3 million more than notorious flop Mr. Magoo. Landis twisted the knife when he remarked “I was really disappointed when I saw that film I thought it was lousy.”

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

Business was brisk Russian customs records show. The United States and the EU had recently restricted sales of sensitive technology to Russia because of its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and many Western tech companies had suspended all dealings with Moscow.

Co-founded by Gokturk Agvaz a Turkish businessman Azu International stepped in to help fill the supply gap. Over the next seven months the company exported at least $20 million worth of components to Russia including chips made by U.S. manufacturers according to Russian customs records.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A visit to major car parks around old Ojo area of Lagos State such as Liberal Motors Peace park The Young and God is Good show passengers in their numbers seeking to buy tickets and some of whom sought discounted prices.

A bus ticket from Lagos to Enugu Owerri and Onitsha which was sold for N10000 to N12000 now cost about N22000 to N25000.

Passengers moved from one bus terminal to another seeking best deals.

“This is the third car park I’m coming to this morning and yet I can’t even get N18000 a ticket to Enugu. Just last month the price was N10000. How they moved from N10000 to N22000 is simply wickedness. Things are tough for people yet these transporters look for ways to frustrate people the more and exploit them” Chika Okafor a prospective passenger at Peace Mass told BDSunday.

Another passenger who identified himself as Chika told BDSunday that he had made plans that he would travel with his brother to the village for their sister’s traditional marriage but had to change his mind and decided to travel alone when he found out the cost of transportation to Asaba.

“I can no longer travel with my younger brother to the village for our sister’s traditional marriage. I have to go to the village alone. I earn N100000 as monthly salary and I take care of my younger brother since our parents died. If I’m paying almost N23000 for a one-way journey to the East this will be roughly almost N50000 to and fro.

“I need some money to still take care of myself and other expenses. Where do I get such money? So it is only wise to let my brother stay while I manage to travel. The struggle is real” Chika lamented.

For those who decided to cut cost by not travelling but sending food items to their loved ones in the village they are also paying heavily to transport the items.

At the Young Shall Grow park in Mazamaza Lagos people pay between N10000 and N13000 to transport a bag of rice to the East.

“I paid N10 000 to send a bag of rice to my parents this morning. Cost of transportation to the village is very high so I thought to cut costs by just sending it to them. I was shocked when I got to The Young car park and was told that it will cost N13000 to send the rice home. I had a budget for N5000 because the last time I sent rice to the East it cost just N4000. I had to beat down the price to N10000. The cost of everything is so high and people are really suffering this period” Vivian Ogonna told BDSunday.

Air travellers are also facing a similar issue as cost of air fares have also risen.

A recent visit to the Lagos local airports showed a busy terminal with travellers processing their boarding passes.

A one-way ticket from Lagos to Abuja on Wednesday on Air Peace cost between N85000 and 120000 as against N35000 charged in January 2022. Also the airline’s one-way ticket from Lagos to Port Harcourt cost between N90000 and N120000 as against 30000 charged in January 2022. Lagos to Kano one-way flight also costs between N80000 and N120000 as against N40000.

Green Africa which started operations last year with Lagos-Abuja fares for as low as N18000 currently charges between N70 000 and N85 000 on the same route. The airline also charges between N75000 and N85000 for its Lagos-Port Harcourt flight.

United Nigeria Airlines have also raised fares from N28000 since February to N90000 for Lagos-Abuja and Lagos-Port Harcourt routes.

Stakeholders say fares may still rise as aviation fuel has become scarce.

Air passengers travelling for Christmas this season may be faced with flight delays and cancellations as a result of aviation fuel scarcity across several states in Nigeria.

The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) on Tuesday alerted the general public to impending disruptions in scheduled flight operations due to the scarcity of aviation fuel otherwise known as JET-A1.

According to AON the scarcity has “reared its ugly head again in the past few days.”

According to the airline operators the scarcity will no doubt force them to reschedule flights leading to late operations and or cancellations.

A statement by Obiora Okonkwo spokesman AON read in part: “This unintended development is a pain on airline operators and a stain on the industry especially at this time of mass movement of people for the Christmas and New Year festivities.

“While we do our utmost best to manage the situation and ensure safe flight operations we plead the understanding of the travelling public in the circumstance.”

The aviation fuel crisis which began in late February and deteriorated further through the months of March to May has further worsened and is currently threatening the ability of airlines to continue operations with the price of JetA1 rising from N200 in December 2021 to over N400 per litre in February. Currently the price has skyrocketed to over N800 per litre.

Allen Onyema vice president of AON and the chairman of Air Peace had earlier in the year warned that if nothing was done concerning the cost of aviation fuel the fuel crisis would force airlines to suspend operations.

“Aviation fuel prices may take airlines out not only in Nigeria but everywhere in the world. Some airlines outside Nigeria have shut down because of the rising cost of aviation fuel. If these things are not addressed in Nigeria it can affect the bottom line of all airlines in Nigeria” he said.

He explained that when airline operators decided to charge N50000 as base fare they looked at cost per seat and discovered that airlines will still not make profit if they charge N60000 as base fare because multiple taxations erode the revenues of airlines.

One year ago economic base fare for tickets were between N25000 to N30000 but the airline in February 2022 increased economy tickets to N50000 and N60000 showing a 100 percent increase.

Airline operators have since increased base fare from 50000 to over N100000 depending on the price of aviation fuel.",,,,,,,,,

The star performers in the US Japan and China delivered twice the returns of the FTSE 100's top stocks according to data from eToro exclusively seen by This is Money.

Defence contractor BAE Systems has been the FTSE 100's top-performing stock this year having risen by around 54 per cent.

Top 10: The top 10 best performing stocks on the UK's FTSE 100 index in 2022

US matters: A table showing the top 10 performing S&P 500 stocks in 2022

BAE Systems an arms manufacturer has been bolstered in a year which saw Russia invade Ukraine and mounting global tensions.

Ben Laidler global markets strategist at eToro said: 'While the FTSE 100 may have lost ground in 2022 it has performed well by international standards and finishes the year as the best performing major international market.

'However as the data shows when you dig a little deeper the returns delivered by the UK's star performers pale in comparison to the returns offered by the leading US European and Asian stocks.

'There is no single reason for this but rather a multitude of factors which have held back UK-listed stocks this year. For example US oil stocks have not had to face punishing windfall taxes like BP and Shell have in the UK.'

Within Britain's blue-chip index the likes of Pearson and mining giant Glencore up 51 per cent and 43 per cent respectively.

Having raked in bumper profits shares in oil giants Shell and BP have also performed strongly rising around 41 per cent in the last 12 months.

Performance: The best performing UK stocks have lagged behind rivals in Asia and the US eToro said

British Gas owner Centrica shares have also performed strongly and are up around 30 per cent on a year ago. The company’s profits have soared boosted by record-high global gas and electricity prices although its UK consumer arm British Gas has suffered at home.

Centrica will hand £250million to shareholders via a recent buyback scheme as high wholesale prices put the firm on course for a six-fold increase in net profits compared to last year. The group posted a half-year profit of £1.34billion in July.

But the performance of individual stocks in the FTSE 100 index has been dwarfed by those elsewhere in the world.

For instance in the US Occidental Petroleum Group which is listed on the S&P 500 has seen its shares rise by 115 per cent in the past year which is more than double the gains enjoyed by FTSE 100-listed BAE Systems.

Even the US's tenth performing best S&P 500 stock APA Corp saw its shares jump over 60 per cent year-on-year.

Japan: A table showing Japan's top 10 performing stocks in the last year

Closer to home: A table showing the top 10 best performing Euro STOXX shares in 2022

A similar picture emerges when examining stocks in Japan and China. The ninth best-performing large-cap stock in Japan Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings has seen its shares rise by around 58 per cent while the tenth best performing stock in China Jinzhou Jixian Molybdenum Co has surged by 118 per cent in the last year according to eToro.

In China Zhonglu Co which manufacturers bicycles exercise equipment motorcycles mopeds saw its shares surge by 256 per cent over the period.

eToro's Laidler said: 'If you look at Japan the Yen is down more than 17 per cent against the dollar over the past year which has boosted the competitiveness of its firms.

'Sterling on the other hand is down just 7 per cent against the dollar over the past year resulting in a much weaker effect for UK-listed firms.

'And while China's economy has slowed sharply this year it is still growing at a much faster pace than the UK and has inflation of just 2 per cent.

'Taken as a whole though the FTSE 100 looks fairly attractive when judged against its peers. Overall it has benefited from a combination of cheap valuations high dividends and an attractive sector mix of oil stocks and traditional defensives from consumer staples to healthcare.'

He added: 'It's also worth remembering that stock markets are not economies and are not entirely dependant on one another to thrive.

'In fact if global uncertainty remains high in 2023 the FTSE 100 should thrive. Although equally the index's attractiveness will fade if the global economy settles interest rates begin to fall and investors recover their animal spirit.'

In 2021 the FTSE 100 closed at 7384 points having started the year at 6460 points. The FTSE 100 rose 14.3 per cent in 2021 representing its best year since 2016.

Looking to the here and now the blue-chip index was in positive territory for 2022 by a margin of 1.1 per cent at Thursday’s close.

At close on Friday the FTSE 100 was up 0.05 per cent or 3.73 points to 7473.01. In the US the S&P 500 has fallen by around 20 per cent in the last year.

A fairly weak pound has been helpful for the FTSE 100 which is packed with oil companies miners and pharmaceutical companies that make the greater part of their revenues in dollars but have sterling share prices.

Chris Beauchamp chief market analyst at IG said: 'Unless US markets can stage something of a late save this afternoon it is going to be a rather sour end to the year for stocks.

'In such a tough year for stocks it is an achievement for the FTSE 100 to finish for Christmas more or less flat for the year so far while others have suffered much more.

'But with the global economy staring a recession in the face there is unlikely to be too much optimism heading into the new year.'",,,,,,,,,,,,

American semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials will build a $600 million plant here that will expand its manufacturing and research operations and create 1000 new jobs The new facility in Tampines Industrial Crescent will be spread over 700000 sq ft with 100000 sq ft of its rooftop covered with solar panels to produce clean energy the firm announced on Thursday.The company also unveiled an eight-year plan dubbed Singapore 2030 to continue expanding its operations here which already represent the bulk of its production capacity outside the United States.President and Chief Executive Gary Dickerson said: “For the past 30 years Singapore has been a strategic hub for Applied Materials and we are excited to build on our success with new investments.”He noted that its plans are in line with estimates for the global chip industry to grow beyond US$1 trillion (S$1.35 trillion) in market value by the end of this decade double the size of today’s market.Mr. Dickerson said the new investment would allow the company to meet growing customer demand accelerate commercialisation of new technologies and services and bolster its research and development (R&D) capabilities.Applied Materials is also one of the top employers in Singapore’s precision engineering sector.The company established its presence in Singapore in 1991 with a small sales office and has since expanded in manufacturing and R&D.Its workforce here now stands at 2500.Mr. Brian Tan regional president of Applied Materials Southeast Asia  said that the new facility will open in 2024 and will employ an additional 1000 staff once it is fully functional.These jobs will include roles in manufacturing customer support and R&D.Dr. Beh Swan Gin chairman of the Economic Development Board said at a groundbreaking ceremony at Parkroyal Collection in Marina Bay that Applied Material’s 2030 plan will help drive the growth of Singapore’s precision engineering sector which accounted for $47.6 billion of output and $15.1 billion value-added in 2021.The semiconductor industry has been hit by high inventories and slower global economic growth but Dr. Beh noted: “We are confident that the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in Singapore will be able to ride out the short-term challenges.”Worldwide sales of semiconductors dropped in the July-to-September period by 6.3 percent the first quarterly decline in about three years according to the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association.Applied Materials’ new investment in Singapore follows expansion plans by global peers such as Micron Technology GlobalFoundries Soitec and Siltronic here. Experts believe these investments show that Singapore – the world’s fourth-largest chip supplier – will continue to be a major hub for the industry.(Source: The Straits Times)",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Cristian Bencomo was booked into jail on Wednesday May 8 accused of shooting his stepmother the Albuquerque Police Department said in a post on X formerly known as Twitter.

Officers responded to the Albuquerque Convention Center shortly after 5 p.m. on Wednesday for reports of gunfire Gilbert Gallegos the department’s communications director said in a video posted on X formerly Twitter.

Officers initially thought they were responding to an active shooter situation but later learned a single gunshot was fired Gallegos said.

The investigation revealed that Bencomo’s stepmother “started to hug him” and he pulled out a “handgun and shot her in the neck” police said.

“We made it all the way through graduation – it was really lovely until it wasn’t” Mary Ward a witness told KOB 4 Eyewitness News.

Ward told the news outlet that the students were told to give a rose to someone in the audience.

“I was watching my student she was coming to the right of me then I looked to the left to the other side there was a crowd of people and then there was a big pop” Ward said the outlet reported.

With more than 100 people in attendance at the charter school graduation Gallegos said “there was a lot of … chaos at the time.”

Nonetheless police said “bystanders held (Bencomo) until officers arrived.”

The woman was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries according to Gallegos. She underwent “hours of surgery” according to the organizers of a GoFundMe who said she will need continued medical treatment and rehab.

Angel Chester the woman’s sister was close by when the shooting happened KRQE News reported. Chester told the station she witnessed Bencomo stomp on her sister’s head following the shooting.

“I keep thinking that it’s a bad dream that I’ll wake up from” Chester told the outlet.

Bencomo is facing multiple counts including aggravated assault and aggravated battery online jail records show. He is being held without bail.

Police are still investigating the shooting according KOAT-TV.

“I suspect that there was a lot of maybe photos or video or witnesses so anyone who doesn’t talk to detectives here on scene is urged to call APD 242-COPS. 505-242-COPS” Gallegos told the outlet.

Djokovic the world No 1 had signed a cap and then a sheet of paper as he headed for the exit when a metal bottle fell onto his head.

Djokovic was clearly in a lot of distress as he fell to the floor and he stayed on the ground for more than 30 seconds before being escorted out by ground staff.

Initially it was thought that the bottle might have been thrown deliberately because footage of the incident obscured where the bottle had come from.

However video shows the bottle slipping out of a spectactor’s backpack as they bend over to attempt to get the attention of the 24-time Grand Slam champion.

New angle all clear now Novak is fine 👇 pic.twitter.com/LWhhpTN0DY — Saša Ozmo (@ozmo_sasa) May 10 2024

Djokovic’s post-match press conference was cancelled but the tournament issued a statement saying: “Novak Djokovic on leaving the Central court at the end of his match was hit on the head by a water bottle while signing autographs to spectators.

“He underwent appropriate medication and has already left the Foro Italico to return to his hotel; his condition is not a cause for concern.”

Djokovic later issued a statement of his own on X. “Thank you for the messages of concern” he said.

“This was an accident and I am fine resting at the hotel with an ice pack. See you all on Sunday.”

Djokovic has won the Italian Open six times and it will be his final warm-up event before he attempts to win his first Grand Slam title of the year at Roland Garros in Paris.

He is currently scheduled to play Chile’s Alejandro Tabilo in the third round on Sunday.

For many the process is likely identical: You snap some photos with your phone and they’re automatically uploaded to Google’s cloud service. You might pick the best photo and share it on WhatsApp or Instagram and then never think about the rest of them ever again. The photos join a constantly updating stream of data about life.

But it shouldn’t be this way. Uploading thousands of photos and never taking any steps to sort or manage them creates a series of privacy risks and is making it impossible to maintain your photo collection in the future. Now is the time to stop being an information hoarder before it spirals out of control.

For the past six weeks I’ve spent around a dozen hours deleting thousands of photos that had been uploaded to my Google Photos account in the last half-decade. In total I erased 16774 photos and videos. During the process—and thousands of ""delete"" taps—three things stood out: My photos collection unknowingly includes a lot of sensitive personal information (both about me and others); I don't need to keep so many photos; and wrestling my collection into shape frees up a lot of space in my Google account.

My photo archive goes back to the early 2000s when everything was captured using an eight-megapixel digital camera. There are tens of thousands of photos—it’s impossible to say how many exactly—and they are entirely handled by Google. The photos were initially stored on CDs moved to Flickr before it limited collections to 1000 images and finally found their way onto Google Photos around 2018. When Google limited accounts to 15 gigabytes of storage I started paying for more.

Inside the collection family holiday shots sit alongside selfies. Food pictures and dog pictures are plentiful. As phone cameras have improved and cloud storage has become seemingly unending it appears that I take more photos every year. I am not the only one. Google Photos holds an unfathomable amount of data about us all: In 2020 the company said it stores 4 trillion photos with 28 billion new photos and videos uploaded each week.

Deleting thousands of photos was a manual tedious process. Using an iPad I scrolled through every photo I had backed up from the past 15-plus years and tapped each one that I wanted to send to trash.

FAYETTEVILLE Ark. — It is sorta surprising the Razorbacks' appearance in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl is only their sixth time.

Surprising because on a clear day you can see the state from the top of the press box. Don't ask we weren't supposed to be up there but it was over 45 years ago so the statute of limitations has expired and the witnesses are probably dead.

It is the only bowl game that is literally just a few short miles from the state of Arkansas borders.

The Razorbacks did play in the first Monday night game there in 1971. Considering the highlight of that game was wide receiver Jim Hodge literally blowing past Tennessee All-American free safety Bobby Majors for the Hogs' only touchdown we'll move along.

By the way you still may not want to bring up the name Preston Watts to any old-timers like myself because he was chased out of the stadium by some Razorback faithful that now seems rather over-kill.

Until then the Liberty Bowl was an afternoon affair that always tried to get somebody close but the Hogs were playing in bigger things during the 1960's. After ABC's success with Monday Night Football in 1970 they got that game on for the first Monday after the NFL regular season ended.

It was a different time.

Which takes us to 1976 and the Liberty Bowl. There would be no way today Elvis Presley could have slipped into any bowl game and sat through a little bit of any football game.

Alabama had a sub-par year in 1976 finishing the season 8-3. Bear Bryant worried about his job when that happened in those days.

When he drew UCLA he worked his team like a national championship game.

Through some questions that morning while working at The Pine Bluff Commercial I managed to get into the press box for that game but ended up alone on the back row of the new media facilities. I was 19 and had my first full-time job then so I would pretty much do anything with no notice.

Obviously the weather affected attendance in the box because about the only people there were from Alabama UCLA and the Memphis area. I had the back row to myself.

Until I noticed some folks wearing sunglasses milling around early in the second quarter and somebody sat down a couple of chairs away with empties between us. Nobody else with them sat down.

He looked at me because I was probably staring a little stuck out a hand and said ""Hi I'm Elvis Presley."" I had already figured that out.

""No s###"" was the best I could come up with along with laughing. He (and his surrounding folks) all laughed thank goodness.

Not a single person I saw came up to him other than his group which wouldn't happen these days. For youngsters to imagine it combine Garth Brooks with Michael Jackson in popularity and you still aren't where he was in terms of drawing a crowd.

Nobody would book him at a stadium because of the security problems.

He had asked me where I was from and ""how in the hell Alabama was ahead 24-0 already?"" when he got there. It was probably unremarkable to him.

Elvis had been at the Pine Bluff Convention Center in the summer of 1976 (and was the first sell-out there ... it had opened that year) and a week or two later was at Barton Coliseum in Little Rock. Went to both.

Right after halftime he got up to leave said ""good to meet you man"" and was surrounded by his group and was gone.

In case you were wondering the Crimson Tide won the game 38-6. They played on New Year's Day the next five straight years winning Bryant's last two national championships including a 24-9 drubbing of Arkansas in the 1980 Sugar Bowl. The Hogs still haven't tackled Major Oglivie.

In August after that Elvis left the building for good.

The COVID-19 pandemic — and its seemingly never-ending aftermath — has been a nightmare for commercial landlords of many different stripes particularly those with significant holdings in retail and traditional office properties.

But in the Boulder Valley and Northern Colorado — especially along the U.S. Highway 36 corridor connecting Denver Broomfield and Boulder — life-sciences and biotechnology companies with a thus-far unquenchable thirst for flex-industrial square footage have kept brokers and builders busy. And with 2023 upon us there’s no sign of a slowdown on the horizon.

While office users who have largely remained in work-from-home or hybrid mode leaving their workplaces underused life-sciences companies are champing at the bit for additional space in the Boulder Valley a market that’s rapidly becoming one of the industry’s leading regions.

“It’s been a very active second half of 2022” BioMed Realty LLC president of West Coast markets Jon Bergschneider told BizWest in an interview this month.

In the Boulder Valley region “you’ve got a great convergence of public and private industry academic [institutions] like the University [of Colorado] venture capital” that combine to spur the growth of the local life-sciences industry along with the real estate development necessary to support that growth Bergschneider said. “It’s a multi-piston engine.”

All told that biotech-related development accounts for “approximately 2.5 million to 3 million square feet of construction … underway or in the pipeline along the Boulder/Denver corridor” according to a recent report from Boulder-based commercial real estate brokerage Dean Callan & Co. When you add proposed projects that have not been fully permitted that square footage total is much higher.

“While office leasing has slowed dramatically life science development is full steam ahead” the report said. New development activity “will be a big boost to attracting more companies to our market and create even more demand for the [research and development] product Boulder provides.”

The biotech explosion in and around Boulder over the last half-decade or so comes as little surprise to local players who have long understood the region to be a technology powerhouse that punches well above its weight.

Erik Abrahamson a senior vice president with CBRE said during BizWest’s Boulder Valley Real Estate Conference held last month that “life science follows tech. We’ve got the tech.”

He said the University of Colorado is producing the “best in the world” graduates in bioscience. Smaller companies have been swallowed up by larger players spreading the seeds of capital and talent to foster new generations of biotech startups.

Mike Ruhl vice president of leasing for BioMed compared the Boulder area to “to what Seattle was 10-15 years ago.”

BioMed which this year bought a roughly 1 million-square-foot portfolio in Flatirons Park for $625 million — the largest real estate deal in Colorado history “look[s] for highly educated markets an influx of venture capital and places with tech already here” he said.

Despite the excitement the biotech industry is not of course entirely without its recent hiccups.

For example Inscripta Inc. a genomic-editing platform born out of the University of Colorado is shuttering its Boulder research and development hub and headquarters in January resulting in mass layoffs for employees at the site.

Meanwhile Clovis Oncology Inc. (Nasdaq: CLVS) defaulted on a loan agreement this month and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

“At a high level there have certainly been some macro issues that face everybody no matter what geography or industry you’re in” Bergschneider said. Those issues unsurprisingly relate mainly to interest rates volatility in capital markets supply-chain disruptions and a prolonged period of tightness in the labor market.

Macroeconomics haven’t slammed the brakes on local biotech developments but they are likely to make things more expensive both for builders and tenants.

“As [development costs] continue to rise rents need to rise in lockstep in order for developments to pencil and for there to be economically acceptable returns for landlords” Bergschneider said.

Still “life-sciences on the whole and Boulder on the whole has held on really well” he said. “We still see a tremendous amount of demand and great fundamentals.”

Observers across organizations remain quite bullish on the overall outlook for the local sector with access to top talent often cited as a particularly attractive asset.

“For me talent is everything. You grow through talent and creating great technology is really all about talent” Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. president Damaris Mills told BizWest this week. “We see Boulder as being this central U.S. hub for a lot of [biotechnology] talent — and increasingly so.”

Iowa-based IDT entered the local biotechnology sphere this month with the $48 million purchase of technology developed by and facilities formerly occupied by Boulder-born ArcherDX Inc. Archer producer of genetic assays for cancer patients was previously acquired in 2020 for $1.4 by California genetics-testing company Invitae Corp. (NYSE: NVTA) which is now facing significant financial turmoil.

“We’re excited about the site and we’re really excited about the talent that’s here on the team and in the broader community” Mills said.

Here are some highlights of life-sciences real estate projects planned in progress or recently completed in that broader Boulder Valley and Northern Colorado community:

BioMed purchased Flatiron Park with the express purpose of improving its status as a regional hub for biotech R&D.

“At acquisition about 25% of the park was life-sciences. Our goal is to convert that up to about 50% life-sciences” Bergschneider said. “We’ve always envisioned a multi-faceted ownership model in which we’re appealing both to life-sciences and technology [tenants].”

The conversion process is underway and is expected to take a handful of years to complete.

Meanwhile on nearby Walnut Street Conscience Bay Co. LLC is developing West Meadows a 112423-square-foot building that the company said represents a “significant opportunity for a cutting edge two-story science and technology development.”

Broomfield

Dallas-based investor and developer Mohr Capital LLC is dipping its first toe in the market with plans to build a four-building speculative campus on a vacant parcel next to the Oracle Corp. operation in Broomfield’s Interlocken business park.

“They’ve been looking to get into the market here for a while” said WK Real Estate (Wright-Kingdom Inc.) broker Andrew Freeman who along with representatives from commercial brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (NYSE:JLL) is marketing the project.

Mohr’s plan Freeman told BizWest last month is to build four basically identical “life-science slash industrial-flex buildings” that will total nearly 400000 square feet.

Nearby another Dallas developer Lincoln Property Co. is developing a large new office research and development and light-manufacturing campus in Interlocken with an eye toward biotech tenants.

The project known as CoRE – Colorado Research Exchange will be built at 235 Interlocken Blvd. and is planned to total about 450000 square feet spread across four buildings that will range from about 16000 square feet for the development’s amenities center to nearly 200000 square feet for the largest office building.

Louisville

Redtail Ridge represents a major question mark for Louisville’s life-sciences future.

The project which for years has proved difficult to push across the regulatory finish line could eventually house a 2.6 million-square-foot commercial-only development with a focus on biotechnology facilities on the roughly 400-acre long-vacant former Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) site off U.S. 36.

However residents and Louisville officials have been thus far unwilling to grant the approvals necessary for Denver-based developer Brue Baukol Capital Partners LLC and partner Sterling Bay LLC to break ground.

Superior

Another controversial life-sciences proposal in the eastern portion of Boulder County is the Coal Creek Innovation Campus in Superior which could add more than 1200 jobs including many in the biotech sector.

The project planned by Superior master builder RC (Ranch Capital) Superior LLC by San Diego health care real estate developer PMB LLC calls for the construction of four buildings totaling more than 366000 square feet.

Coal Creek was approved in September on a controversial split vote of Superior’s Board of Trustees. Residents cried foul petitioned and sued and last month the board repealed its approval leaving the project in development purgatory.

Lafayette

Construction began in 2021 at the site of the new Medtronic corporate campus just south of the SCL Health Good Samaritan Medical Center in Lafayette. Lucas High/BizWest.



Redtail Ridge partner Sterling Bay is transforming a Lafayette Corporate Campus office building formerly leased to Ball Corp. (NYSE: BLL) into a speculative flex space geared toward biotechnology tenants.

The company which bought the Campus Drive property as part of a $74.5 million portfolio acquisition deal in 2021 with developer Etkin Johnson Real Estate Partners intends a roughly 50-50 split between office and laboratory uses for the roughly 52000-square-foot space.

The lab space will be geared toward research and development uses rather than light manufacturing such as pharmaceutical or medical-device production.

Just next door to the Lafayette Corporate Campus Medtronic Inc. is putting the finishing touches on its medical-device research and development hub.

The company will soon consolidate its local business into 400000 square feet of new office and laboratory space spread across two five-story buildings. Of that 60000 square feet will be dedicated to research and development a 10000-square-foot increase over Medtronic’s current R&D footprint in the region.

Frederick

One of the region’s most significant life-science projects isn’t in the Boulder Valley but just a few miles to the north in Frederick.

It’s there that Agilent Technologies Inc. is planning a major expansion at its manufacturing hub.

The project which state officials estimate could cost upward of $784 million could could nearly double Agilent’s Colorado workforce and nearly quadruple its physical footprint in Frederick.

The Santa Clara California-headquartered Agilent began developing its 130000-square-foot manufacturing facility on 20 acres in the Eagle Business Park adjacent to Interstate 25 in 2016.

The company — which according to its website “provides laboratories worldwide with instruments services consumables applications and expertise enabling customers to gain the insights they seek” — also has existing operations in Boulder. All told Agilent employs about 520 workers in Colorado Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade documents show.

“Agilent is planning to expand its existing facility located at the northwest corner of Tipple Parkway [and] Eagle Boulevard” according to a traffic analysis report provided to Frederick planners. “The expansion project is anticipated to add 310000 square feet of manufacturing building 61000 square feet of associated office uses 42000 square feet of warehouse/central utility plant 2000 square feet of drum storage expansion and 10000 square feet of tank farm.”

The expansion which planning documents show is expected to be complete by the end of 2024 would “accommodate approximately 465 additional employees for the Agilent facility.”

Agilent much like it did when the existing Frederick operation was built has turned to public bodies to help subsidize the project. The company expects to receive more than $10 million in incentives for the Northern Colorado expansion.

Loveland

Last year Beckman Coulter Life Sciences began expanding its presence in Loveland with the construction of a new $9 million office at Etkin Johnson Real Estate Partners’ Axis 25 development.

The 95114-square-foot building expected to allow the company to hire 85 more local workers is scheduled for completion in 2024.

“We have been on a rapid growth journey in Loveland since 2018 when we started with nearly three dozen employees” Beckman Coulter Life Sciences president Greg Milosevich said last year in a prepared statement. “Our strong business needs required us to ramp up quickly last year and we’re proud that despite the economic downturn in 2020 we were able to create more than 60 high-paying jobs in Loveland.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2l0eWxpZmUub3JnLzIwMjIvMTIvMjUvbmV3LXllYXJzLWV2ZS1pbi10aW1lcy1zcXVhcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Year’s Eve in Times Square,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='thecitylife.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/12/25/new-years-eve-in-times-square/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226E90130>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2l0eWxpZmUub3JnLzIwMjIvMTIvMjUvbmV3LXllYXJzLWV2ZS1pbi10aW1lcy1zcXVhcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

For Goff there was added insult in the Lions’ 37-23 loss to the Panthers. The veteran quarterback didn’t like Bank of America Stadium’s field conditions.

""I thought the field conditions were below NFL level standard specifically pregame"" Goff told reporters after the game via the team’s website. ""I don’t know what the deal is here but they need to figure out a way for the turf to not feel like cement.""

Goff was 25-of-42 with 355 passing yards and three touchdown passes. But he was sacked twice and the Panthers delivered seven QB hits.

Field conditions in NFL stadiums have been a topic of conversation. Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte isn’t he only field that’s been blamed for how tough the field is. MetLife Stadium was blamed for multiple knee injuries this season with New York Giants wide receiver Sterling Shepard suffering a torn ACL on a non-contact injury. Allianz Arena in Germany also took some flak.

Investors yanked a record amount of money from stocks last week as part of a financial strategy that lowers tax bills Bank of America said Friday.

Outflows from equities boomed to $41.9 billion the largest ever amount for ""tax-loss harvesting"" said the investment firm said in its weekly Flow Show note the last one to close out a bruising year for stocks.

Under tax-loss harvesting investors sell securities such as stocks ETFs and mutual funds at a loss and then use that loss to offset any capital gains.

There are benefits to harvesting losses even if an investor didn't have any gains as the losses can be used to offset income or future gains according to Fidelity.

BofA said investors in the past week pulled out $10 billion from bonds. They also took out $27.8 billion from passive equities and $17.2 billion from US value funds setting new records for each.

And investors reduced cash holdings by $59.5 billion the largest cut since February. Fund managers had ramped up cash levels in February and in March as they grew nervous about risks from Russia's war in Ukraine slowing global growth and elevated inflation.

Investors preparing for the upcoming tax season were winding down what's set to be a losing year for US stocks. The S&P 500 is staring at a nearly 20% slide and the Nasdaq Composite home to large-cap technology stocks is off by more than 30%.

""I thought the field conditions were below NFL level standard"" Lions quarterback Jared Goff said. “Specifically pregame. I know it warmed up a little as the game went on.

""I don’t know what the deal is here but they need to figure out a way to make the turf not feel like cement.""

Panthers players also have complained this season about the artificial turf at their home stadium.

“It’s probably going to take all of us to stop going to practice until we get grass’’ Panthers linebacker Shaq Thompson told the Associated Press for a story published Nov. 15. “I mean they make enough money off of us to maintain grass. I hate to say this but with our last owner (Jerry Richardson) we had grass. …Listen to your players. We want grass.’’

Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff (16) runs in the fourth quarter at Bank of America Stadium.

Although Goff objected to the field conditions he still managed to throw for 355 yards and three touchdowns on 25-of-42 passing with no interceptions.

Told it was the coldest home game in Bank of America Stadium history Goff remarked of the field “It got better as the game went on. But pregame it was in no condition to be played on. I’m happy guys came out of this one relatively injury free.’’

This is due to some of its recent policies.

First it was the announcement of the naira redesign and then there was the limits placed on cash withdrawals. Just this week the CBN also announced an upward review of the earlier limits placed on cash withdrawals. This again got people talking on social media.

As a Deputy Governor at the apex Bank Aishah Ahmad is not far from the trending discussions as well. Recently she had to represent CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele before a senate hearing a development that got her name trending.

This week’s profile will be on the woman who is in charge of leading the effort to promote a sound financial system in the country.

Birth and education: A native of Niger State Aishah Ahmad was born in Lagos sometime in the 1970s. She attended St. Catherine’s Primary School Surulere Lagos and Zarumai Primary School Minna Niger State before heading on to Federal Government Girls’ College Bida for secondary schooling.

Aishah went on to graduate with a BSc degree in Accounting from the University of Abuja and obtained an MBA (Finance) from the University of Lagos and an M.Sc. Finance and Management from the Cranﬁeld School of Management (UK). She is a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) and she holds the prestigious Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation.

Her career trajectory: Ahmad has had what one might call a very rich career in the banking and finance industry for over two decades even before she joined the apex bank. Right before joining CBN she was in retail banking at Diamond Bank Plc. She was also the Head of Consumer and Privilege Banking a Deputy General Manager and the Head of the Retail Financial Services Division overseeing Privilege Banking Consumer Banking Group Retail Assets Cards and Customer Engagement & Insight for about four years.

Before Diamond Bank Aishah Ahmad worked with Stanbic IBTC Holdings (a member of Standard Bank Group SA) between 2009 and 2014 holding different critical positions like Head Private Client Services and Deputy Head Private Client Services and Head High Net-worth Individuals.

Her two decades of banking experience also include Zenith Capital Limited where she was Head of Business Development Bank of New York Mellon (UK) Synesix Financial Limited (UK) and Zenith Bank Plc where she was Head Retail Banking Unit.

She equally worked with NAL Bank Plc as Head of Private Banking; as well as the First Interstate Bank Plc as Executive Assistant Treasury Group Manstructs Group Nigeria Limited as Group Accountant and Z. O. Ososanya & Co.

Appointment as CBN Deputy Governor: By the time the CBN announcement came stakeholders in the industry could well agree that she had a well-rounded background in the space and was prepared to assume the role. In 2018 she succeeded two-time Acting Governor of the Central Bank and Deputy Governor Dr Sarah Alade who retired in March of the same year.

Her profile on the CBN board profile page says that as Deputy Governor in charge of Financial System Stability she is responsible for leading the effort to promote a sound financial system in Nigeria. Aishah Ahmad is a member of the Governing Board and Committee of Governors at the CBN and Chairman of the Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC) – a not-for-profit organization offering training consulting and research services for the financial services sector.

Other roles and engagements: As one who has achieved impressive success in her career path it naturally follows that Ahmad would now become a role model of some sort to other women. She was the former Chairperson of Women in Business and Public Service (WIMBIZ); a leading women-focused NGO in Sub-Saharan Africa. Aishah is a member of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Association and the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) Association.",,,

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in a tweet shared guidelines to ensure the power grid remains stable as power outage continues. They have asked businesses and the public to help reduce electric power usage without sacrificing safety.TVA and local power companies are also taking steps to temporarily reduce power supplies to certain local areas which may create intermittent power outages in homes and businesses. The authority is actively working with local power companies to minimize the duration of outages. In the tweet they also mentioned these are necessary precautions to prevent far greater power interruptions which might affect the entire area.Until the power has stabilized intermittent power outages for about 10 minutes every 90 minutes to 2 hours can be expected said NES.Jack Baxter vice president NES operations said TVA’s power generation system is being challenged by the swift-moving cold front that moved into the area overnight. The duration of these dangerously low temperatures also plays a part in system performance. He further added that their ability to proactively manage the grid during this time will help them continue to provide safe and reliable power to Middle Tennessee.NES also reported on Friday morning that four of their utility poles were damaged or broken because of Thursday night’s freezing precipitation and high winds. The extreme cold conditions damaged other equipment as well. Early Friday morning 1600 customers were without power but by 10 a.m. the number jumped to 24000. The authorities advised those who have no access to a generator to dress in layers and bundle in blankets to preserve their body heat.

But she also recalls how much better she felt when she received a hand-knitted stocking filled with donated items for her and her newborn Will who arrived three months premature via emergency caesarean section.

The stocking gift part of a community initiative called the Kamloops NICU Empathy Movement made a huge difference Allen said.

""It was such a ray of sunshine during such a dark uncertain time for our family"" she told CBC about her experience in late 2019 when she was also worried about her husband Bill Shelley who had broken 17 bones in a car accident a few weeks earlier.

""It was just something that put a smile on my face when there wasn't a whole lot to smile about.""

The Kamloops NICU Empathy Movement started by another local mom Melinda Baxter is now in its fifth year and the stockings are continuing to bring a bit of comfort to new parents who are dealing with difficult circumstances.

NICU nurses at the hospital started giving out this year's stockings — 15 in total — on Dec. 8.

The stocking Allen received in 2019 contained booties and other clothing items for Will as well as tea and a journal for her. It also contained snacks a coffee mug and a gift certificate for a photo shoot.

She found the stocking gift so uplifting that she got involved the next year and has been donating items ever since.

""Myself and my family have contributed to the stockings the best we can. It's just a really nice thing to do for people who are going through such a really awful time"" said Allen whose son was in the intensive care unit for about a month but is ""wonderful"" now.

""You would never be able to tell that he was so premature"" Allen said. ""He's a smart happy little guy.""

'Connection and community'

Baxter says she started the Kamloops NICU Empathy Movement in 2018 and has since filled 95 stockings for NICU families.

The stockings are knitted each year by the same Kamloops woman — who prefers to remain unnamed — and Baxter fills them with items donated from the community.

She also includes a letter ""rooted in empathy with the intent of holding space for them and their challenging journey.""

Baxter says the idea for the stockings came out of an act of kindness she experienced while her daughter Orianna was in Royal Inland's NICU after being born six weeks premature in December 2017.

Another family in the unit gave everyone Christmas ornaments that said ""Preemie Power 2017"" and that inspired Baxter to do something of her own.

""No one goes in planning to have a baby in the NICU"" Baxter said on CBC's Daybreak Kamloops. ""So feeling that connection and community was so powerful.""

Baxter brings the stockings to the Royal Inland NICU each year on Orianna's birthday or as close to it as possible. The stockings sit in quarantine for about a week before staff hand them out.

Baxter said the initiative has become an important part of her own life and healing journey.

""It sure feels great to be a part of it"" she said. ""And to deliver them is such a beautiful experience.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3VrL2Zvcm1lci1kaXNuZXktc3Rhci1vcmxhbmRvLWJyb3duLWdldHMtYXJyZXN0ZWQtb24tZG9tZXN0aWMtdmlvbGVuY2UtY2hhcmdlcy1pbi1vaGlvL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NDY0NTQ3LmNtc9IBogFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3VrL2Zvcm1lci1kaXNuZXktc3Rhci1vcmxhbmRvLWJyb3duLWdldHMtYXJyZXN0ZWQtb24tZG9tZXN0aWMtdmlvbGVuY2UtY2hhcmdlcy1pbi1vaGlvL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjQ2NDU0Ny5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Disney star Orlando Brown gets arrested on domestic violence charges in Ohio,"FAQs:

For Berkshire Hathaway chief Warren Buffett the 2022 bear market was one big Black Friday sale -- and the Oracle of Omaha went on a shopping spree.

Every quarter institutional investment managers who control more than $100 million in assets are required to submit reports called 13-F filings with the SEC. And the three 13-F filings that Berkshire submitted in 2022 show that this was one of the busiest and most consequential years in the company's history.

Here's a look at the biggest buys and sells that defined a dramatic year of trading for the world's most celebrated investor.

Occidental Petroleum (OXY)

Buffett entered 2022 without a single share of OXY but his Q3 filings show that Berkshire now owns 194351650 shares -- 4% of the firm's portfolio. He started with a $7.74 billion purchase in Q1 and never stopped buying. It was part of a historical dive into energy for Buffett whose famous powers of prognostication led him to buy big in a year that saw record-high gas prices and historic profits for big oil.

Chevron (CVX)

Buffett's second major energy play was Chevron. In the closing quarter of 2021 Berkshire held 38245036 shares but by Q3 2022 it was up to 165359318 for a gain of 127114282. Chevron now makes up 8% of Berkshire's portfolio. According to Motley Fool energy had accounted for less than 9% of Buffett's holdings for the entire 21st century. Now Chevron and Occidental make up 12.1% of the firm's portfolio.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)

Buffett has long been sweet on Apple which still makes up more than 40% of his portfolio but Apple is an outlier. Berkshire has never been big on tech but that all changed in 2022. TSM is a manufacturing company but it's the exclusive producer of the silicon chips that Apple uses to power its devices.

Buffett bought 60060880 shares in the third quarter at a cost of $4.11 billion.

Activision Blizzard (ATVI)

Buffett furthered his expansion into tech with 45483745 shares of gaming company Activision Blizzard. The 14658121 shares he owned in Q4 of 2021 ballooned to 60141866 by the time Berkshire filed in Q3 report in 2022. It now owns $4.47 billion worth -- 1.5% of the firm's combined holdings. Buffett had owned even more earlier in the year but he sold some in the third quarter.

Paramount Global (PARA)

Paramount added millions of subscribers to its streaming services in 2022 and hit box office gold with ""Top Gun: Maverick."" Buffett became a believer adding PARA to Berkshire's portfolio in the form of roughly 69 million shares in Q1. He brought it up to around 78 million in Q2 and finally to 91216510 in Q3 worth $1.74 billion.

U.S. Bancorp (USB)

Buffett did plenty of selling in 2022 as well. After dumping what was left of Berkshire's Wells Fargo holdings U.S. Bancorp became the Oracle's longest-held bank stock -- but he might be falling out of love.

Buffett owned 126417887 shares of USB in Q4 2021 but by the time the third quarter of 2022 rolled around it was down to 77788214.

Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK)

USB isn't the only bank stock that had a run-in with Buffett's ax in 2022. He also thinned out his holdings of Bank of New York Mellon Corp slimming down from 72357453 shares at the end of 2021 to 62210878 in Q3 2022. He's still into the stock for $2.4 billion but BK now comprises less than 1% of Berkshire's holdings.

Store Capital Corp (STOR)

Buffett offloaded his entire STOR holdings in the third quarter dumping 6928413 shares of the REIT that were worth about $181 million. According to US News and World Report STOR owns single-tenant properties like gyms movie theaters restaurants and other businesses that were hit hard during the pandemic. Buffett first bought into the company in 2017.

General Motors (GM)

Buffett sold exactly 10 million shares of GM taking his holdings from 60 million at the end of 2021 to 50 million in the third quarter of 2022 with some smaller buying and selling taking place in the quarters in between. His stake went from $3.52 billion accounting for 1.7% of Berkshire's portfolio to $1.6 billion which now represents 0.5% of his holdings.

Kroger (KR)

Buffett also trimmed his stake in the grocery giant Kroger from 61412910 shares at the end of 2021 to 50268823 in the third quarter of this year. He chipped away at Kroger throughout the year selling millions of shares in the first second and third quarters. Berkshire now owns about $2.2 billion worth of KR.

It might not seem like it at the moment but 2022 has been a blessing in disguise for long-term investors.

Even though the 2022 bear market has delivered some painful unrealized losses over a short time frame the stock market has demonstrated time and again that it increases in value over the long run. This makes every correction crash and bear market an opportune time to pounce.

Time can be an especially strong ally for investors when they hold stakes in game-changing businesses. What follows are five surefire stocks that can help build generational wealth over the next 20 years.

Visa

Let's get one thing straight: Large-cap stocks can still deliver big-time returns. One such winner that can keep on winning for its shareholders is payment processor Visa (V 0.79%).

In terms of credit card network market share by purchase volume Visa is in a class of its own in the United States. It held a 54% share in 2020 and was the only one of the four major U.S. payment processors to substantially expand its market share following the Great Recession (2007-2009).

However there's more to Visa than just sitting in the pole position in the No. 1 market for consumption in the world. With most global transactions still being facilitated with cash Visa can organically enter underbanked markets as well as use its deep pockets to make acquisitions in order to expand its reach. It did this in 2016 with the purchase of Visa Europe.

But what makes Visa truly rock-solid is its laser focus on payment processing. Although some of its processing peers act as lenders Visa has chosen not to. This decision means it avoids loan loss responsibility when inevitable recessions arise. Not having to set aside asset reserves to cover potential loan losses is a powerful tool that keeps Visa's margins juiced and allows it to rebound from economic downturns quicker than most financial stocks.

CrowdStrike Holdings

A second game-changing stock with the ability to make patient investors a whole lot richer over the next two decades is cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 0.89%).

From a macro perspective cybersecurity has shifted from an optional service to an absolute necessity for businesses of all sizes. The COVID-19 pandemic taught businesses the importance of having an online presence and they've responded by moving their data online and into the cloud. As time passes the onus of protecting this data falls evermore onto the laps of third-party providers like CrowdStrike.

While its new customer growth has been impressive -- from 450 subscribers to 21146 in under six years -- what's considerably more important is the organic growth from existing customers. Whereas only a single-digit percentage of subscribers purchased at least four cloud-module subscriptions six years ago 60% of its 21146 clients have purchased at least five cloud-module subscriptions as of the recent quarter. Add-on subscription sales is CrowdStrike's key to jaw-dropping profit growth.

Credit is also due to the company's end-user security platform known as Falcon. This is a platform that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to become more efficient at spotting and responding to potential threats. It's clearly doing its job as evidenced by CrowdStrike's slow but steady climb in gross retention.

Nio

The third surefire stock with generational wealth-building potential over a 20-year time frame is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NIO -4.88%).

Similar to CrowdStrike there's a macro thesis at play that very much favors Nio (and its peers). Since most developed countries want to reduce their carbon footprint promoting EVs and other clean-energy modes of transportation is a no-brainer solution. Given that China is the No. 1 auto market in the world we could be talking about a multidecade vehicle-replacement cycle that drives above-average growth for Nio.

For its part Nio has responded by introducing more than a half-dozen models of varying price points. The ET7 and ET5 sedans which respectively began deliveries in late March and September of this year have been especially popular. Nearly 44% of Nio's record 14178 EV deliveries in November were sedans. Look for this model diversification to really drive delivery and sales growth for the company.

Nio also has a good chance to retain the loyalty of its early EV buyers thanks to its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) subscription. Although enrollment in BaaS nets buyers a discount on the purchase price of a Nio EV it more importantly allows Nio to receive high-margin recurring revenue from buyers. This should help keep them loyal to the Nio brand.

Fiverr International

A fourth phenomenal company that's fully capable of building generational wealth in 20 years is gig economy up-and-comer Fiverr International (FVRR 4.95%).

Fiverr operates an online marketplace for freelancers that provides three distinct tailwinds for the company. To begin with the pandemic has resulted in more people than ever working remotely. This looks to be a permanent labor force shift which would favor Fiverr's online-services marketplace model.

Second Fiverr's online marketplace brings differentiation to the table that buyers of freelancer services clearly appreciate. Specifically Fiverr's freelancer marketplace presents jobs at an all-inclusive price as opposed to the hourly rates found on competing online-service marketplaces. Considering that both the aggregate number of buyers on Fiverr and spend per buyer have continued to climb the takeaway is that price transparency is incredibly important.

And third Fiverr's take-rate is unmatched. By ""take-rate"" I'm talking about the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform that it gets to keep. Fiverr's take-rate hit an all-time high of 30% in the third quarter. The company has consistently grown its freelancer and buyer community despite netting a larger percentage of each deal over time. That's a recipe for substantial long-term growth.

Berkshire Hathaway

The fifth and final surefire stock that can build generational wealth in 20 years is none other than conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%).

While Berkshire Hathaway isn't exactly a household name its billionaire CEO for the past 57 years certainly is. Since taking the reins in 1965 Warren Buffett has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an average annual return of 20.1% through Dec. 31 2021. At this rate of return shareholders have been doubling their money on average every 3.6 years for more than a half-century.

One of the reasons Berkshire Hathaway is such a successful company is because Warren Buffett and his investment team packed the investment portfolio with cyclical stocks. The Oracle of Omaha is well aware that timing the stock market is impossible. Instead he invests in businesses that can take advantage of long-winded periods of expansion. Ultimately economic expansions last considerably longer than recessions/contractions.

The other key factor to Berkshire's outperformance is dividend stocks. More than 30 of the roughly four dozen securities held in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio offer a payout. All told Buffett's company is in line to collect more than $6 billion in dividend income in 2023. Dividend stocks have a rich history of outperforming their non-paying peers which makes them a smart choice for an investor with a long-term mindset like Warren Buffett.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9iYW5rLWhvdXJzLWNocmlzdG1hcy1ldmUtMjAyMi1vcGVuLWNsb3NlZC1iYW5rLW9mLWFtZXJpY2Etd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tY2hhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank hours on Christmas Eve 2022: Bank of America Chase Wells Fargo and more,"Christmas closures are going to last longer than usual this year.

In a Tuesday vote Alameda County home to Oakland and Berkeley passed a package of tenant protection ordinances including the Fair Chance Ordinance that prohibits landlords from performing criminal background checks when screening rental applicants the San Francisco Chronicle reported. All but one of the five county supervisors voted in favor of the ordinance with the fifth abstaining according to the outlet.

Other elements of the ordinance include a ban on landlords requiring that tenants disclose previous arrests and convictions and forbids advertising that discourages applicants with criminal backgrounds. The ordinance also states that tenants’ family members must also be allowed to live in rental units regardless of criminal history.

The ordinance goes into effect on April 30 when the county’s COVID-era eviction moratorium expires. It only applies to the unincorporated areas of the county which includes Cherryland Castro Valley Ashland Sunol and San Lorenzo. Oakland and Berkeley have their own fair housing policies that ban criminal background checks.

Proponents say fair chance policies help reduce homelessness recidivism and family separation according to the outlet. Alameda County reported that 73 percent of residents in Oakland’s homeless encampments are formerly incarcerated.

The other two ordinances passed in the tenant protection package are the Just Cause for Eviction Ordinance which governs when and how a tenant can be evicted and the Rental Registry Ordinance that establishes a registry of all rental units in the county’s jurisdiction.

In passing the background check ban Alameda County joins a wave of U.S. cities that have passed similar fair chance policies. Nearby Richmond passed such a law in 2016. Portland and Seattle also have similar laws on the books.

Landlords oppose banning criminal background checks which they say strips them of control in the application process and increases their liability. A landlord group managed to kill such a ban in New York City last year but the City Council revived talks on such a policy in August.

You can find TVs home goods travel clothing and decor for steep discounts if you know where to look. Tap or click here for the five safest ways to pay shop and send money online.

If you didn’t receive the following for the holidays be on the lookout starting Dec. 26. We hunted down some of the best items you can save money on soon.

1. 4K TVs

Don’t worry if you missed out on Black Friday TV deals. Retailers offer arguably better deals on higher-quality sets (instead of cheap doorbuster ones) in the lead-up to the Super Bowl. Start searching around mid-January to maximize your options and don’t forget to ensure your on-time delivery if you order online.

Statista data says about 44% of American households with TVs use 4K-capable sets. Buy one for yourself and you’ll find out why the rich graphics are worth the price tag.

When the Big Game rolls around you tend to see related sales at Best Buy Walmart and warehouse retailers like Costco and Sam’s Club. Amazon tends to be pretty aggressive about price matching so compare prices before you buy.

2. Bed and bath items

The retail tradition of January “White Sales” — sales on sheets and towels — is a long one stretching back about a century. While retailers may not use that exact terminology when advertising their deals they throw home goods sales from early to mid-January.

Traditional department stores and online home goods retailers like Wayfair and Overstock will throw bed and bath sales during this time.

3. Exercise equipment and fitness trackers

At-home fitness equipment reliably goes on sale in early January to attract resolution-makers. Check out specific brands (NordicTrack Bowflex) as well as Amazon.

RELATED: Man credits Apple Watch’s EKG alerts with saving his life

Fitness trackers are another smart January fitness buy. We’ve seen Fitbit discounts for as much as 30% off from JCPenney Dick’s Sporting Goods Macy’s and others during this timeframe.

4. Winter clothing and coats

Winter is still in full effect right after Christmas and it’s a great time to buy heavier clothing and coats. Stores start stocking spring styles as early as February so they’ll begin to mark down cold-weather items in the new year to make way.

5. Mattresses

Mattress retailers tend to throw mattress sales whenever consumers have an extra day off work. Not only do brick-and-mortar stores get in on the action but online retailers do. Be sure to check out Bear Casper Purple Eight Sleep and similar options.

If you’re in the market for a new mattress note that your options have grown increasingly tech-savvy with features such as individual temperature control on each side as well as integration with sleep-tracking apps.

6. Anything holiday-related

Start shopping for everything festive starting on Dec. 26. This includes artificial trees string lights ornaments ugly Christmas sweaters and Christmas crafting supplies. If you don’t mind holiday packaging it’s also a great time to pick up chocolates popcorn and makeup palettes designed for gifting."

The commercial fiber platform could also revolutionize the industry’s business model by operating as an open-access platform.

The venture plans to bring advanced fiber access technologies to internet service providers and businesses across the U.S. AT&T said in an announcement of the deal yesterday.

The impact on communities would be beneficial the telecom giant says as the new venture seeks to bolster the country’s digital infrastructure and ultimately lead to greater choice and affordability for customers.

“Now more than ever people are recognizing that connecting changes everything” said John Stankey CEO of AT&T in a statement. “The Gigapower joint venture offers customers and communities outside of our traditional service areas the social and economic benefits of world-class technology and access to all the internet has to offer.”

Bridging the “digital divide” with fiber

The expansion of broadband access can build more bridges across the so-called “digital divide.”

Mark Florian global head of diversified infrastructure at BlackRock shared his enthusiasm for the joint venture: “With Gigapower’s fiber infrastructure designed as a commercial open-access platform we can more efficiently connect communities throughout the United States with dependable broadband services—helping bridge the digital divide.”

Florian who is managing director and head of BlackRock Global Infrastructure Funds started the BGIF franchise in 2008.

BlackRock will support Gigapower’s fiber deployment plans and shared infrastructure business model and AT&T plans to leverage its nationwide wireless sales capabilities. Together the companies say the partnership is poised to drive innovation create jobs and stimulate economic growth in the communities it connects.

Coinbase which went public in April 2021 has hit several all-time lows this month and is down roughly 86% on the year. The price of bitcoin has plummeted 65% in 2022.

Some analysts have said while FTX’s bankruptcy is a short-term negative for crypto companies like Coinbase which currently relies on retail traders it could benefit the exchange in the long term.

“To the extent [the FTX crash] pushes people away from cryptocurrency in general it just leads to a smaller market and less revenue for them” Morningstar Analyst Michael Miller told Blockworks. “That’s really been their big problem.”

The flip side Miller said is the cryptocurrency exchange industry is less competitive today than it was six months ago.

“Right now the overall market size does not compensate them for the larger market share” he said of Coinbase. “But the hope [is] if cryptocurrency does recover they are in a strong competitive position considering what’s happened.”

Bullish or bearish?

Dan Weiskopf co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) said Coinbase — with about $5 billion in cash on the books and about $3 billion in low-cost debt — is set to be “a survivor.”

“The question is what it will look like on the other side” he told Blockworks. “Clearly…its business model has to evolve and they cannot afford to lose $500 million a quarter.”

Coinbase reported a net loss of $545 million during the third quarter. The company’s transaction revenues of $366 million were down 44% from the prior quarter. Revenue from subscription and services increased 43% quarter over quarter to $211 million mainly driven by higher-interest income.

BLOK co-portfolio manager Michael Venuto told Blockworks last week that he is keeping his eye on Coinbase in 2023.

“Until there are some signs that the crypto winter is coming to an end it’s too early for us to allocate more to it” he said of Coinbase at the time. “There’s potentially more pain even though we know long-term they’re going to benefit.”

Fund manager Ark Invest though has been upping its positions in Coinbase amid the latest crypto carnage. Ark Research Director Frank Downing said Coinbase is set to be “a share gainer” in the space over the long term as trust flows to more regulated exchanges.

Exchanges indeed have tried to reassure investors following FTX’s crash through various transparency efforts including proof-of-reserves reporting. Coinbase produces quarterly financial statements and auditing firm Deloitte certifies that its assets are backed one-to-one.

Some have argued these companies are falling short in their trust initiatives and certain auditors have halted activity in the space. Others say FTX’s demise validates the importance of self-custodying cryptoassets.

Coinbase revealed that from Oct. 1 2021 to Sept. 30 2022 law enforcement agencies made 12320 requests for customer account information and financial records — a 66% increase from the prior year.

“A strong case for self-custody” Sasha Hodder founder of Hodder Law Firm tweeted last week referring to the Coinbase stat.

The company said in a blog last week that it is also focused on “supercharging key building blocks for web3” such as its self-custody wallet NFT capabilities and developer tools. The post signals a continued push to be associated with more than just retail trading.

“We’ve made major investments in Coinbase Wallet because there is no web3 without self-custody” the blog states.

A Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment further.

Looking ahead

Weiskopf said he is anxious to see what comes of Coinbase’s partnership with BlackRock in 2023.

The crypto exchange revealed a partnership in August with the firm — the world’s largest asset manager with roughly $8 trillion in assets under management.

By connecting BlackRock’s investment platform Aladdin and Coinbase Prime the companies said they would provide crypto trading custody prime brokerage and reporting capabilities to clients of both Aladdin and Coinbase.

Many called the deal a significant one. Ark Invest models suggest the relationship could be a catalyst for bitcoin’s price to rise by up to $500000.

As for diversifying revenue streams Coinbase said in its third quarter shareholder letter that while it expects pressure on transaction revenue to persist into next year it seeks to continue growing its subscription and services products — a segment that includes staking and custody.

Coinbase began to support staking for Cardano in March and Solana in June. Mark Palmer a managing director and fintech analyst at BTIG previously told Blockworks the exchange is well positioned to be a beneficiary of increased institutional adoption of staking.

The exchange’s push within Web3 services likely won’t materially contribute to the company’s bottom line anytime soon Miller said.

“As Web3 does grow there’s opportunity there but that is really more over the medium or long term” he added. “For at least the near-term future it’s going to be pretty tightly tied to cryptocurrency markets.”

Coinbase’s stock price closed the week at $35.49. Miller said his fair value estimate for the company is $90.

“That does include a projection that cryptocurrency markets recover as that’s going to be the big long-term driver for Coinbase” he said. “Ultimately if bitcoin goes to zero that’s the fair value estimate for Coinbase.”

Googl e Doodles are temporary changes to the Google logo intended to commemorate holidays events achievements or notable historical figures. First Google Doodle commemorated the 1998 edition of the long-standing annual Burning Man festival in Black Rock City Nevada. It was a bit of a joke from Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to remind Googlers they would be out of the office for Burning Man. Since then the journey has continued. The Google Doodle has numerous relevant and interesting aspects that we would like to know more about. Here are five important and interesting aspects:

The Doodle team receives about 7000 submissions a year.

Each day hundreds of people email doodleproposa [email protected] with their ideas and Googlers pitch their concepts constantly. There is a dedicated Doodle team who represents different global countries. They provide information to the core team regarding what moments and milestones will resonate most on a local level. That helps them to choose which would be most appropriate. There are times when the selected doodles are not displayed everywhere. There are some that are specific to certain regions and countries.

The dedicated team published the 5000th Doodle in 2020

It celebrated Slovakia’s Freedom and Democracy Day the country’s annual holiday commemorating heroic efforts by local youth activists. The first Google Doodle honored the 1998 edition of the long-running annual Burning Man event in Black Rock City Nevada. It was a bit of a joke from Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to remind Googlers they would be out of the office for Burning Man. The journey from then continued so far.

There is a public archive for every doodle published so far

The website was launched in December 2011 (and it is undergoing a makeover in the near future). The archive provides information on each Doodle its topic and often the artist as well – there is also a section for interactive Doodles you can revisit. It is also possible to view the history of Doodles for a specific day.

The doodle team is always guided by a dedicated set of principles

A major one is that Doodles should aim to delight and surprise people as Jessica mentioned. Another key principle: Doodles are never dedicated to someone who’s still alive because person-focused Doodles are meant to honor someone’s lifetime achievements. Google typically abstains from referencing or celebrating religious holidays specifically in Doodles.

Doodles aren’t all always digital"

When The Mirage changed hands this week it marked the beginning-of-the-end for its iconic volcano attraction.

The sale also shed more light on a growing lucrative real estate trend on Las Vegas Boulevard: Casino landlords are collecting hefty rents.

MGM Resorts International announced Monday that it closed its nearly $1.1 billion cash sale of The Mirage’s operations to Hard Rock International which assumed control of the property as of 6 a.m. that day.

Also Monday Vici Properties which owns The Mirage’s real estate said it entered a lease with Hard Rock that calls for initial annual rent of $90 million.

Real estate ownership along Las Vegas Boulevard has dramatically changed in the past several years as casino resorts up and down the Strip are now leased to rent-collecting landlords. Vici is now by all appearances the biggest property owner in the famed corridor boasting 660 acres as of this spring.

As casino property ownership changed hands it resulted in little if any visible effect for customers. But landlords paid billions of dollars to own the huge hotels along the Strip — and lock sellers into high-priced leases.

Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon said casino operators who sell a property get “immediate funds” they can use to invest in other properties or businesses or pay down debt.

But he noted they are also obligated to pay rental rates that are structured to climb over time.

“It’s a fixed and rising expense” Beynon said.

It’s not cheap either.

Caesars Entertainment Inc. said in a regulatory filing that it expected to shell out more than $1 billion in lease payments in 2022. MGM Resorts disclosed that it was required as of Sept. 30 to make $1.9 billion in “cash rent payments” over the next 12 months.

Don’t feel too bad though as MGM in particular has made mountains of money selling its real estate in sale-leaseback deals.

It sold the Bellagio for $4.2 billion in cash to financial giant Blackstone in 2019 and raked in $2.4 billion in cash from the 2020 sale of MGM Grand as part of a deal that also involved Mandalay Bay.

Last year MGM paid more than $2 billion for full ownership of Aria and Vdara — and then sold the towering resorts to Blackstone for nearly $3.9 billion in cash.

MGM still operates all of those properties.

Vici a Caesars spinoff vastly expanded its holdings on the Strip with the $17.2 billion buyout of MGM’s real estate spinoff. As part of the deal which closed this spring it acquired several MGM-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

Hard Rock owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida announced in December 2021 that it was buying The Mirage’s operations. It has since outlined plans to gut the resort and expand its casino floor convention space and theater.

It’s also looking to build a guitar-shaped hotel tower on the site of the outdoor volcano attraction an idea it first floated a year ago.

It could get some help with The Mirage’s overhaul from its landlord. Vici said Monday it “may fund” Hard Rock’s planned redevelopment of the property but added specific terms remain under discussion.

A group of emergency physicians and consumer advocates in multiple states are pushing for stiffer enforcement of decades-old statutes that prohibit the ownership of medical practices by corporations not owned by licensed doctors.

Thirty-three states plus the District of Columbia have rules on their books against the so-called corporate practice of medicine. But over the years critics say companies have successfully sidestepped bans on owning medical practices by buying or establishing local staffing groups that are nominally owned by doctors and restricting the physicians’ authority so they have no direct control.

These laws and regulations which started appearing nearly a century ago were meant to fight the commercialization of medicine maintain the independence and authority of physicians and prioritize the doctor-patient relationship over the interests of investors and shareholders.

Those campaigning for stiffer enforcement of the laws say that physician-staffing firms owned by private equity investors are the most egregious offenders. Private equity-backed staffing companies manage a quarter of the nation’s emergency rooms according to one Raleigh North Carolina-based doctor who runs a job site for ER physicians. The two largest are Nashville-based Envision Healthcare owned by investment giant KKR & Co. and Knoxville-based TeamHealth owned by Blackstone.

Court filings in multiple states including California Missouri Texas and Tennessee have called out Envision and TeamHealth for allegedly using doctor groups as straw men to sidestep corporate practice laws. But those filings have typically been in financial cases involving wrongful termination breach of contract and overbilling.

Now physicians and consumer advocates around the country are anticipating a California lawsuit against Envision scheduled to start in January 2024 in federal court. The plaintiff in the case Milwaukee-based American Academy of Emergency Medicine Physician Group alleges that Envision uses shell business structures to retain de facto ownership of ER staffing groups and it is asking the court to declare them illegal.

“We’re not asking them to pay money and we will not accept being paid to drop the case” said David Millstein lead attorney for the plaintiff. “We are simply asking the court to ban this practice model.”

‘Possibility to Reverberate Throughout the Country’

The physician group believes a victory would lead to a prohibition of the practice across California — and not just in ERs but for other staff provided by Envision and TeamHealth including in anesthesiology and hospital medicine. The California Medical Association supports the lawsuit saying it “will shape the boundaries of California’s prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine.”

The plaintiff — along with many doctors nurses and consumer advocates as well as some lawmakers — hopes that success in the case will spur regulators and prosecutors in other states to take corporate medicine prohibitions more seriously. “Any decision anywhere in the country that says the corporate ownership of a medical practice is illegal has the possibility to reverberate throughout the country absolutely — and I hope that it would” said Julie Mayfield a state senator in North Carolina.

But the push to reinvigorate laws restricting the corporate practice of medicine has plenty of skeptics who view it as an effort to return to a golden era in medicine that is long gone or may never have existed to begin with. The genie is out of the bottle they say noting that the profit motive has penetrated every corner of health care and that nearly 70% of physicians in the U.S. are now employed by corporations and hospitals.

The corporate practice of medicine doctrine has “a very interesting and not a very flattering history” said Barak Richman a law professor at Duke University. “The medical profession was trying to assert its professional dominance that accrued a lot of benefits to itself in ways that were not terribly beneficial to patients or to the market.”

The California case involves Placentia-Linda Hospital in northern Orange County where the plaintiff physician group lost its ER management contract to Envision. The complaint alleges that Envision uses the same business model at numerous hospitals around the state.

“Envision exercises profound and pervasive direct and indirect control and/or influence over the medical practice making decisions which bear directly and indirectly on the practice of medicine rendering physicians as mere employees and diminishing physician independence and freedom from commercial interests” according to the complaint.

Envision said the company is compliant with state laws and that its operating structure is common in the health care industry. “Legal challenges to that structure have proved meritless” Envision wrote in an email. It added that “care decisions have and always will be between clinicians and patients.”

TeamHealth an indirect target in the case said its “world-class operating team” provides management services that “allow clinicians to focus on the practice of medicine and patient care through a structure commonly utilized by hospitals health systems and other providers across the country.”

State Rules Vary Widely

State laws and regulations governing the corporate practice of medicine vary widely on multiple factors including whether there are exceptions for nonprofit organizations how much of doctors’ revenue outside management firms can keep who can own the equipment and how violations are punished. New York Texas and California are considered to have among the toughest restrictions while Florida and 16 other states have none.

Kirk Ogrosky a partner at the law firm Goodwin Procter said this kind of management structure predates the arrival of private equity in the industry. “I would be surprised if a company that is interested in investing in this space screwed up the formation documents; it would shock me” Ogrosky said.

Private equity-backed firms have been attracted to emergency rooms in recent years because ERs are profitable and because they have been able to charge inflated amounts for out-of-network care — at least until a federal law cracked down on surprise billing. Envision and TeamHealth prioritize profits critics say by maximizing revenue cutting costs and consolidating smaller practices into ever-larger groups — to the point of regional dominance.

Envision and TeamHealth are privately owned which makes it difficult to find reliable data on their finances and the extent of their market penetration.

Dr. Leon Adelman co-founder and CEO of Ivy Clinicians a Raleigh-based startup job site for emergency physicians has spent 18 months piecing together data and found that private equity-backed staffing firms run 25% of the nation’s emergency rooms. TeamHealth and Envision have the two largest shares with 8.6% and 8.3% respectively Adelman said.

Other estimates put private equity’s penetration of ERs at closer to 40%.

Doctors Push for Investigations

So far efforts by emergency physicians and others to challenge private equity staffing firms over their alleged violations have yielded frustrating results.

An advocacy group called Take Medicine Back formed last year by a handful of ER physicians sent a letter in July to North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein asking him to investigate violations of the ban on the corporate practice of medicine. And because Stein holds a senior position at the National Association of Attorneys General the letter also asked him to take the lead in persuading his fellow AGs to “launch a multi-state investigation into the widespread lack of enforcement” of corporate practice of medicine laws.

The group’s leader Dr. Mitchell Li said he was initially disappointed by the response he received from Stein’s office which promised to review his request saying it raised complex legal issues about the corporate practice of medicine in the state. But Li is now more hopeful since he has secured a January appointment with officials in Stein’s office.

Dr. Robert McNamara a co-founder of Li’s group and chair of emergency medicine at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine drafted complaints to the Texas Medical Board along with Houston physician Dr. David Hoyer asking the board to intervene against two doctors accused of fronting for professional entities controlled by Envision and TeamHealth. In both cases the board declined to intervene.

McNamara who serves as the chief medical officer of the physicians’ group in the California Envision case also filed a complaint with Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro alleging that a group called Emergency Care Services of Pennsylvania PC which was trying to contract with ER physicians of the Crozer Keystone Health System was wholly owned by TeamHealth and serving as a shell to avoid scrutiny.

A senior official in Shapiro’s office responded saying the complaint had been referred to two state agencies but McNamara said he has heard nothing back in more than three years.

Differing Views on Private Equity’s Role

Proponents of private equity ownership say it has brought a lot of good to health care. Jamal Hagler vice president of research at the American Investment Council said private equity brings expertise to hospital systems “whether it’s to hire new staff grow and open up to new markets integrate new technologies or develop new technologies.”

But many physicians who have worked for private equity companies say their mission is not compatible with the best practice of medicine. They cite an emphasis on speed and high patient volume over safety a preference for lesser-trained cheaper medical providers and treatment protocols unsuitable for certain patients.

Dr. Sean Jones an emergency physician in Asheville North Carolina said his first full-time job was at a Florida hospital where EmCare a subsidiary of Envision ran the emergency room. Jones said EmCare in collaboration with the hospital’s owner pushed doctors to meet performance goals related to wait times and treatments which were not always good for patients.

For example if a patient came in with abnormally high heart and respiratory rates — signs of sepsis — doctors were expected to give them large amounts of fluids and antibiotics within an hour Jones said. But those symptoms could also be caused by a panic attack or heart failure.

“You don’t want to give a patient with heart failure 2 or 3 liters of fluid and I would get emails saying ‘You didn’t do this’” he said. “Well no I didn’t because the reason they couldn’t breathe was they had too much fluid in their lungs.”

Envision said the company’s 25000 clinicians “like all clinicians exercise their independent judgment to provide quality compassionate clinically appropriate care.”

Jones felt otherwise. “We don’t need some MBAs telling us what to do” he said.

Barack Obama is steadily acquiring the reputation of a solid tastemaker having started an annual tradition of sharing his best discoveries of the year. Millions of his followers across various social media platforms tune in to see President Obama’s selections while also adding their own recommendations to the comment sections.

This year Obama included some interesting picks in his roundups of the best films and songs released in 2022. When it came to the former he championed arthouse directors such as Céline Sciamma and Ryusuke Hamaguchi while also highlighting the impact of blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick.

Earlier this year President Obama had already shared his summer playlist which consisted of songs by artists like Kendrick Lamar Burna Boy Beyoncé and more. It turns out that his favourite artists of the year haven’t really changed and many of the songs were already mentioned in his previous list.

Tracks such as Beyoncé’s ‘Break My Soul’ and Burna Boy’s ‘Last Last’ were already present on Obama’s summer playlist. While Obama had chosen Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Die Hard’ in his mid-year lineup he decided to end the year with ‘The Heart Part 5’.

Released as a promotional single for Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers ‘The Heart Part 5’ is at the very top of Obama’s selection. When it was first released the innovative music video generated a lot of discourse on social media because of its commentary on deepfake technology and its impact on contemporary visual arts.

State investigators on Friday released their final report into the crash.

The head of Ethiopia's investigation Amdeye Ayalew blamed Boeing for their failure to ""disclose early and attentively"" issues with the 737-MAX 8's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).

The aircraft which was bound for the Kenyan capital Nairobi came down minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa.

The MCAS system is believed to have caused the plane to ""pitch the nose of the airplane down to the point the pilot lost control” said Ethiopian Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges. “The airplane left (at an) angle of attack or AOA sensor failed immediately after takeoff sending faulty data to the flight control system the erroneous data in turn triggered the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS which repeatedly pitched the nose of the airplane down to the point the pilot lost control” Moges added.

The final report into the Ethiopian Airlines Group incident also concluded that all professionals and planes related to the crash were correctly certified.

In March 2019 Ethiopia’s flight ET 302 Boeing 737-8 Max aircraft flying to the Kenyan capital Nairobi crashed went down six minutes after takeoff killing all 157 people on board from 35 different countries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vbmV3cy9vbW5pYnVzLXNwZW5kaW5nLWJpbGwtaGFuZHMtYm9laW5nLXNvbWUtZ29vZC1uZXdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Omnibus Spending Bill Hands Boeing Some Good News,"After last-minute maneuvering this week Congress has passed and sent a $1.7 trillion omnibus appropriations bill to President Biden’s desk for the fiscal year 2023 which will fund the federal government for the upcoming year. Included in the legislation are noteworthy measures affecting the travel industry.

Passage of the bill gives Boeing a reprieve for its 737 MAX program with an extension of a deadline for new crew alerting systems. In addition the law also includes the bipartisan Omnibus Travel and Tourism Act to coordinate a national tourism strategy at the federal level.

The good news for Boeing goes back to the 2020 Aircraft Certification Safety and Accountability Act which requires all aircraft certified by the FAA after Dec. 27 2022 to include updated crew alerting systems.

The requirement came in the wake of two fatal accidents involving the 737 MAX in 2018 and 2019. Subsequently the current fleet of MAX aircraft was cleared to fly by most international aviation authorities—except the Chinese—following a nearly two-year grounding and extensive software and training updates. As a result Boeing had expected the newer 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10—the smallest and largest variants respectively—to be certified under those exact requirements.

However the FAA approval process took longer than expected bringing certification of the two newer models up against the Dec. 27 deadline.

Without the Congressional extension the aircraft would have had to undergo an extensive upgrade and lengthy recertification process placing the future of the new airliners in doubt and jeopardizing the $50 billion in orders for the new jets already on Boeing’s books.

The exemption written into this year’s omnibus spending bill would allow the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 to be certified under the pre-2020 rules. But it does require Boeing to outfit the MAX 7 and the entire fleet of MAX 8 and MAX 9 with two fixes designed to improve its flight control system within three years of the MAX 10 certification.

The Boeing 737 MAX 10 is already being flight tested with the updated system on board.

US Tourism Gets a Boost

The massive spending measure also includes the bipartisan Omnibus Travel and Tourism Act designed to strengthen the industry by creating an Assistant Secretary of Travel and Tourism in the Commerce Department to coordinate a national tourism strategy.

According to a statement from Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Tourism Trade and Export Promotion the US is the only G20 country that needs an agency or cabinet-level position in charge of travel and tourism policy.

The legislation also formally authorizes the US Travel and Tourism Advisory Board allows the collection of data on domestic travel and tourism mandates the development of a national travel and tourism strategy every ten years and creates a report on the effects of the pandemic on the travel and tourism industry.

Many organizations in the travel and tourism industry including the American Society of Travel Advisors the US Travel Association the American Hotel and Lodging Association and the Global Business Travel Association have endorsed the initiative.

“This is a great outcome for travelers and the travel industry alike as the US now joins every G20 nation in prioritizing the travel experience” said Geoff Freeman president and CEO of the US Travel Association. “The Omnibus Travel and Tourism Act enhances federal leadership for the travel industry by establishing a new Assistant Secretary to elevate travel issues and the industry’s positive impact on the US economy.”

Suzanne Neufang CEO of the Global Business Travel Association cited the importance of a national strategy for travel. “The industry continues to need additional support and resources to continue its recovery” Neufang said calling it “a positive step in restoring global business travel and meetings in the US and abroad.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS92aXJnaW4tYXRsYW50aWMtNzg3LWVjb25vbXktcmV2aWV3LWRlYy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flight Review: Virgin Atlantic's Boeing 787 Economy To London Heathrow,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='simpleflying.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /virgin-atlantic-787-economy-review-dec-2022/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226EAE290>, 'Connection to simpleflying.com timed out.

After takeoff a 3-course dinner is served. The airline doesn't use a tray to serve in Business Class anymore. They have tried to upscale the table setting and offerings. Catering is excellent as it comes from Brussels.

Cooked salmon starter with salad and bread

Flemish style cod

I tried out Ethiopian wine (Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon) and Ethiopian Habesha beer.

After the main course cheese board dessert and fruit were served on a cart.

Economy Class has 2 choices between chicken and fish together with salad and a white chocolate mousse.

As the flight is a short 5 hr 45 mins the dinner service took more than 2 hours and felt quite slow. I fell asleep after dinner until 30 minutes before landing I was awoken by a beautiful sunrise. The crew served an express breakfast which was a croissant and drinks.

Although the service at times was slow I felt my recent Ethiopian Airlines flight experience was better than a few years ago. The dining experience has improved greatly. The service was also attentive. However the Wi-Fi didn't work on my flight.

Addis Ababa airport is at 7625 ft above sea level. We landed on time on runway 07R. Watch the landing in my video.

About my Ethiopian Flight

Pros:

Improved dining service and quality of food.

Extensive network and good connectivity.

Good award seat availability when compared with other carriers.

Cons:

The 2-2-2 Business Class seating on B787 is underwhelming. The older 777 fleet has 2-3-2 angle flat Business Class seats. Some newly delivered A350 have 1-2-1 individual aisle access seating. The airline is focused on building the fleet and network but with inconsistent hard products.

Wi-Fi didn't work on my flight.

The Addis Ababa Hub

After landing I toured the passenger terminal and up to 10000 passengers in the morning transit at Addis Ababa Bole Airport making it the busiest hub in Africa. The terminal has been expanded with now 21 gates and 9 airbridges.

Ethiopian Airlines' biggest strength is its network. Passengers from Europe North America Middle East and Asia are connecting at Addis before their final destination in Africa.

Ethiopian Airlines has 3 lounges one for Premium Business Class passengers one for Gold frequent flyers and one for Silver frequent flyers. Next week I will share photos of these lounges.

The B777-300/ERs are usually deployed to Lagos and Abuja Nigeria.

Many destinations such as Kinshasa Kano Moroni and Windhoek are served by the new B787 and A350.

The morning departure peak was from 9 am to 11 am and then the airport terminal became very quiet. The same thing repeats in the evening with an arrival peak from 8pm to 10pm and a departure peak between 10pm and 12am.

Transit Hotel at Addis Ababa

I also toured the newly opened Transit Hotel - Ethiopian Skylight Hotel at Addis Ababa Bole Int'l. The hotel has rooms available from both the landside and airside.

price is in USD

Next week I continue to explore Ethiopian Airline lounges at Addis Ababa and fly on their new A350 to Cape Town.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlbWVtYmVyaW5nLXRoZS1ib2VpbmctNzI3LWhvbWUtb24tYS1wb2xlLXdvcmxkcy1mYXN0ZXN0LWhvdXNlLXRoYXQtcm90YXRlZC1pbi10aGUtd2luZC0yMDcwNzMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remembering the Boeing 727 Home on a Pole World's Fastest House That Rotated in the Wind,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlbWVtYmVyaW5nLXRoZS1ib2VpbmctNzI3LWhvbWUtb24tYS1wb2xlLXdvcmxkcy1mYXN0ZXN0LWhvdXNlLXRoYXQtcm90YXRlZC1pbi10aGUtd2luZC0yMDcwNzMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226EAD060>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Note: The editorial staff at IMS.com is taking a look back at the 10 biggest moments of 2022 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in this year-end series with one installment appearing on the site per day in countdown fashion from Dec. 22-31.

Jeff Gordon and his longtime crew chief Ray Evernham reunited at Indianapolis Motor Speedway during a Labor Day weekend sports car event.

The two who won NASCAR’s inaugural Brickyard 400 at IMS in 1994 and later won the event in 1998 briefly came out of retirement to compete in the IMSA-sanctioned Porsche Carrera Cup North America Presented by the Cayman Islands race. It was the first time the championship-winning combination had teamed together since 1999 the year after they won their third Cup Series season title.

Gordon joined an entry list of more than 30 Porsche specialists driving Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars on the 14-turn 2.439-mile road course. Fittingly Gordon drove the No. 24 entry.

“Ray and I have always talked about running another race together and we felt like Indy was the perfect place” Gordon said of the second-annual Porsche Sports Car Together Fest. “It (was) a fun way to spend the holiday weekend and make some new memories.”

Gordon won 93 Cup Series races in his decorated career and is a record five-time Brickyard 400 winner at IMS. He also holds the Cup Series record for most road course victories (nine). In 2017 he won the Rolex 24 At Daytona to become one of only four drivers to have won both the Daytona 500 and the Daytona 24-hour race.

In 2003 Gordon got his first taste of the IMS road course in a famous seat swap with Formula One driver Juan Pablo Montoya. But until this year Gordon had never competed on the circuit. Now he has.

Parker Thompson and Riley Dickinson drove to overall victories in the two Porsche Carrera Cup North America races. Thompson a former Road to Indy driver won the first 40-minute race while Dickinson won the second. Gordon finished 15th and 11th in his debut in the world’s premier one-make series featuring 500-horsepower Porsches.

“I wanted to do some fun things make some passes” Gordon said of his race on the second day. “I made a pass on the white flag – that made my whole weekend.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Donncha O'Callaghan was nervous filming his new TV show because he had a horrible feeling that the days of people being wound up or being embarrassed in front of people were gone.

He has teamed up with his 2fm Breakfast colleagues Carl Mullan and Doireann Garrihy for The Full Irish Hidden Camera Show but disguising himself became a problem at 6ft 6"" - and people knew Carl's voice.

The former rugby star is no stranger to pranks and divilment after his career with Munster and Ireland.

Donncha told RSVP Live: ""Being recognised was half the problem and people recognised our voices as well.

""Even if we were wearing disguises they knew what we sounded like. It was certainly a lot of fun though.

""I was nervous though because I had a horrible feeling that the days of people being wound up or being embarrassed in front of people were gone.

""But there is something in the Irish nature that loves people being wound up and more importantly being wound up themselves.""

The Munster legend added: ""In England my teammates when I played rugby for Worcester either got really embarrassed or aggressive. Whereas Irish people just laugh.""

For Donncha filming this show had all the feeling of being back in the dressing room and it reminded of when Paul O’Connell and Frankie Sheehan pulled the wool over his eyes.

He explained: ""The weekends are so pressured in sports so you need silly and immature fun during the week. Paul O’Connell and Frankie Sheehan got one thing after they pretended to invent this machine called an Isosymetric Core Enhancer.

""I thought it sounded incredible and I was injured at the time so I handed them over my credit card number.

""As soon as they got my details they were sending balloons to Boston Scientific where my wife Jenny works and flowers to my coaches down in Cork Con.

""Anybody they could get a hold of. I am well used to being wound up but I enjoy that sense of divilment and fun.""

Donncha praised the comedy scene in Ireland and our unique sense of humour.

He said: ""I love watching homegrown Irish shows that show off our sense of humour. I love Tommy Tiernan and his humour.

""You can get lost in the various streaming services and that is why I love creating something that is Irish.

""There is room to make it better and I would love to drop the hammer and really push it and see how good we can make it. We need to see how it is received.

""I have been around great teammates in the past and I feel lucky to have Doireann and Carl around me.

""On top of being really good at what they do they are also great craic. They have an innate ability to find fun.""

Donncha will also be screens for the annual celebrity instalment of Ireland's Fittest Family where he will coach Tadhg Fleming.

He said: ""They are different types of days because the charities come first. You nearly leave it to the celebrities to see how far they go. Half of you hope they are not too bothered. I landed the Flemings and I have always been a super fan of theirs.

""They kept me going when I was away in England playing rugby for three years.

""Ever since the bat in the house that was common language in the Worcester dressing room. If you didn't catch the ball one the lads would say ‘Would you catch it Derry?’.""

He added: ""All the celebrities were so competitive and they wanted to do really well. It got fiery at a few points which was great.""

Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was killed in Memphis Tennessee on April 19. She was 28 years old.

Police found Brown’s body at approximately 9:30 a.m. inside a crashed car on Rolling Woods Drive according to reports from local news station WHBQ which misgendered Brown and used her legal name in its initial coverage. Brown had been fatally shot in the side.

On April 28 Alexavier Williamson 20 reportedly confessed to the killing in a statement to Memphis police telling homicide investigators he had shot Brown in a wooded area near the roadway. Williamson worked with Brown at a local restaurant where surveillance footage allegedly showed the two entering Brown’s car together at around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of her death. Williamson has been charged with second-degree homicide.

Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of trans-led nonprofit WeCareTennessee said she was saddened to live “in a time where Black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” in a statement to the Human Rights Campaign this week.

“Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on” Tasaki said. “It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

As HRC’s report noted news of Brown’s death prompted an outpouring of grief among friends and family who remembered her as a “beautiful soul” and someone who uplifted those around her. In addition to her restaurant work Brown’s social media profiles indicate that she was an adult content creator as well and had garnered a large following on X formerly Twitter. Local news reports (which also used Brown’s legal name) also indicate that Brown had previously been shot as recently as October when she was the target of an attempted armed robbery.

Brown is among the latest victims in a rising tide of violence targeting trans communities particularly Black trans people. Her death came barely two weeks prior to the hit-and-run killing of local icon Kita Bee in Kansas City MO.

Harrah’s Nebraska this week received the state’s blessing to begin construction on its temporary and permanent casinos. Developer Caesars Entertainment plans to open the gaming venues in March 2023 and March 2024.

The Nebraska Racing and Gaming Commission (NRGC) on Wednesday voted in favor of issuing Harrah’s Nebraska a provisional gaming license. The concession will become active once the gaming spaces are built and the state gaming regulators sign off on each building’s operations.

Caesars is now cleared to proceed with building a temporary casino at the Platte County Agricultural Park on the east side of Columbus. The permanent Harrah’s casino will be built northwest of the downtown area at the former Wishbones events site center which closed in May 2021 and was demolished earlier this year.

With this approval we will start within the next couple of weeks depending on weather” said Joe Morris Caesars’ senior vice president of racetrack casino operations.

Nebraskans passed a ballot referendum during the November 2020 election that authorized the state’s licensed horse racetracks to become casinos with slot machines table games and sports betting.

Columbus Casino

Columbus qualified for a casino through the state’s 2022 legalization of commercial gaming because of its horse racetrack facility at Ag Park. Live racing has greatly declined over the years with the Columbus track scheduling only 11 days of live racing in 2023. But the city’s investment in keeping the track and simulcasting facility open over the years is finally set to pay off with the Harrah’s development.

Harrah’s plans to open its temporary casino inside Ag Park’s downstairs exhibit hall. Caesars says the building only needs minor renovations to become a temporary casino that will feature about 250 slot machines.

The permanent Harrah’s Nebraska casino will be about four air miles across town from Ag Park. To satisfy the racing component of the 2020 gaming law Harrah’s Nebraska will build a new one-mile horse racetrack and hold live racing there beginning in 2024.

The $75 million project will result in a new structure equipped with a 40000-square-foot casino and sportsbook with more than 400 slots and 20 table games. The sportsbook will be staffed with on-site oddsmakers plus self-service wagering kiosks. Nebraska’s sports betting law limits sports wagering to retail operations. No online bets are allowed.

An entity called Convergence LLC is the owner of the land where Harrah’s Nebraska will be built. Convergence will construct and own a forthcoming hotel at the casino. Convergence has contracted with Marriott International to operate the hotel once it’s ready for guests in 2024.

Finally Harrah’s Nebraska will feature several restaurants and retail shops.

Caesars Selection

Columbus Exposition and Racing Inc. chose Caesars Entertainment as its casino development partner in July 2021. The nonprofit that is dedicated to the advancement of horse racing is cofinancing the $75 million permanent casino though Caesars will bankroll the majority of the budget.

Casinos in Nebraska are required to share 20% of their gross gaming revenue with the state. The bulk of the tax income will be used to support the state’s Property Tax Credit Fund.

WarHorse Casino Lincoln was the first legal commercial casino to open in Nebraska in September.

A pair of goals from Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin on Friday secured yet another feat in his surefire Hall of Fame career passing hockey legend Gordie Howe for the second-most goals scored in NHL history.

In front of a friendly home crowd against the Winnipeg Jets Ovechkin scored on a wrist shot to give Washington a 1-0 lead to tie Howe at 801 career goals. The fans at Capital One Arena gave the 37-year-old a standing ovation as he skated over to the bench to greet his teammates.

Goal No. 802 was an empty-netter coming late in the third period. The Capitals would go on to defeat the Jets 4-1.

Last week Ovechkin became the third player in NHL history to score 800 career goals joining Howe and Wayne Gretzky who holds the record with 894 goals.

Ovechkin was selected by the Capitals with the first overall pick in the 2004 NHL draft. He is the Capitals’ franchise leader in games played goals points playoff games played playoff goals and playoff points.

According to the NHL Ovechkin is the only player in league history to win a Stanley Cup as well as the following individual achievements:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtYWlycG9ydC1mcmFuY28taGFycmlzLW1lbW9yaWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airport’s statue of Pittsburgh Steeler Franco Harris now impromptu memorial,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtYWlycG9ydC1mcmFuY28taGFycmlzLW1lbW9yaWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212239E66E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But the authorities are set to unveil a newly built $1.5 billion city a project that officials claim “reflects the rapid socioeconomic development” in the Central Asian nation.



The new city -- Arkadag or Protector -- draws its name from the formal title of Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov the authoritarian leader who stepped down in March after ruling the country with an iron fist for over 15 years.



Berdymukhammedov handed power to his son Serdar in a managed election. But the 65-year-old remains a top official as the chairman of the upper house of parliament and continues to wield considerable influence.

Located around 30 kilometers southwest of the capital Ashgabat Arkadag will serve as the capital of Akhal Province which is situated along the border with Iran and Afghanistan.



Construction of the project began in 2019 the same year that Serdar Berdymukhammedov’s was appointed as governor of Akhal.



Over the course of the project the younger Bedymukhammedov became the minister of industry and construction materials and deputy chairman of the cabinet before succeeding his father as president.



In April Serdar Berdymukhammedov called for a “public discussion” to find a name for the new city.

Sure enough the speaker of Turkmenistan’s lower house of parliament duly announced the city’s name on December 21 claiming that “the wishes of residents of all regions” and the “suggestions of public organizations” had been taken into account.

But sources told RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service in May that the name was already decided.



Turkmenistan watchers scoff at the notion that the city-naming was an exercise in democracy.



“There is no trace of a public campaign. How did they ask the opinion of people in these regions where there is no Internet where even mobile penetration is low?” asked Luca Anceschi professor of Eurasian Studies at the University of Glasgow. “The name of the city is an illusion. The city itself is an illusion.”

'Far Away From Food Queues'

Arkadag does not resemble most cities or even provincial capitals in Turkmenistan.

Footage shown on state media suggests it will have more in common with central Ashgabat where billions of dollars generated from gas exports have funded the construction of ostentatious buildings with white marble facades even as other parts of the country bear the brunt of a prolonged economic crisis.

Arkadag has been hailed by Turkmen authorities as a “smart city” which will host a hippodrome a children’s rehabilitation center named after the former president and a statue of the ex-leader. One of the central streets in the city will be named after the patriarch’s favorite horse Akhan.



The city is designed to house more than 12000 families.



Ruslan Myatiev the editor of the Europe-based exile-run Turkmen.News website says Arkadag will accommodate members of the elite and those with ties to the ruling Berdymukhammedov family.



Myatiev said this fits the general pattern of the Berdymukhammedovs keeping members of their extended clan separate from the general population and “far away from food queues” that have become common amid rising poverty and food shortages.

“At the moment the relatives -- a very broad term that includes even very distant relatives -- have occupied a number of neighborhoods built with state money in and around Ashgabat” said the journalist.



In contrast “since about 2015 the general population of Turkmenistan has been living with no clear vision of tomorrow” Myatiev added.

'Instruments Of Corruption'

Despite all evidence to the contrary Turkmen state propaganda has claimed a never-ending procession of economic successes.

An exception came last year when the elder Berdymukhammedov then president acknowledged that the state was struggling to repay its foreign creditors on time.

The reality is that the government is also struggling to pay the salaries of public sector employees on time including the construction workers building Arkadag according to a report by RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service in September.

Earlier this month residents of some neighborhoods in Ashgabat told RFE/RL that they had been left without water and heating during a cold snap.



In November RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service reported a sharp growth in the market for secondhand clothes and used household items in Turkmenabat the capital of eastern Lebap Province.



“When you go around to people’s houses you see that they have put up for sale half of their belongings just to survive to buy bread” one Turkmenabat resident told RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service.



Turkmenistan’s energy-dependent economy took a nosedive after global oil and gas prices plunged in 2014 and Russia ceased imports in 2016.



Recently global energy prices have recovered Russia has resumed buying some Turkmen gas and top client China in the first nine months of this year purchased more than $7 billion worth of the fuel according to Chinese customs data.



But that has not fueled an economic recovery in Turkmenistan where the state has prioritized spending on multibillion-dollar vanity projects despite chronic food shortages and price hikes.



Widespread poverty corruption and unemployment have forced millions of Turkmen to leave the country in recent decades.



“You have a new city in a country where the population is shrinking whatever official statistics claim. You have a new airport that costs over $2 billion in a country that has no tourism and which is trying to stop its citizens from fleeing the country” said Anceschi of the University of Glasgow.

“Everything is backwards but what we can be sure of is that somebody is making an awful lot of money off these projects. Because they are instruments of corruption” he said.

There is little hope of a change in direction. President Serdar Berdymukhammedov has pledged to “follow the course” set by his father.

The younger Berdymukhammedov has only had good things to say about Arkadag a project that he has led.



“There are currently few countries in the world that are building and commissioning an entire city” Berdymukhammedov said in April. “This indicates the growing economic potential of the Motherland the good training of our specialists.”"
CAH,Cardinal Health,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzI0LzItaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1zdG9ja3MteW91LWNhbi1idXktYW5kLWhvbGQtZm9yLXRoZS1uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Healthcare Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,"These companies are safe havens during tough times with above-average dividends.

It's a scary time to be an investor with the markets languishing and the threat of additional interest rate hikes next year weighing on stock prices. In this environment it is important to control risk and one way to do that is by investing in quality healthcare companies with consistent sustainable dividends.

Cardinal Health (CAH 1.50%) and AbbVie (ABBV 0.22%) offer dependable revenue growth with above-average dividends. These are the type of value companies investors turn to in tough times and they are likely to be among the first stocks to bounce back when the economy improves.

Cardinal is in the middle of everything

Cardinal Health's stock is up more than 60% over the past year. The drug and laboratory products distributor operates in two segments: pharmaceutical and medical. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023 it reported revenue of $49.6 billion up 13% year over year with income from operations of $137 million down 67% over the same period in 2022 and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 down 57% year over year. The pharmaceutical segment is the one fueling growth bringing in $46 billion of the company's first-quarter revenue up 15% year over year. Medical saw revenue fall by 9% to $3.8 billion with lower product and distribution sales.

The company's bottom line was hurt by supply chain issues and inflation because many of its contracts are long-term limiting how fast the company can raise prices. New CEO Jason Hollar however is focusing on raising prices.

Cardinal is also looking at improving its medical segment sales. In November the company in a collaborative effort with Medically Home launched a supply chain network and last-mile fulfillment solution Velocare. The point is to deliver hospital-level care at home for patients bringing critical products and services to patients within an hour or two saving money and bringing more efficient care.

What I like about Cardinal is it doesn't have the expenses that pharmaceutical and medical device makers do in developing and making drugs and medical devices. It carves out its own profits from being the middleman. With inflation rising so fast this past year that put a short-term strain on the company but it is built for long-term success with less risk than most healthcare companies.

Cardinal also offers an above-average quarterly dividend which it raised by 1% last year to $0.4957 per share the 36th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. Its current yield is roughly 2.5%.

AbbVie is prepared for its next phase

AbbVie has proven its doubters wrong for so long that they're even joining the shareholder ranks. Over the past year the pharmaceutical stock is up more than 20%.

The looming patent cliff for Humira has made AbbVie a better company. The immunology blockbuster's sales will likely decline beginning in 2023 when it faces biosimilar competition in the U.S. for the first time. CEO Richard Gonzalez said he expects sales for Humira to drop 45% by 2024. The anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy has long been the standard of care for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.

However AbbVie already has two drugs that are lining up to replace the $20 billion in revenue that Humira earned last year: Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Just as Humira did the two biologics are steadily adding approvals. Skyrizi gained its third Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval this summer to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease and it also picked up that approval this fall in Europe. Rinvoq already has approvals to treat active ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis along the spine) Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis atopic dermatitis rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.

AbbVie said last year that the two drugs should deliver $15 billion in annual revenue by 2025. They're well on the way as they combined to bring in $5.3 billion in the first nine months of this year with Skyrizi's sales up 75.6% year over year and Rinvoq's up 54.5% in that same period.

Thanks in no small part to a big research and development budget fueled by Humira profits the company has a huge pipeline particularly in oncology with 26 molecules currently in trials. Another drug with huge potential is Vraylar which earned its fourth indication this month by the FDA as an add-on therapy for major depressive disorder. An estimated 21 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2020 according to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The drug was already approved to treat schizophrenia manic or mixed episodes from bipolar I disorder and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.

The company is raising its dividend by 5% next quarter to $1.48 per share offering a yield of around 3.7% more than double the average S&P 500 dividend of 1.82%. AbbVie because it spent years as part of Abbott Laboratories is a Dividend King that is on schedule to raise its dividend for the 51st straight year. The one downside to AbbVie stock is the pain of knowing you could have gotten a lower share price a few months ago but that annoyance ends when you consider the company's potential for growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3Rob21hcy1sZXdpcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODQ2NDU1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thomas Lewis Obituary (2022) - Belleville IL - Kurrus Funeral Home - Belleville,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/thomas-lewis-obituary?id=38464555 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3Rob21hcy1sZXdpcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODQ2NDU1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvZ29hL3JhbmUtY29udmV5cy1tb2Rpcy14bWFzLXdpc2hlcy10by1jYXJkaW5hbC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjQ4NDg3MC5jbXPSAXRodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2dvYS9yYW5lLWNvbnZleXMtbW9kaXMteG1hcy13aXNoZXMtdG8tY2FyZGluYWwvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NDg0ODcwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vishwajit Rane conveys PM Narendra Modi’s Christmas wishes to Cardinal,PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane  along with wife and Poriem MLA Deviya Rane on Saturday met archbishop Filipe Neri Cardinal Ferrao  to convey to him wishes from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of Christmas .Cardinal Ferrao reciprocated the gesture by conveying his wishes to the Prime Minister through Rane. tnn,,,,,,

The company operates several well-known brands in various global markets including North America the U.K. Germany Australia and Italy and has long relied on its strong brand presence in these markets to drive business and generate profits.

However the uneven reopening of cruise travel in the wake of COVID-19 in Asia and Australia in particular and the direct impact of the conflict in Ukraine on European countries have had a significant effect on the company’s results.

Carnival’s Strongest Suit Now Working Against Them

Carnival Corporation’s brand strategy has long been one where it operates several brands that are location specific. Think Costa Cruises and Italy AIDA and Germany P&O in the UK and Australia and so forth.

This strategy has long been one of the strong points of Carnival Corporation and propelled it to be to world’s largest cruise operator.

In Carnival Corporations’ fourth quarter earnings call CEO Josh Weinstein explained: “We believe that having the No. 1 or No. 2 brand in each of the largest cruise markets such as North America the U.K. Germany Australia Italy France and Spain is the foundation of our portfolio strategy and allows us to tailor our experiences and offerings to those specific source markets enabling us to generate stronger brand loyalty and gain greater penetration and profit.“

One of the main challenges facing Carnival Corporation has been the lagging reopening of specific markets particularly Australia Asia and the Baltics.

These markets have been extremely important and the main base for drawing in non-North American guests for the company in 2019.

The markets that are now lagging behind accounted for around 2 million people or one-third of its total non-North American guests and were particularly reliant on the company’s Costa and Princess brands representing 40% of Costa’s guests and 25% of Princess’ guests.

Costa Cruises in particular had been betting heavily on expanding its operations in China. For the Chinese market the cruise line developed several new cruise ships aimed solely at the Asian market. However these vessels are now either not sailing or being transferred to Carnival Cruise Line under the ‘Carnival Fun Italian Style‘ program.

With Australia currently in a similar position to North America a year ago and Japan further behind the recovery has been slower than expected leading to those changes in deployment and guest-sourcing approaches as Carnival anticipates ongoing impacts particularly in the first half of 2023.

In addition to the challenges posed by the slow reopening of these markets Carnival Corporation has also been affected by the conflict in Ukraine. This has weighed heavily on consumer confidence in regions served by the company’s Costa and AIDA brands leading to greater uncertainty and closer-in booking patterns.

What’s the Solution?

To help mitigate these impacts Carnival has made strategic deployment decisions focusing on solutions that reduce the friction of air travel lower overall costs and facilitate closer-in bookings.

This strategy aims to attract more new-to-cruise guests and position the company as a more attractive value proposition than land-based alternatives.

Due to the challenges mentioned above Carnival Corporation has taken steps to optimize its fleet and transform its business to position itself for long-term growth.

The company has disposed of 26 ships since the pandemic’s start while also introducing larger more efficient ships such as the Excel-class Carnival Celebration Mardi Gras Costa Toscana Costa Smeralda AIDAnova and AIDAcosma and Iona and Arvia for P&O Cruises.

On top of the 26 ships it has already disposed of Carnival is also planning to offload at least three smaller less efficient cruise ships in the near future. Some rumors even include selling off various parts of the business such as Seabourn Cruise Line.

The new ships have resulted in nearly a quarter of the company’s fleet consisting of new capacity with an 8-percentage-point increase in balcony cabins and a significant increase and variety of onboard experiences that generate additional revenues.

Having a fleet of ships that is fast becoming one of the youngest in the industry Carnival’s problems remain though. How to draw 2 million guests back to those ships and fill them up?

Bringing ships back to the Caribbean and North America will only work to a point especially since Carnival Cruise Line already has a large chunk of the market.

By contrast a company such as the Royal Caribbean Group does not have this problem at all focusing primarily on the US middle-class market with Royal Caribbean International and the premium North American and European market through Celebrity Cruises and Silverseas.

Whether the plans will work out for Weinstein and his nine cruise brands remains to be seen. One thing is certain investors are not seeing the recent numbers as positive. Carnival Corporation is suffering from extremely high debt and continues to post losses something it will need to address as soon as possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2Nhcm5pdmFsLTIwMjMtdHJpbmlkYWQtc2FpbnQtbHVjaWEtamFtYWljYS1ncmVuYWRhLTY4MzE1NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to Celebrate Caribbean Carnival in 2023,"You've heard of Carnival — the epic fêtes intoxicating soca music and costumes adorned with feathers and jewels. This celebration of freedom created by enslaved Africans in the 18th century and enshrined after Emancipation is a must for any traveler looking to explore Caribbean culture.

Next year Carnival will be back in full force after a pandemic hiatus. Tourism booms around the events so book early — and check out our mini-guide to the most unmissable parties. Working with a Carnival concierge company like Carnival Jumpers is highly recommended. They can secure party tickets costumes and hotel rooms which often sell out months in advance.

Trinidad and Tobago

February 15–22 2023

In the birthplace of the celebration as we know it today Trinidad Carnival — known locally as the Greatest Show on Earth — is the biggest event of the year and was the only major Caribbean Carnival to happen in 2020 before the world shut down. Build your stamina for nonstop parties like the popular MC Boat Experience and Soca Brainwash and sign up early for popular Mas bands (parade groups) like Tribe to ensure you have the best costume of the season.

Where to stay: Port of Spain is the center of the action; the Hyatt Regency Trinidad downtown is close to both the airport and the hottest fêtes.



Jamaica

April 12-18 2023



Jamaica has cemented its reputation as one of the top travel destinations in the Caribbean but it’s newer to the annual Carnival calendar — recently attracting soca artists in addition to its iconic reggae and dancehall scene. It's a great place to experience all the events that dedicated attendees know and love but at a more affordable price point. Work with a concierge to secure your costume from local Mas band Xodus and book tickets to popular parties like SunKissed and Duck Work.



Where to stay: The centrally located (and affordable) Courtyard Kingston is a great base for party-hopping and exploring local sites like the Bob Marley Museum.

St. Lucia

July 12–19 2023

Best known as a destination for romance and luxury St. Lucia turns euphoric when the summer heat turns up and Carnival takes over. Visitors flock to the island for its local music (Dennery Segment) and to join Mas bands like Legends. It’s the perfect place to “get on bad” with stunning views of mountains and sea.

Where to stay: Most events take place in the Rodney Bay–Gros Islet areas and the Harbor Club Curio Collection is in the heart of it all.

Grenada

August 10–15 2023

One of the most distinctive events in the region Grenada’s Carnival — called Spicemas — is a celebration of culture local food and the colorful pageantry of Mas bands like Oro. But to get the true Spicemas experience head to the island’s one-of-a-kind Jab Jab J’Ouvert which signals the unofficial start of the events. Jab is Creole derived from the French diable (“devil”); revelers mock the island’s former colonizers by donning devil horns covering themselves in black oil blowing conch shells and dancing until dawn.

Where to stay: The luxurious Silversands Grenada on Grand Anse Beach is close to the excitement and offers a discounted Spicemas package.

That is up from 54 percent occupancy to start 2022 in the first quarter as the company continues to close the occupancy gap following its restart.

“Occupancy for first quarter 2023 is expected to be 90 percent or slightly higher just a 14-percentage-point gap or better” Bernstein said. “As I said before this would be nearly a 5-percentage-point improvement from the fourth quarter 2022 gap.”

Bernstein said it wasn’t enough.

“We are working hard and expect to close the gap to 2019 with occupancy returning to historical levels in the summer of 2023” he said with 2019 being the last normalized year of cruise operations.

“On the pricing front for first quarter of 2023 we expect net per diems to be up 5.5% to 6.5% in constant currency and 3% to 4% in current dollars as compared to first quarter of 2019. A great accomplishment as we start the new year.”"

However other communities have added their traditions and culture along the way to make it 'interesting'.

Some of these traditions include:-

1. Bad Santa (Austria)

In Austria there is no Father Christmas or Santa Claus. Instead they have a creature called ‘Krampus’ who is said to be the evil accomplice of St Nicholas.

Krampus is an aid to wander around the streets looking for kids who are badly behaved.

The citizens have adopted this tradition to date. They wear tarrying masks and throw ghostly pranks on children and adults along the roads and the streets sending them on heels with screams!

2. Christmas Sauna (Finland)

For many homes in Finland there is a specific spot considered a sacred space for the long-dead ancestors.

On Christmas Eve they are expected to strip naked and take a long respectful stint in the sauna.

After the long tint session they head out for the evening celebrations and it is believed that the spirits of the ancestors take their rightful space in the bubbling water.

3. Setting a shoe 'schoentje zetten' (Netherlands)

Dutch children believe that placing their shoes by the fire during Christmas has a lot to offer.

They eagerly place one shoe filled with carrots near the fire with hopes that 'Sinterklaas' will take them and then fill them with small gifts and treats in the night.

4. La Befana the Christmaswitch (Italy)

This is the last festivity of Christmas time in Italy. Befana which is a Greek word loosely translated as 'manifestation of divinity' is represented by an old woman who rides on a broomstick through the air to bring candies and sweets to well-behaved kids.

She is also said to bring onions garlic and coal to the rascals.

5. Fried caterpillars (South Africa)

For South Africans Christmas celebrations are not complete without some freshly fried caterpillars on the table!

Seems like an unusual Christmas tradition but these insects act as a great source of protein in the land.

They are arrested just before Christmas preserved and later consumed throughout winter and as a main meal during Christmas celebrations.

6. Flying witches (Norway)

Christmas Eve is a very big event for Norwegians. Families gather together for meals singing and opening gifts.

Chinese troops illegally entered Indian territory on a number of occasions to collect a fungus that is considered costlier than gold a report by the Indo-Pacific Centre for Strategic Communications (IPCSC) says.

The fungus – known as Cordyceps – is found in the Indian Himalayas and in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau in southwestern China. As per the report the People’s Liberation Army soldiers have transgressed into India’s Arunachal Pradesh to pick these valuable fungi that is often used in traditional medicine. The emerging Chinese middle class seeks this panacea for everything from impotence to digestion without any scientific evidence.

China is the largest producer and exporter of cordyceps. However the IPCSC report says that in recent years the harvest has declined in China. The increasing demand and the fewer resources have resulted in over-harvesting of this herbal drug.

Harvesting of cordyceps

Cordyceps grow on the larvae of insects and therefore are called parasitic fungi. When cordyceps infect an insect they take over their body and eventually sprout from the corpse. Cordyceps sinensiswhich grows in the Himalayas parasitizes the larvae of ghost moths. It grows from the head of the caterpillar which is why it is also given the name caterpillar fungus.

It is very difficult to commercially cultivate the fungus it is mostly harvested from the wild.

According to IPCSC: “Some towns in the Himalayas rely on collecting and selling this fungus for a living. In fact experts say that up to 80 percent of household income in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas can come from selling caterpillar fungus.”

To compare the scarcity and dearness of the fungus sample this - a small 10 gram bag of Cordyceps can retail for the equivalent of $700 USD. 10 grams of gold is worth about $500.

Attempts at cultivating cordyceps in the lab have been unsuccessful even as they become rare in the wild.

Strategic concerns

However reports that PLA troops intrude into India to collect this fungus are not new. These may not pose strategic concerns but any transgressions must be treated with seriousness.

The India-China border in the north east is a fertile ground for exotic items and often even locals stray and are detained by soldiers on the other side.

Many of the locals who are also employed has porters by the Indian Army may sometimes embark on gathering and hunting excursions of local herbs and other items that sell at exorbitant rates in the international market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdlZWsuaW4vdGhld2Vlay9zcGVjaWFscy8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L3RoZS1odW50LWZvci1oaW1hbGF5YW4tdmlhZ3JhLmh0bWzSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGV3ZWVrLmluL3RoZXdlZWsvc3BlY2lhbHMvMjAyMi8xMi8yNC90aGUtaHVudC1mb3ItaGltYWxheWFuLXZpYWdyYS5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The hunt for Himalayan Viagra,"Prerna Devi and her husband Jagat Singh Ganghari fall on their knees and bend over on the floor.

Prerna is 52 or thereabouts Jagat 65. On a crisp November afternoon in Munsiyari―a quiet hamlet at 7200ft in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district―they are demonstrating how they burrow for the tip of a rare fungus in snow-peaked mountains.

The maximum gold medals are won by Chinese athletes. Keeda jadi is the secret. I am sure Xi Jinping also eats this. He doesn’t ever grow old. ―Yogesh Rawat who claims to sell keeda jadi to sportspeople in Rajasthan and Haryana

In Munsiyari often charmingly referred to as Little Kashmir local residents often point to the five famous peaks namely Panchachuli girding the Kumaon region far into the horizon as if the peaks are the source of all sustenance in this quaint little hill town perched between the borders of India Tibet and Nepal.

Standing outside her spacious pucca house on a broken road Prerna looks petite and rough-hewn. She chirpily talks about walking over the remnants of a glacier from the Nanda Devi east base camp to search for keeda jadi or cordyceps―a mummified caterpillar fungus with a slender brown body whose benefits were perhaps first described in An Ocean of Aphrodisiacal Qualities a 15th century Tibetan medicinal text.

It is known as Yartsa Gunbu in Nepal and Tibet a poetic name meaning summer grass winter worm. The mushroom is renowned as ‘Himalayan Viagra’ for its rumoured use as a sexual stimulant. But Prerna is least concerned with such saucy connotations. For her family of three in Munsiyari keeda jadi is the most important source of income in a region mostly amenable to growing potato rajma and medicinal herbs.

This April the couple trekked all the way to the Nanda Devi east base camp and climbed further ahead to procure keeda jadi. They managed to collect 400 pieces of the fungus hidden under patches where the snow had melted. On the way down they sold off their collection to a thekedaar [contractor] for Rs10000. The people of her village made a total of Rs10 lakh this year selling keeda jadi. In the international market a kilogram of keeda jadi costs Rs65 lakh making it perhaps the most expensive mushroom in the world costlier than gold or diamonds.

“We didn’t even know such a valuable resource existed on our side of the Himalayas” says Jagat while calling attention to his bruised elbows and shins. “First people from Nepal came quietly through the jungles and went up to collect this insect-herb. Then the people in Dharchula (a town in Uttarakhand close to the Nepal border) got to know of this and they too headed for the mountains. We in turn got to know from the Dharchula folks when they descended the mountains.”

Jagat first learnt about keeda jadi in 2011 and has been a regular visitor to the higher reaches often braving floods snow-melt and avalanche to camp onsite from April to June every year. In 2013 his tent with all the rations utensils and woollens tumbled down the valley as a glacier collapsed.

“The first time my wife and I went there we didn’t get a single piece” recalls Jagat. “It is hardly ever visible on the ground. You have to crawl on your knees and elbows which start bleeding from the cold. You have to keep crawling. Every year there are casualties. So many have slipped on ice and died.”

He says he can trek 65km a day his wife even more although searching for keeda jadi is getting increasingly difficult with their faltering eyesight. “I will go one more time” he says. “Just one last time next year.”

Prerna interjects: “At least our son has completed his education because of the money we earned from keeda jadi.” She explains how she soaks the unsold fungus in water for a week or two so the juice seeps out and then drinks it up like a hot beverage.

The couple even eats it raw. “It has cured our fever stomach ulcers and knee pain. Maybe it is protecting us from the harsh cold climate in the mountains too. The buyers cannot afford to eat it because it gets more and more expensive. But we obviously can” chuckles Prerna.

The rare plant-animal herb dictates fortunes in parts of Uttarakhand specifically in the Pithoragarh belt. It grows abundantly in the bugyals (alpine meadows) of the state. In the fruiting season in spring the mushroom pops out of the head of the exoskeleton of a dead caterpillar. The fruiting and harvesting are wrapped up in less than two months from mid-May to June.

Local healers and traditional practitioners list several uses of the magic fungi. C.S. Negi professor of zoology at Motiram Baburam Government Postgraduate College in Haldwani has been researching on keeda jadi for more than 15 years. In a 2016 paper he lists how it can treat 21 different ailments starting from erectile dysfunction malignant tumours bronchial asthma to diabetes cough and cold jaundice and alcoholic hepatitis.

“In some parts of Nepal Yartsa Gunbu is powdered and combined with the rhizome of Dactylorhiza hatagirea [the creeping rootstalk of an orchid species found in the Himalayas] for consumption which along with honey and cow’s milk is used as tonic and aphrodisiac. People of both sexes normally use a combined dose of one dried Yartsa Gunbu with half litre of milk and two teaspoons of ghee (clarified butter) for a week. Invariably young or immature Yartsa Gunbu.... are recommended for the preparation of the sexual-stimulant” states the paper published in the International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation.

In Dharchula it is often consumed with the local alcoholic brew called chakti. And in Munsiyari one need not go to far-off remote villages to find collectors of keeda jadi. From shopkeepers and tailors to an ex-armyman or gas station guard everyone has a keeda jadi story to share.

Cordyceps grow abundantly in the bugyals (alpine meadows) of Uttarakhand. In the fruiting season in spring the mushroom pops out of the head of the exoskeleton of a dead caterpillar.

The fungus has been widely used in Tibetan and Chinese medicine for centuries and there are regulations on its harvesting and trade in the two countries. The Nepal government in 2020 disallowed the annual trek to harvest the fungi because of its near-constant depletion. The same year the International Union for the Conservation of Nature listed it as “vulnerable” to extinction.

But there is little awareness or chatter around conservation of this precious resource on the Indian side of the Himalayan belt. Because the sale of cordyceps is banned in India collectors and harvesters are always furtive around referencing keeda jadi even if a major chunk of their household income depends on it. Most of the produce is smuggled into Nepal for it to be legally traded to China which sees the highest demand for the fungi.

Navin a resident of Papari village in Munsiyari runs a clothing store in the main town. He shows us videos of himself in gumboots slashing snow with a wooden stick in the high altitudes to tease out keeda jadi. His family of five is cared for thanks to him venturing into the mountains every year. The highest amount he has ever managed to earn by selling his haul in the last seven years is 03 lakh. This year he made Rs80000.

He loses his composure when he talks about keeda jadi’s price in the international market. “Our government is arresting us for selling something as natural and vital as keeda jadi” he says. “We work hard the land is ours we do the collection but everything is going to Nepal and China. Why does it have to be this way?”

At the Tribal Heritage Museum in Munsiyari samples of keeda jadi are quietly displayed behind a glass wall among artefacts of cooking pots bowls kettles and vanity boxes derived from the Bhotia people. An audio guide in Hindi blares out a guided tour of the private museum. When the narrator’s voice describes the discovery uses and abuses of the magic herb it encapsulates in a few pithy sentences the state of apathy keeda jadi lives under in India. “People are thoughtlessly scrambling for it. No one cares about tomorrow” it warns.

Yogesh Rawat a businessman lives with his wife and daughter a few hundred metres away from the museum. He is originally from Bauna village in Pithoragarh. The same village was one of the first Indian outposts to learn about keeda jadi in its own backyard in 1999. Rawat has grown up seeing elders in his family sell keeda jadi which at one point used to be Rs9000 per kilogram.

Yogesh Rawat | Sanjay Ahlawat

“It is not like the yield of this insect-herb has gone down in the mountains. It is still the same. It is just that more people now land up to look for it” says Rawat as he pulls out two rolled-up paper pouches of the dried-up insect herb. One is set to go to Rajasthan and will sell for Rs70000.

“I have the best stock” he says. “All my clients from Rajasthan and Haryana are sportspeople. I go to Delhi Haat to sell other medicinal herbs but also establish contacts for keeda jadi. Now I don’t have to go anywhere for marketing. I get calls sitting here in Munsiyari.”

Rawat once made 033 lakh just from a week’s haul of keeda jadi. “Going to collect this mushroom is always like entering the jaws of death. We almost skate with our bare feet. We go to Panchachuli and pitch tents there. We do kirtan bhajans and wear lightly shaded clothes because dark clothes are worn by the goddess Nanda Devi” says Rawat indicating the respectful ways to keep the mountain deity in good humour before undertaking the dangerous task of harvesting the insect-herb.

Rawat is related to Love Raj Singh Dharmshaktu who has climbed Mt Everest seven times. People who go up to search for keeda jadi are far more risk-taking trekkers Rawat says. His only mission is to promote the herb in his own proactive way. “If we give GST for this then it is not illegal. Indian scientists work for outsiders. If they spend one day on keeda jadi India will make crores. Uttarakhand will not have to sell alcohol”he says.

Rawat laments that research in the practical applications and medicinal uses of the herb is not done in India even if there is limited scientific evidence to back the claims. But keeda jadi has helped his family save money on medical expenses. His wife’s joint pain he says magically disappeared after its consistent use over 15 days.

“We keep eating this all the time. We just feel very light” he says. “When I eat this I can walk 5km instead of 1km. But you have to take it over a period of time. It is not like any English quick-fix medicine.”

Rawat wants the government to legalise the sale of keeda jadi for real conservation. “The maximum gold medals are won by Chinese athletes. Keeda jadi is the secret” he says. “I am sure Xi Jinping also eats this. He doesn’t ever grow old.”"

Chip Eng Seng will use proceeds to buy the 30pc it didn’t control of a five-star Maldives resort The Lagoon (also known as Samarafushi Lagoon) on the North Malé Atoll from its joint venture partner Tropical Developments Pte affiliate Amin Construction.

It is paying $1.46m in cash and will assume full responsibility for the $3m debt.

The buyer said by controlling the lot management can be more efficient.

The leasehold expires in 2066.

North Malé Atoll is 20 minutes from the capital (Malé) by speedboat.

Mr and Mrs Tang are also behind a $1.88 billion mixed-use complex 8 Shenton Way Singapore set to accommodate a 63 level building that country’s tallest.

In January the couple outlaid $545.6m for residential developer SingHaiyi Group.

CLAYTON Mo. — The U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday bypassed Centene Corp. (NYSE: CNC) in awarding $136 billion in contracts for the health insurance provided to active-duty military members a blow to the Clayton giant and St. Louis' largest public company by revenue which has long held some of the work.

The Defense Health Agency said it was awarding the TRICARE contract for its west region to TriWest Healthcare Alliance of Phoenix owned by Blue Cross Blue Shield nonprofits including Blue Shield of California Regence Blue Shield and BCBS of Arizona along with the University of Colorado Hospital Authority and the University of New Mexico Hospital.

The $65.1 billion contract held by Centene for years through its Health Net Federal Services subsidiary includes a 12-month transition-in period plus eight one-year option periods a Defense Department spokesman said. The west includes 1.5 million beneficiaries in Arkansas Illinois Louisiana Oklahoma Texas and Wisconsin.

Centene said in a statement that ""we are disappointed by the DHA's decision.""

""We have a debriefing scheduled with the DHA in early January and have requested details to which we are entitled under the government's procedure rules"" it said. ""Following receipt of this information we will be in a position to determine our options regarding the Agency's decision.""

Centene this year lost another major award when the California Department of Health Care Services announced in August its intent to award contracts for Medicaid managed care contracts to Centene’s subsidiary Health Net of California Inc. in nine counties but not in others including Los Angeles and Sacramento counties. Centene is preparing to take legal action if a California state agency rejects its protest over how bidders were chosen. And Centene which has had a stagnant stock price this year has grappled with allegations of improper Medicaid billing to states. It's set aside $1.1 billion to resolve the claims which are now also the subject of a shareholder lawsuit against ex-Centene executives.

Responding to Thursday's decision TriWest said in a statement that several entities were also assisting it with the work: Accenture Blue Health Intelligence BizFlow Cognitive Medical Systems eviCore EXL FindHelp HealthSparq IBM MDLIVE MyRevelations Omada PsychArmor PGBA Signature Performance and Wells Fargo.

It also said it previously held TRICARE contracts with the Defense Department for 17 years beginning in 1996 through 2013 also in the western U.S.

Utility officials said Friday that restoration efforts are taking longer than normal because of the extreme cold and road conditions.

Entergy Arkansas the state's largest utility said about 9800 customers in 36 counties were still without electricity Friday. Outages included a few of customers in counties across the state though about 4300 in Faulkner County and 1200 in Marion County remained without power.

""The damage reports are mostly wire down and wind-related causes"" spokesperson Kacee Kirschvink said Friday.

Entergy was hopeful outages would not spread through the weekend. ""We don't anticipate any problems but this freeze won't let up for some time so we aren't out of the woods yet"" Kirschvink said. ""We are working to restore power as quickly and as safely as possible and we will continue throughout the course of this cold spell.""

About 150 Texarkana customers of Southwestern Electric Power Co. were without electricity Friday. ""Those outages were primarily due to the extreme cold temperatures and wind"" spokesperson Tara Muck said Friday morning.

Like Entergy SWEPCO officials are not forecasting more outages.

""With the temperatures getting a little warmer and the wind not as strong our hope is we'll see fewer outages"" Muck said. ""But the cold is still a factor as we work to restore power. There are a lot of people using electricity right now. That is also a factor that comes into play.""

Both utilities noted restoration efforts are slowed by weather and slick roads.

""Customers may see estimated restoration times that are longer than usual"" Kirschvink said. ""That is because of the additional time it takes to restore power in the cold weather. As damage is assessed restoration times will be adjusted.""

Earlier Friday about 100 Little Rock customers of Summit Utilities lost gas service though it was restored by early afternoon. The pocket outage was in the Rock Creek area in West Little Rock. The outage shut off heat for customers in the Little Rock neighborhood west of Napa Valley Road and Hinson Road.

""Our teams have been working around the clock to prepare for this week's cold temperatures"" said Fred Kirkwood chief customer experience officer. ""Despite that fact the extremely cold temperatures have caused some of our regulator stations to freeze impacting the flow of gas to our customers.""

Summit which took over CenterPoint Energy's distribution assets in Arkansas in January has gotten off to a rocky start in the state as it converted billing systems. Last month dozens of Summit Utilities natural gas customers reported receiving multiple bills for the same service period and problems getting through to customer service to resolve the issue.

Roads are ""covered in black ice"" and visibility is limited the Minnesota State Patrol warned imploring drivers to slow down and buckle up. Windchill advisories and warnings were in place with windchills in the -30s across the state.

Statewide between 4:30 p.m. Friday and 11:30 a.m. Saturday there were 350 crashes 30 with injuries 282 spin outs and one jackknifed semi the patrol said.

Ferocious winds that pounded nearly every corner of Minnesota on Friday whipped up whiteouts and led state and county agencies to shut down thousands of miles of highways that in calmer conditions would have hummed with holiday travelers.

Instead most roads were empty as a blizzard packing winds in excess of 50 mph reduced visibility and pushed snow back onto plowed lanes. Several counties in southern Minnesota took plows off the roads until conditions improved the National Weather Service said.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation reopened Interstate 90 between Albert Lea and the South Dakota border but advised that road conditions are still difficult.

MnDOT also said ""no travel"" advisories will be lifted on several highways across south central and southwest Minnesota but some remain closed as snowplow crews continue working to clear drifts. MnDOT advises drivers to check 511 for the latest conditions.

Metro Transit said 43% of buses were delayed by an average of nine minutes at noon Saturday while light rail has ""stabilized.""

Widespread and prolonged periods of whiteout in frigid conditions led scores of motorists to stall or land in ditches across south and south-central Minnesota. Troopers had to remove several vehicles from the ditch along Hwys. 71 and 68 south and west of Redwood Falls said Sgt. Troy Christianson with the State Patrol.

""First responders are swamped"" said Minnesota Department of Transportation spokeswoman Sandra Schlagel. On Friday afternoon Gov. Tim Walz declared a peacetime emergency in response to the storm activating the Minnesota National Guard to assist with rescuing motorists.

Conditions were bad enough that Meeker County in central Minnesota and Freeborn Jackson Mower and Blue Earth counties in southern Minnesota pulled plows off roads Friday afternoon.

Travel was not advised across much of the west southern and central parts of the state where a blizzard warning remained in effect until Saturday morning. Winds consistently howling between 35 to 50 mph made for tough going even in the southern metro counties of Dakota and Scott also included in the blizzard warning.

""You create your own emergency if you stall spin out or crash"" said Anne Meyer another MnDOT spokeswoman. ""That is why we don't want people going out when travel is not advised.""

Few people were out and about in Blue Earth where the lack of traffic on I-90 made for a slow morning at the Farmer's Daughters Kitchen about 40 miles west of Albert Lea. The eatery located just off the freeway is normally packed for Friday breakfast said owner Becki Steier.

""We had some customers this morning but it's quiet now"" she said. Scores of trucks were idled at a truck stop across the street she said.

Down the road in Fairmont Hannah Johnson a property supervisor at the Quality Inn said she'd seen only a handful of travelers make reservations to get out of the blizzard. Likewise she saw just a few vehicles on the road while she was out shoveling.

Johnson said she didn't mind the blizzard. ""It's going to be Christmas soon and we're going to have all this snow.""

The North Pole-like weather was felt along the North Shore of Lake Superior. Grand Marais had the second-strongest wind gust ever recorded at the harbor clocked at 74 mph Friday morning according to the Weather Service in Duluth.

Slick conditions in the Twin Cities led to crashes and spin outs all day MnDOT said.

Air travelers suffered for the second straight day as close to 5000 flights were canceled nationwide by Friday afternoon. At Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport there were 157 cancellations of incoming or departing flights by 3 p.m. according to the flight tracking website flightaware.com.

Amtrak scrubbed Empire Builder runs between Chicago and Seattle through Sunday. The train stops at Union Depot in St. Paul. Metro Transit buses were rolling but many were running late.

Travelers weren't the only ones experiencing setbacks. UPS Amazon and FedEx officials said severe weather could cause delays for Christmas deliveries.

Philip Ekman owner of Albertville-based Platinum Courier Service said the weather had not slowed the 20 drivers he employs.

""For the most part they're pretty hardy people"" he said.

But the heavy snow and intense cold prompted customers to scale back on deliveries that were not considered essential and could be postponed Ekman said.

For Christmas presents that needed to be delivered on time Ekman said Platinum was not slowing down. One of his drivers picked up an expensive watch at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and was on the road to deliver the gift in Michigan he said.

With frigid conditions expected to continue into next week CenterPoint Energy and Xcel Energy asked customers to consider temporarily lowering thermostat settings to conserve energy and save on heating bills. Both utilities said they were seeing a short-term rise in natural gas market prices due to the extreme cold across much of the country.

""Consider conserving natural gas for the next few days because the wholesale cost is passed on directly to customers"" read a statement from Xcel Energy.

CenterPoint Energy recommended settings at 65 degrees during the day and 60 degrees when asleep or away from home.

Sunday should bring a sunny Christmas morning with temperatures in the single digits and a chance of snow toward evening. By midweek a thaw could mean highs above freezing Wednesday and Thursday.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

Both,"PERSPECTIVE

As good life appeared to be a mirage in the Niger Delta idealistic young men who went by the militants’ label decided to make a reality show of ransom or death (or both) with the lives of those in the region perceived to be the oppressors and their collaborators.

For them agitation was the instrument of peace and war and inexplicably the means to development. However beneath the exuberant idealism was an unmistaken quest for personal power personal wealth personal prestige and personal survival.

The creeks and the mangroves developed claws and eyes and muscles which could kill and suck blood.

No one was safe

At the centre of the game was the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) and its numerous mutations. What started with the hoisting of the flag for self-determination and justice transformed into something more sinister. “Many groups were emerging and regrouping for the purpose of this protest and agitation” says Oturubo one of the region’s leaders.

He adds “the mission was getting bad as individuals started fighting for their economic survival. The agitation got into sea piracy oil bunkering hostage taking and kidnapping for ransom. In a camp three or four people can gather themselves for operations. This was helped because gun was easy to get in the Niger Delta. Every community has its own armoury as individuals also have guns.”

The genie was out of the bottle and wreaking havoc.

When Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan a native of Ogbia in Bayelsa State became Nigeria’s president following the death of his principal (Umaru Musa Yar’Adua) he tried to improve on the Amnesty Programme which had been initiated by President Olusegun Obasanjo and begun by Yar’Adua before his passing. He developed a personal rapport with some of the leaders especially the taciturn but larger-than life Tompolo a honcho of MEND. But that only diminished the violence. Fregene says “sixty per cent of our brothers in this Niger Delta are militant in character and they have been engaged in the different inter-ethnic crises.”

The situation was developing its own momentum and self-perpetuation. The inter and intra-ethnic crises whetted the appetite of the devil and now the situation was becoming difficult to control. In Fregene’s words: “During this period they took up arms against one another. They were well-trained on how to use guns on how to shoot. In this process of counter exchanges they knew how to fight. Then in each area there would be one person like a kingpin who is taking care of the fighters.

He becomes the “General Officer Commanding” (GOC). So as a politician or top businessman you know you must get this person to your side. You now engage these people and fund them. You pay them give them security contract and with this funding the GOC maintains these fighters. He spreads money around.”

Trouble too was not in short supply

Emegere was one of those hired by the company to troubleshoot in the treacherous terrain of the Niger Delta. In 2011 some vandals had blown up an oil pipeline somewhere in the riverine area of Ondo State. Chevron followed due process of informing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) the state and federal governments and the affected community. Thereafter a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) was arranged with Emegere representing Chevron to ascertain the cause of the spillage.

Some armed mobile policemen were attached to the JIV team which left Warri for Ondo State. Emegere says that members did not know that some informants including those working with the Ondo State government may have been in touch with some elements with sinister intention. He recalls: “When we got to Igbokoda Ondo State we were to leave the jetty and board the boat but those who received us said we don’t need to go with our police escorts. They said they already have armed police escorts who would accompany us there.”

Emegere did not suspect any hanky-panky. So he and his colleagues boarded the boat and soon they were off on the unmarked path off the lagoon. It was when they got to a remote location where Chevron was not operating that he had a sense of foreboding. They knew that they were literally in hot soup. Suddenly their captors who had hitherto been calm became hostile. They said before they could visit the area of the oil spillage the JIV team had to visit the area’s traditional ruler. This was not what was discussed earlier but Emegere and the others bowed when it was clear they had no choice.

Thus began a nine-day nightmare

That makeshift “house” was an elaborate hut built on stilts on the lagoon. It represents the ugly face of the Niger Delta. It has no light no potable water no modern conveniences. It is just the old-style hut which has been used for generations before the Ilaje people realised that they were rich in hydrocarbons. That unsteady house represents the permanence of problem for the people of the Niger Delta. Emegere and his colleague were marched outside into the endless mangrove. They kept them in the mangrove from about 1 pm until sunset. At about 8 pm they ferried the captives to another community.

With their prized captives the kidnappers began negotiations with Chevron which was ready to do everything permissible within its policy regarding employees’ safety and welfare to ensure that its staff were unharmed and freed. The kidnappers kept their captives in a small room with neither electricity nor any other facility for modern living. They were fed sparingly. It was a harrowing experience. Emegere became ill. “I think it was malaria so they got me Fansidar – an antimalarial medicine. On the day we were released I could barely walk. Chevron had to send a helicopter to Igbokoda to move me to Warri clinic. I was on admission for days.”

Emegere believes his kidnap was an elaborate operation planned and executed with the active involvement of a commissioner in the Ondo State government. He also came face-to-face with the logistics of kidnapping with the support staff of caterers and doctors to ensure that the high profile hostages remained alive as bargaining chips. He came to realise that his company too had a sophisticated proactive infrastructure to deal with such emergency. With the kidnap Chevron swung into action and eventually succeeded in getting the hostages released. The company knew it was now in a different kind of war. It was a new dangerous Niger Delta.

To some Niger Delta leaders kidnapping was a legitimate weapon of the struggle. Their main targets were the staff of the oil companies especially the expatriates who were seen as more valuable hostages. But once you are a staff of an IOC you were a potential victim.

Before kidnapping became a way of life in the labyrinthine Niger Delta staff of Chevron were free to interact with members of the neighboring communities. They had friends and sometimes they went out on furlough in the neigbouring villages and towns. It was a good and peaceful environment before the Warri crisis was ignited. Since then the oil companies had learnt to take pre-cautionary measures.

Rilwanu believes he was taking the right precautions. Then came 25 July 2003. It was a Friday. It was also his birthday and his daughter’s. Early that morning he had packed his bag to spend the weekend in Benin and celebrate with members of his family. As was his habit he would call John Ashima his direct boss usually by 6.45 every morning. If Ashima did not receive his call by 6.50 am he would call him as they always talked before the usual 7 am leadership meeting in Escravos.

By 6.30 am he stepped out of his house and entered his car. In a jiffy three men emerged and asked him to step out. He knew he was in trouble. When his boss called him at 6.50 am the phone rang and rang but there was no reply. He (Ashima) knew there must be trouble. When he still could not get through he contacted Rilwanu’s neighbours and they told him that what he feared had happened. By 7.30 am the entire Chevron management was aware of what had happened. The company had to work collaboratively with the state government to secure his release.

His kidnappers told Rilwanu that they had been trailing him for more than a month for he was their specific target. They even trailed him to his home in Benin but did not have the opportunity to capture him. They tried to set him up with ladies but Rilwanu was not a ladies’ man. They said he was a straightforward but stubborn man. They knew their quarry well and were joyous that they had captured such an important prisoner.

They took him to a safe house in Warri where they kept him for two days. The kidnappers did not try to hide their identity. They told him they were Ijaws representing the Egbema National Development Forum (ENDF). They wanted their community to be recognised as one of the oil-producing communities within Chevron operations. Chevron had no business in that community. They believed this kidnap would get them what they wanted. Rilwanu knew his life was in the hands of these hard men. He prayed hard.

By virtue of his job he also interfaces with the government making him quite popular.

Rilwanu’s direct supervisor was at the centre of efforts to get him freed. The company contacted Governor Ibori who then summoned the State Security Council. For them the kidnap had come too close to the centre of the state. They employed all the resources at their disposal to look for Rilwanu and that was why the kidnappers were moving him regularly.

They knew Chevron would not pay ransom and therefore they settled for the olive branch offered by the government of Ibori who promised to investigate their grievances. On the eighth day the kidnappers quietly dropped Rilwanu on a side street in Warri and told him he was free.

Many years after the memory of that ordeal still holds Rilwanu captive. He said he could not drive alone and anytime a vehicle overtook him his heart would skip a beat or two. It is as if the kidnappers could again emerge from the shadows and present him with another nightmare.

As he had promised Ibori persuaded the various ethnic groups in Delta State to accept government proposal on the sharing of benefits from the oil companies. The state government fused the ijaw kingdoms of Gbaramatu Egbema Ogulagha together as offshore stakeholders in NNPC/Chevron JV operation – in a bid to accept joint recognition as offshore community stakeholders. According to Rilwanu: “Government was able to impose a political solution by merging them. It just fused the three kingdoms together. This (was what) gave birth to the Gbaramatu Egbema and Oghulagha Coastal Community Front (GEOCCF).”

The state government’s formula brought relative peace. With the intervention of the state government it became easier to engage the communities in constant dialogue so that they would understand and appreciate the changing circumstance of the oil industry. Part of these engagements includes explanation on the declining production suffered by all oil producing companies since the emergence of community crises.

The Delta State Government tackled the primary cause of the conflict which was the sharing of political power. The government knew the tussle for the control of the Warri South-West Local Government Council was a festering sore dividing the Itsekiri and the Ijaw. After Ibori was sworn-in as governor on 29 May 1999 he moved to create a working relationship between the leadership of the two ethnic groups. His government brought them to Benin City (capital of Edo State). It was here after many days of negotiations that the Delta State Government was able to broker peace and reach an acceptable agreement on power sharing.

Seven years after that nightmare precisely on July 8 2010 Rilwanu was captured again.

Fifteen projects are being funded in 2022.

The annual event is among the fundraising activities of OSC an annual charity drive run by the Post and public broadcaster RTHK since 1988.

About 200 players took part in a five-a-side football tournament co-organised by the Hong Kong Football Club (HKFC) and Operation Santa Claus (OSC) at the Happy Valley Recreation Ground on November 27.

As football fans around the world were swept up in World Cup frenzy a group of children and adults in Hong Kong laced up their boots for a sports tournament that involved pitching in for charity.

The football tournament has been held since 1998.

“It’s one of the highlights of the Operation Santa Claus fundraising period” said Jim Gould RTHK’s head of the English programme service.

“The objective is to create a good fun experience for all the teams for everybody taking part and to allow everybody to contribute and take part in a happy healthy activity” he added.

“And it’s always enjoyable for the players the teams and for their supporters their families mums and dads” he said. “I’m very grateful to everybody who took part.”

Long involved in the tournament HKFC fielded teams and generated cash contributions for OSC in addition to taking part in the organisation of the tournament.

“We are very fortunate to be able to cooperate with SCMP and RTHK and help organise this event” Mark Grainger the club’s football section chairman said.

“With the profile of OSC – it’s been in Hong Kong for so long everybody knows about it – I think it’s a very positive message to the community especially to the club to understand that we through football were able to support OSC. And it’s nice to be part of it” he said.

“It’s just fabulous for the kids participating” Grainger added.

A total of 27 teams competed in the Junior U10 Boys Tournament Junior U12 Boys Tournament Junior U12 Girls Tournament and the Adult Tournament. HKFC was among the winners in each category.

“We played very well. It was a bit nerve-racking at the end but we’ve got the best goalkeeper” said Athena Grabowski 11 of the HKFC team that won in the U12 Girls competition.

“I think it’s really fun doing what you love and doing it for charity as well” she added.

Grabowski’s teammate Lola Miller also 11 could barely contain her excitement.

“I feel happy playing football and I get to play with my friends” she said.

In the adult tournament the Cup honours went to the teams representing Savills Property Management and financial giant UBS.

“We’ve supported this event for the last 10 years” said Ian Yip Wing-hoi Savills acting senior director who leads the company’s football team.

“Environmental social and corporate governance is part of our company culture and we are dedicated to fulfilling our CSR responsibilities. We’re very happy to support this charity event” he said.

“Staff wellness is also part of our ESG objectives. The company sponsors the football team. We actually play every week and we also trained specifically for this tournament.”

UBS also said it was deeply committed to the event.

“OSC is a big thing for UBS. Every December or late November we will have a lot of fundraising activities for OSC” said David Pun Hiu-lok the company’s executive director. “We have joined this football tournament for many years.”

He added the team was well-prepared for the match.

“We held some internal games to select the best players in UBS. Best not just in terms of skill but also for their spirit and for having a heart that wants to do something good for society” Pun said.

“We have observed a lot of world-class games at the World Cup” he said adding his team members had stayed up until 6am the night before their match to watch the global tournament.

Chubb Insurance another participant found the event worthwhile in more ways than one.

“We find it very meaningful and at the same time we can do some exercise as well. One important thing is to build the team spirit” said Charles Lui Ka-kui head of financial lines at Chubb.",,,,,,,,,

Construction is nearing completion on the St. Charbel Maronite Church in Doha Qatar with plans to open its doors to worshippers in 2025 coinciding with the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year according to Father Charbel Mhanna from Qatar’s Maronite parish.

In an interview with ACI Mena CNA’s Arabic-language news partner Mhanna explained that with a capacity of about 3000 people St. Charbel will be the country’s largest church open to all Catholics. Once completed it will be Qatar’s second Catholic church joining the existing Church of Our Lady of the Rosary.

While precise statistics on the Christian population in Qatar are lacking Mhanna estimates there are close to 1 million Christians there of which about 70% are Catholic. Approximately 12000 belong to the Maronite rite which is in full communion with the pope.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2Jsb2NrY2x1YmNoaWNhZ28ub3JnLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvYXMtdXB0b3ducy1vdXItbGFkeS1vZi1sb3VyZGVzLWNodXJjaC1zZXQtdG8tY2xvc2UtbmVpZ2hib3JzLWhvcGUtdG8tbGFuZG1hcmstYnV5LWNodXJjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Uptown's Our Lady Of Lourdes Church Set To Close Neighbors Hope To Landmark Buy Church,"UPTOWN — Parishioners of an Uptown church that is slated to close are organizing to landmark and possibly buy the church to keep it open.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church 4640 N. Ashland Ave. will host its last Mass May 19 as the parish is set to merge with St. Mary of the Lake in Buena Park.

That merger has been opposed by some supporters of Our Lady of Lourdes who hope to protect the 108-year-old church from demolition by landmarking it. They then plan to buy the church campus from the Archdiocese of Chicago so they can reopen it.

The group launched a nonprofit Our Lady of Lourdes Preservation Society to further its efforts.

“We’ve seen time and time again remarkable religious buildings sold to the highest bidder and often times undermined and demolished” said Ward Miller executive director of Preservation Chicago which is supporting the parishioners. “We have to save these kinds of buildings honor their stories and honor the communities and people that built them.”

If organizers can landmark and buy the church they plan to reopen it as a historical shrine said Maricelle Garcia vice president of Our Lady of Lourdes Preservation Society. They would also restore the church’s community programs like its food pantry and immigrant services and would convert the rectory into a bed and breakfast to fund maintenance Garcia said.

The group is already working with a few donors and plans to continue fundraising so it can create an endowment to preserve the church.

“We’ve been told that we need to find ways to sustain this financially and we can do it through our donors income-generating projects and through our fundraising” Garcia said.

Organizers are asking neighbors to reach out to Ald. Matt Martin (47th) to ask him to request a landmark designation for Our Lady of Lourdes Church.

Martin is “receptive to preservation goals” and working to facilitate a conversation between the nonprofit and the archdiocese said Lucy Nye director of developmental and business affairs at the 47th Ward office. The alderman is also speaking with preservationists to “make sure they understand what they would need to be able to purchase the building from the Archdiocese and maintain the building for the long” Nye said.

“Ald. Martin supports the preservation of Our Lady of Lourdes church building” Nye said in a statement. “Our priority is to ensure that the building is put to productive use to guarantee that the structure is cared for and maintained in the long term which requires adequate funding and organization.”

Our Lady of Lourdes merged with Buena Park’s St. Mary of the Lake in 2021 as part of the archdiocese’s effort to consolidate church resources. Since then Our Lady of Lourdes’ school building has been sold to developer Honore Properties who will turn the building into 42 apartments.

After the final Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes future celebrations will be held at St. Mary of the Lake 4220 N. Sheridan Road. All sacred items will be brought there as well according to a February announcement from church leadership.

The nonprofit has not yet approached the pastor or archdiocese to ask about buying the church said Susan Thomas spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Chicago. Thomas said Mass attendance at Our Lady of Lourdes “steadily dropped” in the past few years.

Of the 85 people who attend English Mass 65 percent expressed interest in attending Mass at St. Mary of the Lake while 92 percent of the 300 parishioners who attend Spanish Mass agreed to shift parishes as well Thomas said.

“The archdiocese’s Renew My Church team has identified that in order for a church site to be viable it needs an average participation of 800 people every Sunday to support vibrant ministries” Thomas said in a statement. “This is a very difficult moment but the parish life cannot end when a church building closes. The staff is committed to the spiritual well-being of all parishioners who worship at St. Mary of the Lake and Our Lady of Lourdes Parish.”

Our Lady of Lourdes held its first Mass in October 1892 on the southwest corner of Ashland and Leland avenues.

When the city widened Ashland Avenue in 1929 a team of 50 men and horses lifted the 10000-ton church from its foundation and moved it across the street according to Open House Chicago’s website. Once it was moved crews rotated it 90 degrees cut it in half and added a 30-foot expansion in the middle.

“This church has a lot of historical significance both architecturally and spiritually” said Katarina Garcia president of Our Lady of Lourdes Preservation Society. “Some people who’ve prayed in the grotto have gotten their miracles.”

People travel from all over the world to see the grotto at Our Lady of Lourdes in Uptown said Maria Precious Deang treasurer of the nonprofit and former church staff member. It’s a replica of the famous Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in France which is a cavernous holy site for Catholics.

The grotto is one of the only perpetual adoration sites in the area. In 1992 the Uptown church’s grotto was opened 24/7 as a place of worship but its hours were reduced when the church merged with St. Mary of the Lake. The grotto will be closed along with the church May 19.

“We have people from all over the world and of all different religions who come” Deang said. “Especially in these days with all that’s going on in the world people need a place to come for refuge. They need a place where they feel secure no matter what religion or nationality they are.”

Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

Taking place on May 2 Orthodox Holy Thursday the ordination was conducted at St. Nektarios Mission Parish near Harare Zimbabwe by the archbishop of Zimbabwe Metropolitan Serafim.

The St. Phoebe Center for the Deaconess a U.S.-based organization that has advocated for reviving the ancient female diaconate said in a press release that Molen’s ordination would prepare the way for the restoration of the role in other branches of the Orthodox Church. The group’s board chair Dr. Carrie Frost wrote: “Being the first to do anything is always a challenge but the Patriarchate of Alexandria has courageously chosen to lead the way with Metropolitan Serafim laying his hands on Deaconess Angelic.”

According to the release Molen said: “At first I was nervous about going into the altar but when Metropolitan Serafim blessed me to enter the altar as part of my preparation this week those feelings went away and I felt comfortable. I am ready.” According to the St. Phoebe Center Molen was well received by her community and parish.

“The Alexandrian Patriarchate in Africa felt the need to revive this order to serve the daily pastoral needs of Orthodox Christians in Africa” the release read. Metropolitan Serafim said that Molen will have both liturgical and pastoral roles. He said: “She is going to do what the deacon is doing in the liturgy and in all the sacraments in our Orthodox services.”

Serafim added that “one of the most important fields of work of the deaconess was the exercise of the works of love. They were the angels of mercy and the visiting sisters of the sick the ‘grieving’ and poor women imparting to them the gifts of Christian love.”

One of the important functions of deaconesses will be to distribute the Eucharist even while their role will not be identical to the work of their counterparts of more than 1000 years ago. However he noted that “we must admit that women can offer the Orthodox Church a great missionary work” as well as evangelism and teaching and highlighted their missionary catechetical and teaching work. After her ordination Molen distributed the holy Eucharist which in the Byzantine rite is given via spoon and includes the body and the blood.

The Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa has been on the way to diaconal ordination of women for several years. At a 2016 synod in Alexandria Egypt the Patriarchate voted to reinstate the female diaconate. In 2017 the Patriarchate ordained six sub-deaconesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Among the functions of deaconesses may be baptism which in Orthodox churches is conducted by full immersion. In the early Church full immersion for adults was followed by anointing of the whole body which required the assistance of deaconesses for the sake of propriety.

According to the 1917 Catholic Encyclopedia the only mention of a deaconess in the Bible is in St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans (16:1) which refers to Phoebe as diakonos or “servant” even while no official status was implied. However citing testimony by Roman author Pliny the encyclopedia says “there can be no question that before the middle of the fourth century women were permitted to exercise certain definite functions in the Church and were known by the special name of diakonoi or diakonissai.” The fourth-century apostolic constitutions include instructions for the ordination to the female diaconate.

Despite the ancient practice Pope Francis has declared it is impossible for women to be ordained to the priesthood or diaconate."

The Clifton-based college detected unauthorized access to the network on Nov. 2 and an investigation was launched in consultation with outside cybersecurity professionals according to a notice posted to Cincinnati State's website on Friday.

The incident was also reported to law enforcement according to the notice.

Following the investigation Cincinnati State discovered certain files − containing personal information − were removed from portions of its network between Oct. 30 and Nov. 2 the notice states.

The data included full names addresses dates of birth Social Security numbers driver’s licenses or state identification numbers health insurance information and financial account information the notice states.

Cincinnati State sent out notifications on Friday via mail to the individuals whose information was contained within the impacted files the notice states.

""Impacted individuals are encouraged to take steps to protect themselves against identity fraud including placing a fraud alert/security freeze on their credit files obtaining free credit reports and remaining vigilant in reviewing financial account statements and credit reports for fraudulent or irregular activity on a regular basis"" the notice reads.

The notice didn't specifically say whether students' information was impacted by the breach. A college spokesperson has yet to respond to an email from The Enquirer seeking comment.

Cincinnati State is working with its information technology department to implement additional security measures to prevent similar breaches from occurring in the future.

For anyone who has questions or needs additional information regarding this incident Cincinnati State has set up a toll free response line at 1-855-763-5165.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Straits Times

Dec 23 2022

An enforcement officer who was authorised to apprehend offenders for having illegal tobacco-related products ended up pocketing more than $1000 worth of those that were voluntarily disposed of by incoming travellers at the airport.

Mohan Raj Akilan 31 was sentenced to three months’ jail and fined $800 on Friday after he pleaded guilty to one charge of receiving stolen property and another charge of possessing an imitation tobacco product.

Another charge was taken into consideration during the Malaysian’s sentencing.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Hsiao Tien said Mohan was employed by Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Force as an enforcement officer between April 19 2011 and Aug 8 2022.

He was deployed around May 2021 to the enforcement operation unit under the Tobacco Regulation Branch (TRB) of the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) which outsourced tobacco enforcement works to Certis.

One of the duties of officers in that branch is to collect prohibited tobacco-related products that were voluntarily disposed of by travellers entering Singapore via Changi Airport.

They can dispose of these products without any repercussions by filling up a voluntary disposal receipt and an immigration officer will discard the item in a bin which is locked.

Every week or whenever the bins are full or nearly full HSA will issue ad hoc requests to Certis to collect the items that will eventually be destroyed at an incineration plant in Tuas.

Some time in 2021 and 2022 DPP Tan said several TRB officers tasked to perform the collection began misappropriating contraband cigarettes e-vaporisers and e-vaporiser pod products after they realised there was an opportunity for them to do so.

They realised that no other staff member would be around when they transferred the discarded items into empty black bins.

They also realised there was no record of the amount description or weight of the items collected and no procedure to ensure that the items collected tallied with the items declared in the disposal receipts.

So the officers pocketed a portion of the contraband items when transferring the contents into the black bins and packed them in a separate plastic bag.

After the remaining products were packed into the black bins they kept the separate plastic bag in the Certis van parked at the carpark.

The misappropriated items would then be shared among the team of TRB officers on collection duty at the airport.

On some occasions they would also share the misappropriated items with other TRB officers including Mohan.

DPP Tan said: “Gradually the sharing of misappropriated items among the Certis TRB officers became an ‘open secret’ or ‘unspoken rule’ among them.”

Some time between June and July 2021 Mohan received $1417 worth of tobacco-related products including 40 packs of e-vaporiser pods and seven e-vaporisers from a fellow enforcement officer.

For receiving stolen property he could have been jailed for up to five years fined or both.

Meanwhile another officer from the same unit was jailed on Friday for three weeks for forging forms documenting illegal tobacco products he had confiscated from trainee officers.

Mohamad Nor Amali Halmi a 35-year-old Malaysian who was employed by People Advantage a member of the Certis Group got the trainee officers to sign on the initial documents he sent to his team supervisor.

But when his supervisor could not locate the documents Amali forged a new set of documents after he could not get the trainees to sign them again.",,,,,,,,,

It strained their budgets reduced their spending power and clobbered their 401(k) balances. Despite a recent burst of positive news—moderating gas prices and a slowing pace of inflation—many believe the economy will be in worse shape in 2023 than it is now.

Whatever the next 12 months bring there are some simple steps you can take now to prepare your finances for any further economic uncertainty.

Move cash to banking accounts that yield more in interest and charge less in fees. Cancel unused memberships and negotiate charges on those you keep. Review 401(k) contributions and allocations.

It might pay to act with urgency. Some financial benefits that could make a difference expire on New Year’s Eve. Here are six money moves to consider making before breaking out the bubbly:

Earn more on your savings

Keeping your cash in a typical savings account right now is only marginally better than stuffing it under a mattress. The average annual interest rate on savings accounts at all banks is 0.268% according to the financial site DepositAccounts.com meaning $1000 in savings will yield barely enough to buy a slice of pizza.

Some of the lowest rates are at the biggest institutions. Customers of the five largest U.S. banks could have earned $42 billion more on their balances in the third quarter just by moving their cash to higher yielding accounts at other banks by one estimate. Some online-only accounts for example pay rates around 4% and can be linked to an existing account for easy transfers.

The payoff involved in moving your cash away from the biggest banks is currently greater than at any point in the last decade according to Ken Tumin the founder of DepositAccounts which is owned by the financial-services marketplace LendingTree.

True optimizers might appreciate MaxMyInterest a service that in exchange for a 0.08% annual fee on their holdings monitors which banks offer the highest interest rates and allows customers to reallocate their cash accordingly on a regular basis.

For those willing to sacrifice some liquidity one of the best risk-free returns right now comes from inflation-adjusted I Bonds which currently pay out 6.89% but must be held for at least a year. Americans can buy up to $10000 of these U.S. government-backed savings bonds each calendar year so those who want to max out their purchases should do so before January says Mr. Tumin. The interest rate on these bonds is based on a calculation tied to the consumer-price index one reason they became popular this year as inflation surged.

After I Bonds Mr. Tumin suggests considering certificates of deposit or Treasury securities some of which offer higher rates than those of the top online savings accounts; for instance a six-month T-bill purchased Thursday would yield about 4.66% on an annualized basis. That said temporarily tying up your money could mean missing out on better yields soon if the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates.

Finding a home for your cash that pays higher yields won’t make you rich but it can give you some protection from inflation says Gary Zimmerman the CEO of MaxMyInterest. Even some of the best options have still been outpaced by inflation recently. “The real return on cash may be negative but it would be even more negative if you’re complacent about where you keep your cash"" he says.

Switch your bank accounts

Banking changed dramatically over the last two decades but chances are the institution you bank with hasn’t. Americans stick with the same primary checking and savings accounts for about 17 years on average according to a Bankrate survey. That is longer than the average marriage.

It is worth regularly shopping around to make sure you’re still getting the best deal says Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com particularly if you are paying any ATM or monthly maintenance fees. It is now easy to find a bank that offers those services free he said and the benefits could outweigh the inconvenience of switching institutions.

For example customers who typically carry a low balance in their checking account may benefit from choosing accounts with an extended overdraft grace period. One institution Citizens Financial Group added a feature to some of its checking accounts that gives customers who overdraft until 10 p.m. the following business day to cover the negative balance to avoid fees.

A customer who has more than $250000 which is the maximum amount per depositor that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. may also benefit from switching to a brokerage that can offer more insurance coverage by partnering with multiple FDIC-regulated banks. One brokerage giant Fidelity Investments allows customers to hold up to $3 million in insured deposits in its cash management account through partnerships with 26 banks.

Many new financial-technology companies offer even more specialized features bundled with checking accounts. LiliApp Inc. an online-only bank for gig-economy workers and entrepreneurs includes a tax-write-off tracker with its checking account. Majority a digital bank for migrants offers unlimited international transfers as part of its monthly subscription fee.

Cancel your subscriptions

This time of year many Americans sign up for gym memberships as part of a resolution to lose a few pounds. It is also a good time to cancel unused memberships to shed a few bucks from your budget.

The average American spends more than $200 a month on subscription fees and underestimates the cost by roughly $130 according to a study by C+R Research earlier this year. Roughly three quarters of consumers say it is easy to forget about recurring charges and 42% admitted that they were still paying for a subscription they had forgotten about.

The monthly costs associated with streaming services subscription boxes gym memberships and mobile apps have all crept higher over the past year according to data from Rocket Money which operates a personal finance app that tracks spending. Subscription spending among Rocket Money members increased an average of 8.5% this year compared with 2021. Once you authorize a company to take recurring payments from your account they can change the price without asking permission making it easy to lose track of exactly how much you are spending.

This is a good moment to take stock in the recurring payments you may have forgotten said Yahya Mokhtarzad chief revenue officer at Rocket Money. “This year more than recent years it is important to not just take stock of your finances but to really cut unneeded expenses and brace for what could be a tough 2023"" he said.

Renegotiate your bills

For all the recurring bills you cannot cancel pick up the phone and negotiate.

Cable companies and wireless providers may be willing to lower your bill since it costs more to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one said Ted Rossman a consumer-spending analyst at Bankrate.

Don’t be afraid to ask the company for your old rate back or to match a competitor’s price he said. There is often an unadvertised retention discount to keep customers from canceling. You can also request any deals and discounts being offered to new customers even if you’re a longtime subscriber he said.

If you’re asking for a lower rate with a service provider such as your wireless company be aware that you may be offered a promotional rate that increases significantly after an initial period expires said Sophie Raseman head of financial solutions at Brightside a company that provides financial guidance to workers. Set a reminder to cancel or downgrade then she said.

Another way to cut costs is to ask that certain fees be removed from your statement. These charges include line items on your phone internet or cable bill and may appear as “other fees.""

If your first attempt to negotiate isn’t successful call again on a different day as you may have more success with a different customer-service representative said Bruce McClary senior vice president at National Foundation for Credit Counseling.

Check your 401(k)

The standard advice for retirement plans is to let them run on autopilot and to resist the temptation to check your account and make changes when markets are down.

But at least once a year it pays to log into your accounts and review your savings rate investment mix and the types of tax-advantaged accounts you use. The S&P 500 stock index is down 19.3% this year through Friday and U.S. intermediate-term bond funds are down 12.4%; investors should rebalance if their asset allocation has strayed from their long-term targets.

The Internal Revenue Service recently raised the annual 401(k) contribution limit $2000 to $22500 for 2023 the largest increase ever in terms of dollars and percentage according to benefits provider Milliman. For those 50 or older the 2023 limit rises to $30000.

“You should avoid checking too often based on what the market did that day but you need to check in periodically to make sure your choices are still aligned with your long-term retirement goals"" said Mike Shamrell a vice president at Fidelity Investments.

As inflation strains budgets some Americans have had to make temporary reductions in 401(k) savings. The good news: The impact of doing so—even for a few years—isn’t as big as you might think provided you have a plan to catch up later.

For those able to save more the higher contribution limits create an “unprecedented opportunity"" said Ed Slott a certified public accountant and IRA specialist in Rockville Centre N.Y.

More investors with money in workplace retirement plans now have the option of choosing between a traditional 401(k) where contributions are deducted and withdrawals are taxed and a Roth 401(k) where contributions are taxed and distributions can be tax-free. Workers can also divide their 401(k) contributions between the two.

Using some of each could pay off down the road. One advantage to putting some money into a Roth is that retirees can pull money out tax-free in years when dipping into a regular 401(k) would push them into a higher bracket.

Don’t wait until it is too late

It doesn’t pay to procrastinate. A number of important financial benefits that could improve the position of your household in 2023 expire on New Year’s Eve.

Make your financial gifts: Families can give gifts of up to $16000 to an unlimited number of people without triggering estate or gift tax. That amount known as the annual exclusion jumps to $17000 for 2023.

A special rule lets donors use five years worth of annual exclusion gifts at once to superfund 529 college savings plans which let parents grandparents and others invest money to be used for a beneficiary’s qualified education expenses. That works out to $80000 per beneficiary account for 2022.

“Paying for education is a really efficient way to transfer wealth"" says Elisa Shevlin Rizzo a chief fiduciary officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management in New York.

A separate rule lets individuals pay anyone’s qualified education expenses and medical bills without estate or gift tax consequences if they make payments directly to the school or medical provider.

Donors who give away more than $16000 to anyone must report the gifts on a federal gift tax return Form 709. Any excess amount counts toward the amount you can give during your lifetime or at death and be exempt from federal estate and gift taxes. That exemption is $12.06 million per person for 2022 and rises to $12.9 million for 2023.

Use your healthcare accounts: Many workers have bigger balances than usual in their workplace healthcare flexible-spending accounts which allow employees to set aside pretax money from their paychecks to pay for medical expenses because of special Covid-related FSA carry-over rules. Now they are facing a Dec. 31 deadline to use their money or forfeit it. Check your FSA balance and your plan’s spend down rules now.

Take your losses: This year’s painful selloff brings an opportunity for investors to harvest losses in their brokerage accounts. Taxpayers who sell investments including crypto at a loss through Dec. 31 can offset gains on winners and up to $3000 of ordinary income on their 2022 tax return. Unused losses carry over to future years.

Make your required withdrawals: In most cases taxpayers 72 and older must take annual required minimum distributions or RMDs from traditional individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s by Dec. 31 or face a penalty of 50% of the amount they should have withdrawn. One exception: Those who turned 72 this year can wait until April 1 2023 to take their first RMD. Inherited IRAs both traditional and Roth have RMDs too with special rules for IRAs inherited in 2020 or later. A bill passed by Congress Friday raises the RMD age to 73 in 2023 and 75 in 2033 and reduces the penalty for missed RMDs.

A press release from the Sheriff’s Office reports officers were called to a robbery at the Citizens Bank and Trust on Wednesday around 1:45 pm.

The reporting party stated an individual wearing all black and a ski mask came into the bank pulled a firearm and demanded money. The suspect left driving a black sedan.

On Thursday officers received a call that the suspect vehicle was loaded on a tow truck. The Sheriff’s Office made contact with the driver of the tow truck.

It is not a secret that Lexi Thompson made a career in golf because of her father Scott Thompson. Yes her hard work and passion for golf made her one of the world’s best female players but if not for her father she would have never known about the sport in the first place. And the American had these thoughts in her mind when she penned a sweet message for her dad on a special day.

Father’s Day is special. And who would know it better than the 27-year-old golfer who according to her LPGA Tour profile has won 11 championships with the training she got from her dad. Hence she took her invaluable time to appreciate him last year with a meaningful social media message.

People in America among some other countries celebrate Father’s day on the third Sunday of every June. And it fell on June 19 last year. Although Lexi Thompson couldn’t post on the same day she didn’t forget to tweet a day later.

“Happy Father’s Day to my #1 supporter alongside my mom ❤️” the LPGA Tour player wrote on Twitter. “Thank you for everything you’ve done for me and always being there for me!” her tweet further read.

Lexi began golfing at the age of 5and she started playing in competitions a year later. Notably in a Q&A video from her sponsor Bridgestone Golf she revealed that she considers her first-ever win and her major as the most enjoyable victories. And according to her she finds them special because her dad was carrying her bag.

The Thompson men enjoy caddying for the LPGA star

From 2010 when she turned professional the 1-time major champion has changed her caddie more than a few times. And three of them were family.

Scott Thompson used to carry her bag since she was 9 and continued to do so till she got two years of experience as a professional player. “My dad has been there for us as support when we’ve needed it” she once said about Scott according to an LPGA article from 2015. “…encouragement when we’ve needed it; help when we’ve needed it.”

Moreover her two elder brothers Nicholas and Curtis both professional golfers have also caddied for her multiple times. In fact Curtis was on her bag when Lexi won the 2018 CME Group Tour Championship.

The bankruptcy court approved a resolution plan by the Swan Energy-Hazel Mercantile team consortium for Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd (RNEL).The Ahmedabad court Friday gave an oral order approving the resolution plan but a detailed written order is not yet uploaded on the tribunal's website.In March 95% of lenders of RNEL had approved the duo's resolution plan.The winning bidder Swan Energy - Hazel Mercantile team offered a staggered payment of ₹2040 crore while on the net present value (NPV) basis it was ₹1218 crore.Of the ₹2040 crore offered by the duo a sum of ₹1640 crore will be paid over the next five years and the remaining payment will be made from the recovery of certain pending dues. Naveen Jindal owned Jindal Steel and Power was also in the fray to acquire RNEL.On Friday the tribunal also ruled that two separate petitions filed by Reliance Infrastructure and Jindal Steel and Power objecting to the plan submitted by the winning bidder were rejected.Reliance Infrastructure a sister concern of RNEL and Jindal Steel petitioned that the Swan- Hazel team needed to be 29(A) compliant.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) under Section 29 (A) prohibits defaulting promoters or their related parties from submitting a resolution plan. Reliance Infra and Jindal Power had petitioned that Nikhil Merchant who is managing director of Swan Energy had been director till recently of Navi Mumbai Smart City Infrastructure  a company promoted by defaulter Nikhil Gandhi.Separately Reliance Infrastructure submitted a settlement plan under section 12A of IBC which Ahmedabad NCLT rejected in August.

The first phase will see the building of a boundary wall and a retaining wall to stop sliding of legacy waste and to avoid any hindrance in the construction work.In fact the state government signed an agreement with Ecogreen for setting up the plant for solid waste management for Gurgaon and Faridabad in August 2017.And in December last year Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar laid its foundation stone and set December 2023 as the deadline for the project.Now expected to be operational within two years officials said the plant will use state-of-the-art technology to manage solid waste via two boilers of 750 TPD capacity each and a turbo generator of 25 MW.Emphasising on the importance of solid waste management the ULB minister said ""This plant will prove to be a milestone for proper disposal of waste generated from both the cities of Gurgaon and Faridabad. The waste generated daily will be disposed of in this plant and 25 MW electricity will be generated daily from the waste.""On an average both the cities generate 2100 metric tonnes of solid waste per day which is collected by the company through door-to-door collection and transported to the landfill.Touting this as the country's largest waste-to-energy plant MCG officials said that it will be set up in compliance with the guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board State Pollution Control Board and Solid Waste Management Rules 2016.Ecogreen officials said that the construction got delayed due to unavailability of land and late environmental clearance. ""As per the direction of the nine-member committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal we have started the construction work of the plant"" said Sanjay Sharma deputy CEO Ecogreen.Later in the day Gupta visited the land identified by HSVP in Gurgaon for housing under the Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana to homeless poor families identified through parivar pehchaan patra (PPP).

Beware it’s not for kids,"Bhopal: Amit Jain often buys sugar-free aerated drinks for the family particularly as his daughter is fond of carbonated drinks and takes the “no calories” form of it to keep her weight in check. But a couple of days ago Jain was surprised to read on the can of the drink a warning from the manufacturing company that it’s not recommended for children pregnant and lactating women because the carbonated water contains an admixture of sucralose and acesulfame potassium.“I have been buying cans of sugar-free carbonated drinks for quite some time I never read it myself nor anyone else including the shopkeepers told me about the warning written by the manufacturing company in bold letters"" said Jain who happened to read warning by chance. He checked in other brands of carbonated drinks and found similar results.When he asked shopkeeper whether he knew that the drink is not for consumption of children he said “We thought energy drinks should not be given to children and we do ask children below 14-15 years not to take energy drinks but we didn't have an idea that carbonated drinks should not be given to children.”After reading minutely the text on the energy drinks Jain said that energy drinks have no such warning that it should not be given to children.“Having read the warning now I still don't know whether my 14-year-old can take it or not. I would like her to abstain from drinking it for a few more years but she may continue using it because all her friends drink it and none have any problem with it. I think the age should also be specified when you say children should not be given this drink” said Amit.District food safety officer Devendra Dubey  when asked on the issue said “It's for the consumers to read everything written on the pack of an edible good before using it. The manufacturing company has done its job by warning you and the shopkeeper is not expected to read health warnings and inform all the customers. It is for customers to take safety precautions. It is not only zero calories aerated drinks but a lot many things which are recommended not to be used by a particular group of people. Many people have allergies from soya products or even eggs. It is for them to see that they do not eat these things. It is like checking for the expiry date whether there is a health warning on the pack. It's more important with medicines but in the case of edibles too people should take care to read the text on the pack” he said.He added “The warning is inscribed on the pack in a particular form using a particular font size and it can’t be changed. If it says children the companies must write children. If I am not mistaken medically the age is 14 years till we treat a child as a child for such purposes. But it's for the parents to decide the age of children who are not to be served a particular thing not recommended for children. As far as I am concerned I would only say that if something is injurious to a child it would best not be consumed till the age of 18.”",,,,,,
KO,Coca-Cola Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5kZW1vY3JhY3kubmV0L2VuL2FtYXpvbi1jb2NhLWNvbGEtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWRvbmF0aW9ucy1zY3Jvb2dlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola and Amazon among top firms donating ‘pennies’ to charity at Christmas,"Corporate Scrooges in the UK have boasted about donating as little as 0.007% of their cash to charities at Christmas analysis by openDemocracy has revealed.

Amazon and Coca-Cola are among the giants that have been accused of “giving pennies from their back pocket” to good causes as part of promotional stunts over the holiday period.

This year Coca-Cola announced that it would donate the equivalent of a meal to charity for every person who visits its Christmas truck tour in the UK this year. It’s only at the very end of its announcement that the world’s richest beverage company explains it will give a maximum of just £25000 to the charity Fairshare which redistributes surplus food to the hungry.

According to Fairshare £25000 is enough to supply 100000 meals. But the donation amounts to less than 0.01% of the £259.9m profit Coca-Cola made in the UK – the equivalent of a millionaire donating three £30 turkeys to charity. By contrast Coca-Cola handed £440m in dividends to shareholders in 2021 dipping into its reserves to do so.

BAE Systems also among the 30 biggest companies in the UK donated £150000 to food banks last Christmas – just 0.007% of its £2.3bn profit for 2021. The arms manufacturer said it gave £11m overall to charity in 2021. By comparison it handed out £1.1bn to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks.

British Gas owner Centrica – among the top 100 largest UK companies – also gave £250000 to food bank operator Trussell Trust last Christmas. The donation was equivalent to 0.03% of its profits in 2021 – which stood at £948m double what it made the previous year. The charity says the number of people using food banks rose by 40% between April and September this year.

“These companies’ charitable giving is too small even to call it reputation washing. This seems more like the corporate equivalent of using a drop of spit to clean something off the side of your mouth” said Alex Cobham chief executive of the Tax Justice Network.

“The UK could today simply allow the Treasury to use existing legislation to make multinationals like Amazon publish their country-by-country reporting data. But both as chancellor and now as prime minister Rishi Sunak has blocked this measure – meaning companies can continue to keep their questionable tax behaviour in the shadows while they claim the plaudits for trivial charitable giving.”

openDemocracy

Amazon meanwhile – one of the world’s richest companies – donated an estimated £256000 to charity in the UK last Christmas.

In a blog post the company said it gave £120000 split between 120 local charities nominated by employees: £50000 to children’s charity Barnardo’s £25000 each to homeless charity Depaul and family support charity Home-Start and £10000 to rapper Stormzy’s #MerkyFoundation.

Amazon UK also said it also donated £500 to “every local food bank” near its 24 warehouses. openDemocracy estimates this could amount to a £26000 donation given there are 52 food banks run by the Trussell Trust within five miles of Amazon’s 24 sites.

Amazon UK Services the warehouse and logistics arm of its business made profits of £204m before tax in the UK last year according to accounts filed at Companies House. The corporation’s Christmas donations in the UK would amount to 0.13% of this income.

But Amazon’s total profits in the UK were likely much higher than this figure. The company reported that revenue for all its business in the UK – including retail and cloud computing services not included in the £204m figure – was £23.2bn in 2021. It would not reveal how much profit it made from this.

Amazon paid no corporation tax in the UK that year thanks to the “super-deduction” scheme for businesses that invest in infrastructure that was introduced the same year by the then chancellor Rishi Sunak according to research from the Fair Tax Foundation.

Other companies have applauded their employees’ personal generosity while seemingly giving nothing themselves. For the last two years staff working at Jaguar Land Rover have donated £5000 of their own money to charity and tens of thousands of grocery items to food banks – but asked if the company itself had contributed a spokesperson told openDemocracy they were only aware of the donations given by employees.

“Big businesses like to pretend that left to their own devices they will do the right thing. These figures show clearly how hollow those claims are” said Nick Dearden director of campaign group Global Justice Now.

“In a period of historically low corporate taxation these giants will do anything they possibly can to further push their taxes down as well as shift their costs onto the public sector and drive down the wages of their employees. The idea that putting a few pennies from their back pocket into the charity tin is going to make up for this is ridiculous.

“Big corporations and the multi-billionaires that run them now have so much more power than the average citizen – even here in the UK. Frankly you could multiply these paltry charitable donations a thousand times and you’d still get nowhere near the amounts necessary to change this.”

Through the funding of PKR 11500000 they are providing food shelter mosquito nets WASH facilities hygienic kits clean drinking water and basic shelter support to more than 1000 flood-affected households especially to families led by women differently-abled individuals and minority groups.

In addition to providing basic relief goods the community will also be provided with safe drinking water facilities. For this Bondh E Shams a global water charity organization is installing its solar-powered all-in-one water pump and filtration system in a communal place. To further make access to clean water easier the project is providing H2O water wheels by Tayaba.org to the women for easier collection.

Fahad Ashraf Vice-President of Coca-Cola Pakistan said “The sheer scale of damage across Pakistan owing to the recent catastrophic floods is unprecedented. At Coca-Cola we are committed to building sustainable shared communities and these joint efforts with the Indus Earth Trust are a part of that commitment.” As per government reports one-third of Pakistan was under water and to date in many areas the water is stagnant and continues to be a source of health hazards.

Shahid Sayeed Khan CEO of Indus Earth Trust said “The recent floods in Pakistan have shown to the world that tackling climate change and environmental degradation needs to be our collective top priority. It impacts not only all aspects of our lives but our survival as a species. At Indus Earth Trust our vision is to work for the development of neglected coastal communities by maintaining their sense of dignity. For this partnerships with organizations like Coca-Cola play a key role in reaching the maximum number of these communities.”

This large-scale emergency requires coordinated efforts between the government I/NGOs and donors including corporates. Coca-Cola has been at the forefront since the floods hit.

tosh67 posted her hilarious video on TikTok where peeps worldwide were curious to see what was happening. The clip has even racked up 3.2 million views on the platform.

The video itself is quite simple a woman washes her hair with coke just that. But the act is odd for those who aren't familiar with dreadlock maintenance. The hair requires many products to keep it healthy and for his woman and others it does the trick.

Briefly News got in contact with Thomas who runs a hair salon in the South of Johannesburg who had a lot to say about the odd technique when asked if he would recommend it:

""There's nothing in hair science that says Coca-Cola will wash your hair clean. It's just a myth spread around the world regarding what people do with other things. It's just a myth. People think that when you wash it with Coca-Cola the hair will twist easily and lock easily and stuff like that. None of these things have been proven.""

When asked about what to do to treat natural hair he recommended the day-to-day products found in your local salon dedicated to ethnic hair.

Other folks even suggested products similar to the popular fizzy drink while others just stayed around to bust some jokes. See the comments below:

In another story Briefly News previously reported that one man changed the way that many people of South Africa see mogudu. While putting it inside of a wrap is not how it is done traditionally times are changing and people are spicing things up.

Mogudu is a combination of chopped tripe and intestines served as a stew often with hot pap or dumpling. So when our guy threw it inside a wrap some people had questions.

""When you are in those months playing meaningful football it is something unlike any other style of football that exists"" McDaniel said. ""The beginning of the season pales in comparison to that environment.""

The Dolphins and the Green Bay Packers will have that type of experience when they meet on Christmas. Both teams are eyeing the postseason but their scenarios to get there are quite different.

The Dolphins (8-6) will make the playoffs if they win their last three games — or just their last two against division foes New England and the New York Jets. Miami has lost three straight though and wants to begin its playoff push by beating Green Bay.

Standing in their way is four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers.

""We're about to play Aaron Rodgers who has been in the league for years and arguably one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play"" safety Jevon Holland said. ""So what more do you have to focus on? This is a huge challenge especially for me. ... Playoffs are playoffs. I've never been to the playoffs so I wouldn’t know.""

The Packers (6-8) likely need to win their last three games to make the postseason. Even if they win out they're not guaranteed to make it.

""This is a really good football team that we're going against"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. ""Obviously they're very hungry. They've got a lot at stake. We've got a lot at stake and it should be a playoff-type game.""

McDaniel and LaFleur know each other well having worked together as assistants with Houston Washington and Atlanta.

LaFleur said he sees some advantage in playing against a familiar coach.

""I think it leads to some creativity quite honestly"" he said ""because you might see the same concept that you have that gets ran and it's like OK what wrinkle can I throw off of this so I think there's pluses and minuses to everything.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL25jc3RhdGUvZm9vdGJhbGwvY29tbWVudGFyeS1kcmFrZS10aG9tYXMtYW4tbmMtc3RhdGUtYWxsLXRpbWUtZ3JlYXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COMMENTARY: Drake Thomas An NC State Great,"Drake Thomas has produced a college career that merits him being listed among the all-time great linebackers at NC State.

The lineage at the linebacker position runs deep at NC State.

Bill Cowher Robert Abraham Vaughan Johnson Frank Bush Bobby Houston David Merritt Damien Covington Levar Fisher Pat Thomas Manny Lawson Stephen Tulloch Nate Irving Audie Cole Terrell Manning and Germaine Pratt are some of the outstanding linebackers in NC State history since 1980 -- and that is not a complete list of greats during a span that is now into its fifth decade.

Being a Wolfpack linebacker is a serious responsibility. The backer often directs the defense but it also runs deeper. It is about being cognizant of the greats that have worn the red and white (and sometimes black and gray) of NC State.

It is about understanding that there is a high standard for that position group at NCSU but not shying away from trying to lift it to another level and ultimately leaving it in a better place for the successor.

There is a great linebacking heritage at North Carolina State University. Perhaps it is fitting that one of its legends graduated from Heritage High School.

When Drake Thomas made the trek from Wake Forest North Carolina to NC State as a college freshman there was no real way of knowing quite how his college career would turn out. He clearly had the drive and desire but would he have enough of the 'measurables' and could he compensate for any of his perceived size shortcomings no pun intended to play at the ACC?

The answer was yes resoundingly. The motor Drake Thomas possesses has manifested itself not in just the physical or psychological traits of his position but also the mental aspects. Thomas never seems to be misaligned or drifting away from where he is supposed to be and that usually is where the play is to be made.

Obviously Thomas has earned accolades. He has helped the Wolfpack win games.

In the process he has also won the hearts of NC State's fan base.

In what must be the neatest portion of his legacy Thomas gets to share in the maintaining and lifting of the NC State linebacking lineage with his teammates Isaiah Moore and Payton Wilson who also have earned their spots in the Wolfpack linebacker antiquity.

He will also share the experience of being a part of the NCSU football family with members of his own family -- which will be a way of strengthening the link they have together as time goes by.

Thomas is in a Wolfpack brotherhood with his two brothers an NC State family with his own family and a great NCSU linebacking legacy with his linebacker teammates. That must be a fulfillment that words cannot properly express.

With his college career in its final week words can express what he has made of himself at NC State.

Drake Thomas is an all-time great Wolfpacker.

Aaron Rodgers threw for 238 yards and a touchdown and had one interception for the Packers (7-8) who have won their last three games after starting the season 4-8.

Miami (8-7) lost its fourth straight game and must win its final two to make the postseason.

The Dolphins trailed by six points with a chance to take the lead in the final two minutes but Tagovailoa threw his third interception in three possessions to end Miami's comeback bid. He threw a pick with about six minutes left that set up a Packers field goal to make it a six-point game.

Packers kicker Mason Crosby hit a go-ahead field goal early in the fourth after back-to-back turnovers by both offenses.

Undrafted Miami rookie Kader Kohou intercepted a pass by Rodgers intended for Allen Lazard but the Dolphins gave it right back when cornerback Jaire Alexander intercepted Tagovailoa on the very next play.

Miami’s defense held the Packers to six points off turnovers in the second half to keep the Dolphins in it after blowing a 20-10 first-half lead.

The Dolphins held Green Bay to two scores in five trips to the red zone.

A.J. Dillon led the Packers with 36 yards rushing on 11 carries and Allen Lazard had 61 yards receiving on five catches.

Tyreek Hill had four catches for Miami to give him 113 for the season setting a Dolphins' single-season receiving record. Jaylen Waddle added five receptions for 143 yards.

But Miami spoiled those big receiving days with turnovers.

Raheem Mostert fumbled in the first half leading to a Green Bay field goal. Tagovailoa's three interceptions were the most he has thrown all season.

Miami committed to the run game early rushing for 82 yards against Green Bay after a season-high 188 yards rushing against Buffalo in Week 15.

The Dolphins ran four times for 38 yards on their opening drive and took a 3-0 lead and Green Bay countered with a field goal to tie it after Keisean Nixon’s 93-yard kickoff return set up the Packers at the 9-yard line.

Miami built a 20-13 halftime lead after an 84-yard TD by Waddle and 1-yard TD run by Jeff Wilson.

Dillon’s 1-yard TD run on Green Bay’s first possession of the third quarter tied the game.

Tight end Marcedes Lewis also had a 1-yard TD catch in the first quarter.

MORE TURNOVERS

Rodgers’ interception in the fourth quarter was his 11th pick of the season his highest total since he had 11 during Green Bay’s Super Bowl-winning season in 2010. Rodgers threw a career-high 13 interceptions in 2008.

CHRISTMAS CHILL

The temperature at Hard Rock Stadium was 46 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius) at kickoff which marked the second-coldest home game in Dolphins history. The coldest was played on Christmas Eve in 1989 against Kansas City in 40-degree weather. The Chiefs won that game 27-24.

HOLIDAY HISTORY

Tagovailoa’s 84-yard TD pass to Waddle was the longest offensive TD score on Christmas day in NFL history according to NFL Research. It was athe fourth-longest TD in Dolphins history and the longest since Dan Marion’s 85-yard TD pass to Mark Duper in 1986 vs. the Houston Oilers. It was also the longest TD catch of Waddle’s career.

INJURIES

This article was originally published in 2021. However it remains timely.

By: Bryan Boggiano

A diverse array of internet and cable service providers can be found in Coral Springs but a common myth is the city allows only two Bluestream and AT&T.

Resident Sam Poulos is getting two different stories. Comcast the parent company of Xfinity told him the city’s restrictions do not let other internet and cable providers in. The city told him it was because Comcast would not run the lines.

“I don’t want a song and dance from our leaders” he wrote on Facebook “I want to know the truth.”

Poulos isn’t the only resident with this concern. In November 2020 Sandra Hernandez wrote “I wish Comcast was allowed to service Coral Springs.”

There is also a Facebook group to end what some residents say is a monopoly on service providers. With 145 members Blue Stream Sucks the old Advanced Cable Communications of Coral Springs seeks to “elect a politician that will allow companies like Comcast to come and supply reliable service.”

Coral Springs spokesperson Lynne Martzall said Bluestream and AT&T have infrastructure built in the city; however Comcast only has their infrastructure in the Corporate Park.

“We cannot surmise why residents hold a specific belief but when a service provider indicates they are unable to service the area a resident may be under the impression it is the fault of the city” she said. “That is untrue.”

While Xfinity services businesses and some homes in the city there are homes located too far from the existing network said Cynthia Arco with Comcast Florida Region.

“Our approach is to continue to review any potential service areas and look for ways to expand our network and bring Xfinity services to more people” she said.

Data from broadbandnow.com shows residential properties in Coral Springs have at least three provider options available. Some neighborhoods have five options including Brookside Mariner’s Cove The Isles The Springs and Cypress Run north of Lakeview Drive.

AT&T Internet HughesNet Viasat and Bluestream are available to over 90 percent of residents. Xfinity has about 25 percent availability while AT&T Fiber is about 30 percent and Hotwire Communications just over one percent.

Martzall said the city has no franchise agreement with any cable provider. For any internet or cable company to operate in the city they must apply for a permit through the building department. Upon approval they would refer them to the engineering department. This would give residents more options for providers.

“The city recognizes the importance of expansive and reliable cable and internet access for residents and businesses” she said. “We welcome service providers to submit permits and plans to develop their infrastructure in the city.”

(Loren Holmes/ADN)

A major oil prospect on federal land in Alaska is hanging in the balance as pressure mounts on the Biden administration for a final decision to approve or reject the project.

Conservation groups and climate activists have urged the administration to deny ConocoPhillips the permission it needs to build the $8 billion Willow oil project. National groups protested outside the White House earlier this month arguing the project will imperil wildlife like polar bears and undermine President Joe Biden’s goals to combat climate change.

The project’s advocates including Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation are calling for approval from the administration so construction can start immediately during the North Slope’s short winter season or else it will be delayed until next year. They say the project is vital for the struggling Alaska economy and could combat future high oil and gas prices.

Alaska Native leaders are also weighing in both in favor and against.

Political observers say they don’t know where the Biden administration will land saying the president is in a tough political position.

ConocoPhillips has said it will begin construction as soon as the administration makes a decision supporting development.

“Any further delay (at Willow) is unwarranted” after five years of environmental review of the project the company said in a statement Thursday.

Additional delay “jeopardizes ConocoPhillips’ ability to initiate construction of the project in this winter season and further advance major contract awards that are needed to execute the project” the company said.

Also this month ConocoPhillips Alaska President Erec Isaacson signaled in an interview with Bloomberg that the company will back out of the project if the Biden administration scales the development down to two drilling locations called pads.

ConocoPhillips said the “viable path forward” is a development proposal with three initial drilling pads a plan the federal government proposed this summer. That plan arose after a federal judge rejected initial approval of the project by the Trump administration in 2020 after conservation groups argued that the government had underestimated the plan’s harm to wildlife among other factors.

Alaska delegation meets Biden officials

If built Willow would be one of the first oil fields in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The reserve which is the largest block of federal land in the U.S. was established by President Warren Harding in 1923 as a source of oil for the U.S. Navy. But commercial oil didn’t flow from the reserve until ConocoPhillips established its first small field there in 2015.

The Willow field could produce 600 million barrels of oil over three decades worth $50 billion at today’s oil prices. Its oil could also lead to the release of 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions during that time equivalent to what 76 coal-fired power plants emit in a year conservation groups say.

ConocoPhillips called the power plant figure used by the conservation groups is “deliberately misleading” as it compares emissions over Willow’s 30-year life to the annual output of coal plants. The oil company said that based on new calculations in the draft environmental report released in July which presents the smaller proposal for three initial drilling pads ConocoPhillips found that Willow’s “annualized direct and net indirect emissions” are equal to about one of the “theoretical power plants.”

Alaska Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola said in a statement Wednesday that they’ve met twice with senior Biden administration officials in recent days to urge approval of the project. The meetings included John Podesta Biden’s senior adviser on clean energy innovation and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh Sullivan said in an interview.

The administration has committed to releasing a final environmental report for the project before February and a final decision before March according to the delegation’s statement.

In September the delegation had implored the administration to approve the project by year’s end.

Spokespeople with the Interior Department declined to comment on the current timeline for a decision.

“We have nothing to offer on this” said Melissa Schwartz communications director with the agency.

Sullivan said the timeline is “disappointing” and limits the development that could begin in the four-month construction season that begins in January. Work that can’t happen this year will need to wait until early next year.

“Even the news today was in my view somewhat disappointing because you’re getting into the middle of the construction season” Sullivan said Wednesday.

Climate activists protest Willow outside White House

Climate activists in early December protested at the Ellipse outside the White House unfurling a bright-yellow banner that said: “Stop the Willow Oil Project.”

“Our recent climate wins the clean energy advancements we’ve made President Biden’s 2030 goals — they’re all for nothing if the administration approves this colossal drilling project” said Magnolia Mead of This is Zero Hour. “Youth turned out to elect President Biden and Democrats because of their ambitious climate promises and all eyes are on him to follow through.”

Alaska Native leaders have also weighed in.

Rosemary Ahtuangaruak Nuiqsut’s mayor wrote in an opinion piece in The Hill last month that her village the closest to the project is being ignored as Biden “barrels towards approving” it.

“The Biden administration is moving forward with a massive oil and gas project that is a climate disaster waiting to happen while refusing to listen to the voices of my constituents and community who will bear the burden of this project with our health and our livelihoods” she wrote.

Harry Brower Jr. mayor of the North Slope Borough that includes Nuiqsut and borough president Amaulik Edwardsen expressed support for Willow in a September opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.

“We are tired of outside groups trying to turn this project and every other oil and gas project in our region into the poster child for a global movement away from fossil fuels” they wrote. “This is more than a political oil debate for us; it’s about access to land we were promised many years ago. Without projects like Willow and their crucial economic benefits many of my neighbors would be forced to leave the lands they and their ancestors have inhabited for thousands of years.”

‘A tough spot’ for Biden

Observers of oil field activity and federal policy in Alaska said they weren’t sure where the Biden administration would land on Willow.

Andy Mack former Alaska Department of Natural Resources commissioner under independent Gov. Bill Walker noted the Biden administration has taken positions that have allowed the Willow project to advance.

The Bureau of Land Management and ConocoPhillips have worked together to find a way to reduce harm to the environment that would have been caused by an original development plan proposed by the oil company he said.

“I think they’ve done as much as they can do to mitigate the impacts” through the project’s design said Mack chief executive of Kuukpik the Alaska Native village corporation for Nuiqsut and an oil field services provider.

Mack said Willow is an “economic opportunity” for Alaska. But it is “immense” and will have environmental impacts he said. Kuukpik will push for improvements like urging the federal government to require electronic monitoring of caribou in the area to provide details on their status he said.

Pat Pourchot the former top Interior official in Alaska for six years under President Barack Obama said in an interview he thinks Biden is “under a lot of pressure” on Willow.

Biden has set ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions but the Willow project will increase those emissions he said.

That creates a contradiction in policy something emphasized by conservation groups said Pourchot board president for the Alaska Wilderness League which was part of the legal effort that stopped Willow’s approval under the Trump administration.

Pourchot said the administration also has political calculations to consider in a Willow decision.

That includes future support that might be needed from Murkowski a moderate who at times has been a critical swing vote on issues that Democrats favor.

And Democratic leadership will want to support Peltola politically who they’ll need in two years to regain control of the House he said.

“The Biden administration is in the crosshairs between his own policies and on the political side” Pourchot said. “I think Biden is in a tough spot and I don’t know what he’ll do on Willow.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported how many barrels of oil the Willow field could produce over 30 years. The correct amount is 600 million not 600 billion. This article has also been updated to include a response from ConocoPhillips about emissions at Willow.

Church in Bulls Head a 9000-square-foot section of parking lot is generally inactive. Used for overflow parking and sometimes shared by several bordering schools as a port of retreat during fire drills and other emergency evacuations the space is appropriately obscure idle and undeveloped. But if a hotly debated approval process is green-lighted and a special zoning permit allowed the practically unused corner of land would be transformed into a lithium-ion battery storage facility which will accumulate electrical energy and take pressure off the local grid when it is overly stressed.

Residents school administrators and church parishioners are not taking the possible conversion lightly.

“We are proactively addressing this issue because we are not comfortable with the idea of these units -- which are not yet time-tested for fire safety and toxic emissions -- being located 100 feet from our school” noted Gina DeSantis president of Moore Catholic High School which has recently launched a campaign against the battery energy storage system (BESS) development.

DeSantis said she learned about the proposed project last month after a school security guard witnessed a woman taking pictures of the school campus.

‘WHAT I LEARNED WAS DISCONCERTING’

“She said her company was launching an energy installation project on church grounds. So I researched and called every person involved -- if it’s going to be installed next to my campus I want to know all of the details” DeSantis said. “I didn’t like that this was shrouded in secrecy and what I learned was disconcerting.”

According to information obtained by DeSantis from New Leaf Energy the company developing the project the proposed BESS facility would consist of six large-scale rechargeable lithium-ion battery systems manufactured by Tesla. The information also outlined that each can store up to 20 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity and the intent of the project is for Con Edison to store energy produced during periods of low demand (e.g. at night) and then draw power from the facility when demand peaks.

The proposed energy site would be located in a 9000-square-foot section of this parking lot. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma-Hammel)

“Between the charging and discharge cycles the stored energy would sit unprotected in a church parking lot -- not in an industrial location as required by applicable zoning” DeSantis noted in a Nov. 22 letter to Community Board 2 stating her opposition to the project.

“Although its proponents claim their project is not a threat to the community they tried to keep the neighborhood uninformed of their plans” the letter continued. “Now that the details of this project have come to light it is clear that there are numerous reasons why the application should be denied … the most important reason is the safety of the children who attend the six schools that encircle the proposed project.”

Bulls Head residents have rallied around DeSantis’ crusade to halt the endeavor. New Leaf Energy which was founded in July 2022 issued a statement to dispel their concerns.

SAFETY A ‘TOP PRIORITY’

“It is important that the community understands that the safety of local residents is our top priority for this project. This includes our neighbors in nearby schools and local businesses” noted Corina Solis project developer at New Leaf Energy. “We only work with reputable battery manufacturers who adhere to the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) code and requirements and are approved for use in New York City by the FDNY. The safety protocols involved in installing battery storage systems include third-party testing certification and FDNY review of the fire safety of the full battery system ventilation and exhaust fire alarm and detection fire suppression remote monitoring and communication ....”

Solis also noted that a dedicated technology management team within the FDNY reviews individual models of battery technologies before installation on the project even begins.

“The potential for fire is extremely low and the systems are designed and tested to fail safely” she said. “Residents can rest assured we’re working with retired and current members of the FDNY to ensure the highest level of project safety. There will be secure fencing surrounding the equipment as an additional safety measure. The system will be locked and monitored by remote and central monitoring and CCTV. The fencing will block the line of sight to the public.”

But members of the community said they are not satisfied with that response.

“They say it’s 99% safe but what about that one percent?” said Dennis Quirk who works closely with the Seton Foundation’s Bishop Patrick V. Ahern High School a private special education program for students ranging from 14 to 21 years of age that also borders the site. “This should be located on a commercial property somewhere that is not in close proximity to the children. That one percent is too much when you’re dealing with kids. The safety of our children is paramount.”

Other schools near the site include: New World Preparatory Charter School also on the Moore Catholic campus; PS 60 located at 55 Merrill Ave.; Children At Play Preschool 40 Merrill Ave.; Hellenic Classical Charter School 1641 Richmond Ave.

OUTCRY FROM PARISHIONERS

And parishioners of Our Lady of Pity said they are enraged by the church’s lack of communication regarding this matter.

“The pastor didn’t loop anyone in” one parishioner said requesting anonymity. “He brokered this deal and the parishioners and trustees were left in the dark. This is a residential area and we have all of these schools. Who needs this system to be installed here?”

Citing fire danger and air toxicity the parishioner also questioned what will happen if such systems eventually become obsolete.

“Are we stuck with these units then? Do they just sit idle and become an eyesore?”

A small group of Our Lady of Pity churchgoers has launched a grassroots initiative to combat the site handing out flyers and going door-to-door with informational sheets on the project.

“If it’s so safe then why is it a big secret?” one Bulls Head resident asked. “There is no transparency and that’s unacceptable.”

Residents parishioners and school administrators say the parking lot which borders Moore Catholic High School is an inappropriate location for such a facility. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma-Hammel)

The Advance/SILive called the rectory to inquire about parishioners’ concerns and the church declined to comment. When asked about the validity of the community’s apprehension New Leaf simply stressed the importance of the work.

“Blackouts during the hottest days of the summer have impacted this community for years and can be highly disruptive to everyday life and local business” Solis said. “Our battery storage project will improve the quality of life for residents by reducing or eliminating the frequency of brownouts and blackouts throughout the summer.”

The proposed project is not the only one of its kind in Staten Island. A lithium-ion battery storage unit is currently being built on Giffords Lane in Great Kills. Its developer NineDot Energy said it should be operational and ready to harvest energy by 2023. And according to Frank Morano chair of Community Board 3 an application seeking to install an identical BESS unit at 405 Arthur Kill Rd. adjacent to Holtermann’s Bakery was recently rejected.

“We do have major concerns about these units” Morano said. “We see on the news that litihium-ion batteries easily catch fire and we know that those particular fires are extremely hard to put out. Toxic chemicals are also at play. There are too many issues so our final decision was to deny recommendation.”

Paul Rogers and Nick Petrakis owners of Energy Safety Response Group who were hired by New Leaf to articulate the safety and compliance of this project said that many of the community’s concerns are misguided.

“Most of the fires that you see on the news are because of counterfeit consumer products” Rogers said. “These systems are an entirely different entity.”

SAFETY CHECKS

Rogers and Petrakis both retired NYC firefighters work with companies across the country doing safety checks to ensure that these battery storage sites are compliant. The pair noted that New York state and city codes for these systems are exceptionally strict.

“There are always hazards and risks associated with energy storage in general” Petrakis said. “But New York City is strict in its requirements. The number of safety measures these technologies must pass just to be installed is considerable.”

According to Rogers and Petrakis the equipment proposed for Bulls Head endured “full scale 9540A” testing in which an overcharge was simulated and normal system protections were removed to see how the BESS would fare.

“The 9540A test which measures the fire safety hazards within battery systems replicates the worst-case scenario” Rogers said indicating that the units were pushed to their limit and no fire was observed. “You can’t ever say that equipment is 100% infallible but the way this system survived this very rigorous test is strong proof of its safety.”

A spokesperson for the FDNY said the project is still under review.

“The stationary energy storage installation is the subject of a Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA) application” the spokesperson said. “The department will fully review the application and meet with the applicant before making a recommendation to the BSA.”

Con Edison which is the beneficiary of this citywide battery storage push said it has no role in choosing site locations.

“Energy storage has a huge role to play in New York’s renewable energy future” the utility company said in a statement. “Well-sited battery projects can strengthen the reliability of our electric delivery system while helping to maximize the use and value of renewables. Through our Clean Energy Commitment Con Edison has pledged to support the development of 1000 megawatts of energy storage in our service area by 2030 the vast majority of which will be owned by our customers. Aside from a handful of examples specific project locations are chosen by other parties not by Con Edison. Our focus is helping to nurture the battery storage market and providing incentives where appropriate.”

NEXT STEPS IN THE PROCESS

Concerns about this project were brought before Community Board 2 and a Land Use Public Hearing was scheduled for Jan. 3 to address the issue but has been postponed.

According to Councilman David M. Carr (R-Mid-Island) the project is currently going through a process of consideration with the BSA seeking a special permit for a Battery Energy Storage System.

“This entails a hearing before the relevant Community Board which in this case is Community Board 2” Carr explained. “The CB’s vote is advisory and not binding.”

Additionally Carr said there are reviews and sign-offs required by the New York City Department of Buildings and the New York City Fire Department. Finally there will be a hearing and vote on the project by the BSA itself.

“I believe that New Leaf which is the company that is the project developer should actually be doing additional community engagement including a presentation in Bulls Head about the project in addition to any appearance they make at the Community Board” Carr said. “Previously constructed energy storage facilities of this type have not been built in residential neighborhoods and I think it’s incumbent on New Leaf to explain why they believe this site -- which is adjacent to a residential community -- is appropriate. I have also reached out to the Fire Department which is only just beginning their review process. Given all this they have a steep burden of proof in making their case to residents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN255LmNvbS9zYWludC1wYXRyaWNrcy1jYXRoZWRyYWwtY2hyaXN0bWFzLW1hc3MtbnljLzEyNjEzMjA0L9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN255LmNvbS9hbXAvc2FpbnQtcGF0cmlja3MtY2F0aGVkcmFsLWNocmlzdG1hcy1tYXNzLW55Yy8xMjYxMzIwNC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saint Patrick's Cathedral other iconic NYC churches hold Christmas masses for people to worship warmly out of the cold,"Saint Patrick's Cathedral spreads warmth joy during this cold Christmastime in NYC

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- Despite the cold weather many bundled up Saturday night and headed to Saint Patrick's Cathedral for the start of Christmas.

Inside the cathedral on Christmas Eve worshippers gathered for the midnight mass. Mayor Eric Adams was in attendance.

The mass was led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan and others who braved the cold weather that has impacted New York.

The chilling cold caused parts of upstate New York to freeze and shut down as temperatures dropped to the negatives.

In the city many enjoyed the wintry Christmastime feel by doing activities like shopping over at Bryant Park.

National Grid and Con Edison are now urging customers to conserve energy due to the weather and increased demand on interstate pipelines that bring natural gas the region.

PJM which operates the electric transmission system that serves 13 states including New Jersey also gave tips to help conserve energy.

""We'd like to continue those efforts as we go into Christmas Day. Remember to save energy you can do things like just turning off any non-essential lights in some of the rooms"" Mike Bryson PJM Senior Vice President of Operations said.

The cold weather will continue on Christmas Day so if you head out of the house you'll want to bundle up.

Another church up the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral is celebrating Christmas in a very special way as well.

Uptown at St. John the Divine worshippers came together for Christmas services for the first time in three years.

""This for us is a great new beginning"" said Rev. Patrick Malloy Dean of Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine.

There was a time not too long ago that the idea of passing through metal detectors for a Christmas mass would have been horrifying -- an awful sign of the times.

But on Saturday at St. John the Divine this year it felt just like home.

""Being together prosperity for the new year new beginnings"" parishioner Michelle Dildunne said.

One of the world's great landmark churches which was forced to close to in person worship in March of 2020.

Since then so many people have grown accustomed to life at a distance or over Zoom.

While these services will still be live streamed Malloy said people are desperately craving connection after three years.

Which makes this Christmas especially meaningful as the world comes back together.

""We want to draw people close. We want to see people get to know people"" Malloy said. ""I think that's what Christmas really is all about. Christmas is about the Christian belief that in Jesus Christ God came close. God became human. And so for us not to come close to one another in our human enfleshment is a real detriment I think to our ability to be together as human beings.""

The church will hold services on Christmas Day at 10:30 a.m.

More than 22 inches of snow was dumped on Buffalo Friday shattering the previous daily snowfall record of 12.6 inches set in 1976 the National Weather Service said Saturday.

“This may turn out to be the worst storm in our community’s history” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Saturday morning. “There are still likely hundreds of people stuck in vehicles.”

Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed the National Guard Friday to help with rescue efforts as local first responders were overwhelmed.

Wild video on Twitter showed officers from the West Seneca Police Department forced to abandon their snow-bogged patrol car as the arctic cold front swept over the area.

The department shared footage of heavy snow falling as they commandeered a more weather-appropriate vehicle.

“We will say once again that it’s no joke out here and to please stay off the roads” police said.

At least three people in Buffalo have died as a result of the blizzard.

Two people in Cheektowaga died early Saturday after first responders could not get to them in time Poloncarz said adding that they died from “emergency medical events” and were not stuck in cars.

However there were several reports of first responders and the National Guard rescuing residents trapped in their cars throughout the day.

Meteorologist and storm chaser Reed Trimmer detailed on Twitter how he helped rescue a family who was stranded for seven hours just a block from a shelter.

“Worst blizzard I have ever covered” he wrote.

A third person died in the city of Buffalo though Poloncarz did not disclose the circumstances around his death.

“All other reports are rumors. These three are the only confirmed fatalities” Poloncarz said in a Saturday afternoon tweet.

Meanwhile more than four million customers of New York City’s largest utility company Consolidated Edison were asked to conserve energy “until further notice” Saturday.

The company said in a press release that the arctic blast had prompted increased demand on gas pipelines.

As of 6 p.m. Saturday Buffalo was suffering 0.06-mile visibility Fox Weather told The Post.

The city’s airport received a snowfall of 30.4 inches on the evening of Christmas Eve. Wind speeds across the city were recorded up to 60 mph and aren’t expected to taper off until early Monday morning.

Wind chills were reported as -10 to -30 degrees Fahrenheit according to the National Weather Service.

Buffalo’s NWS branch shared footage of the intense snowfall and zero visibility conditions at its airport headquarters. The whiteout shielded cars parked just a few feet away the agency said.

There was zero-mile visibility at the airport for 16 hours from midday Friday to the early morning hours of Christmas Eve.

The city of Buffalo did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

As we near the end of 2022 plenty of uncertainty looms ahead in 2023 – and the challenges faced by this world are far from over. This year investors have faced a sharp selloff in equities spiking yields in bonds and dramatic swings in oil prices. Though market tumult is only a temporary event there's no saying how long it might last. A long-term focus allows investors to tune out the noise from daily volatility and focus on building a strong portfolio. Here are five stocks chosen by Wall Street's top pros according to TipRanks a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Nova Measuring

Nova Measuring (NVMI) a metrology solutions provider for the semiconductor manufacturing industry has benefited from lower exposure to the memory market which has suffered major setbacks this year. About 70% of Nova's products are for the foundry market which has not been drastically affected by the slowdown in the semiconductor industry this year. Benchmark analyst Mark Miller who hosted a virtual meeting with Nova management recently pointed out that the company has gained at a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 20% over the past five years surpassing its growth in WFE (wafer fab equipment) spending. The analyst is also upbeat about Nova's prospects in this area. ""While a softer 2023 is expected Nova expects to once again outpace WFE spending"" said Miller. Miller notes that the longer-term outlook for Nova is bright given the demand runway that will be created when the U.S. Europe and China ramp up internal chip manufacturing over the next five years. (See Nova Measuring Stock Investors sentiments on TipRanks) Further the second half of 2023 is expected to be stronger due to a possible rebound in the memory market and increased orders from its major customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). The analyst reiterated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $100. Miller who is ranked No. 276 out of more than 8000 analysts on TipRanks has delivered 51% profitable ratings in the past year. Moreover each of his ratings has generated average returns of 14.2%.

Costco

Costco (COST) has a unique business that offers food and general merchandise in bulk at discounted prices through membership warehouses. Strategic investments customer-centricity and a focus on membership growth have helped the business survive a tumultuous year. Recently Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said that he sees consumer spending trends improving later in 2023 and this will be a catalyst for Costco's top-line growth. Also the retailer's ongoing store growth and international expansion are expected to push business performance trends upward. (See Costco Dividend Date & History on TipRanks) The analyst also believes that Costco's dominance in the warehouse-based retail market is driving its competitive advantage. Feinseth cut his price target to $635 from $678 but reiterated his buy rating on the stock. The analyst views ""the recent pullback as a major buying opportunity"" and expects Costco's loyal customer base and resilient business model to continue to drive growth. Feinseth stands at the 271st position among more than 8000 analysts. Remarkably 58% of his ratings have been successful with each rating delivering average returns of 10.7%.

Amazon

Technology expert analyst Brian White of Monness Crespi Hardt has always been bullish on Amazon (AMZN). The analyst has his eyes set on the long-term prospects of the company in the rapidly advancing digital transformation. White is upbeat about the growth runway ahead of Amazon in the areas of e-commerce Amazon Web Services digital media advertising Alexa robotics AI and others. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment in the near-term the lingering pandemic is expected to push digital transformation further ""benefiting the company's long-term business model."" The analyst reiterated his buy rating on Amazon with a price target of $136. (See Amazon Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks) White's convictions on Amazon have been 46% successful. Moreover 54% of his overall ratings have been profitable with each rating generating average returns of 8.1%. The analyst has been ranked No. 716 among over 8000 analysts tracked on TipRanks.

Meta

Coming to yet another one of White's favorite stocks Meta Platforms (META) the analyst remained bullish with a buy rating and a $150 price target. The company is wrapping up a difficult year full of challenges which are expected to carry over into 2023. However in the long run the analyst sees Meta gaining from the secular growth opportunities in digital ads and advancing in innovations in the metaverse. White expects the Facebook-parent's valuation to move up significantly over time. (See Meta Platforms Website Traffic trends on TipRanks) ""With sales up 34% per annum over the past five years EPS turning in a 32% CAGR and generating an attractive operating margin we believe Meta Platforms should trade at a premium to the market and tech sector in the long run; however the expect the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment will weigh on advertising spending in the coming quarters"" said White.

Rating: About this rating True

There's a swank hotel room in Cinderella's Castle a landmark structure at Disney World in Orlando Florida. But you can't pull it up and book it on Hotels.com because it's pretty exclusive.

The room is called Cinderella's Castle Suite according to the resort's website. It's ""nestled within the turrets where the clocks all remain at 11:59 p.m. magic lies in each corner and one glass slipper rests as a reminder to always dream"" according to the Disney World website.

In a 2018 interview with ""Good Morning America"" suite concierge Sean Marsich said that staying in the room is something you can't buy with money — it's an invitation-only affair.

Marsich added the suite can sleep up to four people and contains a number of details specific to the Disney story including entertainment devices controlled with a magic wand and a glass slipper and a crown on display.

And the clock in the suite never changing from 11:59 also has special meaning: As in the classic Disney cartoon version of the ""Cinderella"" story the magic spell that turns the Disney princess from an abused housemaid to princess-to-be ends at the stroke of midnight.",,,,,,,,,

These numbers are according to an unaudited financial report filed by the state-owned river-port enterprise to the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) on December 12.

Broken down by category port operations accounted for the most exceeding $29 million (up 20 per cent year-on-year) followed by administrative operations (over $3.78 million; up 17 per cent) and other services ($272632; down 11 per cent) while other sources topped $3.8 million rocketing by 55 per cent.

PPAP said the number of cargo vessels handled at its facilities in the January-November period soared by 54.73 per cent year-on-year to 3271 as oil gas and cargo throughput rose by 3.58 per cent topping 3.6 million tonnes and container throughput increased by 21.40 per cent to 383261 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units).

A TEU is an inexact unit of cargo capacity used in the shipping industry roughly equivalent to a container with internal dimensions measuring about 20 feet long eight feet wide and 8.5 feet tall or a volume roughly 38.5 cubic metres.

PPAP also noted that 78 passenger boats carrying 5075 people docked at its facilities over the period up from zero in the same time last year.

PPAP director-general Hei Bavy credited the upturn in the port business to general improvements in economic activity which he tied to the relatively subdued spread of Covid-19 and easing of pandemic-linked restrictions across the globe.

“Economic activity has been improving since most countries opened their borders post-Covid-19 which has contributed to the growth of the port’s business performance during the period” he said.

Last year PPAP reported net profits at $12.7 million – up 29 per cent over 2020 – and container throughput at 348898 TEU up nearly 20.0 per cent from 290857 TEUs in 2020 which followed a 3.49 increase from 2019.

In late March Bavy disclosed that PPAP had forecast container throughput of 394679 TEUs this year as Covid-19 tapers off which would be a 13.12 per cent jump from the 2021 figure. The company is well on track to pass that target.",,,,,,

Hope Valley is full of love triangles and complex love stories but the cast of When Calls the Heart’s real-life romances aren’t quite as hard to keep track of.

Erin Krakow Chris McNally and Kevin McGarry are just some of the Hallmark Channel stars who have become family over the show’s more than nine season run. The series which got picked up in June 2022 for season 10 made its premiere in 2014.

During that time the protagonist Elizabeth Thatcher (Krakow) has found love more than once — settling down with Lucas Bouchard (McNally) during season 8 after having to choose between him and Nathan Grant (McGarry). Off screen however Krakow has been much quieter about her love life.

In fact the A Cinderella Story actress hasn’t shared much of any of her romantic liaisons with her fans via social media. McNally has been equally as hush-hush about his relationship with fellow Hallmark star Julie Gonzalo.

In January 2019 the actor confirmed he was seeing someone but didn’t reveal it was his Sweetest Heart costar. “I am mostly focusing on the puppies” McNally told My Devotional Thoughts at the time. “My girlfriend and I each adopted a puppy so I’m looking forward to being home with them when I can.”

Three years later Gonzalo surprised fans when she shared that the couple had welcomed their first child. “Our hearts are full … Welcome baby M ♥️” the Christmas With the Kranks star captioned the June 2022 snap tagging her beau in the picture.

Krakow was quick to send her well-wishes to her TV husband commenting with three smiling face with hearts emojis. Andrea Brooks who has starred alongside McNally since he joined the show in 2019 added a series of pink heart emojis.

McGarry who joined the series as the beloved Mountie in 2019 found love while appearing on the Hallmark drama. News broke in November 2020 that the Wedding Veil actor was dating When Calls the Heart’s Kayla Wallace.

The duo who also costarred in 2022’s Feeling Butterflies have since begun to show off their real-life romance to fans little by little.

“Sunshine of my life the source of 99% of my laughter: my dearest Kevin. Happy Birthday to you 💙” the Snowed in for Christmas actress wrote via Instagram in March 2022 gushing over her man.

Three months later the lovebirds celebrated their series’ renewal in Italy alongside pals Krakow and Ben Rosenbaum.

“News just reached Italy🇮🇹 Mamma Mia! Here we go again! #Season10” Wallace captioned a vacation snap with the crew in Venice. “Congrats to my When Calls the Heart family🌹 #hearties.” The three other actors reposted the image and proceeded to toast the show’s success.

A yearly tradition that has been going on for nearly a decade students at Sutton Middle School were challenged to beat the $450 they raised the previous year for the Santa Fund. And they did so easily.

“The kids are really excited about the fact that they absolutely smashed last year's or any previous years’” said Casey Cummins a social studies teacher and seventh grade student adviser. “We were happy to make that sizable donation to the Santa Fund.”

Each grade’s class officers take on a fundraising or community service effort every year and for seventh graders the T&G Santa is the largest Cummins said.

T&G Santa: Merry Christmas from T&G Santa!

Now in its 84th year the T&G Santa Fund and partner United Way of Central Massachusetts turn monetary donations into gifts for children to unwrap on Christmas morning.

Having inherited organizing and managing the Santa Fund from a previous teacher eight years ago Cummins puts the collection process into the hands of his seventh grade class officers.

Class officers are typically elected to the role but because of COVID-19 taking away opportunities from students in recent years the 15 students who expressed interest this year were all made officers.

The position is meant to help them “get them ready to be in a leadership role in eighth grade and hopefully in high school they continue to be involved in student government.”

He said that it is meant for students who are interested in student government but may not have the time commitment if they are involved in other activities or sports.

Lunchtime raffle held

This year’s class officers sold raffle tickets for $1 at lunchtime for two weeks allowing their classmates as well as the sixth-graders whom they share lunch period with to come and buy a ticket. Eighth graders also had the opportunity to donate taking a break in between classes to stop by Cummins' office and drop off the money.

The ticket gives them a chance to win a prize such as a gift he said. And while most students would bring in a dollar to participate others would bring in bigger bills to help achieve their goal.

Efforts to raise money had been made in the past he said through things like bake sales but the promise of a lunchtime performance from their teachers as well as a lot of excitement around making sure kids have a “special Christmas” helped make the big push to beat previous years’ records.

“I think that certainly resonated with a lot of kids and I think they went home and … mentioned it and their parents encouraged them or gave them their money” he said. “It was definitely a collective effort.”

Principal Anne Corron said she was proud of her students for their “generosity of spirit.”

“[It] never ceases to amaze me. They get so fired up about it at lunch and they get excited about donating and helping others in the local community” she said.

Students also received praise from Superintendent Kimberly Roberts-Morandi who said that it’s “an incredible source of pride” to see the impact of their students on the community.

“They took an idea ran with it and made a difference for the community” Roberts-Morandi said. “Their work is an inspiration and a challenge to the rest of us to continue to find ways to give back.”

He said that the experience was also rewarding for him seeing students take it seriously and have a sense of responsibility and that it makes him “feel good” to have a school community who understands “how important it is to help others” and be selfless.

“We don't do it to make ourselves feel good” Cummins said. “But it certainly at this time that's so crazy and so chaotic and people can get really focused on what they have going on it's really impressive to see young kids in a school community rally for something like this.”

Since 1938 the T&G Santa Fund has helped ensure community agencies and organizations are able to provide thousands of children presents to unwrap Christmas morning.

Sutton Middle School is among the 21 other groups acting as T&G Santa’s helpers this year.

The others include Canterbury Elementary School; Catholic Charities Worcester County and Southbridge; Centro Inc.; the state Department of Mental Health; Devereux Therapeutic Foster Care; Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health; Friendly House; Gardner CAC; The Guild of St. Agnes; Jeremiah’s Inn; Pernet Family Health Service; Rainbow Child Development Center; Salvation Army of Fitchburg Greater Milford and Worcester; Spanish American Center; Worcester Housing Authority; Webster Square Daycare Center; Winchendon CAC and Yes We Care.

Jennings Secondary School student Dequan Cummins loved to play football Dequan (right) with friend Keane Gregoire

The agonising wait for answers by a Nut Grove father who feared his teenage son had perished in a blaze at their home in January has come to a heartbreaking end.

Michael Cummins’ worst fears were realised this week when long-awaited results of a DNA swab confirmed that badly burnt remains found among the rubble of his home were those of 16-year-old Dequan.

The family had waited more than 11 months for an overseas laboratory to return the results.

Pathology reports have often been delayed due to tardy payments by the government to professionals in neighbouring islands. The government previously said it was striving to settle debts to expedite the process.

Cummins 45 told Observer yesterday he had known that the body was that of his child. But the results bring a sense of closure and pave the way for the boy to be buried.

Cummins previously spent weeks searching for Dequan who he had raised alone since he was a toddler.

The teenager who attended Jennings Secondary School was described as one who loved plants along with playing football and basketball.

On Friday his childhood friend Keane Gregoire told Observer he would never forget Dequan. He added that he was saddened but “holding up”.

Fire chiefs previously said their investigations had determined the blaze was started accidentally by an open flame.

The catastrophic inferno razed Cummins’ home and two others to the ground in the early hours of January 10.

Cummins who washes cars and does casual maintenance and landscaping work told Observer he is still homeless as a result.

The family plans to stage a candlelight vigil in Dequan’s memory on the anniversary of the tragedy next month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbnoubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYm9sYW5kLXJldGFpbnMtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1zcG90LXZzLTAwNDcwNDcxNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boland retains Australian spot vs South Africa in 2nd test,"Australia's Scott Boland appeals unsuccessfully for the wicket of South Africa's Khaya Zondo during day two of the first cricket test between South Africa and Australia at the Gabba in Brisbane Australia Sunday Dec.18 2022. (AP Photo/Tertius Pickard)

MELBOURNE Australia (AP) — Last year’s Boxing Day hero Scott Boland has retained his spot in Australia’s bowling attack and will line up at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against South Africa beginning Monday.

The fast bowler will return to the scene of his test debut last December with Australia selectors opting for Boland over Josh Hazlewood who continues his recovery from a side strain.

Captain Pat Cummins confirmed Sunday that Australia would stick with the same XI that beat the Proteas by six wickets in just two days in the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane.

“We gave Joshy every chance it just got to a stage where Joshy more than anyone else probably thought he was a bit underdone” Cummins said. “It’s probably the mark of the man that he himself thought ‘I don’t feel quite right’ and pulled himself out of selection.”

Boland has taken 25 wickets in his five tests at an average of 10.36. The 33-year-old Boland ran through England batters with six wickets and allowing only seven runs at the MCG last year to secure man-of-the-match honors on debut to help Australia retain the Ashes.

Australia will be looking to secure its first test series win against South Africa on home soil since 2005-06 by going 2-0 up at the MCG. The third test is in Sydney beginning Jan. 4.

Veteran opener David Warner will become just the 14th Australian to play 100 tests when he lines up against the Proteas. The left-hander will be hoping his milestone match brings about some runs in the red-ball format -- he has not scored a test century since January 2020.

South Africa captain Dean Elgar has confirmed at least one change to his side’s batting lineup but would not say who is in or out ahead of Monday’s toss at the MCG.

While Elgar praises their pace attack as the best in the world South Africa is not making enough runs to give the bowlers a realistic chance. They have scored more than 400 only once this year against Bangladesh.

Their woes were highlighted on the Gabba green-top in the first test.

“Our build-up in Brisbane was brilliant we had two weeks that the guys were actually batting quite well” said the opener who was dismissed for three and two at the Gabba.

“It was a bit of a hiccup that we had (at) the Gabba. But both batting units had that bar one batsman (Travis Head’s 92 for Australia). Going back to the drawing board that was the biggest thing for us . . . “

Marco Jansen appears to be one player who can help South Africa maintain its strong bowling performance.

The 22-year-old Jansen has taken 40 wickets in eight tests at an average of 18 but he’s also grown three centimeters -- just over an inch -- taller than he is listed after having another growth spurt.

The 2.09 meter (6 foot 7-inch) left-armer took 3-32 in the first innings at the Gabba and will be crucial to the Proteas’ chances of hitting back to level the series.

Jansen was a two-sport star as a teen -- a provincial rugby union player in South Africa when he was 16. But the position he played is a surprise.

“I played rugby as a flyhalf” Jansen said of the position often played by smaller speedier guys. “I stopped when I was 16 or 17 and that is when I started growing. I am 209 centimeters now. That was the last time I was officially measured.”

The Proteas had earlier invited Jansen to be a net bowler to help them prepare for tests. He recalled seeing greats Vernon Philander Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel at those sessions and wanted to follow in their footsteps. Now he leans on the current trio of Kagiso Rabada Anrich Nortje and Lungi Ngidi.

“Learning off them is special for me and they have helped me quite a lot” Jansen said. “When I have a few questions they tell me to keep it simple.""

Rabada said Jansen was living up to the challenge.

“He is an X-factor bowler and so natural. Watch him bowl and it is like he could wake up at 3 a.m. and do what he did in the first innings (at the Gabba)” Rabada said. “He is extremely natural. He’s gifted. He’s got height. He’s got pace. He’s got bounce. He can swing the ball. He can nip the ball. What more do you want? And he’s a leftie. That’s pretty rare.”

The business model along with physician payment models are crucial drivers for the adoption of innovations. In the U.S. physician payment is mostly codified in the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). Until recently CPT codes related to digital medicine activities were mainly limited to telephone services. To embrace the evolving implementation of the various modalities of digital medicine the American Medical Association (AMA) determined that a more comprehensive codeset is needed. Thus the Digital Medicine Payment Advisory Group (DMPAG) was initiated in late 2016. Since then the DMPAG has achieved a significant and measurable impact on digital medicine intervention adoption by introducing CPT codes for remote physiologic monitoring remote therapeutic monitoring artificial intelligence and other digital innovations.

Digital medicine interventions (e.g. telehealth digital therapeutics and artificial intelligence) have opened new channels for health care delivery and created new efficiencies in the health care delivery process1. This contrasts with other innovations such as novel therapeutics diagnostics and devices that also enhance the care delivery process. Digital medicine interventions have faced more adoption challenges than those less disruptive to the care delivery process23. A critical driver of the adoption of innovations in care delivery is the business model4. The majority of healthcare decisions involve physicians and accordingly physician payment models are an essential lever for adoption of digital medicine interventions5. In the U.S. virtually all physician payment is codified in a set of codes referred to as Current Procedural Terminology (CPT “www.ama-assn.org/amaone/cpt-current-procedural-terminology”). CPT is governed by the American Medical Association (AMA “www.ama-assn.org”). The CPT code set codifies the level of physician work and/or practice expense related to a care delivery process. Code Change Applications (CCA) for new codes or updates to existing codes are presented to the CPT Editorial Panel three times per year. If the panelists feel that there is sufficient evidence to support the code’s use and that the CCA is not represented by the current code set the panelists will approve the CCA. The approved CCA then goes to the RUC (RBRVS (Resource-Based Relative Value Scale) Utilization Committee) for suggested valuation which is then submitted to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS “www.cms.gov”). CMS determines if Medicare will pay for the CPT code. Many private (commercial) insurers consider the CMS coverage and valuation decisions when making their coverage and payment decisions for health care provider services represented by CPT codes. Many of the CCAs related to digital medicine intervention have been submitted to the AMA CPT Panel by the Digital Medicine Payment Advisory Group (DMPAG “www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/digital-medicine-payment-advisory-group”).

Until recently physician payment for digital medicine activities was scarce and mainly limited to telehealth consultations for patients in Health Profession Shortage Areas as defined by CMS. Digital therapeutics remote physiologic monitoring artificial intelligence and other digital innovations reached the marketplace during this phase.

In 2015 the CPT Editorial panel assembled the Telehealth Services Workgroup to address the growth of interest in telehealth. The initial work product of this group was Appendix P (CPT Codes That May Be Used for Synchronous Telemedicine Services) of the CPT code set. Though this was viewed as a positive step the AMA leadership determined that a more comprehensive view was needed. In late 2016 the multi-stakeholder DMPAG was convened. The DMPAG consists of 18 people 50% digital medicine experts or practitioners and 50% experts in the CPT process.

The achievement record of the DMPAG has been remarkable. At the time of inception there was no reimbursement path for digital medical interventions such as remote physiologic monitoring remote therapeutic monitoring asynchronous exchange of information between doctor and patient online consultation between a primary provider and a specialist or use of any healthcare-related mobile applications.

Over the first six years of the DMPAG the group’s impact on digital medicine adoption has been significant and measurable. CPT codes for services in the paragraph above now exist and are paid by CMS and many private insurers. Table 1 lists a compilation of these services and their corresponding codes published in the CPT manual. Table 1 CPT codes and appendices developed by the DMPAG. Full size table

When new reimbursement codes are introduced and adopted by CMS it takes several years to see measurable reimbursement activity. The earliest codes to be promulgated by the DMPAG were codes to support the care of patients using remote physiologic monitoring (RPM) technologies. These codes were conceived in 2017 and became part of the CMS-reimbursed code set in 2019. We have two years of data on their use in Medicare and as illustrated in Fig. 1 the growth in the utilization of these codes was substantial. Codes for chronic care management (CCM) released in 2016 are offered for comparison. The growth trajectory is substantially less. Quite likely the COVID-19 pandemic played an important role in catalyzing RPM code reimbursement adoption. This further illustrates that the DMPAG has kept pace with the implementation of digital medicine interventions. Fig. 1: CPT codes of Chronic Care Management (CCM) and Remote Physiologic Monitoring (RPM). a The CCM codes stand for: 99487: CCM services with the following required elements: multiple (two or more) chronic conditions expected to last at least 12 months or until the death of the patient; first 60 min of clinical staff time directed by a physician or other qualified health care professional per calendar month; 99489: add-on code: each additional 30 min of clinical staff time directed by a physician or other qualified health care professional per calendar month. b The RPM codes are defined as: 99453: RPM parameter(s) (e.g. weight blood pressure pulse oximetry respiratory flow rate) initial; set-up and patient education on use of equipment; 99454 : Device(s) supply with daily recording(s) or programmed alert(s) transmission each 30 days; 99457: RPM treatment management services 20 min or more of clinical staff/physician/other qualified healthcare professional time in a calendar month requiring interactive communication with the patient/caregiver during the month; 99458: RPM treatment management services clinical staff/physician/other qualified health care professional time in a calendar month requiring interactive communication with the patient/caregiver during the month; additional 20 min. Full size image

Following the RPM code implementation the DMPAG was instrumental in developing and refining the parallel set of codes for the gap in CPT coding for remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) technologies. These RTM codes are new enough that to date the utilization data for the RTM codes is limited.

Another example of a code born of the DMPAG’s efforts allows for reimbursement for so-called e-consults where a clinician (often a primary care clinician) sends relevant information about a complex case to a specialist. The specialist can now be reimbursed for that activity. Fig. 2 illustrates the growth in the utilization of those codes. Fig. 2: CPT codes of Interprofessional telephone/ internet/ EHR consultation. The CPT codes are defined as: 99451: Interprofessional telephone/internet/electronic health record assessment and management service provided by a consultative physician including a written report to the patient’s treating/requesting physician or other qualified health care professional 5 min or more of medical consultative time; 99452: Interprofessional telephone/internet/electronic health record referral service(s) provided by a treating/requesting physician or other qualified health care professional 30 min. Full size image

Since DMPAG’s initiation in 2016 digital therapeutics artificial intelligence (sometimes referred to as augmented intelligence) and other digital innovations have reached the marketplace and the AMA has attempted to resolve the complexity of appropriate reimbursement for digital medicine. The DMPAG has taken its moniker of ‘digital medicine’ seriously and not focused simply on telehealth and remote care. A recent example of another foray into technology-related reimbursement has been efforts to create a taxonomy for using augmented intelligence in healthcare delivery (Table 2). Table 2 Taxonomy for the use of augmented intelligence in healthcare. Full size table

What makes the DMPAG successful? The group formed a productive culture and chemistry early on. The AMA has devoted tremendous resources to giving the group a perspective on upcoming challenges in digital medicine payment and the tools needed to gather the data required to make thoughtful policy recommendations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2N2cy1jaHJpc3RtYXMtaG91cnMtc3RvcmUtb3Blbi0yMTAwMDA1MDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What are CVS' Christmas hours?

The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that it will overhaul packaging labels for the emergency contraceptive pill Plan B that women can take after having sex to prevent a pregnancy.

The federal agency said it will remove references on the contraception's packaging that claim without scientific evidence that the pill prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb.

The new labels are intended to further distinguish the emergency contraception — also known as the morning after pill — from abortion pills which end a pregnancy after a fertilized egg has implanted in the lining of a woman’s uterus.

In a memo released Friday the FDA clarified that taking Plan B pills is not the same as an abortion a fact that has long been understood in the medical community.

""Evidence does not support that the drug affects implantation or maintenance of a pregnancy after implantation therefore it does not terminate a pregnancy"" the FDA said in its statement.

The agency added that the emergency contraception works similarly to birth control in preventing pregnancy but contains a higher dose of levonorgestrel. The pill prevents ovulation.

About a quarter of women say they've used emergency contraception pills at some point according to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control released last year.

Still concern has swirled that access to emergency contraception such as Plan B might be limited in some states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion this summer. Nevada's Republican governor-elect said he'd consider banning the pill during a debate this year. School clinics in Idaho also prohibited the pills under a law banning public funding for ""abortion related services"" last year.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved Plan B for use up to 72 hours or three days after unprotected sex. Women are able to get the emergency contraception over the counter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2lsbGlub2lzL29ha2xhd24vbWFyaWFub3MtamV3ZWwtY2hyaXN0bWFzLTIwMjItZ3JvY2VyeS1ob3Vycy1vYWstbGF3btIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mariano's Jewel: Christmas 2022 Grocery Hours In Oak Lawn,"Business & Tech Mariano's Jewel: Christmas 2022 Grocery Hours In Oak Lawn Find out when you can pick up those last-minute Christmas dinner additions from Fairplay Jewel Mariano's and Tony's in Oak Lawn.

Chris Perkins who lost reelection to the Weld RE-4 board in November 2021 and David Sislowski who was elected to the Windsor town board in 2018 and ran for mayor two years later will be interviewed during a special school district board of education meeting Tuesday Jan. 3 in Windsor.

The meeting begins at 5 p.m. at the Weld RE-4 board room in the district administration building on Main Street in Windsor.

Perkins and Sislowski will be interviewed with fellow Windsor residents Joel Kiesey Nick Mask and Raymond Ruth to fill the District A seat that opened with Aaron Smith’s resignation last month.

Smith announced his resignation Nov. 14 after serving nearly a year on the board. He defeated incumbent Perkins by 283 votes in November 2021 and was sworn in later in the month.

The selected appointee will fill the remainder of Smith’s term until November 2025. The appointee will then be eligible to run for election.

Weld RE-4 began accepting applications soon after Smith’s resignation. Those interested had until Dec. 16 to apply.

Kiesey has been a certified public accountant for the last 14 years he said in his application to the school district. He has lived at his address in Windsor for about 18 months and is a senior tax manager for KBF CPAS in Windsor according to his LinkedIn.

Mask is a software developer by trade and works at Zing Studios in Longmont according to his LinkedIn page. He has lived at his Windsor address for a little more than five years. He said in his application materials he’s the president of a small Longmont corporation that provides software development services.

Ruth is an executive for Danaher Corporation where he leads a global services organization for Beckman Coulter Diagnostics according to his application. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics is a health care diagnostics company and part of the Danaher Corporation family of global science and technology companies.

He has lived at his Windsor address for a little more than three years.

Finding a replacement for Smith will mark the third time since spring 2021 the Weld RE-4 board has filled a seat by appointment.

Current board member Patrick Miller was named to the board in January following the resignation of board president Jennifer Lieber in November 2021. Miller’s term expires in November 2023.

Lance Nichols was appointed in April 2021 following the resignation of Brad Irion. Nichols the board vice president won election to the board in November 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vaml0c21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9uaWNob2xhcy1tZXJlZ2FsaS12LWNyYWlnLWpvbmVzLXJlbWF0Y2gtcG9zdHBvbmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nicholas Meregali v Craig Jones Rematch Postponed - Jitsmagazine.com,"Nicholas Meregali and Craig Jones first met in their epic semi-final match of the under 99kg division at the 2022 ADCC world championships and it was immediately clear that this was a rivalry that was likely to spawn a rematch in the near-future. There was plenty of back-and-forth action between the pair and neither man was able to score any points in order to win a definitive decision. Instead it went to the judges and they declared Jones to be the winner a decision that the majority of fans at home seemed to agree with as well.

They then shared the podium at the event after Meregali defeated Rafael Lovato Jr in the third-place match and Jones lost the final to Kaynan Duarte on points. With Meregali training under John Danaher for ADCC 2022 and representing New Wave Jiu-Jitsu at the event there was already a built-in storyline when he came up against former Danaher student and the founder of B-Team Jiu-Jitsu in Jones. It seems as though Nicholas Meregali and Craig Jones were happy to see that story play out further when they both agreed to a rematch at the upcoming Who’s Number One event on February 25th 2023.

The match was set to serve as the co-main event underneath another rematch that fans are dying to see Gordon Ryan v Felipe Pena 4. The event itself will still go ahead as planned and the main event is unaffected although there has not yet been a new co-main event confirmed for it. The winner of the under 99kg division at ADCC 2022 Kaynan Duarte has publicly offered to replace Jones against Meregali in February but the challenge was rejected and neither Jones or Meregali will compete at the event.

The news that the Nicholas Meregali v Craig Jones rematch was being postponed was announced in a post to the official Instagram account of FloGrappling:",,,,,,,,,

(Gabriele Holtermann-Gorden/Sipa/Newscom)

In June 2019 tractors were parked on Broadway Avenue to protest the New York City Council's foie gras ban. (Gabriele Holtermann-Gorden/Sipa/Newscom)

New York City's terrible foie gras ban passed in 2019 at the urging of animal-rights groups is on life support.

In an order issued last week the state's agriculture department found the city's ban on the sale of foie gras violates state law. The order blasts ""the City's effort to use its police powers and business regulatory authority to bar the sale of a lawfully produced farm product—not for reasons of the health safety or welfare of its citizens—but to change animal husbandry practices occurring on farms outside its jurisdiction to which it objects.""

The order which characterizes the ban as ""unusual"" ""unreasonabl[e]"" and ""legislative overreach"" gives New York City 30 days to appeal. If the city fails to do so within a month—the city says it's pondering its next move—then the order will become final.

While I welcome the likely death of the city's foie gras ban—and hated the very idea of it—news of its seemingly imminent demise comes as no great surprise. That's because the city was put on notice years ago that its foie gras ban is illegal.

""[T]he state's Department of Agriculture and Markets informed New York City two years ago that its foie gras ban 'directly and unreasonably restricts Plaintiffs' farming operations in violation of' state law"" I explained in a column earlier this year that detailed the filing of a lawsuit challenging the city ban.

This month's order issued by that same state agriculture department and saying virtually the exact same thing should make that fact abundantly clear to any elected official in New York City who hasn't been paying attention. The ban is illegal.

As the agriculture department details New York State law ""protects farmers against local laws which unreasonably restrict farm operations located within an agricultural district."" The key issue in such cases the department explains is whether a local law in question protects the health and safety of its residents. If it doesn't then the local law is illegal.

In its order the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets notes that in 2020 it ""invited [New York] City to submit documentation or other evidence to support any claimed public health or safety threats related to… production of 'force-fed' livestock products.""

Instead New York City essentially sat on its hands for two years before thumbing its nose at the state.

""The City made no factual submissions to the Department"" the order notes. Instead the order says the city claimed that the state agriculture department ""lacks jurisdiction"" to ""supersede"" New York City's local ban.

The agriculture department's order is the latest (and most serious) rebuke. In the aforementioned lawsuit filed in May by two New York State foie gras farms the plaintiffs argue the ban violates state law and could cost hundreds of Upstate farming jobs—not to mention restaurant jobs in the city itself—if it were to take effect. But it didn't take effect. In September a New York state judge enjoined the city from enforcing the ban while the case makes its way through the courts. That means city restaurants have continued to sell foie gras legally despite the ban.

This month's order then likely signals the demise of a ban that never even took effect.

Sergio Saravia of La Belle Farm one of the plaintiffs told The New York Times the order is ""a weight off our shoulders.""

""[T]he order stops local municipalities from establishing a dangerous precedent of dictating to us what farmers can grow and what people can eat"" said Marcus Henley of Hudson Valley Foie Gras another of the plaintiffs. ""It's great news for farmers and fine diners everywhere.""

While New York City Mayor Eric Adams hasn't yet said whether the city will fight the order he's previously lauded the ban.

""The days of foie gras are gone and foie-gotten in New York City"" the punny Adams tweeted in 2019 after the New York City Council passed the ban. ""A new law will END this cruel practice in our city for good.""

In addition to the demise of New York City's ban the U.S. Supreme Court may finally hear a challenge to California's terrible ban on the sale of foie gras in that entire state. Earlier this week Reason Foundation submitted an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff foie gras producers who are challenging the California law. That means 2023 could spell the end of two of America's worst food bans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDQ1NDc5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for John Edward Meyers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDQ1NDc5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223873220>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

“The air access sector continues to strengthen as renowned airlines such as Delta Air Lines continue betting on the combination of modern infrastructure diversity of options and accessibility that Puerto Rico has as a world-class destination in the Caribbean region” said Carlos Mercado Santiago the executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company.

The service from Detroit one of Delta’s key U.S. cities will be operating once-weekly on Saturdays through April 8.

Both routes will be operated on Delta’s B739 aircraft with capacity for 180 passengers.

“The increase in routes and frequencies from important domestic and “international flight centers in addition to offering greater convenience to travelers looking for a place to spend the winter season boosts economic activity benefits thousands of local workers and increases the contribution from the tourism sector to the development of the island’s economy” said Mercado Santiago.

Indeed Puerto Rico has been seeing a wave of new airlift in the last few years as the island’s tourism industry has boomed amid the pandemic.

“Puerto Rico is one of the most popular destinations in the Caribbean especially for Delta customers said Amy Martin vice president of International Network Planning for Delta Airlines. “Now Delta customers in San Juan will have access to two additional flight hubs in the United States where they can conveniently connect to more destinations around the world.

Thousands of travelers were stranded at airports or stuck on hold trying to rebook flights this week as a massive storm snarled travel in the U.S. and Canada ahead of the holidays.

With the snow rain ice wind and frigid temperatures disrupting air travel plans nationwide United Southwest American Delta and JetBlue are the five major airlines offering flyers a little extra cushion this holiday weekend.

But how does each airline’s system work?

Kurt Ebenhoch a consumer travel advocate and former airline executive said travelers should read the fine print carefully. If you book a return flight outside the window that the airline sets you may have to pay for the difference in fares for example.

United

United Airlines will waive change fees and fare differences for passengers traveling through the East Coast Texas Central and Northwest and the Midwest.

Passengers have until Dec. 28 2022 to rebook.

Airlines say one of the best things travelers can do is download their app for information. This way you will stay up to date about any possible delays cancellations or any additional travel options.

As of Friday afternoon more than 4800 flights into or out of U.S. airports had been canceled according to the flight tracking service FlightAware.

Staying calm -- and knowing your rights -- can go a long way if your flight is canceled experts say. Here’s some of their advice for dealing with a flight cancellation:

MY FLIGHT WAS CANCELED. WHAT NEXT?

If you still want to get to your destination most airlines will rebook you for free on the next available flight as long as it has seats according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

If you want to cancel the trip you are entitled to a full refund even if you bought non-refundable tickets. You’re also entitled to a refund of any bag fees seat upgrades or other extras.

Ebenhoch stressed that travelers are eligible for a refund not just vouchers for future travel. If you do take a voucher make sure you inquire about blackout dates and other restrictions on its use.

CAN I ASK TO BE BOOKED ON ANOTHER AIRLINE’S FLIGHT?

Yes. Airlines aren’t required to put you on another airline’s flight but they can and sometimes do according to the DOT. Jeff Klee CEO of CheapAir.com recommends researching alternate flights while you’re waiting to talk to an agent. Agents are typically under a lot of pressure when a flight is canceled so giving them some options helps.

Ebenhoch also suggests looking for alternative airports that are close to your original destination.

IS THE AIRLINE REQUIRED TO GIVE ME A HOTEL ROOM OR OTHER COMPENSATION?

No. Each airline has its own policies about providing for customers whose flights are canceled according to the DOT. But many airlines do offer accommodations so you should check with their staff.

I’M FACING A LONG WAIT TO REBOOK. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

If someone in your traveling party is at a higher level in a frequent flier program use the number reserved for that level to call the airline Ebenhoch said. You can also try calling an international help desk for the airline since those agents have the ability to make changes.

HOW CAN I AVOID THIS IN THE FUTURE?

Ebenhoch said nonstop flights and morning flights are generally the most reliable if you can book them. If you’re worried about making it to the airport in time for a morning flight he said consider staying at a hotel connected to the airport the night before. And consider flying outside of busy dates; this year the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration is expecting big crowds on Dec. 30 for example.

Klee recommends comparing airlines’ policies on the DOT’s service dashboard: https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard. He also suggests reserving multiple flights and then canceling the ones you don’t use as long as the airline will refund your money or convert it into a credit for a future flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVhc3RhZnJpY2FuLmNvLmtlL3RlYS9idXNpbmVzcy9ldGhpb3BpYW4td2hvLW1ha2Utb3ItYnJlYWsta3EtZGVsdGEtZGVhbC00MDY1NDcw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former ET boss Tewolde at the centre of KQ-Delta deal,"By The EastAfrican More by this Author

When the Kenyan delegation led by President William Ruto met with officials of Delta Airlines in Washington to discuss a proposal on the sale of national carrier Kenya Airways a familiar figure sat with the Americans. Tewolde Gebremariam the man credited with the success story of Africa’s biggest carrier Ethiopian Airlines sat across the table.

No one at that meeting understands African aviation more than Mr Tewolde who was the Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines for 11 years until March this year when he suddenly retired for “health reasons.”

The Ethiopian is a senior strategy adviser for Delta and will be crucial in making or breaking the deal under discussion between the two airlines whose outcome will come down to the transaction advisers.

Mr Tewolde who Delta will be looking up to in the negotiations buried KQ’s hopes of dominating the African skies with the latest African Airlines Association data showing that in 2021 ET carried 7053000 million against Kenya Airways’ 1489000.

Ailing carrier

Dr Ruto when he met the Delta team in Washington DC on the side-lines of the US-Africa Leaders Summit expressed his desire to sell off the ailing carrier which posted a half-year loss of about $80 million.

“I’m willing to sell the whole of Kenya Airways” Dr Ruto said. “I’m not in the business of running an airline that just has a Kenyan flag — that’s not my business.”

Kenya Airways CEO Kilavuka was non-comiital on whether the government was offloading its entire stake saying that a decision was yet to be reached.

“No decisions have been made. However we are exploring all possible options that would best address the financing needs of KQ. The government of Kenya at the beginning of the year agreed to fund our restructuring. We are implementing this restructuring plan. However because of changing priorities GoK has indicated that they would like us to pursue alternative funding proposals. This has therefore necessitated us to look at plausible opportunities for the airline with the full support of GoK” Mr Kilavuka told The EastAfrican.

If Delta accepts the President’s proposal and acquires the government’s 48.9 percent stake in the airline it would be the biggest shareholding by a US carrier in a foreign airline. The other shareholders include a consortium of local lenders (38.1 percent) Air France-KLM (7.8 percent) and minority shareholders (two percent).

Deeper penetration

A deal would give Delta deeper penetration in Africa and increase its options for distributing traffic between Asia and the United States.

On the flipside a deal for KQ is critical in light of the shifting competition landscape and Qatar Airways’ ongoing bid to acquire a 49 percent stake in RwandAir.

According to international stockmarket and financial news website Market Screener Delta’s current largest shareholding is AeroMexico which it owns 20 percent. Other stakes are 9 percent of China Eastern Airlines 2.86 percent of Air France-KLM and 2.94 percent of LATAM. This is in addition to shares in other non-airline entities.

Delta’s competitor United Airlines owns 8.04 percent of Azul while American Airlines holds 5.83 percent of China Southern Airlines.

Transaction advisers

But it is early days before one can tell if Delta will bite President Ruto’s hook and how much of KQ it would eventually settle for. The nitty-gritty of any prospective deal will be determined by transaction advisers on both sides of the table. Delta will be burning the midnight oil conducting due diligence to determine what it deems to be fair value for a stake in KQ.

Although it comes with higher financial obligations a controlling stake in the carrier would give Delta more leverage in pushing through hard positions when it comes tom issues such as rationalising the headcount.

The question of KQ’s existing debt would have to be settled. One likely option would be for the government to take it off the balance sheet to shore up KQ’s value. Leaving the new entity to assume the debt would significantly lower KQ’s value and make the deal a hard-sell to the Kenyan public who view the carrier as one of the crown jewels.

Beyond the financial side they would seek clarity on the Kenyan government’s role in the restructured carrier. Would the government retain a golden share and veto powers and use regulatory instruments to shield KQ from competition? The status of the other shareholders and their agreeability to Delta would also have to be determined.

Stemming haemorrhage

Whatever price Delta offers the value of having it on board is not the purchase price but rather in stemming the haemorrhage and new capital that it will bring. An unencumbered KQ will be nimble and better positioned to grasp emerging opportunities offered by a liberalised market and the African Continental Free Trade Area. It will also benefit from Delta’s muscle to acquire new aircraft lower purchase prices or lease rates and better finance terms.

Even though it is not a matter of life and death closing the deal is important to KQ’s various stakeholder groups. Overall passengers would see a better-quality product while the taxpayers would be saved the burden of shoring up the airline’s capital base.

Mr Tewolde who Delta will be looking up to in the negotiations buried KQ’s hopes of dominating the African skies with AFRAA data showing that in 2021 ET carried 7053000 million against Kenya Airways 1489000.

He led the Ethiopian flag carrier for 11 years with success reflected in its exponential growth from $1 billion annual turnover to $4.5 billion; from 33 airplanes to 140 currently and from three million passengers to 12 million (pre-Covid). Under his leadership the airline grew manifold building over $700 million worth of vital infrastructure a big hotel cargo terminal MRO hangars and shops aviation academy and full flight simulators.

Overtook Emirates

It was during Mr Tewolde’s leadership that Ethiopian overtook Emirates to become the biggest connector between Asia and Africa as well as within Africa. It became Africa’s top airline in both passenger volumes and fleet size.

Early this year before his sudden retirement he announced the signing of a memorandum with Boeing -- with which ET has had a longstanding partnership -- for the supply of Freighters. Under the deal the listed aerospace company will supply five 777-8 Freighters the industry’s newest aircraft said to be the most fuel-efficient twin-engine. Mr Tewolde said the agreement would help ET meet its expanding global cargo demand from its hub in Addis Ababa and position it for long-term sustainable growth.

“Consistent with our history of aviation technology leadership in Africa we are pleased to sign this memorandum of understanding with our longstanding partner Boeing which will make us join a select group of launch customer airlines for the fleet” he said.

“In our Vision 2035 we are planning to expand our cargo and logistics business to be one of the largest global multimodal logistics provider on all continents. To this effect we are increasing our dedicated freighter fleet with the latest technology fuel efficient and environment-friendly airplanes of the 21st century.”

High profits

Ethiopian Airline maintained high profits during the better part of Mr Tewolde’s tenure. It defied the Covid-19 storm to post a six percent growth in net profit from $133.4 million in 2019 to $140.93 million in 2020 according to the annual report for the 2019/2020 financial year.

Its operating revenues increased by six percent from $2.2 billion to $2.34 billion and operating expenses went up by one percent to $2.07 billion from $2.05 billion during that year.

The airlines’ borrowing rose by 25 percent to $63.35 million from $50.48 million and its working capital dropped from negative $147.17 million to negative $408 million.

ET’s total assets rose by 61 percent from $4.47 billion to $7.21 billion in the period under review. According to the African Airlines Association (Afraa) 2021 annual report the continent’s airlines posted a cumulative loss of $2 billion in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Cargo services

ET’s cargo services cover more than 120 international destinations around the world with both belly-hold capacity and dedicated freighter services.

Mr Tewolde grew capacity from 8.3 million seats in 2012 to 14.8 million in 2021 after a dip to 11.8 million in 2020. The airline’s reach grew to 114 destinations from its hub in Addis Ababa from 75 in January 2012.

Ethiopian Airlines has a presence in six African countries through a management role or strategic partnership with the local carriers seeking to revive their ailing national carriers.

Before his retirement Mr Tewolde had announced the airline’s plans to restart operations with Ethiopian Mozambique Airlines after terminating the service in May on the back of the Covid-19 pandemic impact on aviation. Besides the Asky in Togo ET also has an interest in Malawian Airlines and Chad-based Tchadia Airlines and has a management contract with Ceiba Intercontinental in Equatorial Guinea.

ET plans to set up an airline in Nigeria and has signed an interline agreement with Johannesburg-based Airlink which allows passengers to have seamless travel on a single ticket on any of the two carriers’ networks.

Pan African Airline

If Kenya sells off the carrier to Delta what happens to the proposed pan-African airline deal with South African Airways?

Mr Kilavuka said the KQ funding proposal complements the pan-African airline group formation.

“The Pan-African Airline Group is a project among African airlines to consolidate the aviation sector in Africa in order to provide customers with the best possible benefits and connectivity for the growth of Africa.

It is also critical to the realisation of Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) and the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA) initiatives both of which will open Africa’s skies boost trade tourism and promote the growth and value of aviation throughout the continent” he said.

On whether KQ would increase its US routes and services Mr Kilavuka said his expansion plan is based on commercial viability of prospective routes.

“Delta Airlines as part of SkyTeam is a strategic partner of Kenya Airways with over 20 codeshare points in the US. Any expansion for Kenya Airways in the US is complemented by this arrangement” he said."

The award has been launched in 2022 by folk website Tradfolk to help raise the profile and change perceptions of traditional folk dance.

Beltane Border Morris who hail from Devon won the public vote of Tradfolk readers from a shortlist of eight dances. The winning performance was filmed in May 2022 at the White Thorn Inn in Shaugh Prior Devon. It features two dozen dancers and band of musicians performing a dance conceived by the team and inspired by a mighty elm tree called the Cross Tree that proudly stood in Moretonhampstead on Dartmoor two centuries ago

The team were formed in 2001 and have been performing around Devon Cornwall and further afield ever since. With around 50 active members and recruiting around half a dozen new dancers a year Beltane’s membership spans the generations bringing together dancers aged between 19 and 75.

Ant Veal co-Squire of Beltane Border Morris said: “We’re thrilled to have our dancing recognised by this award. We always try to exude energy and enthusiasm to an audience through our dancing to make Morris interesting and attractive. Energy is infectious and a great way to inspire others; so much of ordinary daily life can seem rather mundane which makes morris a great form of escapism from that.”

Beltane dance the ‘border’ style of morris which originates from the Welsh borders and is distinguished by its rag jackets fast fluid style and aggressive stick clashing. Around 25 percent of the UK’s 800 or so morris teams dance in the border style and according to the 2020 Morris Census it is the fastest-growing type of morris dance.

Jen Cox Chair of Open Morris the umbrella organisation of which Beltane are members and one of the award shortlisting panel said: “The thing that really sets Beltane apart for me is the energy and uniformity of the wild and free dancing style. The dancers are a diverse range of ages and genders but all mesh into a very cohesive dynamic and vibrant team with excellent quality and accuracy and a wonderful and very tangible commitment to their performances. This is a long way from what people expect morris dancing to be.”

Also representing in the dance shortlist was ‘Cotswold’ morris the form of dance originating mostly from Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire distinguished by its bells and hankies; Yorkshire longsword dancing which uses metre-long rigid metal swords to form shapes and patterns; North West morris which originated from the mills and factories of Lancashire; and ‘rapper’ sword dancing from Northumberland a fast and furious form of dance which uses flexible metal swords and is traditionally danced in pubs;

James Merryclough morris writer for Tradfolk and organiser of the award said: “When most people think of morris dancing they probably imagine slightly portly middle-aged men pottering around at a village fete. Beltane’s winning performance and indeed the rest of our shortlist shows that this stereotype is totally outdated. Not only is there now gender balance amongst morris dancers in the UK but there are plenty of young people are taking up English dance traditions. The number of people dancing morris has continued to grow in recent years; teams in Sheffield for example reported almost fifty new recruits since the pandemic.

“The appeal of morris dancing is that it is a complete hobby; it combines the fitness and stamina of a sports team; the sense of satisfaction and pride of performing arts; and the socialising and camaraderie of a social club. It is a living breathing tradition that continues to adapt and change with our society as shown by the brilliant performance and ethos of Beltane.”

Morris teams regularly ‘dance out’ over the Christmas period particularly on Boxing Day when in the past it was common for agricultural workers to dance at nearby big houses for extra money during winter. Anyone interested in watching morris dancing over Christmas or giving morris a go can use the morris map to find their local sides.

After the pop star encouraged fans to vote in the 2018 midterm elections Ms. Smith registered. The 23-year-old’s most recent rite of passage — getting her first credit card — was also prompted by the singer.

When the 11-time Grammy winner announced her Eras Tour her first in five years Ms. Smith said she knew she had to “do everything in my power to be able to get tickets.” So she signed up for a card through Capital One which partnered with Ms. Swift to promote the tour and offered fans preferential access to presale tickets.

“Taylor Swift was once again that push” said Ms. Smith who lives in Pittsburgh. In addition to getting concert tickets she hoped the card would help her to build good credit. “As I signed up because of the Taylor presale I realized the importance of financial literacy and maybe it should be pushed more in schools and colleges” she said. Ms. Smith who has cerebral palsy was able to get four accessible seats for her and her friends for about $1013 though she used her debit card because the total exceeded her credit card’s limit.

Still getting a credit card was already a goal of Ms. Smith’s partially because her mother had encouraged her to start building credit so that she would have a good credit score when she moved into her own apartment and Ms. Swift’s concert deal led Ms. Smith to take that financial step.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mentor-on-the-Lake Mayor David Eva is enthusiastic about the direction of the city as the community slowly continues to emerge from difficult years during the pandemic.

“It was nice to get back to some form of ‘normal’ in 2022” the mayor said.

Eva said highlights of 2022 included being able to have the fifth annual Fall Festival in September after a two-year absence.

In addition City Council recently approved an overlay district ordinance which will allow a development to progress at the corner of Andrews Road and Lakeshore Boulevard. This project along with a development at the former St. Andrew’s Church on Andrews Road were discussed during the year.

Eva also pointed out there were successful business openings during the past year with CareNow Wellness Center and Pelican’s Snoballs opening on Andrews Road during 2022.

Pelican’s Snoballs is the first Pelican’s franchise in Ohio.

“There was much debate over the projects on Andrews Road and the corner of Andrews Road and Lakeshore Boulevard” Eva said. “Many discussions led to these projects moving forward” Eva said. “As elected officials we all worked together during the year to reach these outcomes

The former St. Andrew’s Church property will be developed to be a Dollar General store. Eva added the architecture for the building will be unique in style and at least 15 percent of the retail space of the store will contain fresh and/or freshly frozen food products which he said was a “positive outcome” despite some opposition from residents.

The 2023 budget will more than likely look a lot like 2022 Eva said. No major purchases are currently scheduled for 2023 in Mentor-on-the-Lake.

He also said the city would like to add full-time personnel to the fire department.

“Both development projects I mentioned should be well underway in 2023” Eva said. “Adding new developments to both properties I believe can lead to further projects in the city. Both properties being developed have been vacant for some time now and it will be a positive lift to the city. We will continue to look for ways to add revenue and reduce expenses.”

Time is officially running out to shop for Christmas gifts in stores and online for pickup and same-day delivery. The big picture: With Christmas Eve falling on a Saturday expect stores to be busier than last year. However the epic winter storm hitting swaths of the U.S. could affect store and mall hours.

There's been a resurgence of consumers shopping in stores this holiday season according to the National Retail Federation.

The shopping season also began earlier than in past years with retailers wanting to help consumers spread out their purchases as they deal with higher costs due to inflation.

Last-minute gifts and shopping

Yes but: The majority of stores will close early on Christmas Eve and will stay closed on Christmas like in past years.

70% of shoppers plan to shop the week after Christmas an NRF survey found.

Meanwhile a CouponBirds survey of 3150 Americans found close to one-third of couples said they would wait until Christmas Eve to shop for their partner's gift.

Christmas Eve same-day delivery

Major retailers will offer same-day delivery through Christmas Eve with on-demand companies including Instacart Shipt DoorDash Uber and Roadie.

Be smart: Place orders early in the day as availability will be limited.

Instacart told Axios that its platform will operate during normal business hours on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day but “the shopping experience will be dependent on local store openings/hours.”

It expects to complete 800 Family Dollar H2 Renovations as part of its Key Real Estate Initiative.

With the nonstop whirlwind of responsibilities and activities especially in the last few weeks no one could blame you if you neglected to get a gift for someone on your list. But let’s be honest do so and that blame will come nonetheless.

Whether you’re frantically searching for a very VERY last-minute gift or a key ingredient for Christmas dinner you’re going to have to be creative this year (and perhaps willing to drive a lot further than usual).

Finding an open store is a challenge in the best of times on Christmas Day. In a world where labor shortages are approaching critical levels it’s even harder. That’s not to say you’re completely out of luck though. There are a few options.

Keep in mind though that hours may vary and even if a national chain says it’s open that doesn’t mean your local branch will be. Also some municipalities have laws prohibiting major stores from opening on Christmas. Before you head out it’s always a good idea to check first.

""Dominion Energy and other utility companies are experiencing high demand on the electric system that will continue for the next few days"" the utility company that provides power to portions of Virginia North Carolina West Virginia Ohio and several other states wrote in an email to customers. ""Customers are asked to reduce their energy usage over these next few days to help protect the stability of the electric system.""

Dominion offered the following tips:

Set thermostats to 68 degrees or lower.

Turn off non-essential internal and external lights.

Unplug non-essential appliances and devices.

Limit the use of major power-consuming equipment such as dishwashers washers and dryers.

Ensure HVAC vents are open and unobstructed.

Temperatures in Richmond were expected to be between 16 and 35 degrees Sunday with warmer temperatures (in the 30s and 40s) later in the week.

A Christmas-week winter storm knocked out power in communities from Maine to Seattle and a major electricity grid operator warned 65 million people across the eastern U.S. of possible rolling blackouts.

But heat and lights were steadily being restored across the U.S. According to poweroutage.us less than 300000 customers were without power at 8 a.m. EDT Sunday - down from a peak of 1.7 million. In North Carolina less than 6600 customers had no power - down from a peak of 485000 or more. Utility officials said rolling blackouts would continue for the next few days.

Across the six New England states about 121300 customers remained without power on Sunday with Maine still the hardest hit. Some utilities said electricity may not be restored for days.

Around 900 Dominion customers remained without power in Central Virginia on Christmas morning. The majority of those outages were reported in and around the town of Ashland in Hanover County.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

We're perfectly happy eating pizza any time of day and who doesn't love Christmas? Sure the holidays are typically filled with more festive food like ham and indulgent sides but if your idea of the perfect Christmas dinner entails plenty of cheese tomato sauce and toppings you may be asking yourself: ""Is Dominos open on Christmas?""

Whether your holiday gift is not having to turn on the oven to feed the family or you just got home from Christmas visits and want a snack while watching Christmas movies there are plenty of reasons to give Domino's a call. That's why it's important to stay up-to-date on the chain's Christmas hours. Of course for people who don't celebrate Christmas it can be frustrating to figure out which restaurants are open on Christmas Day and the ones that are open tend to be very busy so pizza can be a quick and inexpensive fix.

To help you out we've found out if Domino's is open on December 25.



Is Domino's open on Christmas 2022?

The Domino's near you could be open on Christmas but it's hard to know for sure. The reason? A rep for the restaurant tells CountryLiving.com that restaurants are independently owned and owners are given the choice of whether they want to open on Christmas Day. Many choose to open and it tends to be a busy day.

So before you head out the door to pick up or call for delivery it's important that you check with your local Domino's to make sure their doors are open.

What do I do if the Domino's near me isn't open?

If you find your local franchise isn't open and you need your late-night snack you're still in luck. Some restaurants stay open on Christmas and Christmas Eve like McDonald's Denny's and Sonic. However it's still smart to verify the hours of the locations nearest you.

Queen Victoria's gold and pearl-encrusted domino set may fetch $500000 in an auction. The ...,"

If royals are fascinating their possessions are even more so. Queen Victoria’s beloved pearl and enamel musical domino box by Bautte is an example of their exquisite objects and a testament to the early 19th-century Geneva craft. The ornate rectangular blue domino box was created in 1804-1808 by Jean-François Bautte in Geneva. Offered by Sotheby’s for an estimated $300000- $500000 the 1804-1808 solid gold blue enamel and pearl encrusted domino box was the queen’s favorite pastime that the monarch indulged in with her husband Prince Albert. They enjoyed the game so much that it is mentioned over 40 times in her journal between 1839 and 1861.





In addition to revealing incredible beauty and skilled craftsmanship the domino box was a remarkable amusement piece with a concealed musical compartment. The velvet case housed a complete set of 28 domino counters each enameled in translucent blue over chequered engine-turning-around numbers per Sotheby’s. The sides of the enamel box feature four vignettes depicting the four seasons spring summer autumn and winter. The underside of the case comes with a paper label of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha coat of arms including the motto ‘fideliter et constanter.’



The box lid is enameled with a sailing Cupid on his quiver. The musical domino set was aptly gifted by the queen to her youngest son Prince Leopold Duke of Albany a lover of games. It was eventually passed down through the descendants of Prince Leopold until it appeared at auction nearly 40 years ago when acquired by the current owners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvanViaWxhbnQtc3RpbGwtdXBwZXItY3J1c3QtZXZlbi1hcy1uZWFyLXRlcm0tbWFyZ2lucy1zbGljZS11cC1zdG9jay0xMjIxMjI1MDAyOTVfMS5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvanViaWxhbnQtc3RpbGwtdXBwZXItY3J1c3QtZXZlbi1hcy1uZWFyLXRlcm0tbWFyZ2lucy1zbGljZS11cC1zdG9jay0xMjIxMjI1MDAyOTVfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jubilant still upper crust even as near-term margins slice up stock,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvanViaWxhbnQtc3RpbGwtdXBwZXItY3J1c3QtZXZlbi1hcy1uZWFyLXRlcm0tbWFyZ2lucy1zbGljZS11cC1zdG9jay0xMjIxMjI1MDAyOTVfMS5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvanViaWxhbnQtc3RpbGwtdXBwZXItY3J1c3QtZXZlbi1hcy1uZWFyLXRlcm0tbWFyZ2lucy1zbGljZS11cC1zdG9jay0xMjIxMjI1MDAyOTVfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227393D30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

We do not expect a market crash similar to the one in 2008. Many are anxious about the next next lower in markets to start soon not later than early 2023. Many followers and members reached out with this concern in recent weeks. Although we published quite some data points in our no stock market crash in 2023 article it looks there is more evidence required for our followers. The data points included in this article make us conclude that the market will not move lower even if the market feels ugly right now. This is one of the recurring conclusions in our 2023 forecasts consistent with the insights from the 100 year Dow Jones chart.

[Ed. note: On December 24th our team added another section with more charts about the 2008 situation. As seen in point #6 the rounded patterns back in 2008 broke entirely. They did so around specific periods of the pattern. The bears had an opportunity to break a similar pattern in 2022 but did not succeed in doing so.]

We look at 2 chart comparisons 3 fundamental data points and one anecdotal data point in this article. We conclude that things feel bad but aren’t factually bad (on the contrary in fact).

1/ SPX in 2008 vs. 2022

First let’s compare the SPX charts: 2008 vs. 2022.

The 2008 crash came with a structural breakdown of a key horizontal level it happened in September of 2008 when 123 points in SPY ETF gave up. The bounce that occurred in August from that level was very weak the triple bottom did not hold.

This is the leg lower from 122 points to 68 points between August of 2008 and March of 2009.

In 2022 the bounce from the double bottom at 360 points is pretty strong.

The similarities between 2008 and 2022: the multi-month falling trendline not cleared (not yet).

The differences between 2008 and 2022: the bounce from the double bottom was very weak back then but much stronger right now.

2/ Small caps in 2008 vs. 2022

If anything small caps are the market segment to lead the market lower. There is no way that small caps will hold strong if the market is bearish on the contrary.

In 2008 the Russell 2000 index was trading in a very narrow range before it brake down and went down fast in Sept/Oct of that year.

In 2022 we can see that the Russell 2000 has established a strong double bottom after it gave up support at 2101 points back in January and May.

The similarities between 2008 and 2022: the Russell 2000 index is weak when the market is bearish.

The differences between 2008 and 2022: the current double bottom structure is very strong much stronger.

3/ Credit spread 2008 vs. 2022

When a bear market is about to pick up in speed it will be visible in the credit market.

A yield spread is the ultimate proof of more pain ahead.

At present day spread between the high-yield corporate bond composite and the 10-year US Treasury has widened from 279bps at the start of this year to 499bps recently. However it isn’t spiking higher the way it did during previous credit crunches.

The similarities between 2008 and 2022: a move higher in the yield spread.

The differences between 2008 and 2022: no continuation there was plenty of opportunity for this spread to move substantially higher in 2022 but it did not happen there is no credit crunch.

4/ Consumer sentiment in 2008 vs. 2022

Consumer Sentiment sits at low levels. However even if consumers remain depressed emotionally it does not translate into their shopping behavior. It’s quite the opposite in fact consumers continue shopping as evidenced by the retail sales chart.

The similarities between 2008 and 2022: none.

The differences between 2008 and 2022: continued consumer spending in 2022.

5/ The US Dollar in 2008 vs. 2022

One of the most confusing phenomena in 2022 is the underlying reason of strength in the USD. On the one hand the USD has been rising as a safe haven. However the USD has been rising as well because of its attractiveness against other markets globally.

What this really means is that once risk appetite returns those massive amounts of U.S. Dollars will make it into the market (from cash to risk assets).

The similarities between 2008 and 2022: Only safe haven demand for USD.

The differences between 2008 and 2022: Both safe haven and investor demand from around the globe (with the intention to deploy those dollars later).

6/ Rounded chart patterns: they broke back in 2008 not so in 2022

From our latest Momentum Investing alert shared on Dec 24th: Must-See Charts – 2008 Comparisons:

The 75% completion of rounded patterns are crucial. It’s where decisions are made. Sometimes the exact same day very often in the 75% to 90% completion area.

The S&P 500 chart broke down arguably one week after its 75% completion. Exactly 3 months later the big market crash started.

The NYSE Composite Index chart broke down exactly the day of its 75% completion. It was a precise as it could be. It was the ultimate confirmation that a market crash was underway!

The Nasdaq chart help up pretty well even at 75% completion. After it tried to move higher and found resistance at the falling trendline around 90% completion of its rounded pattern the big downtrend and market crash started.

The Dow Jones set a lower low 3 weeks before it got to its 75% completion.

These charts make the point that the situation in 2008 was much worse when it comes to the charts of leading indexes. Yes the similarity is the falling trendline but the support structures and chart patterns are vastly different.

DETROIT – A winter storm has reached Southeast Michigan Friday and strong winds could cause power outages that’ll last through Saturday night.

On Saturday Dec. 24 winds will blow at 24-40 mph. Such winds can affect power lines and can knock tree limbs down onto power lines.

Recommended Videos

The region is under a winter storm warning until 4 a.m. Saturday.

As of 1:45 p.m. on Saturday more than 3400 DTE Energy customers were without power in Southeast Michigan -- that’s about .15% of all DTE customers.

You can see DTE’s outage map right here.

We’ll continue to update this article with outage information should more outages occur.

Dangerous winds mean that it isn’t safe for crews to be up high and working on power lines -- so any outages could take a while to address.

Below is a statement from DTE:

“We expect to restore power for the vast majority of customers by the end of Saturday and we will continue to work through Christmas until everyone affected by Winter Storm Elliot is restored. Please remember: 1. NEVER use a portable generator inside a home or business. Keep generators outside away from windows and doors so fumes don’t come in. 2. NEVER use a gas stove as a heating source. 3. Stay at least 20 feet from any downed power lines — assume they are live and dangerous.’ DTE Energy Dec. 24 2022 7 a.m.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

FRANKFORT Ky.—- Gov. Andy Beshear is warning Kentucky residents to avoid a stretch of Interstate 71 after a series of accidents since Thursday night.

The interstate through northern Kentucky links Louisville to Cincinnati Ohio.

“We got one cleared then another happened. We got that cleared and then another happened” Beshear said during a news briefing Saturday. “If you can avoid it please do. Don’t travel if you don’t have to.”

Highways officials said traffic on the interstate in northern Kentucky was backed up for 14 miles (23 kilometers). One southbound lane was open but traffic was moving slowly and taking several hours to route onto alternate roads.

___

FORT WAYNE Ind. — The company providing electricity to parts of northeastern Indiana and southwestern Michigan is asking customers to reduce their power use because of extraordinary demands on its system.

Indiana Michigan Power based in Fort Wayne Indiana warned that it might have to direct a regional power grid operator to begin “grid protection power outages” that “would be brief and intermittent whenever possible to limit the impact on customers.”

Meanwhile Detroit-based DTE Energy said more than 23000 lost power as the storm and freezing temperatures blew into Michigan.

As of 7 a.m. Saturday the utility said about 80% had their service restored. More than 1700 employees and support teams were working throughout the Christmas holiday weekend to restore full service DTE Energy said.

County road crews in parts of western Michigan were experiencing white-out conditions due to the snow blowing across roadways.

——

RALEIGH N.C. — More than 450000 customers in North Carolina were without electricity according to poweroutage.us as temperatures that dipped into the single digits early Saturday strained the power system.

Duke Energy said that it was putting planned emergency outages in place because of high demand and that trees felled in high winds had also damaged some lines. Maps indicated that the outages were spread throughout the state but the highest concentration was in the Charlotte area where more than 100000 were reported in Mecklenburg County.

Mecklenburg County said Friday it was adding capacity to its homeless shelters.

State officials said warming centers were opening around the state.

BUFFALO N.Y. — Officials are describing the ongoing blizzard in western New York around Buffalo as potentially the worst the area has ever seen.

Chief Timothy Carney of the Erie County Sheriff’s Office said deputies abandoned 10 police vehicles overnight Friday after getting stuck.

“It’s essentially a category 3 hurricane with a bunch of snow mixed in. It’s been like that for the past 24 hours” Carney said.

Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Saturday that there were still probably hundreds of people stuck in vehicles.

“This may turn out to be the worst storm in our community’s history” Poloncarz said during a news conference Saturday.

There was no emergency service available in Buffalo and several populous cities and towns.

“That is not to say attempts aren’t being made but there is no guarantee that in a life-threatening emergency situation that they’re going to be able to respond immediately"" he said.

___

KNOXVILLE Tenn. — The Tennessee Valley Authority directed local power companies on Saturday to implement planned interruptions to “ensure power system reliability.”

The authority provides electricity to 10 million people in Tennessee and parts of six surrounding states.

Some basic energy conservation steps customers can take:

Select the lowest comfortable thermostat setting and bump it down several degrees whenever possible.

Avoid using large appliances – this means appliances with a three-pronged plug such as dishwashers ovens and dryers – during high-demand periods like early winter mornings.

Shift non-essential activities like laundry to late evening hours when power demand is lower.

Charge electric vehicles overnight.

If you have an electric water heater limit the use of hot water as much as possible.

Crews continue to restore power from Friday’s winter weather

CHARLOTTE – Duke Energy asked customers to conserve energy usage as crews restored power following rotating outages in the Carolinas in response to high-energy demand Saturday morning.

Due to extreme cold weather causing increased demand and a shortage of available power in the Southeast region the company was forced to interrupt service to about 500000 customers to maintain the energy grid and prevent further disruptions. Power is currently being restored and should be completed today.

“This winter blast and customer demand has been unprecedented in recent history of our region and company” said Jason Hollifield Carolinas Storm Director. “Like other utilities Duke Energy took action to protect the overall energy grid – avoiding damage that could have meant even longer outages.”

Hollifield explained the company has systems in place to target prioritized circuits that can reduce energy demand to best maintain the electric system. That process stopped mid-morning Saturday. Duke Energy crews are bringing back service to those who experienced outages as a result of high demand and expect those customers to be restored today.

“We appreciate the patience and support from our customers” said Hollifield. “While it is possible we will experience rotating outages again tomorrow customers can help keep the lights on for everyone by conserving their energy use for the next 24 hours.”

The company is also restoring power to about 40000 customers who experienced outages from a high-wind event on Friday. The company will communicate directly with those customers to let them know when they can expect service to be restored.

The company continues to ask for energy conservation during the extreme cold temperatures in the Carolina to help avoid rotating outages in the early morning hours of Christmas Day. Energy conservation can help keep power on for all customers.

Some basic energy conservation steps customers can take:

Select the lowest comfortable thermostat setting and bump it down several degrees whenever possible.

Avoid using large appliances – this means appliances with a three-pronged plug such as dishwashers ovens and dryers – during high-demand periods like early winter mornings.

Shift non-essential activities like laundry to late evening hours when power demand is lower.

Charge electric vehicles overnight.

If you have an electric water heater limit the use of hot water as much as possible.

If your power is off turn off appliances and other electrical devices that may have been on when the power went out so there’s not an immediate surge on the system when power is restored.

Bringing many customers back online during extremely cold temperatures can add stress to the system.

(WECT) - Duke Energy’s outage map shows more than 500000 people are dealing with outages this morning.

In an alert on the outage page Duke says its conducting the blackouts due to high demands for energy amid the cold weather. The energy company says the blackouts are necessary to prevent longer more widespread outages.

“We understand how difficult an outage can be during extreme temperatures especially during a holiday” the company said in a statement. “Duke Energy deeply appreciates our customers’ patience and understanding as we work through this extreme weather event and we’re doing everything possible to keep the power on for as many people as possible until conditions improve.

In Lake Waccamaw outages have led leaders to open an emergency shelter at Town Hall. That is expected to open at around 9:00 a.m. Saturday.

Most blackouts will be remotely restored after 15 to 30 minutes though some may last longer as a crew will have to be dispatched.

Sign up for the free newsletter to get important environmental news by registering at this link.

It’s been about 20 years since Minnesota where the chemical giant 3M is based first began investigating drinking water contamination around a 3M factory that made the class of chemicals known as PFAS or per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances. Around the same time a lawyer named Rob Bilott was looking into similar pollution from a DuPont factory in West Virginia that was causing the gruesome deaths of nearby cows.

This was the beginning of the public consciousness around what we now call “forever chemicals.” In the wake of these investigations 3M and DuPont pledged to stop making PFOA and PFOS which are only two out of thousands of different types of PFAS. Minnesota settled with 3M for $850 million and DuPont spun off its PFAS business into the company now called Chemours.

Since then PFAS hotspots have arisen like a game of whack-a-mole in states including Maine where the chemicals have tainted sludge fertilizer that the state long encouraged for use on farms and seeped into waterways from military firefighting foam use. Marina Schauffler reported on topics like these in-depth in The Maine Monitor’s recent series “Invisible and Indestructible.” Regulators in places like New England have said that PFAS issues identified so far are only the tip of the iceberg for what’s to come.

3M and DuPont along with companies that bought PFAS from them now face scores of lawsuits — from states towns fire departments and individuals — accusing them of marketing the chemicals for use in all manner of other household and industrial products all while knowing the risks. The chemicals persist for decades in the environment and are linked to a range of deadly human health problems. Reporting by The Intercept has shown the 3M knew this and sought to bury it using a similar playbook to that of Exxon in regards to climate change. Now state and federal regulation of PFAS is finally on the rise years after Rob Bilott first began calling for these reforms.

It was likely with this massive legal liability in mind that 3M announced this week it will stop making and using PFAS altogether by 2025. “While PFAS can be safely made and used we also see an opportunity to lead in a rapidly evolving external regulatory and business landscape to make the greatest impact for those we serve” said 3M CEO Mike Roman in a press release.

It’s a splashy headline but what does it really mean? In many ways the PFAS cat is out of the bag — in Maine and worldwide the chemicals have been shown to be in drinking water wastewater rivers our bodies breast milk crops soil compost food packaging pets wildlife. Removing and destroying PFAS is an evolving challenge and towns states and water utilities are struggling to figure out how to fund testing and treatment. After 3M’s announcement some called for the company to go much further in helping fund this effort.

In the U.S. 3M has made the chemicals at factories in Minnesota Illinois and Alabama — all of which are or have been the subject of drinking water contamination investigations. Illinois is the most recent of these — there federal authorities stepped in to order a response to PFAS in the Mississippi River after reporting has shown state regulators failed to take action for years. And 3M and DuPont are not the only companies that have caused PFAS pollution. Factories that use the chemicals to make their own products — such as Saint-Gobain in New Hampshire — are the subject of similar investigations and PFAS in firefighting foam has polluted water at scores of airports and military installations.

The chemicals are used in paper-making which has caused some of Maine’s PFAS pollution and attracted class-action lawsuits as Mainers begin to ask how the chemicals have harmed their health land and water and who will pay to make it right. Maine has not yet joined the huge raft of federal lawsuits against 3M DuPont and firefighting foam makers which is being heard in combination in South Carolina but state Attorney General Aaron Frey said in May that the state planned to do so soon.

Billions in eventual legal settlements with 3M DuPont and other companies that used PFAS could help cover testing cleanup and health costs. But those cases may stretch for decades as has DuPont’s fight with cancer patients and others whose health problems are linked to PFAS in the Ohio River Valley. 3M has also opposed some state PFAS regulations in court — they successfully delayed New Hampshire’s limits for the chemicals by a year for example by suing over the rules’ use of Minnesota science on PFAS and pregnant people.

It’s unclear from this week’s 3M announcement what will become of the lawsuits the company is facing for past manufacture and sale of PFAS. “3M will continue to remediate PFAS and address litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions” the company said in its release.

It’s also unclear what the future holds for the successor chemicals to PFAS known as GenX — shorter chains of molecules that have been shown to have some of the same problems and risks. GenX chemicals have already been the subject of at least one settlement around a Chemours factory in North Carolina. According to New Hampshire Public Radio 3M declined to answer questions about what its PFAS announcement meant for GenX manufacturing.

“I think the devil is in the details here because PFAS is such a large class of chemicals” New Hampshire-based PFAS activist Andrea Amico whose family was exposed to the chemicals in Portsmouth N.H. told NHPR’s Mara Hoplamazian. “I’m really curious as to how 3M defines PFAS and if they’re truly going to stop making all PFAS chemicals or if it’s just a certain type of PFAS.”

Other advocates agreed that 3M’s move raised more questions than it answered both about the company’s next steps and the fate of PFAS throughout society.

“After telling everyone — their neighbors their workers and their regulators — that PFAS are safe while poisoning the entire planet 3M is now pledging to slink out the back door with no accountability. Congress and the courts cannot allow this to happen” said Scott Faber a senior vice president with the Environmental Working Group in comments sent to media. “No one should trust 3M’s commitment to do the right thing. They never have before.”

There's no turning back for Corporate India in 2023 - the hybrid work model is here to stay.Companies across sectors including Tata Steel Marico  LTIMindtree Boston Consulting Group and Eaton intend to keep the hybrid work model going in the new year offering flexibility to employees to better maintain work-life balance Hybrid work fulfils both employer-employee needs said experts. Employees want flexibility but also in-person time with their teams colleagues and friends at work. Organisations want more people back in offices but recognise that the world of work has changed irrevocably- and employees can be more productive even while operating in flexible models ""Flipkart employees have been functioning in a hybrid model for the past few months now"" said Krishna Raghavan chief people officer Flipkart. ""We will continue to remain flexible in our approach and modify our model as needed - based on both employee needs and external factors.""In the manufacturing sector where the majority of employees are back in office Tata Steel plans to continue with the agile working model it had introduced for white collar employees during the pandemic. Blue collar employees are regularly coming to work.“We have seen a significant increase in the percentage of employees working from home as compared to the prepandemic era” said a Tata Steel spokesperson.LTIMindtree calls it the Yin-Yang model. It has steered away from a one-size-fits-all approach categorising all roles under different ‘personas’— client-office work-office hybrid and home-office—based on roles client-project requirements and personal preferences “The hybrid model is here to stay and it is unlikely that the industry will go back to fully working from offices all the time. The journey from here on will involve retaining what is best and fixing what isn’t. Like Yin and Yang the future productivity of teams and organisations will depend on striking the right balance between working from office and home” said LTIMindtree CHRO Manoj Shikarkhane.“As normalcy resumes our plan is to get back most of our workforce in the office in 2023. We plan to extend the Yin-Yang model to a wider employee base and actively advance the persona-based approach.”BCG has put in place various flexible and hybrid work models. “There is room for all working models to co-exist and companies that will be able to embrace flexibility in the way they work how they work what time they work will be able to attract engage and retain talent better” said Suresh Subudhi managing director and senior partner at BCG.A November survey by HP bore this out. It found that the hybrid model scores high among Indian employees 92% said it improves work-life balance 88% said it increases employee retention and 72% found it to be more productive.“For most employees there will be no going back to the daily commute and traditional nine-to-five workday but rather fluidity between remote and in-person work environments” says Arvind Usretay commercial leader India and South Asia at management consulting firm Mercer. “Having said so sectoral and job role-related differences will continue to remain.”Companies will invest further in perfecting their hybrid models and it will be interesting to see how they overcome challenges of trust collaboration inclusion and engagement said Mercer’s Usretay.“However the good news is that companies are now taking decisions based on nearly three years of data established structures and systems and equipment to support their employees aspirations and requirements” he said.Companies said they are also seeing more employees showing interest in returning to office – at least on some days of the week.A certain amount of physical interaction is critical for culturalisation and driving innovation said Marico CHRO Amit Prakash. It’s seeing more staff preferring to come back to the office.“We are currently in the process of evaluating the best work model for our workforce but are encouraging members to be in office” Prakash said. “At the same time we continue to offer flexibility.”Marico offers an option for location flexibility to employees based on roles and individual needs. It has helped the consumer goods company reach a larger and diverse talent pool.At most of power management company Eaton’s offices employees are currently working on a 3:2 basis — three days in and two days out of office. It has also seen an increasing number of employees keen to return to work.However the hybrid work trend is here to stay says Ashish Kapoor India HR director at Eaton. “Hybrid models allow employees to access remote and on-site working options and provide flexible hours that accommodate their lifestyles” he said."

By Chris Iovenko

All Saints Parish (formerly St. Martha Church) in Morton Grove Illinois sits on a quiet tree-lined suburban street on the outskirts of Chicago. The late mid-century brick building looks more like a community center than a church which is fitting since it was built and designed in 1960 to function as both. On the inside a large crucifix and an altar are situated to one side facing chairs that can be moved out of the way to accommodate a basketball game or other community event. Despite its humble origins All Saints Parish has a special status within the Catholic church because of the massive collection of relics that adorn its walls vestibules and nooks. Known as The Shrine of All Saints it’s home to over 3000 relics and is the second largest Catholic relic collection in the United States behind only Pittsburgh’s St. Anthony’s Chapel.

The relics have been collected over many years by the pastor Father Dennis O’Neill who feels a personal and spiritual connection with the relics.

“I’ve been collecting relics since I was a teenager” said Father Dennis. “It gave me a sense of tangible connection with the saints that I hadn’t experienced before.”

The collection contains remnants of many of Christianity’s most holy and revered figures such as The Virgin Mary St. Peter St. Thomas John the Baptist Thomas Aquinas and many others. The pelvis bone of St. Nicholas the 4th-century bishop who was the inspiration for Santa Claus resides here as do fragments of The True Cross. Father O’Neill has acquired relics that interest him from fellow relic enthusiasts and through online purchases on eBay. Although human remains can’t be sold on eBay an exception is made for religious relics; a recent eBay search revealed over 900 items classified as Catholic relics.

Relics are classified as first or second class; first class relics are actual remnants of a saint or an item that came in direct contact with them. The most prized and valuable relics are those that have a wax seal on them; these have been authenticated by officials of the Catholic Church at some point in the past. With Catholicism in decline in Europe many churches and monasteries have closed and the inevitable relics they contain have been released onto the open market. These relics make their way both into private hands as well as into public collections like The Shrine of All Saints.

Before one enters the nave or main room of the church and the bulk of the relic collection there’s an entranceway that displays framed fragments of the cave in which many believe Jesus was born. It’s widely held that the manger Jesus was born was located inside a cave in Bethlehem since barns simply didn’t exist at that time and it was common practice to lodge flocks in caves.

This 18th-century carved Viennese bust of St. Christina of Bolsena a 3rd-century Christian Martyr contains her jaw and two teeth and is an excellent example of how ancient relics are often contained in relatively newer and often baroque reliquaries.

This bust of St. Peter one of the 12 Apostles and an early leader of the Christian church was hand-carved in Italy around 1540 for an English church.

Two of St. Nicholas of Myra’s bones are pictured in their reliquary. St. Nicholas a 4th-century bishop from modern-day Turkey is the inspiration behind the legend of Santa Claus. St. Nicholas was celebrated for acts of generosity such as dropping gold coins down the chimneys of the poor as well as for performing miracles like resurrecting the slain and dismembered bodies of three murdered boys.

One of the more striking and grim relics in the collection the skull of St. Remaclus dates to AD 670. Remaclus was a 7th-century French Benedictine bishop renowned for his devout commitment to Christ.

This bundle of hair came from St. Therese of Lisieux; one of many more modern saints in the collection. St. Therese (January 2 1873 –September 30 1897) was a French Catholic Carmelite nun. Although she died at the age of 24 from tuberculosis St. Therese went on to gain great fame and appreciation within the church for her sanctity and devotion. Mysteriously the hair still smells of roses.

Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu (August 26 1910 – September 5 1997) better known as Mother Theresa was an Indian-Albanian nun who received the Nobel Peace prize in 1979 for her work with the poor in India. Pictured are three hairs saved from a haircut Mother Theresa gave herself in New York in 1975. Although she was canonized in 2016 Mother Theresa remains a controversial figure in some circles because of her alleged practice of secretly baptizing the dying regardless of religion and charges of poor medical care in the facilities she supervised.

St. Zita of Lucca was an Italian peasant who worked as a servant and who died in 1272. St. Zita is the patron saint of servants and lost keys and is one of the “incorruptible” saints or a saint whose body has been mysteriously or miraculously preserved. Pictured is a relic that contains a fragment of flesh from St. Zita.

Pictured is the heelbone of Saint Francis of Assisi. Saint Francis of Assisi (1181 – 1226) was an Italian Catholic friar who founded the Franciscans a monastic order that dedicated themselves to lives of poverty in which they helped the poor. St. Francis is one of the most famous and beloved figures in Christianity.

According to Father Dennis the incorruptible tongue of the St. John Nepomucene is one of the most unique relics in the collection. St. John Nepomucene was a 14th-century martyred Vicar from Prague who was the confessor to King Wenceslaus IV’s wife the queen. King Wenceslaus tortured St. John to learn what the queen had said during her confession. However St. John refused to violate the secrecy of the confessional and was subsequently drowned in the river at the king’s command.

At just 20 years old the New York science student dropped out of university - and moved across the world.

She wanted to be with her Australian boyfriend Ashton after knowing him for just one year.

Now happily married and living in Melbourne with their one-year-old son Frederick it was a risk that paid off in droves.

Hannah has built a successful Aussie empire raking in more than $6 million in five years.

And she did it all by making and selling bath bombs.

Before creating her multi-million-dollar business the now 28-year-old never imagined bathroom products would be her ticket to success.

“My parents ran their own business my whole life so I definitely knew I wanted to go down that path and have more flexible working hours to travel” Hannah tells 7Life.

“My husband has also always been very entrepreneurial and has had his own side hustles since he was in high school.

“So we definitely had that common goal in mind but I just needed to find the right niche.”

Hannah began making the bath bombs with ingredients she bought on ebay. Credit: Hannah Pereira

In 2017 while working in childcare Hannah decided to try her hand at making soaps face masks and bath bombs at home.

“I was trying a couple of different hobbies like I tried refurbishing furniture and selling that on (Facebook) Marketplace” Hannah says.

“Then a friend said ‘You should make bath bombs from the kits you can buy online and see if you can sell them’.

“So I ordered the ingredients on eBay to make them myself” she says deciding on the name Bath Box for her company.

In demand

From there Ashton built the e-commerce site and Hannah posted on Facebook groups including Melbourne Gal Pals where she made her first sale.

Within six months her bath bombs were in hot demand after she used Facebook advertising and organic growth on Instagram to build her customer base.

“Our two-bedroom unit in Bentleigh was packed to the brim with bath bomb supplies” she says.

“I’d have to move packing peanuts off the bed at night to go to sleep.

“I’d wake up at 6am every morning and go to work (in childcare) then come back at 5pm and work until 2am filling orders then do it all over again.

“It became too much.”

After 12 months the business was booming - and Hannah quit her full-time job to focus solely on Bath Box.

Moving operations to a bigger warehouse the business expanded to selling luxury bath pillows and bath caddies.

Sales surged during COVID-19 lockdowns. Credit: Hannah Pereira

And when the pandemic hit in 2020 sales surged again.

“I think people were looking for a way to spend time and relax in their own home so sales really took off for us” Hannah explains.

Five years from its inception the company has now made more than $6 million in sales.

But Hannah concedes she’s made a lot of mistakes along the way.

“My biggest learning from my business is knowing when to pivot if something isn’t working” she says.

“My business is my second baby so there are a lot of emotions involved but it’s important to recognise when you need to move on.

“I spent so much time and money on the face masks when they weren’t working for me.

“It’s important to be agile and to keep up with the trends so your business can keep evolving.

“In today’s society there is a big push to get rich quick but that’s not the reality.

“Running a business is hard work it’s dedication you need to stick with it and be consistent.”

While Hannah’s business now allows her to travel in luxury for months of the year with her son she has had to work hard to get to where she is.

“When I started Bath Box I had to make a lot of sacrifices” she says.

“You dedicate everything to your business.

“You can’t take time off or go to the movies with friends you have orders to fill and you’re responsible for that.

Ashton and Hannah. Credit: Hannah Pereira

“Now I’ve got employees I’m also responsible for those families so I can’t just clock off at 5pm.

“But now the business is more stable I am so lucky to get to spend more time with my son and travel around the world while I’m working.

“I never imagined the business would grow to this scale so fast.

“I used to say if we made $100000 in one year I’d be thrilled but you always keep striving for that next goal.”

Career criminal Paul Owens was described as being a “blight on his parents’ lives” by a judge at Leeds Crown Court after it was heard the 48-year-old had regularly stolen cash from the pair between prison stints over the years.

For his latest offending he spent five months between April and September 2020 plundering their bank account racked up huge debts on credit cards in his mother’s name and then would “sell” items on over eBay that would never be posted out.

Owens was handed a 12-month jail term and a five-year restraining order to keep him away from his parents.

Owens used eBay to defraud his parents.

The judge Anthony Kelbrick said: “You have a dreadful criminal record and have been in prison for many serious offences. They are mean wicked and calculated offences from a man who has been a blight on his parents’ lives for years.”

Prosecutor Brian Russell said Owens’ parents who live in Wakefield were away on holiday in September 2020 when they received notifications that money was being taken from their account. It transpired that more than £7357 was removed from the account over the months. His mother realised it could only have been done by someone with access to her laptop and passwords.

The credit cards on which he spent more than £5600 were found at Owens’ address when he was arrested.

His mother had also been contacted by eBay demanding money after an account was set up in her name in which items were put up for sale.

Money from the sales were sent to his mother’s account but then removed. The items were never sent. She was told she owed more than £3109.

Owens admitted one count of theft and three counts of fraud.

He has a lengthy record which includes 27 convictions for 96 offences including multiple thefts and fraud. He is currently serving a five-year sentence for burglary fraud and theft.

The sweatshirts include the Nazi swastika symbol that has left the internet flabbergasted.

For those unversed Kanye West has unleashed wrath against Jewish people in recent months. A few of his racist antics including him claiming to go “death con 3” on Jews asking them to forgive Hitler and also infamously claiming to like the Nazi leader on an InfoWars episode.

Meanwhile Twitter user @FarAwayAndCozy who operates under the moniker ThePharmaCopYe-ist uploaded an image which is believed to be that of Kanye West’s upcoming merchandise on December 20. The caption of the tweet read- ""Iconic.""

In the image one can see a man and a woman wearing black sweatshirts which are alleged to be from Ye’s upcoming collection. The back of the sweatshirts seemingly looks like the Swatsika symbol encircled by stars. A woman sitting on a giant cube-shamed structure can be seen wearing the jersey with similar motifs.

Not only does the design look familiar to the Nazi symbol it also seems to spell “Ye” which is the rapper’s legally changed first name.

At the time of writing this article the tweet with the Kanye West merchandise had amassed 647 likes and over 17k views.

Netizens react to Kanye West’s alleged sweatshirt design

Internet users were left dumbfound after seeing the collection. Many could not believe that the rapper would consider selling anti-Jew clothing. Many took to Twitter to express their disappointment. A few tweets read:

It is important to note that West has not confirmed that he is releasing the aforementioned sweatshirts.

It also appears that the image uploaded by ThePharmaCopYe-ist is fake. Twitter user @vitin1000cc uploaded another photo where the models who wore Ye’s alleged sweatshirts posed in the exact similar manner. However the models were seen wearing different sweatshirts leading to confirm that the West merchandise is fake and the image that included his sweatshirts is photoshopped.

Kanye West’s presidential campaign merchandise sells on eBay

As the Yeezy-designer continues to trend online listings of the rapper’s t-shirts hoodies phone cases and flip-flops related to his 2024 run for president has appeared on Amazon and eBay.

Images of the merchandise showcased “YE24” printed on a blue phone case a black hoodie with his face on it along with the “YE24” phrase and a black t-shirt with “YE24” printed on it along with stars in red and blue printed on the bottom and top of the phrase.The rapper can also be seen holding a cross on another t-shirt.

The prices of the Kanye West merchandise range from $20-$30 for hats hoodies which are priced up to $50 and other items.

It is important to note that it remains unclear whether it is being sold by the rapper himself or third parties. Considering the fact that the Donda singer would have promoted his merch social media platforms if it was designed by him it is likely that the items are not designed by West."

In September the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City sold $70 million of art to fund its digital platform. Google has also uploaded dozens of virtual tours of the world’s most famous museums onto its Google Arts & Culture platform including part of the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.

Most online exhibitions are still nothing more than an attempt to render physical works of art more accessible by faithfully representing them online through photos and videos. However some digital platforms are being used to display art that only exists in the digital realm.

Museums are accustomed to grappling with the question of how to host and display works of art made in new and different mediums as a result of changing technology. For example multimedia installations have become a popular facet of modern art exhibitions. Galleries used to be halls of reverent silence; now it is not uncommon for an exhibition to resound with the noise of a video or sound installation.

However as the mediums in which artists create expand beyond video and sound technology is forcing institutions to evolve and re-evaluate the traditional methods by which they display artwork.

The most prominent example of this is the use of blockchain technology to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which are beginning to take hold in the art world. Christiane Paul the digital art curator of the Whitney Museum of American Art has described NFTs as “a natural extension of artistic practices in the digital field.”

As digital art gains greater acceptance within these elite circles digital platforms continue to become more popular. There has been speculation about how the Metaverse could affect this trend by allowing artists to display their work in more democratic spaces that bypass the barriers of cost and access that come with traditional gallery space.

Naomi Beckwith the deputy director and chief curator of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum – which is also available to “visit” on Google – told the New York Times:

“We have hit a critical point where the technology that’s available to artists has far outpaced what museums can offer in terms of resources so we have to beef up. If artists are working with technology then we have to be able to hold it.”

So here are five of the best exhibitions (in no particular order) to explore from the comfort of your home this holiday season:

The Whitney Museum of American Art known informally as “The Whitney” is an art museum in the Meatpacking District and West Village neighbourhoods of Manhattan in New York City. Their online digital gallery known as the “artport” was originally launched in 2001 and acts as the Whitney Museum’s portal to internet and new media art.

This exhibition by Ọnụọha is a video installation exploring food waste in the United States. Not only will this video installation fit seamlessly into a rigorous schedule of Christmas films but it might make you think about ways to reduce your own food waste over the course of this holiday season.

Is there a difference between an online video installation and simply streaming a video on Youtube? Maybe not but you can still brag to your colleagues about how much of your free time over Christmas was spent absorbing culture rather than a dozen more cookies.

2. The Colour of the Climate Crisis by DesignKind 2022

DesignKind is a series of collaborations between emerging designers from South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa and the United Kingdom exploring the relationship between racial justice and climate justice.

This exhibition displays pieces of interdisciplinary work that arose through a process of research and critical dialogue with the help of innovative digital collaboration tools. The themes include climate migration storytelling comparative climate experiences in the oral tradition and the mapping of colonial and climate histories through materials.

This exhibition is especially topical in the wake of COP27 which focused more than any climate summit yet on the subject of loss and reparations. Negotiations over possible climate reparations gave a voice to the disparity between the experience of wealthy nations who predominantly contribute to climate change and poorer mostly non-white nations who are currently suffering the severest impacts.

The online version of this exhibition is hosted by the Pace Gallery a private American contemporary and modern art gallery with nine locations worldwide. It has a distinguished legacy as an artist-first gallery that mounts seminal historical and contemporary exhibitions and has spearheaded explorations into the intersection of art and technology.

Fred Wilson’s interdisciplinary practice centres around his investigations of the mutable nature of reclaimed objects. In this exhibition he imbues these ready-made objects with personal and historical importance by refashioning and recontextualising them through his own artistic revisions.

In a time of year when many people enter into shopaholic overdrive it can be useful to take a moment to reflect on the value of objects and how the context and history of a reclaimed item can add rather than subtract from its value.

Pace Gallery is also exploring the realm of NFT-based exhibitions via a collaboration between Pace Verso (the web3 hub of Pace Gallery) and Art Blocks (the leading platform for generative art). Find exhibitions such as “Contractions” here and “Floating World Genesis” here.

4. Fragile Soil Fertile Soils  U NSSC 20th Anniversary Art Exhibition

In celebration of its 20th anniversary the United Nations System Staff College (UNSSC) hosted an art exhibition on the United Nations campus in Turin and their own online platform. The climate action-focused series hopes to inspire everyone to act as agents of change amidst the climate emergency.

Commissioned in partnership with the Association Internationale pour la Biennale des Jeunes Créateurs d’Europe et de la Méditerranée (BJCEM) this exhibition showcases international artists who offer unique ways of nurturing and healing the earth as a means of inspiring action to address climate change.

During a period of the year when many look forward to a moment of relaxation and restoration it is worth remembering that we are not the only ones on the planet who could benefit from a bit of nurture and restored health.

Find the exhibition here.

The Environment & Society Portal is a gateway to open access resources on the human-environment relationship. They haven’t held any exhibitions in 2022 but one of the beauties of online exhibitions is that they are less strictly bound by the necessities of time and space.

This exhibition from 2021 explores the threat of hazardous waste to the environment and human life through a bend of artwork photography and text. The creators promise to take the viewer “on a journey both into our research and to the edges of our societies that many prefer not to see.”

If you are feeling a bit too festive and in need of some small talk that will enlighten your co-workers (but also risks dampening the mood of any company Christmas party) this is for you. This exhibition is also the digital equivalent of a gallery that has very long explanatory placards – therefore it is probably best consumed before any mulled or sparkling wine.

An honourable mention: #CreateCOP26 and #CreateCOP27 by ShowStudio

These are the winners of two competitions for digital art exhibitions held during the lead-ups to COP26 and COP27 which intended to engage young artists on climate change. Both exhibitions are short comprising just a few poignant and engaging images – perfect for quick inspiration if you need to come up with a socially acceptable new year’s resolution on the fly.

Rather than telling your co-worker or mother-in-law exactly how much weight you want to lose or how much less frequently you want to go on a binge-shopping spree on Amazon you can just say this: “In 2023 I want to be a climate ally.”

The loss wasn’t felt for long when Amazon announced that he would be starring in as well as executive producer of the new Warhammer 40000 series.

Recommended Videos

The board game that made the leap into video became possible when Games Workshop licensed Electronic Arts in 1993. In 2010 the game made the transition to movies when Codex Pictures made Dan Abnett’s screenplay into Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40000 Movie. More recently true to the nature of Warhammer 40K a real-life battle took place between production companies until Amazon beat all the competition and came out the victor.

Because the project is so new and no one really knows what Cavill and the team will do with it it’s too soon to know who will be in it. That doesn’t mean speculations can’t be made and Brie Larson seems to be a great fit but which parts could she play?

She has mastered the art of war skills as Captain Marvel and she’s learning more about action as she takes on the role of Tess in Fast X soon to come out next year. She is more than qualified to enter battle with Cavill or fight against him if that’s the way they go with it. That’s what makes it so fun to look at all the roles she could possibly play if she could clear her schedule between other projects.

Commander Shadowsun

Image via Games Workshop

From student to commander O’Shaserra is her original name as she trained under Commander Puretide. She was vital in saving the T’au Empire from what has been called the largest Ork invasion. For her contribution she was given the name Shadowsun. She would then go on to earn the rank of commander. As Captain Marvel Larson could easily fill that role having already portrayed a character with elite experience in battle.

Saint Celestine

With amazing psychic abilities and strong faith Saint Celestine has somehow managed to become a living saint. It is believed that she has risen from the dead multiple times to be used as a powerful weapon of war for the Emperor of Mankind. What Larson would do with that is anyone’s guess but it would be fun to watch.

Junith Eruita

With the ability to inspire warriors to fight Junith Eruita flies into battle surrounded by holy fire and bearing the Mace of Castigation. The troops could be beaten in battle and weary from even picking up another sword but hearing her voice the Imperial servants are renewed in their fight. That would be a vision to behold if Captain Marvel were to fly into battle as Junith Eruita.

Amberley Vail

Amberley Vail already comes with a little bit of drama in her backstory. She is actually loyal to no one even though she is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. It seems there just might be an affair with commissar Ciaphas Cain that could be written into the script. Now who could play that role? Would it be another one for Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson or even Cavill himself?

Lelith Hesperax

Image via Games Workshop

After distinguishing herself as the undisputed gladiator champion of Commorragh Lelith Hesperax has been slashing and dashing her way through every battlefield. She is the master of death as she smiles while wielding her blades to take out everyone in her bloody path. If Jeannette of The Glass Castle (2017) would have been given knives fans might have seen a preview of her cutting and gutting in action. There is only one problem; Jenna Ortega might also be a good fit to play her. They might have to battle it out which is what the story is all about.

Lotara Sarrin

Image via Games Workshop

An interesting story Lotara Sarrin was a naval officer who was forced to escape her own vessel in what would have been considered a mutiny. She appeared successful but it was later learned that she was actually in the realm of the undead which had somehow been fused with the Conquerer the vessel she had commanded. If written right Larson might have fun exploring this character.

Yvraine

Image via Games Workshop

The Daughter of Shades Yvraine was brought back from the dead and now serves as the representative of Aeldari God of the Dead. She can turn the enemy to ashes with just a touch and she can inspire the warriors to fight giving them strength as she does. This would be such a great role for Larson. However this is yet another role fans think would be perfect for Ortega. If any of this fan speculation comes true Cavill has his hands full finding the best place for everyone.

On a night when neither offense saw much success Pittsburgh put together an impressive final drive to find the end zone and keep their playoff hopes alive. Pickett finished with 244 passing yards including that touchdown to Pickens.

Defensively the Steelers stood tall and kept the Raiders in check all game long. They Held Last Vegas running back Josh Jacobs to only 44 yards rushing and picked off Derek Carr three times in addition to sacking him three as well.

Pittsburgh is now staring down two AFC North matchups to finish the season. The team remains in the playoff mix at 7-8 but must win these next two games.

On the uncertain tax position rate proceedings based on FERC's remedy no additional refunds are due to customers beyond those previously provided in 2021.

""We believe yesterday's FERC orders are a positive step toward resolving a number of long-standing issues raised by our local regulators. While we disagree with some elements of FERC's findings in particular its ruling on the sale leaseback claim we are pleased with FERC's remedy that no additional refunds are due to customers beyond those already provided in 2021 on the uncertain tax positions taken by SERI. Entergy has consistently maintained that our tax strategy was in the best interest of our customers and ultimately provided them with millions of dollars in savings. The company looks forward to continuing to work with our regulators to resolve any remaining outstanding FERC issues for the benefit of our customers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhZmIuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvY29sZC13ZWF0aGVyLWNhdXNlcy1zcGlrZS1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS11c2UtZW50ZXJneS1vZmZlcnMtY29uc2VydmF0aW9uLXRpcHMv0gF6aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FmYi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9jb2xkLXdlYXRoZXItY2F1c2VzLXNwaWtlLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LXVzZS1lbnRlcmd5LW9mZmVycy1jb25zZXJ2YXRpb24tdGlwcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cold weather causes spike in electricity use; Entergy offers conservation tips,"BATON ROUGE La. (WAFB) - Officials with Entergy Louisiana say the cold weather has caused a spike in electricity use.

About 2000 people across Louisiana were without power on the morning of Saturday Dec. 24.

Customers can help to reduce any strain on the electricity system by practicing safe energy conservation according to Entergy Louisiana.

The company released the below tips for customers:

Unplug electronic devices and turn off lights that are not in use.

Hold off on doing chores. Delay laundry washing dishes and other non-essential uses of electricity.

If you have all electric appliances wash clothes with cold water shower quickly instead of taking a bath cook foods at the lowest possible setting and refrain from opening the oven door while baking.

Lower the central thermostat to 68 degrees or the coolest comfortable temperature.

Open blinds drapes and curtains to let in warmth from the sun.

Make sure ceiling fans are rotating in the right direction – clockwise during winter.

Don’t allow warm air to escape from the home.

Utility officials said Friday that restoration efforts are taking longer than normal because of the extreme cold and road conditions.

Entergy Arkansas the state's largest utility said about 9800 customers in 36 counties were still without electricity Friday. Outages included a few of customers in counties across the state though about 4300 in Faulkner County and 1200 in Marion County remained without power.

""The damage reports are mostly wire down and wind-related causes"" spokesperson Kacee Kirschvink said Friday.

Entergy was hopeful outages would not spread through the weekend. ""We don't anticipate any problems but this freeze won't let up for some time so we aren't out of the woods yet"" Kirschvink said. ""We are working to restore power as quickly and as safely as possible and we will continue throughout the course of this cold spell.""

About 150 Texarkana customers of Southwestern Electric Power Co. were without electricity Friday. ""Those outages were primarily due to the extreme cold temperatures and wind"" spokesperson Tara Muck said Friday morning.

Like Entergy SWEPCO officials are not forecasting more outages.

""With the temperatures getting a little warmer and the wind not as strong our hope is we'll see fewer outages"" Muck said. ""But the cold is still a factor as we work to restore power. There are a lot of people using electricity right now. That is also a factor that comes into play.""

Both utilities noted restoration efforts are slowed by weather and slick roads.

""Customers may see estimated restoration times that are longer than usual"" Kirschvink said. ""That is because of the additional time it takes to restore power in the cold weather. As damage is assessed restoration times will be adjusted.""

Earlier Friday about 100 Little Rock customers of Summit Utilities lost gas service though it was restored by early afternoon. The pocket outage was in the Rock Creek area in West Little Rock. The outage shut off heat for customers in the Little Rock neighborhood west of Napa Valley Road and Hinson Road.

""Our teams have been working around the clock to prepare for this week's cold temperatures"" said Fred Kirkwood chief customer experience officer. ""Despite that fact the extremely cold temperatures have caused some of our regulator stations to freeze impacting the flow of gas to our customers.""

Summit which took over CenterPoint Energy's distribution assets in Arkansas in January has gotten off to a rocky start in the state as it converted billing systems. Last month dozens of Summit Utilities natural gas customers reported receiving multiple bills for the same service period and problems getting through to customer service to resolve the issue.

“This was a very tough Christmas for some people down here” resident Jamie Wilson said.

Around 9 p.m. on Sunday Entergy Texas restored the power but many residents have concerns about the state’s power grid.

Residents say the past 48 hours have been a nightmare. A lot of families stayed at hotels they couldn’t cook and some left their pets behind.

“This has been a real hardship for a lot of people even those with generators” said Wilson who lives on Crystal Beach. She says she spent more than 40 hours without power.

“We huddled around the space heaters but my family had to leave. We were not able to do Christmas cookies like we do every year. We didn’t have a Christmas dinner” she said.

She says the community jumped in to help with her generator but others like Kevin Turner were not so fortunate.

“I stayed in a motel Friday night as well as last night” he said.

President and CEO of Entergy Texas Eliecer Viamontes says the Arctic blast and strong winds caused customers to lose power.

“The cold temperatures increased the usage as well and that tends to stress the equipment” Viamontes said.

Viamontes says crews worked around the clock to restore the power.

“We understand the inconvenience. It’s Christmas and our hearts go out to those customers that were looking to spend Christmas differently than what they are right now” he said.

Although residents are relieved the lights are back on they expressed their concerns about Entergy and the state’s power grid.

“Not only behind the accuracy of Entergy but the power structures they have in place. Can it support what we have currently right now and can it support the growth that we are experiencing and for the near future. I don’t think that it can. I don’t think the community has a lot of faith in it either” Turner said.

Entergy posted on its website that they’ve “learned to be ready for anything” and detailed how they have prepared for wintry weather.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Now let me tell you once again about an extraordinarily gifted young Catholic artist who unlike the Jesuit (alleged) lecher Marko Rupnik will never have a fancy studio in Rome and never enjoy the patronage of wealthy and well-connected churchmen. She's a wife and mom raising kids making sacred art and trying to survive this war in her family's home in western Ukraine. Her name is Ivanka Demchuk and here is a link to her portfolio. She follows traditional iconic forms (she is a Byzantine-Rite Catholic) but modernizes them beautifully. The top image is her iconic image of the Nativity. Here are some other examples of her work:

She has so much more -- and you can order them from her Etsy shop here. I encourage you to do so not only because Ivanka Demchuk's work is truly beautiful -- I own two of her pieces -- but because by doing this you can support an artist struggling to keep her family alive in a time of war. Shipping can be uncertain now for obvious reasons but trust me when you open the box from Lviv and see the glory of God in Ivanka's images you will know for certain that you have spent your money well and that it was worth the wait.

The new rule would require third-party payment platforms to issue a 1099K to both the IRS and the individual app user.

This follows concerns from the tax preparation community the electronic transactions community and some lawmakers.

The copse at Cookworthy Knapp off the A30 near Lifton is variously known as grandma's trees the unicorn's wood and the fairy wood but to most of us in Cornwall whose collective heart rises when we spot it on the way home it's better known as the Nearly Home Trees.

Historians believe the 140 beech trees were planted at the top of the hill over 100 years ago - in about 1900 - however there are a number of suggestions as to why. One of the most romantic rumours was that the plantation was constructed by a farmer in memory of his late wife. Some say that this is why the aerial view of the copse looks to be in the shape of a heart.

Others suggest that the trees were intended to be a landscape feature to mark the northern edge of the Lifton Park Estate or as cover for pheasants. Another nickname for the copse the Trafalgar Clump could suggest that the trees were planted in honour of the war however they would have been a bit tardy given that the battle took place in 1805.

One rather smart suggestion claims that trees were planted in clumps on hills all over the country by cattle drovers to mark water sources so they knew where they could take their animals to drink.

Local residents have also said that they were under the belief that the trees mark the burial site of an ancient king.

Whatever the reason they've now become as distinct a Cornish landmark (despite being in Devon) as St Michael's Mount Truro Cathedral and the Eden Project. The trees even became film stars earlier this year when they featured in a pivotal scene in heartbreaking Cornish-made film Long Way Back.

The biggest change in the Nearly Home Trees' fortunes in recent years is how lucrative they've become. A whole cottage industry has grown around selling their iconic likeness on everything from paintings and prints to Christmas tree decorations mugs glassware clocks and ornaments.

There are fridge magnets postcards popular sea glass trees T-shirts coasters and 3D laser designed artwork. You could even wear them over your face during the Covid pandemic.

One look at crafters' website Etsy will reveal hundreds of items featuring the trees while the Facebook page The Nearly Home Trees - Devon (shame about that last bit) also lists everything NHT-orientated. As the old saying goes they've grown like Topsy."

Eversource earned props for putting crews on the road early during Friday’s wind and rain storm. The number of outages in Westport was halved throughout the day from 700 or so to about 350.

Their performance since then has been less praise-worthy.

An “06880” reader wrote last night just before midnight:

“I am spending the holidays with my 92-year-old homebound mom on Bayberry Ridge Road. Power has been out for the whole street since 4 a.m. Friday. Despite 40-plus hours elapsing Eversource still has no projection for repair citing ‘To Be Determined’ as the date when one inquires.

“They no longer even list Westport on the updated outage report because over 99% of homes have power. This is cold comfort to residents on this street who cannot get any information out of this vastly overpaid and underperforming public utility. With zero communication since the beginning we worry that they’ve forgotten about us entirely.”

The reader responded at 1:04 a.m. that his power was back on. He doesn’t know if it was the result of his phone call Tweet or because they were about to do it anyway.

I’m keeping his complaint up though because it’s not isolated. I’ve heard from other readers in the north end of Westport who also had issues with Eversource.

Most seemed to understand the severity of the problem. What bothered them was Eversource’s lack of communication about when power was expected to return.

“We just want to be able to plan” one reader said.

=======================================================

Compare the situation in Lyman (top story above) with the behavior of one Very Entitled Driver downtown yesterday.

He ignored several “One Way/Do Not Enter” signs. He headed past all the cars on 2 sides of the street facing toward him.

Drivers stopped. One rolled down his window and explained the driver was going the wrong way.

He couldn’t be bothered. Perhaps backing up was too difficult or time-consuming. Maybe doing so would be admitting wrongdoing or a blow to his masculinity.

So he got out of his car. He had angry words with one of the right-way drivers.

Then he got back in his vehicle swerved around a couple of cars and kept driving.

All the way to the Post Road.

=======================================================

Also downtown: Our own Barnes & Noble was featured in the opening seconds of Yahoo News’ recent feature on the chain’s resurgence.

Young readers in particular have driven the opening of new (and newly designed) stores.

CEO James Daunt was interviewed by Dave Briggs. The Yahoo journalist knows what he’s talking about — he lives here in Westport just a couple of miles from one of those slimmed-down brighter more open and less “library-looking” Barnes & Noble’s than the previous one.

The Burying Hill High Tide Club has earned an “06880” mention — and props — for weekly swims at that Greens Farms beach all the way through fall.

Now another group is earning even more awe (and raised eyebrows).

Nico Eisenberger reports: “This year we spawned a crazy cousin of the High Tide Club. Inspired by some of the hardy originals and carried forward with an unreasonable and illogical vigor is Club Plunge.

“We’ve done it every week since early November. It’s amazing and wonderful — and makes you think that maybe the extremophiles one sees on YouTube are really on to something.”

The group includes 8 regulars.

“We try to stay in for at least 3 minutes” Nico says. “The screaming subsides after 1 minute then picks up again after 2.”

No word on “weather” they ventured in yesterday.

Both wish everyone in the “0688o” community — in Westport and cyberspace — “happy holidays and many blessings in the new year.”

====================================================

And finally … Christmas music ends tonight. Whether that’s good or bad depends on your threshold for jinglyness.

But before we say goodbye (till next year) to Mariah Carey Josh Groban Michael Jackson Bruce Springsteen Bobby Helms Bing Crosby and Gene Autry let’s tip our Santa hat to Johnny Marks.

He lived for many years on Green Acre Lane off South Compo. He died in 1985 from complications of diabetes. His son still lives here.

Who was Johnny Marks?

Just the guy who wrote “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”

And “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree.” “Run Rudolph Run.” “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas.” And many others.

Not bad for a Jewish kid from Mount Vernon New York.

Merry Christmas! Oy!

Thousands of people spent a cold night in the dark as the power remained out following Friday's ferocious winds which included an exceptional 84 mph gust in Rye according to the National Weather Service. Most other gusts were between 50 and 60 mph from the southwest bringing down trees branches and power lines.

As of 7:30 a.m. 79012 Eversource Unitil NH Electric Co-op and Liberty Utilities customers were without power statewide.

Central Maine Power had 43455 customers in York County without power. National Grid reported 5432 customers without power in Essex County.

Among the hardest hit communities in the Seacoast region:

Eversource: Barrington Durham Epping Lee and Rochester with over 1000 customers without power.

Working All Night at Restoration

Unitil spokesman Alec O'Meara said his company's crews worked all night continuing to make progress restoring customers' power and will keep at it throughout the holiday until each and every customer is restored.

He said the band of thunderstorms that moved through late Friday afternoon that ushered in bitter cold air went through the heart of the company's service area and exacerbated the power outages which jumped from 1500 to 17000.

“This storm could not have come at a worse time and we recognize that many of our customers are wondering if they will have the lights back on in time for their family gatherings. We appreciate their patience during this difficult time” O’Meara said. “Our crews worked hand in hand with emergency responders through windy conditions and plunging temperatures overnight addressing public safety issues while restoring power where possible.”

As power is restored to an area crews will be redeployed to another area.

No Exact Time for Restoration

O'Meara said the possibility exists that some customers may not have power restored in time for Christmas Day and should consider alternatives.

Eversource said it has brought in crews from Alabama North Carolina Texas Virginia and Canada working around-the-clock shifts to address emergency situations clear blocked roads assess damage and restore power to customers impacted by the fierce storm.

""Our focus this morning is on blocked roads & community issues and getting largest outages worked as quickly as possible. Also working to replace 84 broken poles"" Eversource said in a statement Saturday morning. ""We’re continuing to assess damage & working on sharing ETRs. 62 more crews arrived overnight so we have 600+ line tree & service crews working in NH today.""

Fires in Hampton

During the astronomical high tide Friday morning Hampton Fire Chief Michael McMahon said that within the span of a hour the department received reports of 3 structure fires on I Street Jones Ave and Ashworth Ave and 1 vehicle fire on Hobson Avenue with exposure. Hampton Fire Alarm answered over 200 phone calls and dispatched 39 calls for service for Hampton and Hampton Falls.

""We are very fortunate that we had our mutual aid partners in route to assist us with the volume of calls"" McMahon said in a statement.

Rochester Police said they handled over 300 calls for service on Friday.

A tree fell on top of a car parked in a driveway on Whitehall Road on the Amesbury-South Hampton border with a person inside Friday night according to the Amesbury Fire Fighters IAFF Local 1783. A heavy duty wrecker was called into help with the extrication according to photographer Michael Kent.

Christmas Bitter Cold

The forecast calls for sunny skies on Saturday with temperatures in the teens to lower 20s. Southwesterly winds up to around 35 mph or so will send wind chill values down to below zero in most locations according to the National Weather Service.

O'Meara said that those using a generator should make sure it is installed and positioned. An improperly installed or positioned generator can cause exhaust containing deadly carbon monoxide to accumulate in a home.

Generators can “backfeed” electricity into the distribution lines and electrical equipment seriously injuring or electrocuting a line worker or anyone who may touch a now-energized line thought to be dead.

The state Department of Safety’s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management also offered these suggestions:

Use flashlights rather than candles for emergency lighting.

Do not use a gas range or oven as an alternate source of heat.

Only use a generator that has been wired to the house electrical service by a professional electrician.

Never run a generator inside a building or in an enclosed space and keep them 10 feet away from buildings with the exhaust pointed away.

Midgard Self Storage

Lease Online Contact-Free

Roswell GA Dec. 24 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the midst of an ongoing wave of growth for the industry as a whole self storage company Midgard Self Storage recently opened four new locations during Q4 2022 — and plans to open even more in the near future.

As Todd M. Allen managing principal of Midgard Self Storage explains these latest developments for the company aren’t just an indicator of his own company’s success. They also illustrate increased demand for self storage services from businesses and residential customers alike.

The Latest Growth

In Q4 2022 Midgard Self Storage opened its newest locations in Okahumpka and Lutz Florida as well as Gainesville and Augusta Georgia. The Gainesville location is also the company’s first contactless facility. “We’re thrilled at being able to open these new locations and give more people access to convenient self-storage” Allen says.

“This is all possible thanks to the support of our current customers and of course the fact that people are always going to need storage assistance in some capacity. This has been a great year for us and we’re looking forward to expanding even more in 2023.”

Midgard Self Storage has enjoyed steady growth since its inception currently boasting over 80 locations nationwide. The company’s self storage facilities are primarily located in the Southeastern United States (Alabama Arkansas Florida Georgia North Carolina South Carolina and Tennessee) though it also operates a few locations in Colorado.

The most recent openings are a reflection of the strong growth experienced by the self-storage industry as a whole which is expected to have annual growth of 5.76 percent between 2022 and 2027.

An Economically Resilient Industry

Allen is quick to point out that self-storage is an incredibly resilient industry — a fact that has certainly played a role in the growth of his company. “No matter what the economic climate is like people need storage space. During good times they tend to accumulate more goods and end up needing a place to store them” he explains.

“When times get tough there’s a tendency to downsize living spaces and office spaces — and as a result people need extra storage to store the items that will no longer fit in their new space. The affordability and flexibility of self storage makes it an easy solution.”

Indeed it is estimated that 13.5 million households in the United States — 10.6 percent of all households — rely on a self storage unit in some capacity. Add in the businesses that also rely on self storage in some capacity and the result is that nationwide the average self storage facility occupancy rate sits at over 90 percent.

Story continues

Other Trends Driving the Self Storage Boom

While self storage has proven to be a resilient industry regardless of economic conditions Allen notes that there are currently a few key trends that bode well for the industry in the years ahead. “We have a growing number of Baby Boomers who are leaving the workforce and looking to downsize to manage their costs in retirement” he explains.

“As they move to new smaller homes they naturally end up needing additional storage for the items that will no longer fit in their space. And with more Baby Boomers set to retire storage demand will only go up. Pair that with younger generations living in smaller spaces to save on costs and moving more frequently thanks to remote work and self storage becomes a necessity for them too.”

The demand for smaller living spaces can to some extent be attributed to the current housing issues plaguing the United States. Even though the housing market has cooled off after the COVID-19 pandemic rising interest rates and elevated prices have shut many out of the housing market. Rather than buying a larger home many are choosing to rent (which typically results in more frequent moves) or to buy a smaller property.

In each of these situations self-storage can help mitigate some of the challenges of living in a smaller space particularly in regards to storing seasonal or less-frequently-used items. Growing demand for self storage bodes well for Midgard Self Storage (and others’) expansion plans for 2023.

Optimism for the Future

For Allen these trends paint a bright future for self storage companies that are able to deliver what their customers are looking for.

“If there’s one thing the last few years have taught us it’s that flexibility is more important for today’s consumers and businesses than ever before — and that includes their storage needs. When self-storage companies can provide flexibility in terms of unit sizes types of storage payment options and more they can meet customers where they’re at to deliver the right solutions at the right time. I think as long as we can continue to do that we’ll be able to keep growing.”

After all if you live in a small home the living room isn’t always just the living room it can also be a home office guest room dining room or serve all three these purposes at once. So having the right furniture and decor to utilize every square foot is essential. Are you ready to get your small living room organized? Here are seven tips from professional organizers.

How to organize a small living room

The prices below were correct at the time of publishing this article.

1. Maximize the space with functional furniture

The less space you have the more storage you need. So choosing furniture that has hidden storage can help curb excess clutter. “When I’m doing a consult for a new client I’m listening to their needs for the space"" says Carrie Kauffman professional organizer and owner of Carrie’s Essential Services. ""I’m thinking we need to declutter here and get proper storage for the space. I see all the good items that the client can keep and then also have to discuss the larger items that may be useful but are too large for the space.""

Kaufman likes the Ornavo Large Storage Ottoman Bench from Amazon and the Lark Manor Upholstered Storage Ottoman from Wayfair because both have space to stash extra linens and miscellaneous items. Looking to store books or knickknacks? Opt for Vario Stacking Cubes from Container Store.

2. Consider a coffee table with storage

In addition to ottomans you can’t go wrong with a coffee table that has storage. “Get a coffee table that you can entertain your company on and one that will give you some added storage that you can add throw blankets” says professional organizer Shantae Duckworth. Then take a less is more approach to decor. “Books and candles don't need to be on display.”

Duckworth recommends the Kakotito Modern Round Storage Ottoman from Amazon because it has plenty of storage inside and features a modern aesthetic. However if your living room has more of a vintage vibe go with the Yaheetech Modern Lift Top Vintage Coffee Table from Target. If your space is too small for an ottoman a storage stool such as the Sand & Sable Storage Stool from Wayfair can also work.

3. Have a WFH desk work harder

Do you work from home? Having a coffee table that converts into a desk is a worthwhile space saver. Duckworth tells me “we know that a computer desk can take up valuable space. You can also convert the space back into a livable space. Functional multi-purpose furniture is the key to small spaces.”

The Corrigan Studio Amethy Coffee Table from Wayfair has a stylish mid-century modern aesthetic while the Hommpa Lift Top Coffee Table from Walmart has a comfortable ergonomic design. Looking for something minimalist in style and price? Consider the HOMCOM 39"" Modern Lift Top Coffee Table Desk available at Target.

4. Utilize wall space

“Functional wall space can go unused or underused” says Kaufman. “Make the wall function for things you need every day but may not have the flat space to put items on. Wall space just isn’t for frames and artwork.”

The Wallniture Avila Floating Shelves from Amazon are a decorative way to do this but you can also use the 17 Stories Kendelle Wall Organizer With Wall Baskets from Wayfair or The Container Store'sAcrylic Wall Display Cubes instead.

The best way to approach using wall space is to get vertical. Duckworth likes using tall storage pieces such as bookshelves. “[In addition to displaying books] you can also put your photos sentimental items and or collectibles on display.”

A good example of this is the Latitude Run Elite Media Shelves from Wayfair because this unit has lots of compartments. Those with more traditional tastes may want to go with the espresso wood Furinno Jaya 5-Shelf Book Case from Amazon. Another option is a bookshelf/desk combo such as the Nathan James Theo 2-Shelf Industrial Wall Mount from Amazon which can be helpful for living rooms that also serve as home offices.

5. Store things where it makes sense

When you have a small living room both storage and finding the space to entertain can be tricky. Kaufman advises keeping items where you use them especially when you’re entertaining. “Small living room space is your primary entertaining space keep items you need handy versus clogging up valuable travel space in an apartment. [So you don’t need to] head back to the kitchen for drinks or refills! Store wine and liquor in your entertaining space where folks will be gathering. Think about small carts cabinets wine racks.”

Keep wines and spirits within reach using a timeless gold bar cart such as the Vasgale Bar Cart from Amazon. Not a fan of carts and have a little bit of extra space? Why not go with a larger cabinet like Wayfair's 17 Stories Lachesis Metal Bar Cabinet instead? Or to take advantage of vertical space consider Iron Stackable Wine Racks from The Container Store.

We love the idea of having a living room blanket basket to keep all of your throes in one place neat tidy and within reach at all times.

6. Consider little ones too

Children and pets may be little but they can have a lot of things that sure make the living rooms extra hard to keep organized. “When you are short on space but your kids have more toys and crafts than they ever will — storage is essential in any small space” says Kaufman.

The organizer suggests utilizing pieces that work with your aesthetic but are discreet and functional. “Benches ottomans and cubes offering storage can also keep toys out of sight and out of mind. This ensures that your home can be enjoyed by both adults and children alike.”

Storage pieces that can be easily cleaned are also ideal for toys that can bring in dirt from your backyard paint and sticky arts and crafts materials. That's why we love Amazon's 3-Tier Stackable Storage Bins which can be easily disassembled and wiped down as well as The Container Store's SmartStore Translucent Totes for kids toys especially.

For many the process is likely identical: You snap some photos with your phone and they’re automatically uploaded to Google’s cloud service. You might pick the best photo and share it on WhatsApp or Instagram and then never think about the rest of them ever again. The photos join a constantly updating stream of data about life.

But it shouldn’t be this way. Uploading thousands of photos and never taking any steps to sort or manage them creates a series of privacy risks and is making it impossible to maintain your photo collection in the future. Now is the time to stop being an information hoarder before it spirals out of control.

For the past six weeks I’ve spent around a dozen hours deleting thousands of photos that had been uploaded to my Google Photos account in the last half-decade. In total I erased 16774 photos and videos. During the process—and thousands of ""delete"" taps—three things stood out: My photos collection unknowingly includes a lot of sensitive personal information (both about me and others); I don't need to keep so many photos; and wrestling my collection into shape frees up a lot of space in my Google account.

My photo archive goes back to the early 2000s when everything was captured using an eight-megapixel digital camera. There are tens of thousands of photos—it’s impossible to say how many exactly—and they are entirely handled by Google. The photos were initially stored on CDs moved to Flickr before it limited collections to 1000 images and finally found their way onto Google Photos around 2018. When Google limited accounts to 15 gigabytes of storage I started paying for more.

Inside the collection family holiday shots sit alongside selfies. Food pictures and dog pictures are plentiful. As phone cameras have improved and cloud storage has become seemingly unending it appears that I take more photos every year. I am not the only one. Google Photos holds an unfathomable amount of data about us all: In 2020 the company said it stores 4 trillion photos with 28 billion new photos and videos uploaded each week.

Deleting thousands of photos was a manual tedious process. Using an iPad I scrolled through every photo I had backed up from the past 15-plus years and tapped each one that I wanted to send to trash. In one of the longer sessions I erased 2211 photos in 45 minutes. The majority of photos binned were duplicates: Instead of having 16 pictures of me running through a forest only the best two or three remain. Thousands of screenshots were culled: The moment I was verified on Twitter and the news article about a goat being arrested didn’t make it through the process unscathed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmluZ2V0Yy5jb20vYWR2aWNlL2hvdy1kby15b3UtZGVzaWduLWEta2l0Y2hlbi10aGF0LWlzLWJldHRlci10by1jb29rLWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How do you design a kitchen that's better to cook in?

When planning a high-functioning kitchen that allows you to unleash your inner chef it's all about design that prioritizes efficiency. 'Kitchens are about togetherness gathering with family and friends and enjoying a well-cooked meal' says John Lum AIA founding principal at John Lum Architecture. 'The best kitchens to cook in are those that maximize its utility with a welcoming environment for everyone to enjoy.'

When it comes to striking this balance think about the big ticket items that you need to consider how all the zones work together and what you can do to make your life easier in the long run. 'Try to imagine yourself and the list of tasks you wish to achieve in your kitchen at the design stage before you start any remodelling or construction works' recommends designer Benji Lewis.

How do you design a kitchen that's better to cook in?

1. Maximize countertop space

(Image credit: Julian Abrams. Design: Patalab)

First and foremost a sure-fire way to design a kitchen that's better for cooking in is to maximize your countertop and kitchen worktops. A home chef needs space to prep and greater space allows you to have more creativity in the space. Even in a small kitchen countertops are a cook's non-negotiable. From kitchen islands that double up as social spaces and prep zones to clever kitchen peninsulas that jut out the side of a wall for extra countertop space if you can give yourself as much countertop as possible your kitchen is off to a good start.

Most homes are fitted with countertops that are around 25.5 inches from the wall to the edge of the counter but some have extra room of up to 28 inches. If you can make your countertop longer consider turning your L-shape kitchen into a U-shape kitchen with a peninsula on the end if you can afford the space.

2. Create a good lighting scheme

Good kitchen lighting is a must in this space and while it helps with the atmosphere and aesthetic of the space its real selling point is how it can help the cooking process. It's a place where you'll be working to host for friends and family using the space for chopping and cleaning so these zones need to be well-lit.

You want a good mix of task and ambient lighting to fit the various activities. 'You want to balance functional overhead lighting with task and ambient lighting' says John. While overhead pendant lights are aesthetically pleasing they're not the most important light source when it comes to tasks in the kitchen. Consider LED lighting options in your kitchen as you can hide LED strips under kitchen cupboards that will shine down on your countertop space and help you prep as you entertain. Wall lights make for a nice addition to your wall and can be twisted and bent in any direction to shine a light on whatever you're working on.

‘You want to be able to see what you’re cutting and what you’re cooking which is why lighting over prep surfaces including under cabinet lights and a hood over the cooktop with lights to see what’s in those pots is key’ says Matthew Miller of StudioLAB.

The light of the bulb itself is also important in the kitchen and can help the room feel warm and welcoming instead of cold and stark. This helps if you're looking to create a kitchen where your cheffing is on show to guests and you are entertaining.

All light sources have a Correlated Color Temperature and it is measured in Kelvins (k). 'The lower the figure the warmer it is. In the kitchen environment I would suggest either 2700k or 3000k' says Darren Parnaby senior lighting designer from Beem.

3. Think about your 'work triangle'

(Image credit: Future. Matthew Williams)

The kitchen is a place where many different tasks and elements of housework take place so designing a well-functioning kitchen all comes down to the spaces between these zones how they interact and intricately planning the proximity of these areas.

'When I am designing a kitchen layout I envision what happens when my client is moving about the space while preparing food' says Nadia Watts of Nadia Watts Interior Design. 'What should be at arm's length? Where is the logical place to reach? And who else may be in the kitchen at the same time? Answering these questions helps determine the flow and placement of elements throughout the kitchen and allows me to design accordingly.'

John Lum refers to the distance between the fridge the prep and the cook areas as the 'work triangle'. The kitchen work triangle is used to determine kitchen layouts by looking at the primary tasks and where they are carried out - usually the cooktop sink and fridge. You ideally want equal distance between each of these spaces and for nothing to obstruct the flow. 'We try to optimize the work triangle and plan accordingly' says John. 'Locating separate under-counter wine refrigerators or refrigerated drawers for children’s snacks — away from the main cooking triangle — can minimize cross-traffic conflict.'

Think about what belongs near to each point in the triangle to. ‘Other items such as a microwave should be close to the fridge since you’re more than likely pulling out something cold to reheat’ adds Matthew from StudioLAB. Elsewhere you want a drying rack near the sink and the spices accessible near the hob. Break your kitchen into these three points and plan outwards.

4. Consider a working pantry

(Image credit: deVOL)

If space allows a pantry is a good option for a kitchen minimizing the clutter in the main space and allowing you to store dried foods and jars in a designated zone in an organized way and not taking up crucial space in your main entertaining area.

'A working pantry is a great use of space because not only does it store pantry items and kitchen appliances but it also serves as a prep area that can be hidden at the ease of closing the pantry door' says Amy Forshew founder of Proximity Interiors .

There are different options for your pantry too. You might want a sliding door system or soft fabric curtain to shut your pantry out of sight while a free-standing piece of furniture might make a better idea if you are lacking in space. Remember to light your pantry no matter whether it's a smaller side room or a freestanding piece this will all help the cooking process be as smooth and streamlined as possible.

5. Organize the clutter

Planning for clutter is also super important in the kitchen. The cooking process is messy and it's part of the fun. It’s not about keeping everything neat it's about thinking how mess can be cleaned up as easily as possibly afterwards. 'Appliance garages that allow easy access to everyday appliances such as coffee makers and toasters can hide some of the clutter' says John 'while open shelves and cubbies can frame the chaos so that the kitchen still looks orderly' recommends John.

'We utilize appliance garages any time we have an open kitchen' says architect Megan Blaine co-founder of Blaine Architects + Marshall Interiors . 'They keep the kitchens looking clean and tidy while not sacrificing function.'

6. Make sure you have deep drawers for pots and pans

When planning and organizing your kitchen drawers try and prioritize drawers that fit in all your favorite cooking necessities. There is no use planning a kitchen with cupboards that don't fit saucepans so go for drawers with extra depth to accommodate those pots and pans you'll need for the cooking process. Drawers are most commonly around 10 inches high with one slimmer one at four inches high. 10 inch deep drawers are better for those baking bits and pieces.

Alternatively a lower cupboard can be divided with one shelf so you can stack your pots and pans and larger kitchen items.

7. Really consider the type of kitchen faucet you go for

The kitchen sink is an important element of your kitchen and getting the design right will help the flow and make a space that's better for cooking in. During the design stage think about where in the kitchen your sink goes - is it on an island facing your guests or does it take up part of your countertop space. Think about organizing the clutter that gathers in your sink area. A larger sink area and a dedicated zone for dishwashing means visual mess can be kept off the main countertops.

During the design stage consider investing in a hot water tap these use up a lot less electricity and free you up some space where your bulky kettle normally sits. This gives you more countertop space which we already know is important. The arc of your kitchen faucet normally falls around eight to 10 inches high but think about where your cabinets sit and if it is too high and bumps into kitchen cabinets you might want to drop it to around three inches. A faucet that has a spray nozzle is also good for the cooking process helping you clean easier and with more force.

8. Keep utensils close to hand

Another important factor when bearing in mind design in the kitchen is also about those everyday utensils 'Keep utensils close to hand' advises interior designer Benji Lewis. There is no use having wooden spoons spatulas and ladles on the other side of the kitchen so make sure you have designed a space that is both aesthetic and easily accessible.

You can buy large pots that sit by your cooking station or have a drawer nearby so you're never caught short. 'A hanging rail or kitchen shelf with hooks behind the stove work well' says Benji using the wall for extra space for storage.

9. Consider what type of hob you want

Designing a kitchen to have the right hob is key. 'You need to think hob versus range gas versus induction aga versus tepan' says Hugh Leader Williams designer at Blakes.

'This is normally relatively easy to resolve as it is largely informed by the type of food most regularly cooked. People who value quick intense heat and like to cook Asian style food will likely prefer to cook with gas and need good strong overhead extraction like a Westin hood. People who cook less often or cook more European-inspired food tend to like induction hobs that can get away with more subtle downdraft extraction like that offered by Bora' says Hugh.

Clients who love to cook socially and entertain while preparing food tend to like an induction hob on a modern kitchen island as they can chat to their family or guests who are seated at the island. For others concentration is key so a defined cooking space with the hob on the back wall run of a kitchen gives them the ability to have their back to the room. After the cooking device has been determined the layout flows from here."

Oil production in Guyana and Brazil is expected to substantially increase in 2023 successfully anchoring production growth in the Latin America region according to Hart Energy- a globally-recognised provider of information on the petroleum industry.

Hart Energy in a report published on Thursday detailed that Guyana and Brazil are expected to produce an additional 850000 barrels of oil per day in 2023 from new oil ships.

Although other countries in the region including Colombia Mexico and Venezuela are oil producers the report said that the continental neighbours will see greater output.

“…the lion’s share of the production will come from developments in exploration hotspots Brazil and Guyana” the report noted.

With production underway at two developments- the Liza I and Liza II- in Guyana’s prolific Stabroek Block the country is already producing about 360000 barrels of oil per day.

Production at this block is managed by an ExxonMobil-led consortium that includes the United States’ Hess Corporation and China’s CNOOC.

According to Hart Energy in late 2023 once production at the new development Payara starts output should increase by 220000 barrels of oil per day.

At Payara a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel or oil ship known as the Liza Prosperity will produce oil.

In 2025 and 2026 new developments at the Yellowtail and Uaru projects are expected to come on stream.

Meanwhile Petrobras estimates that another 630000 barrels of oil will be added to Brazil’s production in 2023. This output is expected to come from five oil ships.

The report also noted that another 13 new oil ships will start production in Brazil between 2024 and 2027.

The 15 million barrels plus royalty adds up to around US$2B. Stabroek News sought to measure the response from three sectors – the government ExxonMobil and random citizens on milestones reached and direct benefits.

The key gap remains the absence of the regulatory body which is meant to set a comprehensive framework for full compliance with the laws and the policies of the country.

Just after the PPP/C government was sworn in on August 2nd 2020 current Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat had said that the Commission was a priority.

He had told Stabroek News in an August 6th 2020 news item that he hoped that as soon as the 13th Parliament began that the Petroleum Commission Bill would once again be tabled as his government believed that it is needed for the sector to be insulated from political interference before major decisions for the sector are made.

“Oil to a country could be a curse or a blessing but it all depends on the management of that sector. The oil and gas sector will definitely need management in terms of responsibility and transparency in keeping with the Santiago Principles and that is what we intend to bring to the ministry” he had told Stabroek News in an interview following his swearing in.

“The Petroleum Commission Bill was tabled by the previous administration about three years ago and sent to a special select committee. Unfortunately that bill still languishes in that Special Select Committee. Such a special Bill that will reduce political interference in the managing of that sector I believe is needed to ensure transparency” he added. More than two years on his administration is still to deliver a bill.

Minister of Legal Affairs and Attorney General Anil Nandlall SC had also underlined that the Petroleum Commission Bill was a priority for the government and they would be working to ensure that it was swiftly returned to Parliament.

“While we were in opposition we had some fundamental conceptual problems where it was felt that there was an overconcentration of power to politicians. As a result we withheld our support on the floor. The Minister at the time Raphael Trotman expressed some reservations about the Bill and he had asked it to be sent to the special select committee” Nandlall had said in the August 6th 2020 news item. He stressed the importance of having a Bill that reflected the best for the people of this country and also the benefits of the establishment of the Commission.

The Bill was first presented to the National Assembly in May of 2017 and returned for its second reading and debate one month later. The People’s Progressive Party/Civic then in opposition had stoutly criticised it questioning the powers granted to the Minister of Natural Resources.

President Irfaan Ali had also been most vocal in his criticisms of the bill while as an opposition MP and objections were also raised by the PPP/C about the lack of independence of the commission general governance and its ability to operate in a non-discriminatory and apolitical manner.

“When we examine section 8 which deals with the Power of the Minister to give directions to the Commission it is clear that the Commission will hardly be able to work without the direction and control of the Minister. According to Section 8 the Minister is not only allowed to provide policy guidance but also give direction to the Commission regarding size of the establishment the employment of staff and the terms and conditions of employment the provision of equipment and use of funds reorganization of such works of development as to involve a substantial outlay on capital account training education and research the disposal of capital assets; the application of the proceeds of such disposals” Ali had stated .

“Thus the Minister is literally empowered to dictate inter alia how many persons an independent Commission should employ what should be the terms and conditions of employment for the staff of the Commission how an independent Commission should use its funds et cetera. Based on our review of similar legislation in other countries we were unable to locate one that bestows comparable powers to the Minister. Indeed based on our review we found that the only power the Minister is granted in other countries is the power to provide policy guidance” he had added.

There has been no positive statement in recent months from Ali on a Petroleum Commission.

National Petroleum Day

Oil production commenced on December 20th 2019 under the previous APNU+AFC government and former President David Granger had declared the occasion as historic and named it ‘National Petroleum Day’. He had said that the proclamation would remind citizens of their “duty to protect the country’s patrimony and to ensure the sustainable management of [its] finite hydrocarbon resources.” But at the time of the declaration Granger’s government had already fallen to a no-confidence motion and the country was swinging into full elections campaign mode. The APNU+AFC would then leave office in August 2020.

The PPP/C assumed the mantle of government in August 2020 and claimed sustainable management as its praxis in the two and half years it has been in office.

“The PPP/C Government continues to take pride in the sustainable and proficient management of the petroleum sector including other natural resources as we continue to hoist Guyana as a South American country for economic and natural resources management and development” Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat told the Sunday Stabroek last week.

“We will continue to be guided by the Low Carbon Development Strategy 2030 and President Irfaan Ali’s Vision 2030 for infrastructure development and economic prosperity under the One Guyana initiative” he added.

The Minister of Natural Resources recalled that it was in the month of May [2015] when the breakthrough Liza 1 discovery in the offshore Stabroek Block occurred.

When first oil was celebrated in 2019 it was from the Liza Phase 1 with an initial projected daily average of 120000bpd. Bharrat noted as the operating year 2022 comes to an end that from the Liza Phase 1 well the total oil production volumes grew to approximately 114713412 bbl. “The maximum peak production occurred on July 26th 2022 with daily production volumes reaching 155457 bbl” Bharrat informed. With the additional FPSO Liza 2 the current daily production has exceeded 370000 bbl.

Regarding crude oil sales the Government of Guyana received its first lift of profit oil from the Liza Destiny FPSO on the 19th of February 2020. To date “the GOG has received fifteen (15) million barrels of profit oil from the Liza Destiny FPSO (and Unity FPSO)” according to the Natural Resources Minister. Bank of Guyana Governor Gobind Ganga stated that as of last week Guyana had some U.S$1.285B remaining in its Natural Resource Fund (NRF) account. Debited from the NRF account this year in accordance with the NRF law was US$607.6M.

Activity update

ExxonMobil did not respond to the questions asked but instead one of its representatives said that “most of the information sought could be found in the activity update we recently issued”. That update stated that more than 4400 Guyanese or 64 percent of the industry’s workforce are currently supporting the company’s operations. “It speaks to the early commitments that we made around things like the Centre for Local Business Development starting in 2017 working with other organisations like the TVET schools and the ministries to ensure that people are well-trained and available and able to contribute and play an important part in developing the nation’s resource” the release quoted Country Manager Alistair Routledge as saying.

“Since the first discovery in 2015 ExxonMobil Guyana and its contractors have spent more than $140 billion with Guyanese suppliers” it stated.

But while the government and ExxonMobil have tried to outcompete each other about the benefits being received by the citizenry the response by some locals has only served to dampen that enthusiasm. Some agree that while opportunities have been had for a number of persons they do not believe that all citizens are seeing tangible benefits. “I don’t want to hear about the oil money because I am not getting any. All that billions you are talking about… we don’t see here. You see what I am doing? I have to hustle…” a vendor on Regent Street told this newspaper.

However 28-year-old Randel Wright who works at a firm in the capital says that people are benefitting. “People might not be getting money in their hands like they want to but the country is benefitting. It is not a selfish thing. My cousin works offshore and he shared that plenty people has gotten jobs and training. He is not just a lucky one” he said. “If I think that more can be done? More can always be done. But I think with the right direction we will see where the money is going. I want it to get to a point where I can collect directly too but I am also very real. That will take a while…” he said.

Other persons Stabroek News spoke with did not want to give their names because many felt that their views may be misinterpreted as a direct attack on government. Many lauded that the oil resource was found and is garnering revenue. Some also listed areas of benefits. One man Linden Parjohn posited that “any money can do well if it is managed correctly.” Guyana’s Minister of Natural Resources said that his government will ensure accountability and he pointed to audits of operations that have been initiated. “To ensure accountability and transparency a financial audit of expenditures and profit oil during the period 1999 to 2017 was done. Similarly a local consortium VHE consulting was contracted to audit the cost-recoverable expenditures from the Stabroek block during the period 2018 to 2020” he said. However the pre-contract audit is still to be made public.",,,

They can now snap up highly desirable public tech companies at bargain-basement prices after valuations plunged by as much as 80% this year.

Just this week the PE giant Thoma Bravo agreed to buy the software maker Coupa an enterprise spend-management-software company in a deal valued at $8 billion. Coupa's stock had fallen 60% this year and the deal offers Coupa a 77% premium to where the stock was trading when word of the deal first got out.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Overall dealmakers have been sitting on the sidelines this year with PE activity down 55% in the third quarter from an already slow second quarter according to EY.

Investment bankers who Insider spoke with blame the slowdown on turbulence in the leveraged-financing markets as well as a reluctance of boards and major shareholders to sell at depressed valuations.

""A lot of frustration comes from the sell side being unrealistic"" Kirk Kaludis the global head of technology investment banking at RBC Capital Markets said.

For instance after recent speculation that another firm Vista Equity Partners wanted to buy Coupa the company's largest shareholder took the unusual step of saying publicly it would oppose any deal that undervalued the company.

But the company still ended up being taken private albeit at a higher price. And sellers are becoming increasingly resigned to accept lower offers Jason Gurandiano RBC's US head of technology banking said.

""We're starting to see people engage particularly founders who see the outlook for the next couple of years"" Gurandiano said. ""They can make a decision to sell today at a depressed multiple or hold on for a couple years and have value destruction.""

On the buyer side PE firms are sitting on upward of $2.5 trillion in dry powder. Thoma Bravo announced earlier this month it had completed fundraising for massive buyout funds totaling more than $32.4 billion after its recent acquisitions of the software companies Anaplan ForgeRock Ping Identity and SailPoint Technologies.

Bankers are advising private-equity clients to act fast.

""If you don't buy now it's gonna be more expensive in the second half of the year"" said James McVeigh a longtime investment banker and the founder and CEO of Cyndx a market-research firm. ""You will see pricing run away from you after Q1.""

So which companies are likely to be on the holiday-shopping lists of PE firms?

Cyndx which recently launched a new corporate-valuation tool for companies provided Insider with the most likely targets. (Coupa was originally on the list before it got snapped up.) Cyndx based the list on criteria bankers and buyout firms consider the most important:

Dependable revenue. Private-equity firms require a steady cash flow to pay down debt which excludes many kinds of tech companies that have more volatile income streams. One big exception is software-as-a-service companies that have subscriptions and other long-term contracts with customers who rely on them to run their businesses even in a recession.

A market capitalization between $1 billion and $10 billion. There are some bigger leveraged-buyout deals — like Twitter's if that ever closes — but the average private-equity deal was $1.1 billion last year according to Bain & Co.

This one is not hard to find with the Nasdaq down about 20% this year and many SaaS providers down much more than that. Earnings expected next year. If PE firms are preparing to layer on more debt companies have to generate profits and use that cash to pay off the loans.

Here are the 34 contenders ranked by the lowest enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio as of December 3. A company's enterprise value includes its market capitalization debt and any cash on the balance sheet. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a common measure of profitability. (An EV/EBITDA value below 10 is commonly interpreted as healthy though tech companies often have much higher ratios because investors are willing to pay more for growth.) Companies did not respond to requests for comment unless otherwise noted.

NCR

NCR Corporation a company that helps restaurants retailers and banks run their businesses has not had a great 2022. The company's stock price has fallen over 40% in the past 12 months with the public markets valuing the entire company at slightly more than its projected 2023 revenues. Additionally NCR is fairly leveraged with $5.7 billion in debt versus $736 million in cash. Wall Street expects the company's revenue to grow by 3.2% next year.

Synaptics

Synaptics is a developer of human-interface hardware and software or the means through which humans and computers communicate with each other like touchpads or biometrics. The company has suffered an over 64% drop in stock price this year and is projected to shrink revenue by nearly 3% in 2023.

SolarWinds

SolarWinds develops software to help businesses manage their networks. Its time as a public company has been stormy with the stock cut in half since debuting on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018 and falling more than 40% this year. SolarWinds now has an enterprise value of just over $2.5 billion making it affordable for PE firms that might also be attracted to its $493 million of cash on hand.

F5

F5 provides application security multi-cloud management and online-fraud prevention. It stands out from most other companies on our list because it has been public since 1999 and is relatively large with an enterprise value of nearly $9 billion. But with the stock down nearly 40% this year the company could finally be small enough to attract interest from PE buyers who could also take a liking to its solid balance sheet.

TaskUs

Outsourcing company TaskUs debuted on the public markets in June 2021 with a strong 26% IPO price pop. Since then however the company has seen its market capitalization sliced nearly in half in the last year. TaskUs' low trading multiple of 2.4 times next year's revenue could be a reflection of its slow revenue growth with an estimated increase in 2023 revenue of just 6.6% according to Wall Street estimates.

EverCommerce

EverCommerce's first year as a public company has been a rough one with the stock down more than 60% since its debut last July. But it has a durable and growing business providing software-as-a-service to half a million small and midsize companies. It's carrying more than half a billion dollars in debt but Wall Street analysts are projecting 12.4% revenue growth next year.

R1 RCM

R1 RCM offers revenue tools to healthcare companies. Despite suffering a 60% drop in stock price this year which resulted in the company trading at less than three times next year's revenue the company is still projected by Wall Street to grow sales at nearly 30% in 2023 making it an attractive target for private-equity firms.

Perficient

Digital consulting firm Perficient has been an active acquirer in recent years picking up other consulting companies like Inflection Point and Ameex Technologies. With a stock price down 45% in the last year though it may soon find itself on the other side of the table. With a market capitalization of $2.6 billion Perficient trades at three times next year's revenue and is projected to grow sales just under 10% in 2023.

E2Open

E2Open originally entered the public markets in July 2012 before being taken private by Insight Venture Partners in 2015. In February 2021 the supply chain management firm went public for the second time through a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC at the height of the SPAC craze. Now E2Open may become a private company again as the company deals with a stock price down nearly 50% in the last year and over $1 billion in debt versus just $115 million in cash. A E2Open spokesperson declined to comment.

RingCentral

RingCentral is similar to Zoom except it focuses on audio providing a cloud-based business-phone system that delivers team messages videoconferences and phone calls. Both companies have had their shares battered in the past year with RingCentral's stock down about 80% giving it a market capitalization of about $3.9 billion. RingCentral seems interested in being a buyer itself as there's been market chatter about a potential acquisition of its competitor 8x8.

Alarm.com

Alarm.com offers services for remote control home automation and monitoring services. The company's stock has sunk 37% this year currently trading at less than 3 times next year's revenue. Wall Street expects Alarm.com's sales to grow by just 3.8% in 2023 but the company is profitable making it a potential target for private equity firms.

Informatica

Permira and Canada's government-pension fund took Informatica an enterprise cloud-data-management platform private in 2015. The company went public again in October of last year and with its stock price cut in half this year it could be primed to go private yet again. The company brought in $1.44 billion in revenue last year up 9% from 2020. In 2023 it's forecasted to grow sales by 9.2%. An Informatica spokesperson told Insider that the company ""continues to stay focused on growing its cloud customer base and be a market leader in cloud data management.""

DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean provides businesses with cloud-computing services. The company experienced a 66% drop in stock price this year and is now trading at 5.4 times next year's revenue estimates. However DigitalOcean is EBITDA-positive and is forecasted to grow sales at a nearly 30% rate in 2023.

Momentive

Related stories

Customer experience company Momentive originally known as SurveyMonkey has had quite a well momentous year. At the end of 2021 customer service firm Zendesk announced its acquisition of Momentive but just a few months later in February 2022 Momentive's shareholders rejected the proposed acquisition following a failed takeover of Zendesk by a group of private equity firms. Since then Momentive's stock has plummeted 60% from where it was a year ago and the company is projected to grow revenue by just 8.3% next year. Momentive's failed acquisition and lackluster performance could present an opportunity for opportunistic PE firms.

Squarespace

The website builder Squarespace went public in May 2021 via direct listing at a market capitalization of $6.6 billion. Since then the company has seen lukewarm stock performance with its market cap dropping to $3 billion. Private-equity firms may be drawn to the company for its positive EBITDA although its sales growth has faltered with an expected 10.5% increase in 2023.

Cvent

Cvent provides software for event management marketing and attendee engagement. It first went public in 2013 raising $135 million. Three years later it was taken private by Vista Equity Partners for $1.65 billion and it went public again late last year this time via a special-purpose acquisition company. Since then its stock has fallen by nearly 40%. It may soon be a private company for a third time.

Twilio

Twilio which sells programmable communication tools for making and receiving phone calls saw its stock plummet 34% in November after lowering its fourth-quarter guidance. The stock is down more than 80% this year and Twilio's enterprise value sits at just $6.4 billion. PE buyers could be enticed by the company's pristine balance sheet with more than $4 billion of cash against less than $1 billion in debt.

Five9

Five9 is a provider of cloud-based call-center software that over 2500 clients use for sales marketing and customer service. In 2021 Five9's shareholders rejected Zoom's $14.7 billion bid for the company but with a halved market capitalization from a year ago and a forecasted 16.5% revenue growth Five9 may be back on the market. A Five9 spokesperson declined to comment.

Everbridge

Everbridge which offers applications for personal safety and business continuity has seen its stock rise 20% in the past month. Even so the stock is trading at half what it was at the beginning of 2022. Everbridge brought in $368.4 million of revenue last year that analysts are projecting to grow 6.3% in the next year. Meanwhile its enterprise value stands at just $1.7 billion.

Altair

Altair offers software for simulation high-performance computing data analytics and artificial intelligence. The company's stock is down about 30% this year with an acquisition of data analytics and machine learning company RapidMiner announced in September and analysts predict only 8.4% revenue growth next year. Altair has about equal amounts of cash and debt $312 million and $305 million respectively. An Altair spokesperson declined to comment.

Rapid7

Throughout 2020 and 2021 Rapid7's stock soared as high-profile cybersecurity attacks and data breaches made the company's security offerings more relevant than ever. However after a year of falling stock prices and the acquisitions of fellow cybersecurity companies like Ping Identity and ForgeRock by PE firm Thoma Bravo Rapid7 may be next in line for buyers. The company has a nearly $2 billion market capitalization and is projected to grow revenue by 17.3% next year. A Rapid7 spokesperson declined to comment.

Q2

Q2 helps banks credit unions and fintech companies with digital banking and lending. Its stock has plummeted by nearly 70% this year giving it an enterprise value of less than $2 billion. The company has yet to turn a profit but has seen revenue growth of greater than 20% the past three years and analysts are projecting 13.6% growth next year leaving some to believe the stock is oversold.

Definitive Healthcare

Definitive Healthcare a healthcare analytics and data provider company joined a steady stream of healthcare companies going public in 2021 like medical professional platform Doximity and digital health startup Hims & Hers. Although the public offering was priced on the high end of its range and enjoyed a near 50% IPO pop Definitive Healthcare's stock has struggled since falling 57% in the last year. However the company is still trading at nearly 12 times next year's revenue and is projected to grow sales by about 17% in 2023.

Qualtrics

Qualtrics is an experience management company that allows enterprise users like UPS to easily create surveys and generate reports. Since going public last year its stock has fallen nearly 80% giving it a market capitalization of around $6 billion. But it has $732 million in cash on hand with zero debt and analysts are projecting 16% revenue growth. One obstacle to a sale is that any deal would have to be approved by SAP the German software company that remains the controlling shareholder.

Duck Creek Technologies

Duck Creek Technologies provides software to the property and casualty insurance industry. The company was one of the first to go public during the COVID-19 pandemic and its stock saw mixed performance during 2020 and 2021 due to smaller-than-expected earnings beats and weak financial guidance. This year Duck Creek's market capitalization has been cut by 60% presenting a potential opportunity for PE firms to pick up an asset at a low price.

Elastic

Elastic helps companies quickly store search and analyze huge volumes of data in the cloud. Its stock is down more than 50% this year despite projected revenue growth of 25% and an enviable client roster that includes Netflix Microsoft Slack and Uber.

Varonis

Data security and analytics company Varonis was perhaps one of the greatest beneficiaries of 2020 and 2021's tech craze as the company saw its stock soar over 300% from March 2020 to its heights in September 2021. This year though Varonis has come back to earth — its stock price has sunk over 57% in the last 12 months. However the company is still well capitalized with $790 million in cash and $249 million in debt and with lots of deal activity in the cybersecurity space Varonis could be an enticing acquisition choice. A Varonis spokesperson declined to comment.

nCino

nCino which offers a bank operating system braved the global pandemic to go public in July 2020 a time when many tech companies were avoiding the public markets. They were rewarded with a more than 150% surge in price during their first day of trading. Since then though the company's stock has faced tougher times decreasing by 47% in the last 12 months and giving the company a market capitalization of $3.1 billion. Wall Street predicts nCino's revenue to grow about 20% from 2022 to 2023.

Olo

Strong demand for Olo's March 2021 IPO helped push the company's offering price range from $16-$18 to $20-$22 before ultimately pricing at $25 per share with a nearly $4 billion valuation. A year and a half later the restaurant tech company's enterprise value is merely $842 million. Despite Olo's dismal stock price performance PE buyers could be enticed with the company's zero debt and 17% projected revenue growth.

Zuora

Zuora helps companies build run and grow their subscription businesses. The company has seen a nearly 60% drop in stock price this year and is trading at less than two times next year's revenue. In March 2022 Zuora received $400 million in capital from tech investment firm Silver Lake in the form of convertible debt and the recent cash infusion may make it less open to a takeover. However with strong projected 2023 revenue growth of 18.6% Zuora remains a strong target for PE firms.

Sprinklr

In June 2021 customer experience management company Sprinklr went public in a downsized IPO both cutting its opening price and number of shares sold. Since its lackluster public debut Sprinklr's bad luck has continued as the company has experienced a 36% decrease in stock price in the last year. But the company carries zero debt on its books and analysts expect brisk 19% revenue growth next year. A Sprinklr spokesperson declined to comment.

New Relic

New Relic provides cloud-based software to help websites and app owners track performance. The stock is down about 45% this year and now trades at less than three times next year's projected sales. New Relic's tough year has resulted in takeover rumors with Reuters reporting that the company is preparing to explore a potential sale following interest from private equity firms and a growing stake from activist investor Jana Partners. New Relic said as a company policy they do not comment on rumors or speculation.

BlackLine

BlackLine develops cloud-based services to automate the financial-close accounts-receivable and intercompany accounting processes. Its stock price has been hammered going down about 40% this year and making it the subject of mergers-and-acquisitions chatter. Wall Street sees 21% revenue growth over the next year.

UiPath

During its April 2021 IPO UiPath landed a $31 billion valuation slightly below its last private financing valuation of $35 billion but an impressive achievement nonetheless. Over the past year the software automation company has seen its stock plummet over 60% and now the company has an enterprise value of less than $7 billion. However UiPath has zero debt on its books and analysts are projecting demand for its offerings will remain strong with strong revenue growth of almost 20% next year.

On Friday FedEx posted a statement to its website warning those who used its Express service that the guaranteed delivery date of Dec. 26 may not be met after the Memphis and Indianapolis hubs experienced “substantial” weather disruptions.

The shipping company said actions have been taken to lessen any impact on delivery but the safety of its team members is the “number one priority.”

“We recognize the importance of deliveries this holiday weekend and are committed to providing service to the best of our ability by implementing contingency measures where it is safe and possible to do so” the statement read.

FedEx recommended keeping up with its Service Alerts page for updates in addition to tracking shipments.

The company reminded customers that shipments delayed “due to inclement weather are not eligible for a refund or credit under the Money-Back Guarantee policy.”

UPS put out a similar statement announcing the weather impacted its Air and Ground service specifically at hubs in Louisville Kentucky and Rockford Illinois.

“We will work to ensure the safety of our employees while minimizing effects on service. Contingency plans are in place to help ensure that shipments arrive at their final destinations as quickly as conditions permit” the statement read.

The parcel service encouraged customers to keep up with the status of shipments on its website.

UPS also said the UPS Service Guarantee does not apply to shipments affected by the weather-related disruption.

Amanda had to deliver packages to 100 clients that day; one of those was to a woman with a husband battling against cancer. While delivering the package she chatted with the lady and heard about her ill husband. However she tried to change the topic after she felt awkward.

However the Lord was telling her to do something else. He wanted to bless the lady and her husband through Amanda.

“I drove off. My heart was pounding. I’ll have to do probably 20 more stops then I have to go back” said Amanda.

She rushed to deliver the rest of the boxes… “Then I stopped what I was doing I went back to the neighborhood and ring her doorbell” Amanda stated in her testimony.

“Ma’am can I pray for you?”

“I said ‘Ma’am can I pray for you?’ and she broke down. She came out of the front porch and squeezed me so tight” Amanda added.

Christians are called to be God’s vessels and a light unto the world. Therefore there are many times when we are being called by God to step out to be His instruments. But how frequent are we willing to be used by God? Most importantly can we put aside your busy schedules to glorify Him?

“A lot of people want the Lord to use them and for me as an example I pray every day for the Lord to use me” Amanda continued. “But when He’s trying to use you or when you feel that call and that tug on your heartstrings do you move your feet? Do you move?”

Amanda’s testimony clearly shows what God wants to do with our lives. Let’s live to be a vessel of God’s love for all the people.

Watch her video and be encourage:

The multipurpose North Little Rock arena achieved record results this year offering 137 events with more than 315362 tickets sold at a gross margin of $27.4 million.

That performance gained Simmons international attention ranking 50th in the world according to data compiled by Pollstar a trade publication covering the concert and music industry.

As performers returned to the stage Simmons Bank Arena capitalized on the renewed activity which was above the 120 events the facility typically hosts each year. Many countries still had suspended or limited live events with thousands of attendees when bookings were made last year pushing many musicians and other performers to U.S. arenas like Simmons.

""It's been an awesome year"" said Michael Marion general manager of the arena. ""We've never done anything like this. We were able to book a lot of things because they were all staying here in the U.S.""

For example the arena hosted 23 comedy and musical performers in 2018 and 2019 pre-pandemic and held 37 last year. It also has annual bookings such as Monster Truck rallies the Harlem Globetrotters and Arkansas Razorback basketball games.

George Strait sold the most tickets more than 17608 even though others like Elton John sold out the facility. Strait performs in the round creating more seating area for fans.

Elton John was the first major performer in the arena in 1999 after its opening was delayed by 10 days due to structural issues which were found the same day the original opening event -- an NBA game showcasing the Los Angeles Lakers featuring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant -- was canceled hours before tipoff.

The Pulaski County Multi-Purpose Civic Center Facilities Board has managed the arena since 2004 picking up management duties from a private company that ran the arena when it opened as Alltel Arena.

The name changed first in 2009 when Verizon purchased Alltel Corp. and gained naming rights to the facility. Verizon did not renew the sponsorship contract and Simmons Bank stepped up with a $10.5 million agreement in 2018.

One thing has remained consistent across the name changes -- Marion has been general manager from the very first day.

The entertainment arena provides concerts sporting events and meeting space for the Central Arkansas market.

Usage should return to normal levels in 2023.

""I think things will settle down next year"" Marion says. ""I don't think we'll see this kind of event load next year.""

ALLIANCE RUBBER RECOGNIZED

Alliance Rubber Co. which manufactures rubber bands in Hot Springs is one of eight companies cited by the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) as one of the nation's leading exporters.

The woman-owned company has been operating for nearly 100 years and also offers packaging and promotional products for use in the home and workplace. Alliance currently exports to 60 countries.

""EXIM is dedicated to facilitating the exporting success of U.S. small business as they compete globally"" said bank President and Chair Reta Jo Lewis. ""The eight exporters recognized this year have contributed greatly to fulfilling EXIM's mission of supporting American jobs by facilitating U.S. exports. Congratulations to each business!""

U.S. companies particularly small businesses use the bank's financing tools and resources to increase international sales showcase American-made products and create and sustain American jobs.

VENTURE CENTER WINNERS

A Cincinnati company that enhances peer-to-peer payment options for banks won the Demo Day award as the latest FIS Fintech Accelerator cohort at the Little Rock Venture Center ended last week.

The accelerator sponsored by Fidelity National Information Services Inc. of Jacksonville offers mentoring and training services that allow financial technology companies to grow their businesses and make important connections in the sector.

Demo day featured live presentations by the fintech companies participating in the accelerator to an audience of remote investors bankers and fintech leaders.

""Now in its seventh year the FIS Fintech Accelerator has successfully helped more than 70 entrepreneurial innovators from across the globe gain access to a network of industry experts"" said Hamza Qadir managing director of fintech programs for the Venture Center. ""Partnerships make this possible. FIS and the state of Arkansas have been vital for ensuring collaboration between our organization the financial services industry and field experts in order to continue advancing fintech solutions for real-world problems.""

NWA HOT HOUSING MARKET

The Northwest Arkansas housing market of Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers has been touted by a national organization as one of the top real estate markets in the nation to watch in 2023.

The region is projected to be the fourth-best housing market next year by the National Association of Realtors which is predicting 4.78 million existing-home sales in 2023 down 6.8% from 5.13 million in 2022. The Atlanta metro area was projected to be the top-performing market.

""Half of the country may experience small price gains while the other half may see slight price declines"" said Lawrence Yun chief economist with the real-estate organization.

The national median home price will reach $385800 -- an increase of just 0.3% from this year which was $384500. Rent prices are predicted to rise 5% in 2023 following a 7% increase in 2022.

Mortgage rates which climbed above 7% this year fueled by interest-rate increases should settle down to 5.7% Yun said.

""The demand for housing continues to outpace supply"" Yun said. ""The economic conditions in place in the top 10 U.S. markets all of which are located in the South provide the support for home prices to climb by at least 5% in 2023.""

“We’re the largest bank in Iowa but we have not had a physical brick-and-mortar presence in Cedar Rapids” said Chip Reeves who became MidwestOne’s chief executive officer Nov. 1. “That will change in the first quarter of 2023.”

Reeves 55 talked with The Gazette about his connection with former CEO Charlie Funk the role of a community bank and the ways the industry is evolving.

Q: You were CEO of Beach Bancorp Inc. based in Florida and before that worked in the Pacific Northwest. Iowa has no mountains or oceans. What drew you here?

A: “It’s really a return to Midwestern roots and values. I grew up in Cincinnati Ohio and went to Miami of Ohio. My wife Michelle grew up in the northern suburbs of Chicago and also went to Miami. I worked 22 years with Fifth Third Bank which is primarily based in the Midwest.”

Q: With longtime MidWestOne CEO Charlie Funk’s August bike accident and rehabilitation have you had a chance to talk with him?

A: “I first spoke with Charlie about 2 1/2 years ago and we both enjoyed the dialogue even that long ago. We reconnected in March or April as Charlie announced his intentions to retire. Over these last two months I’ve been able to spend some quality time with him. He’s been an outstanding mentor and board member.”

Q: You have some other things in common right?

A: “Charlie is a tall individual who played basketball in college. I’m 6’7’’ and played basketball at Miami of Ohio. Charlie’s legal name is Charles. My legal name is Charles. My middle initial is actually ‘N’; so is Charlie’s. I spent five years in southwest Florida in Naples and I actually worked in the same building that MidWestOne is in there.”

Q: What structures or cultures did Funk put in place at MidWestOne Bank that made you want to lead the organization?

A: “Two things that I think are Charlie Funk’s legacy. One it’s a legacy of growth. When Charlie first became CEO of what was at that time Iowa State Bank it was probably only $300 or $400 million in size. Today MidWestOne across five states is worth $6.5 billion. The other is the culture and the values and our operating principles.”

Q: The movie “It’s a Wonderful Life” is popular this time of year. The Baileys were a banking family deeply integrated in the community and its needs. How much of being a bank CEO today is about being active in the community?

A: “It’s critical. It’s what separates us as a community bank. My wife and I have lived by those values throughout our lives. You’ll see me being extremely involved in the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids Corridor and community. I have meetings later this week and next week with the United Way of Johnson County with the school district here in Iowa City. I’ll be looking to become part of the Iowa Banker’s Association and many of our team members are incredibly intertwined with the community.”

Q: For a while it seemed like there were bank branches on every corner. Has that changed with more mobile banking?

A: “Why you are seeing less branches today is because the customer has chosen how they desire to interact with us for their normal daily banking. The transactions pieces have gone digital. That’s why we as an industry and we at MidWestOne have invested so much in our digital online experiences.

“What that also means is when a customer is visiting us in our branches or offices we have to be great bankers because most of that now is around specific events advice or solutions. We spend an incredible amount of time in education and training of our bankers and I think we have the best in the market.”

Q: Cryptocurrency is viewed by some as an alternative to traditional banks. To what degree have traditional banking institutions interacted with crypto and is there any intersection?

A: “If you look out to 2030 and 2040 digital currency will almost replace real currency. However the speculation of crypto or Bitcoin etc. I’ve always looked at that as a little bit of a Ponzi scheme. But the digital currency the payment systems that are coming from blockchain are absolutely here to stay. I believe we’ll ultimately see the Federal Reserve begin to step into the space and create a federal digital currency.”

Q: We’d love to hear about your family.

A: “I love to brag about my family. We have four children. They are boy girl girl boy: 26 24 22 and then we took 10 years off and have a boy who is 13 years old and will be relocating here to Iowa City with my wife Michelle.”

Chip Reeves the new CEO of MidWestOne Bank in Iowa City on Tuesday Dec. 20.

The banks witnessed a 5 per cent increase in customer deposits during the period under review to stand at N43.68 trillion as of September 2022 from N41.61 per cent as of June 2022.

Four of the 13 banks recorded positive growth in their share price in the third quarter of this year in the local equities market.

The 13 banks recorded an average cost-to-income ratio of 64.96 per cent in the period under review compared to 69.11 per cent in the same period last year.

The National Bureau of Statistics said that the banks recorded slowed growth saying that the banking sector slowed from 20.06 per and 25.5 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 respectively to 12.03 per cent during the period under review.

NBS reports that this is the slowest quarterly growth since the first quarter of 2021 when the economy was recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Top 5 biggest banks in Nigeria by market capitalisation

Legit.ng reported that Zenith Bank GT Bank and 3 others made the list of the top 5 banks in Nigeria according to market capitalisation. This is according to data released by the Nigerian Exchange at the close of the market on Monday November 28 2022.

The market capitalisation is in otherwords the cumulative value of the banks. It is calculated by multiplying the total units of shares held by the price of the shares.

Typically the positions would be comprised of the tier-1 banks in Nigeria which are sometimes known as FUGAZ (First Bank UBA GT Bank Access Bank and Zenith Bank) but for the period under our scope UBA lost its position on the list to Stanbic IBTC.

Efficiency has been taken into consideration when designing the first solar car Lightyear 0.

The first solar-powered electric car to enter production is called Lightyear 0. The electric start-up has given Finland's Valmet Automotive the ownership for production. Almost all of the world's major automakers have used their vehicles in production. Valmet wants to provide full battery and vehicle manufacturing solutions to start-ups like Lightyear with the help of CATL as a partner.

Lighteryear 0: Specifications and features

Efficiency has been taken into consideration when designing the solar car. The body of the 0 has been made extremely slick with a drag coefficient of less than 0.175 in order to accomplish that. This is the lowest ever for a production car. As there is less resistance to the vehicle's motion this helps to maximise range.

Additionally solar panels have been installed on its body panels including the roof and bonnet. Those naturally recharge the battery every day if the sun is out. You won't need to charge it if you drive 50 km per day for months. Four separate in-wheel motors and a 60 kWh battery are included with Lightyear 0. This enables an acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in just over ten seconds.

In favour of performance the top speed is supported to 160 km/h and the WLTP-certified range is 625 km. The thermal integration enables reusing the leftover heat to keep the vital components at the ideal temperature. The light chassis and body contribute to this. Also included is a battery pack with a high energy density.

Lighteryear 0: Price

The Lightyear 0 costs $262000 to purchase (approx Rs 2.16 Crore). This elevates it to the status of a luxury item but its convenience seems to be warranted. For those who reside in a sunny area they could potentially save a lot of money because the battery will be sufficiently charged for moderate daily use. I

n a few years Lightyear will release a smaller EV with the name 2 catering to those seeking for a more affordable alternative of the solar vehicle. Only 946 units of the 0 will be available for purchase.

What’s important is “to do this as quickly and safely as we can.”

Wildly premature

But dedicated experts in the field think such efforts are wildly premature and could have the opposite effect from what Iseman expects.

“The current state of science is not good enough … to either reject or to accept let alone implement” solar geoengineering wrote Janos Pasztor executive director of the Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative in an email. The initiative is calling for oversight of geoengineering and other climate-altering technologies whether by governments international accords or scientific bodies. “To go ahead with implementation at this stage is a very bad idea” he added comparing it to Chinese scientist He Jiankui’s decision to use CRISPR to edit the DNA of embryos while the scientific community was still debating the safety and ethics of such a step.

Shuchi Talati a scholar in residence at American University who is forming a nonprofit focused on governance and justice in solar geoengineering says Make Sunset’s actions could set back the scientific field reducing funding dampening government support for trusted research and accelerating calls to restrict studies.

The company’s behavior plays into long-held fears that a “rogue” actor with no particular knowledge of atmospheric science or the implications of the technology could unilaterally choose to geoengineer the climate without any kind of consensus around whether it’s okay to do so—or what the appropriate global average temperature should be. That’s because it’s relatively cheap and technically simple to do at least in a crude way.

David Victor a political scientist at the University of California San Diego warned of such a scenario more than a decade ago. A “Greenfinger self-appointed protector of the planet … could force a lot of geoengineering on his own” he said invoking the Goldfinger character from a 1964 James Bond movie best remembered for murdering a woman by painting her gold.

Some observers were quick to draw parallels between Make Sunsets and a decade-old incident in which an American entrepreneur reportedly poured a hundred tons of iron sulfate into the ocean in an effort to spawn a plankton bloom that could aid salmon populations and suck down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Critics say it violated international restrictions on what’s known as iron fertilization which were in part inspired by a growing number of commercial proposals to sell carbon credits for such work. Some believe it subsequently stunted research efforts in field.

Pasztor and others stressed that Make Sunset’s efforts underscore the urgent need to establish broad-based oversight and clear rules for responsible research in geoengineering and help determine whether or under what conditions there should be a social license to move forward with experiments or beyond. As MIT Technology Review first reported the Biden administration is developing a federal research plan that would guide how scientists proceed with geoengineering studies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NvbGFyLWVsZWN0cmljLWJvYXQtcG9sLWx1eC1jYW4tYmUtYS1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1wYXJ0eS12ZW51ZS1pbi10aGUtbWlkZGxlLW9mLWEtbGFrZS0yMDY5MzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar-Electric Boat POL Lux Can Be a Sustainable Party Venue in the Middle of a Lake,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NvbGFyLWVsZWN0cmljLWJvYXQtcG9sLWx1eC1jYW4tYmUtYS1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1wYXJ0eS12ZW51ZS1pbi10aGUtbWlkZGxlLW9mLWEtbGFrZS0yMDY5MzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226FC39A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

FirstEnergy offers the following tips to help conserve the use of electricity:



If health permits set thermostats at a lower temperature than usual.

Turn off non-essential appliances equipment and electric lights – including holiday lights – that you do not need or are not using.

Postpone using major electric household appliances such as stoves dishwashers and clothes dryers.

Close curtains and blinds to retain warm air inside homes.

Demand for electricity is expected to increase through the day as the cold temperatures continue and families gather to celebrate the holiday. PJM will continue to monitor conditions and will take additional actions if necessary which may include the potential for short rotating customer outages. Taking action to conserve energy now can help offset the need for additional actions later.

FirstEnergy has also created a new online video game Drone Safety Zone to help drone pilots learn safety guidelines while participating in an obstacle-course drone race.

The free game can be found at dronesafetygame.com. Gamers can answer safety questions to get power boosts for flying their drones in a three-lap race. Racers can advance up a leader board with each round.

FirstEnergy said “While drones can be safe when used correctly flying them close to power lines substations or other electrical equipment could cause serious damage and pose significant safety risks to you and other people nearby.”

The race course includes power hazards that zap and slow your drone if you don’t manage to avoid them.

Candace Webb FirstEnergy public safety manager said “Drones have become a must-have gadget for the holidays because they can perform stunts take photographs or even stream video. But like driving a car there is an inherent responsibility that goes along with the activity to keep yourself safe and the power flowing reliably.”

FirstEnergy offers these tips and suggestions:

Become a licensed pilot before flying a drone.

Register a drone weighing more than a half pound with the Federal Aviation Administration.

Stay at least 200 feet away from power lines or other electrical equipment.

Fly your drone at or below 400 feet and keep it at an altitude where it can be seen.

Do not fly in dark or windy conditions.

Never try to get your drone if it crashes on or near a downed line or substation. Call 888-LIGHTSS (888-544-4877) and a FirstEnergy employee will retrieve it safely.

Drone safety isn’t the only thing to keep in mind for a harm-free holiday. FirstEnergy also offers a few tips on best practices for holiday decorations:

With time Christmas trees continue to dry out making them increasingly flammable. Trees decorated with holiday lights have an increased risk because they’re in direct contact with an electrical source. Check with your local community to find a recycling program through which to dispose of your tree early in the new year.

Always unplug decorations by using the gripping area. Pulling on the cord could damage the wire and present a shock or fire hazard.

As you take down holiday lights inspect the wiring and discard any that have cracked frayed or appear to have damaged wire insulation.

Label or store indoor decorations separate from those intended for outdoor use.

Many people spend hours playing the Battle Royale game daily. Fortnite is no stranger to collaborations either. Star Wars Marvel and DC Comics characters have all been playable characters. It is not limited to fictional characters either. Ariana Grande and Travis Scott have also had collaborations with Fortnite. Another collaboration has just launched on Fortnite. Giannis Antetokounmpo is now a playable character in Fortnite.

Giannis Is A Playable Character In Fortnite

While you can dominate the court in NBA 2K games with Giannis you can now also dominate the battle royale island in Fortnite. Players can buy two different skins in the Giannis bundle. One is just a Fortnite version of Giannis but another is Giannis is a Greek god-type armor. Players can also play on Giannis’ Dream Island to earn exclusive rewards. If you play the game and are a fan of Giannis this bundle is a must-have.

Popular Amongst Kids

This type of collaboration shows how popular Giannis is amongst the younger generations. While Fortnite is played by people of all ages it is insanely popular with the younger generations. For Fortnite to spend time on this collaboration it means that there must be a proper demand for it. Giannis is so popular that he transcends the basketball court and is now a pop culture icon. What is great about this is that it is creating fans of the game and the Milwaukee Bucks. Young fans will grow up idolizing Giannis and watching his games.

It is awesome to see Giannis in Fortnite. It will be interesting to see if any other NBA players get this kind of treatment or if Giannis makes guest appearances in any other video games.

Jayson Tatum and Giannis Antetokounmpo lead their respective teams into the third of five holiday matchups on Sunday.

The Bucks and Celtics carry the NBA’s two best records into their first meeting of the season. If it’s anything like last season’s playoffs it should be one heck of a Christmas present to NBA Fans. Tatum and Antetokounmpo are both in the thick of the early MVP race but who has the upper hand right now?

At 5 p.m. Eastern on Christmas Tatum and Antetokounmpo will face each other for the first time since the Celtics outlasted the Bucks in a thrilling seven-game playoff series. It was a series that homecourt advantage meant very little and you could expect the unexpected.

The Bucks had a golden opportunity to close out the series at home in Game 6 but Tatum played the best game of Boston’s grueling postseason run. The Celtics star went for 46 points to lead the visiting Celtics to a 108-95 victory and force a Game 7 back in Boston.

Tatum was spectacular from start to finish. He had struggled throughout the series. In his three previous games Tatum shot 5-for-27 from three-point land. In the pivotal Game 6 he went 7-for-15 from beyond the arc and 17-for 32 in the game.

Antetokounmpo was steady throughout the series. With Khris Middleton out the Greek Freak was forced to do more than normal. The Celtics/Bucks game is the centerpiece of the Christmas matchups this year. The list of holiday games are as follows:

New York Knicks vs. Philadelphia 76ers – 12 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

Dallas Mavericks vs. Los Angeles Lakers – 2:30 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

Boston Celtics vs. Milwaukee Bucks – 5 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

Golden State Warriors vs. Memphis Grizzlies – 8 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

Denver Nuggets vs. Phoenix Suns – 10:30 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

The Joker continues to rise 👀



Check out the latest @Kia MVP Ladder: https://t.co/MjFikuPFc7 pic.twitter.com/8UhjZiE0U6 — NBA TV (@NBATV) December 23 2022

Tatum and Antetokounmpo are always near the top of the early MVP conversation. Two weeks ago Tatum held the lead in the Kia MVP rankings. The Celtics had the best record in the NBA at 21-5 but then things took a turn as they wrapped up a six-game road trip.

After double-digit losses to the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers the Celtics trailed the LA Lakers by 13 points with less than four minutes to play but mounted a late rally to pull out an overtime win. When they returned to TD Garden for a seven-game homestand they lost the first three games.

Milwaukee has been much more consistent. Antetokounmpo has led the way by averaging a career-high 31.4 points. He’s also putting up 11.3 rebounds ad 5.2 assists.

Tatum is averaging 30.5 points 8.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists. Boston’s recent slump sent him down a couple of spots in the latest Kia MVP rankings putting him behind Antetokounmpo and Denver’s Nikola Jokic.

For now Antetokounmpo is the right choice. He’s the better player on a more consistent team but as we’ve seen a lot can change in a matter of weeks.",,,,,,

Happily Ford's engineers had better sense than scaling down a fission reactor and shoving it in the rear of a concept car.

ICE

kWh

Sixty-five years after the Ford Nucleon fiasco humanity's just hit another breakthrough with a different far more complicated form of nuclear energy; nuclear fusion. At the National Ignition Facility in California scientists recently smashed the proverbial glass ceiling known as scientific breakeven. The point where the level of energy output by a fusion reaction exceeds the energy needed to generate the reaction in the first place.What does this mean for the auto industry? Well let's put it this way. If you think electric vehicles are only masking the problem of climate change by not making any emissions post-production that's only the fault of the factories building them. Granted the EPA themselves state EVs have a smaller carbon footprint than the equivalentcar. But is it really small enough to make a difference?A great many automotive production facilities are still powered by fossil fuel-derived energy like coal and natural gas whether they build electric vehicles or not. There's even one tire factory in Turkey whose parent company Petlas Tyres owns a neighboring coal-fired power station. This power station is purported to cover some of the plant's operating costs.Though this is a somewhat rare and extreme case of the industry's dependency on dino juice it does serve as an interesting focal point to the problem at hand. The world is still cripplingly dependent on fossil fuels and nuclear fission is far too costly and politically polarizing to compensate on its own.But where fission evokes images in the mind's eye of meltdowns radiation sickness and entire cities laid to waste in fallout fusion is quite the opposite. A public image of basically limitless cheap energy with relatively few downsides permeates sci-fi culture. As does the potential for the next generation of nuclear-powered rocket engines . In short fusion rules and fission drools if you're not a nuclear engineer.Of course nuclear science is never that simple. Modern generation-III and III+ nuclear fission reactors are remarkably different and far safer than the RBMK Reactor which had a big boogaloo in Ukraine in April 1986. Apart from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster caused by an earthquake outside of anyone's control fission reactors in North America Europe Asia and the world over have had remarkable safety records since the events at Chornobyl (Chernobyl).This squeaky-clean accident record post-2011 has us thinking it's high time global politicians put the fear-mongering around nuclear energy to bed and devise a plan to implement the technology safely and for the benefit of every sector of society. That includes the automotive sector. No matter the type of vehicle built be it gas electric or magic the energy costs to build one vehicle are astronomical. We think the wombo-combo of fission and fusion nuclear energy has the potential to meet demand.One study published by the Conference on Manufacturing Systems in 2012 detailed how the energy consumption just to power all the welding robots in a modern car factory consumes as much as about 288 MJ per car (80/car). Another study by the Swiss science publication MDPI determined it took as much as 55000 MJ (megajoules) to produce a single car. For us petrolhead-minded that's the equivalent of roughly 475 gallons (1800 liters) of gasoline's worth of energy.With the National Ignition Facility's scientific breakeven netting an energy gain of 1.5 MJ it's tough to judge how soon this can be scaled to support vast swaths of energy infrastructure the auto industry included. This of course leads to the problem of how to plan this nuclear future in specific detail.At the present day the American National Energy Institute estimates 92 separate nuclear reactors are active across 28 states. The states of Illinois and Pennsylvania alone account for over 21 percent of that number with 20 reactors between them. It's difficult to say for certain how many of the 150-plus automotive production facilities in America rely on nuclear energy for at least a portion of their energy consumption.Whatever that figure turns out to be it's nowhere near enough in our opinion. That's why if you ask us the implementation of reliable nuclear fusion at some point in the near future will have effects so profound that the automotive sector would simply be another collateral effect of quick decisive change. Could the end result be an electrical grid that can charge your Tesla Rivian  or whatever you choose for next to nothing?If the full exploits of fusion energy are fully realized free EV charging would just be the tip of the iceberg. One can't help but think fusion power would do wonders for solving the microchip shortage once and for all. Of course we're still at least a short wait away from all of this taking place. But now that scientific breakeven is at hand you should start being a lot less pessimistic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2ZvcmQtYnJvbmNvLXNhc3F1YXRjaC1yZWFzb25zLXRvLWJ1eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Reasons Why You Should Consider Buying A Ford Bronco Sasquatch,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2ZvcmQtYnJvbmNvLXNhc3F1YXRjaC1yZWFzb25zLXRvLWJ1eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mb3JkLWUtc2VyaWVzLWY1OS12ZWhpY2xlcy1yZWNhbGxlZC1vdmVyLWZ1ZWwtbGVhay1pc3N1ZS_SAV9odHRwczovL2ZvcmRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvZm9yZC1lLXNlcmllcy1mNTktdmVoaWNsZXMtcmVjYWxsZWQtb3Zlci1mdWVsLWxlYWstaXNzdWUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford E-Series F59 Vehicles Recalled Over Fuel Leak Issue,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://fordauthority.com/2022/12/ford-e-series-f59-vehicles-recalled-over-fuel-leak-issue/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mb3JkLWUtc2VyaWVzLWY1OS12ZWhpY2xlcy1yZWNhbGxlZC1vdmVyLWZ1ZWwtbGVhay1pc3N1ZS_SAV9odHRwczovL2ZvcmRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvZm9yZC1lLXNlcmllcy1mNTktdmVoaWNsZXMtcmVjYWxsZWQtb3Zlci1mdWVsLWxlYWstaXNzdWUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

New York Attorney General Letitia James' massive fraud lawsuit against Trump is currently scheduled to go to trial in Manhattan in October 2023 — and Trump himself could end up personally testifying.

The lawsuit seeks to bar Trump and his family from doing business in New York State and alleges that the Trump Organization fraudulently exaggerated its worth by billions of dollars for years to obtain loans. Trump responded in turn by suing James alleging she abused her position of power by investigating him.

Experts previously told Insider's Laura Italiano to expect an ""eye-glazing"" slog of litigation before the scheduled trial in New York State Supreme Court next fall predicting that Trump's team will fight tooth and nail to delay the matter. That could include potential attempts to swap judges and heel-dragging over motions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1tb3N0LWhhdGVkLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hbWVyaWNhLTIzMDkyMTE4Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Most Hated Companies in America,"In this article we will be taking a look at the 15 most hated companies in America. To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.

In an ideal world companies would be supported by the general population. After all the economy of a country defines its standard of living and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all companies provide innovation ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?

Many corporations in the world and especially the bigger ones are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost. Even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more. This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders. Meanwhile employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid not to mention made to work in harsh conditions. Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so they are actually a detriment.

You might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company this is an important fact to consider. However Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier they often compromise on their beliefs.

Another reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.

Story continues

It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns data leaks and its influence on everyone but it still has 2 billion active monthly users and so is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business) public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).

Of course this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed or even increase it. According to PwC itself one of the largest firms in the world mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC it ""describes the stocks of knowledge skills experience health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships institutions shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus it will achieve success quickly. Of course this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.

Speaking of audit firms the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms while taking steps in some countries should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.

You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.

For our rankings of the most hated companies we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street TheStreet.com Bloomberg Business Insider and Fast Company giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America companies which need to work hard to regain public trust starting with number 15:

15. American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG)

American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG) with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.

14. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.

13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.

Number of times mentioned: 2

Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time growing massively over a short period of time. However hatred for Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.

11. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER)

Number of times mentioned: 2

The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.

10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.

9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.

Overall though we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.

8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)

Number of times mentioned: 2

One of the largest banking institutions in America Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes we know it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.

In 2018 Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.

7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)

Number of times mentioned: 2

BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world and in 2010 was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years but we don't think it is material anymore.

6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.

One of Impossible Kicks’ newly acquired sneakers - called the ""What The"" Air Jordan 1’s with just 17 pairs made to benefit a children’s hospital in Portland Oregon - now resale for a whopping $140000.

D.J. KHALED LISTS HIS MIAMI SNEAKER CLOSET ON AIRBNB FOR $11 A NIGHT

""We're the largest brick-and-mortar resale company in the country. We have 17 locations it's our first full year open we're to do more than $50 million in sales"" Mocadlo told FOX Business’ Lydia Hu on Monday. ""We were so excited to get this million-dollar collection. We're going to be able to bring it to all of our customers who can acquire these asset-class sneakers.""

Nike has successfully cornered the sneaker resale market with their brands making up the biggest share of all global retail sneaker sales at more than 27%. Air Jordan and Dunk Low styles have gained secular ""streetwear"" popularity reselling at both affordable and luxury price points.

Take the Nike Dunk Low Retro ""Black White Panda"" colorwave for example which can be bought at a reasonable $167 (MSRP $100). On the other hand high fashion collaborations such as the Dior x Air Jordan 1’s (MSRP $2200) or Off-White Dunk Lows (MSRP $170) can resale for more than $15000. Resale prices ultimately depend on desired shoe size and product line availability.

While some buyers choose to wear and show off their fresh - yet pricey - kicks others treat the new ""asset class"" like art to be displayed in an office or at home. The general rule of thumb is models with the fewest pairs produced tend to be most expensive according to Mocadlo.

""For example Nike couldn't get the licensing from Warner Brothers so [the Freddy Krueger Dunks] had to all be destroyed"" the Impossible Kicks CEO said. ""So there are some surviving pairs that were able to be existed and we actually have one of them.""

Leading resale platforms such as StockX and GOAT have achieved billion-dollar company valuations by serving as a sort of auction house for not only sneakers but a variety of asset-class fashion items including purses couture fashion electronics and even trading cards.

But Nike previously cried foul over these third-party resellers going so far as to sue StockX in New York federal court this past February for selling unauthorized images of Nike shoes as part of StockX’s non-fungible token (NFT) line. Nike said StockX's NFTs infringe its trademarks and are likely to confuse consumers. Its lawsuit asked for unspecified monetary damages and an order blocking their sales.

Some sneakerheads have criticized Nike for essentially gatekeeping the supply of its sneakers with small production quantities and selling the shoes at market prices exclusively through its lottery-based ""SNKRS"" app which Nike has admitted is infiltrated by bots.

In October Nike updated its terms and conditions on the app indicating its keeping a close eye on resellers and the use of bots. According to a Wall Street Journal report the sneaker giant’s new rules allow the company to cancel orders placed with automated ordering technology charge restocking fees and suspend accounts it determines are buying the products with the intent to resell.

Nike did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment regarding the company’s efforts to identify and prevent bots and resellers from purchasing apparel on Nike’s website and apps.

New York Attorney General Letitia James' massive fraud lawsuit against Trump is currently scheduled to go to trial in Manhattan in October 2023 — and Trump himself could end up personally testifying.

The lawsuit seeks to bar Trump and his family from doing business in New York State and alleges that the Trump Organization fraudulently exaggerated its worth by billions of dollars for years to obtain loans. Trump responded in turn by suing James alleging she abused her position of power by investigating him.

Experts previously told Insider's Laura Italiano to expect an ""eye-glazing"" slog of litigation before the scheduled trial in New York State Supreme Court next fall predicting that Trump's team will fight tooth and nail to delay the matter.

Tambang Freeport tak hanya menghasilkan emas semata. Foto/Dok

- Mendengar nama Freeport  yang pertama kali terlintas di pikiran adalah emas. Maklumlah tambang Freeport di Papua merupakan salah satu tambang emas terbesar di dunia.Diperkirakan cadangan emas Grasberg bagian dari Freeport mencapai 1062 juta ons. Jumlah itu lebih dari dua kali lipat cadangan emas di Siberia Rusia.Berdasarkan perhitungan pada 2012 tambang emas Olimpiada tambang di Siberia memiliki cadangan sebesar 475 juta ons. Hingga Desember 2019 MIND ID induk Freeport Indonesia mengungkap bahwa cadangan (proven+probable) untuk emas Freeport Indonesia secara keseluruhan 2908 juta troy ons.Sejatinya selain emas masih ada beberapa ""harta karun"" yang dihasilkan oleh Freeport. Bahkan ada mineral yang sebenarnya merupakan bahan tambang yang paling banyak dihasilkan oleh Freeport.Berikut tiga bahan tambang yang dihasilkan Freeport selain emas:1. TembagaPresiden Direktur Freeport Indonesia Tony Wenas pernah mengatakan bahwa mengatakan komoditas yang dihasilkan oleh Freeport dengan kandungan mineral utama adalah tembaga. Dari ore (bijih mentah) yang ditambang oleh Freeport tembaga merupakan mineral yang paling banyak didapatkan.Menurut Tony dari satu hasil tambang bijih atau ore di dalamnya terdapat kandungan 1% persen. Sementara emas hanya dapat diperoleh sekitar 1 gram dari hasil tambang ore sebanyak 1 ton. Jadi dalam 1 ton ore yang dihasilkan kandungan tembaganya sebanyak 10 kg.Mengutip laporan Freeport-McMoRan produksi tembaga Freeport Indonesia pada 2021 berhasil mencapai 134 miliar pon (670 ribu ton) dan menjadi produksi tertinggi sejak 2011. Dari tahun 2011 hingga 2021 tembaga yang sudah dikeduk Freeport mencapai 49 juta ton.2. PerakPerak merupakan salah satu bahan mineral hasil bumi. Perak merupakan logam transisi lunak berwarna putih dan mengkilap. Perak juga punya nilai jual yang ditinggi meski harganya di bawah emas.Perak juga memiliki beberapa manfaat. Yang utama adalah digunakan untuk bahan pokok keperluan industri. Perak memiliki konduktivitas terhadap listrik yang tinggi jadi digunakan dalam fabrikasi sirkuit listrik. Selain itu menjadi bahan utama pelapis uap dalam industri elektronik. Perak juga digunakan sebagai bahan baku uang logam.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcG9ub3JvZ28uaW5ld3MuaWQvcmVhZC8yMjk3OTQvdGVydW5na2FwLWFkYS1oYXJ0YS1rYXJ1bi10ZXJzZW1idW55aS1kaS1mcmVlcG9ydC1zZWxhaW4tZW1hc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Terungkap Ada Harta Karun Tersembunyi di Freeport Selain Emas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='ponorogo.inews.id', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /read/229794/terungkap-ada-harta-karun-tersembunyi-di-freeport-selain-emas (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225181510>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcG9ub3JvZ28uaW5ld3MuaWQvcmVhZC8yMjk3OTQvdGVydW5na2FwLWFkYS1oYXJ0YS1rYXJ1bi10ZXJzZW1idW55aS1kaS1mcmVlcG9ydC1zZWxhaW4tZW1hc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

I didn't pay much attention to it until recently but now that I have tried following the suggestions for over a month I can't say I regretted checking out this feature. It helped me get better at running and gave me a fresh perspective on effective training and recovery.

You can read more about the feature here: How do Garmin's Daily Workout Suggestions work? The feature was introduced in the Garmin Forerunner 745 and it's available in all the best Garmin watches including the Garmin Fenix 7X Garmin Enduro 2 Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar and more. You can get some of the same effects but without Garmin's algorithmic smarts with an app like Nike Run Club. A quick extract of my achievements with the full story below:

Down 2kg in bodyweight (approx. 4.4 lbs although I ate a bit better over that time)

Around 20 seconds taken off Park Run PB

Slowing down a bit suddenly made running 10km effortless - great for confidence.

Being told to run the day after a 3 am Gatwick start and 12 hours of drinking in Munich

Losing 1 point of VO2 Max on the same session that I beat the Parkrun PB (?)

Garmin Workouts seems to take things steadily working on gradual improvement

Down in the ruts

Running has stacks of benefits. It’s a competitive sport if you want. It brings structure to your day burns calories and has numerous mental health benefits. And maybe lets you see a bunch of dogs down at the local park. I’ve leaned heavily on all these running facets bar the competitive stuff over the last couple of years. However parts of this seemed to stop working in late 2022.

Do you know that aimless feeling of being in a rut? A couple of personal issues and the 4:30 pm sunsets had laid that feeling on pretty thick — that and more or less actually being in a rut — a few months ago. However running is still cheaper than a therapist so I tried a way to level up my running alongside a few other lifestyle changes to improve matters.

Free will is out the window

The plan was to throw my free will out of the window to reduce the chance of not going for a run. I would use my Garmin watch to tell me what to do each day run-wise. No excuses or backing out unless there was a legit reason to do so. All of Garmin’s higher-end watches have a feature called Suggested Workouts which offers a lightly structured session based on how ready it thinks you are for exertion. Despite having reviewed what feels like a dozen Garmin watches this year up until this point I completely ignored this feature.

Here’s how it works. When you go to start a tracked run on your watch your Garmin throws up a screen suggesting a time and pace. It could be a simple everyday run a set of intervals where you run fast for a few minutes a bunch of times interspersed with slow sections. Or you could be thrown a VO2 Max test designed to leave you more-or-less begging for the session to end.

In watches with Morning Report you’ll get a preview of what’s to come when you wake up. Morning Report is a series of screens that shows how you slept what the weather’s like and so on. My initial plan was to carry this on for a month. At the least I’d learn a bit more about how Garmin’s watches work. But I’m now six weeks into this experiment and it has completely changed how I think about running.

Running slow

The most obvious change the Garmin training programme made was to bring my pace way down for the average workout. Over the past few years I have mostly run roughly every other day generally at a “threshold” pace. You can think of this as the speed that leads to a high heart rate but one you can maintain for a reasonably long time. For everyday casual runs Garmin lowered my pace from around 5:05 per km to 5:55. I’d told myself the faster pace was my comfort zone. And sure I wouldn’t be left “feeling it” in my legs after a run the next day.

However I was fooling myself as slowing down suddenly made 10k runs feel like a doddle. In my old run style I’d rarely run the entire 5-7km of my average run without walking a bit — constantly reviewing phone cameras is a good excuse for slowing down to capture photos — but at Garmin’s pace the issue was more one of not speeding up too much. Going slower makes running easier: it seems ridiculous to say this but in practice going with Garmin’s recommendations was revelatory. Suggested workouts seem to work roughly on an 80:20 principle where only 20% of your exercise is particularly intense.

Getting overconfident

Within a week I was carrying on significantly longer after the workout had officially ended and envisioned beating my personal best Park Run (which is a 5k distance) time on the coming Saturday.

That didn't happen; I was already technically breaking my rules. As it turns out running slower for longer takes a bit of getting used to. Halfway through the first 5km Park Run after starting this program my quads were screaming and I ended up with a slower time than before I started this exercise. It's a reminder that a properly structured workout plan actually has some thought behind it.

And if you do what I did you're not going to see the best from Garmin's Suggested Workouts anyway. The system is smart enough that if you overdo a workout and run too fast or too long it will re-calibrate future workouts to compensate.

At one point I got into the habit of checking what was coming up next through the week to get in the right mental zone for any upcoming interval or VO2 Max session. However the interval workout pencilled ended up being replaced by a slow base run because I'd overdone it a bit yet again. This can get annoying but it makes sense. Garmin doesn't want to be blamed for causing injuries or bumping you into overtraining.

Slow and steady

However that doesn’t mean there aren’t some strange things to Garmin’s virtual coach. At one point I travelled to Munich for a birthday weekend spent in German beer halls. Flight times meant a 3 am start followed by more-or-less all-day drinking until past midnight.

The following day Garmin’s energy-rating Body Battery feature had me at 5 points out of a hundred. Its message was “go back to bed” but Suggested Workouts still had me go out for a 30-minute recovery run. Garmin Connect also suggests my exercise routine is highly imbalanced with an anaerobic shortage and a massive overrepresentation of “high” and “low” aerobic activity.

However it’s perhaps a reminder that some strength training — or other types of workouts — complements regular running. You’re just not going to get that with the exercise tunnel vision involved in this experiment. There is a sense of progress however. Suggested Workouts is gradually increasing the “acute load” of the routine the combined required effort if you like which plays out in the sessions becoming slightly longer.

What progress?

The progress I’ve seen or at least felt hasn’t had that much to do with how Garmin’s numbers are gradually ticking upwards. Eventually I did manage to beat my Park Run personal best by around 20 seconds. Over the first month I lost about 2kg in weight although another part of this whole motivation drive was an effort to do more batch cooking( and less pizza eating).

And to cap off six weeks with Garmin’s Suggested Workouts I got a bit bold with my final sessions before writing this piece up. My Garmin Enduro 2 suggested a long run the first time it has given me a workout session longer than an hour.

Despite -2 degree centigrade weather I was feeling good after the hour and five minutes Garmin suggested so I kept going to see how far I could comfortably go. And by the time I hit 15km the half-marathon distance was too tempting not to go for.

I eventually called it a day at 23km and even then the only discomfort was thigh rubbing — admittedly pretty uncomfortable stuff. Before this experiment I had never run anything longer than 10km at a time and had only tried that a handful of times over the last couple of years. As it turns out a little structure and thought can make a big difference to an exercise routine.

Has it got me out of the rut I mentioned at the start of this article? Not really. Running helps but isn’t a solution in itself. However there’s a real sense of empowerment in finding a little shift in perspective that can make you realise you can do things you never thought you could.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvdGhpcy15ZWFycy1nYXJtaW4tcnVubmluZy13YXRjaC1yZWxlYXNlcy1yYW5rZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This year's Garmin running watch releases ranked,"It’d be fair to say that Garmin had a great year. The outdoor sports and GPS experts have launched new iterations of its cycling computers fitness trackers exercise bikes and loads more. However it’s the best Garmin watch releases of this year that we’re primarily interested in.

The best part is that each of them is well worth a look with the range running across all price points and feature sets to offer something for everyone all without compromising on quality.

We’ve put together our list below which ranks the top Garmin Watch releases in 2022 not including separate tactical music and solar editions. While our top watch is the Garmin Forerunner 955 and one we prefer over its siblings there’s something for everyone in this list whether you’re a casual runner or cyclist or you’re smashing marathons out of the park. Here are the top Garmin watches of 2022.

1. Garmin Forerunner 955

(Image credit: Matt Evans)

The Garmin Forerunner 955 gets the top spot for us because it’s just a very good all-rounder – although you’d expect that at this price. It takes everything you’d expect from a top-quality fitness tracker like a new Training Readiness score to add to Garmin’s existing Body battery functionality and 20-day battery life but adds in a series of smartwatch-adjacent features too.

That means it has onboard storage for your favorite playlists while its GPS is more accurate than many comparable devices we’ve tested. If you’re a keen runner it adds a whole host of complex data to sift through and while that may be overkill for many it’s also packing an impressive full-color map on your wrist to help you get home safely too. A morning report provides information about the weather your sleep and training readiness along with suggested workout intensities so you know how hard to hit the road. Truly a near-perfect running companion.

2. Garmin Venu Sq 2

(Image credit: Garmin)

Clocking in at around half the price of the Garmin Forerunner 955 the Venu Sq 2 is much more appropriate for more casual runners. If we had a “most improved” award we’d give it to the Venu Sq 2 on this list.

That’s because there isn’t an aspect that hasn’t been advanced from its predecessor the original Garmin Venu Sq – it has an AMOLED screen now which is much easier to read. It has an overhauled user interface that adds improved widgets. It’s even got double the battery life of its older brother with up to 11 hours of use on a single charge.

It doesn’t quite offer the sheer depth of data as the aforementioned Forerunner 955 but it’s still a very solid option for more budget-conscious fitness enthusiasts that may want to get to grips with basic training.

Garmin Instinct 2

(Image credit: Future)

A rugged watch for under $250 / £259 / AU$549 is a surefire way to get into the hearts of many and that’s exactly what the Garmin Instinct 2 offers. It’s not going to win a lot of awards for its design because it’s still fairly chunky (although not as big as its predecessor) but with two sizes now (45mm or 40mm) it’s a much more solid choice for those who have smaller wrists.

For that impressive price it offers excellent tracking across multiple activities be that running cycling swimming or plenty more and again operates in the gray area between smartwatch and fitness tracker even offering its own app store in the form of Garmin Connect IQ.

Honestly the Instinct 2 would be very close to the top of this list if it wasn’t still packing a monochrome (black and white) display but with near limitless battery life on the solar battery model and with impressive training advice on when to rest and when to push yourself harder it’s a great rugged outdoor companion.

4. Garmin Instinct Crossover

(Image credit: Matt Evans)

The newest tracker on this list takes much of what we love about the Instinct 2 and mixes it up with some small but noticeable tweaks.

Much of the chassis is the same as the Instinct 2 so don’t expect a drastically better-looking watch but at least the ruggedness remains intact. The change here is the addition of analog watch hands and all of the small composite UI elements behind the hands have been brought into the same design which makes it feel a little more compact without losing the ease of reading. In fact the small second display has been removed entirely and it looks cleaner in our opinion.

If you want a more modern-looking Instinct 2 it’s well worth a look and if you’re looking for analog watch hands it’s an easy pickup.

5. Garmin Enduro 2

(Image credit: Matt Evans)

The biggest most expensive Garmin Watch released in 2022 will be top of the tree for a very specific group of users and for good reason – it’s the best of everything Garmin does wrapped in a heavy big smartwatch.

That comes at a cost naturally but if you’re out for the best of the best the Garmin Enduro 2 is just that. It’s a good-looking smartwatch that can take some punishment has 32GB of onboard storage for music and apps and has a staggering 150-hour battery life with GPS. It also offers Garmin’s excellent topographical maps as well as route guidance to help keep you heading in the right direction – while also acting as a breadcrumb trail to help you get back. Lost after dark? There’s even a very bright flashlight.

It’s likely to be a bit large for many though and too pricey for others so it settles at the fifth spot on our list. But if you're a serious endurance athlete go ahead and bump this specialist performance tool right to the top.

6. Garmin Forerunner 255

(Image credit: Future)

Our final model is the Garmin Forerunner 255 which comes in lower thanks to its price being somewhere between the Forerunner 955 and the Venu Sq 2 making it a bit of a halfway house.

While it lacks the Training Readiness score found on the 955 (and many others on this list) it’s a great mid-price running watch that’s chock full of clever tech and offers a color screen. It features a range of workout modes but feels ideal for a running watch thanks to its slim design excellent GPS tracking and the fact it’s comfortable enough to be worn 24 hours a day. In fact on standby it offers a week of battery life.

Music fans can even opt for the Forerunner 255S Music variant which adds additional storage for your favorite workout tracks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcmVhYmxlLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9wb2xhci1pZ25pdGUtMy1yZXZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Polar Ignite 3 review,"Polar Ignite 3 By Polar The Polar Ignite 3 could be a top sports watch gem in design and smarts. Sadly though the laggy software some familiar performance problems and durability issues overshadow its achievements. Then there’s the price too. It’s more expensive than the Ignite 2 and when you consider you can pick up a Venu 2 for less and get a lot of the same core features with better smoother software it’s tough to recommend the Ignite 3 over it right now. Hit Sleek design with crisp display

Welcome interface redesign

Good array of tracking and analysis Miss Notable performance issues

Battery life is poor with always-on display

Screen has already been scratched

When Polar launched the Ignite in 2019 it felt like more accessible sports watch with a big dose of fun.

It boasted some of Polar’s best features but with a design best described as more lifestyle and less sporty.

The Ignite 2 landed in 2021 and didn’t make wholesale changes but with the Ignite 3 there are some big ones. Some we weren’t expecting to see on this particular Polar watch.

Those new features put the Ignite 3 into a new price bracket. The bigger price tag puts it up against the Garmin Venu 2 and you could even throw the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) into the mix here too.

The Ignite 2 felt like a step in the right direction for Polar’s fitness watch so has the Ignite 3 built on that good work? Here’s our verdict on the Polar Ignite 3.

> Best running and sports watches from our reviews

squirrel_12861174



Screen and display

Wareable

Let’s get straight into it. The big story here with the Ignite 3 is that it has an AMOLED touchscreen display which as far as we can recall is the first Polar watch to include the same kind of display technology typically reserved for smartwatches.

Garmin does include AMOLED screens on its Venu and Epix series watches but this is new ground for Polar and it's very much welcomed.

The Ignite 2 featured a color TFT touchscreen display but the Ignite 3’s roughly same-sized screen marks a step up in rich colors lovely deep rich blacks you like to see on an AMOLED panel and it’s bright too.

Polar lets you pick from three backlight brightness settings and you will want to use the brightest option in brighter outdoor sunlight.

This is typically a downside of this screen technology compared to the memory in pixel screens included on Polar’s Vantage V2 and Grit X Pro watches. We used the Ignite 3 at night and in sunnier conditions and it handled those more challenging visibility conditions well.

Wareable

The look of the display is also a big positive with its gently curved exterior a nice upgrade on the flatter screen included on the Ignite 2.

There’s still a black bezel surrounding that display but there’s less of it particularly at the bottom of the screen and Polar’s small handful of watch faces do an effective job of hiding what bezel there is here.

Wareable

Polar also adds Gorilla Glass 3.0 to provide stronger protection against scratches. Sadly it doesn’t look to be up to the task based on the long scratch that’s already appeared across the screen on our Ignite 3.

We’ve had it on our wrist 24/7 in the gym and for outdoor workouts and worn it in bed. That’s far from rigorous usage and we can’t put our finger on how this damage has materialized.

So for all the positives that Polar has finally put a great screen on one of its watches to make it feel more like a slick sporty smartwatch we can't ignore the nasty big scratch it's managed to acquire during our testing.

Performance struggles

Wareable

Polar’s watches that launched in 2021 had performance problems and that included the Ignite 2. Whatever Polar was packing its watches with components-wise it simply wasn’t delivering the kind of smooth software interactions that you’d hoped to find.

Like the Polar Pacer Pro the Ignite 3 promises to address those laggy concerns by beefing up processing power moving from a 120MHz CPU speed setup to a quicker 192 MHz one compared to what was packed into the Ignite 2. It’s bumped things up in the memory department as well going from 0.64MB to 5MB of RAM.

So do those upgrade internals make a marked difference? Sadly we'd say no. We’ve still experienced some pretty irritating lag swiping to look at our notification stream. The software’s response when pressing the physical button which now sits more centrally on the case is slow as well. It can also be slow to save workouts and we've had the watch randomly reboot on us on at least one occasion.

There are elements like swiping through widgets which feel relatively smooth so there’s a clear inconsistency with how smooth those interactions are.

In isolation it might not seem like a big problem but collectively it makes the Ignite 3 frustrating to get on with.

Improved UI

Wareable

Those performance problems are a shame because the work Polar has done to refine Ignite’s interface feels like a step in the right direction. It's still not perfect but it's better.

You’ve now got an interface that better fills the screen with vibrant watch faces to you can now add complications. Full-screen widgets for features like activity tracking Polar’s FitSpark suggested workouts weekly stats and the weather feel much nicer to glance at.

Wareable

Polar still doesn’t go all in on smartwatch features as Garmin does but you can view phone notifications and quickly identify which apps they’ve come from. The music controls feel well optimized to that screen and do work with third-party music apps like Spotify as well as being accessible during workout tracking.

You don’t get payments apps onboard safety features smart assistants and a fair bit more but by keeping things simple Polar delivers staples that most will be happy to find here. The music controls seem less affected by the performance problems than the notification support is so it’s a simple but imbalanced experience.

Dual-frequency GPS debuts

Wareable

We thought Polar would join the dual-frequency GPS party at some point but didn’t expect the Ignite 3 to be the first beneficiary of a mode that’s appeared on watches from Apple Garmin Coros Huawei and Amazfit.

The application of the technology designed to improve outdoor tracking accuracy in problematic scenarios like tracking near tall buildings in tall wooded areas or bad weather has certainly offered mixed results so far. We'd say its presence on Apple Garmin and Amazfit's watches have been the standout examples of its benefits to improve that accuracy.

On the Ignite 3 our feelings are that we hope it will get better when Polar decides to put it on one of its watches where it makes more sense.

Wareable

While core data for outdoor runs like distance tracked and average pace held up pretty well against Garmin’s multi-band mode on the Marq Athlete Gen 2 a closer inspection of the GPS tracks suggests those plotted routes weren’t quite on the money. Garmin’s multi-band mode wasn’t perfect either but it’s quite clear the points where Polar struggles.

Wareable

Wareable

Outside of those added dual-frequency GPS skills the Ignite 3 feels very similar to using the Ignite 2. You’ve got similar sports modes and there’s the same Precision Prime optical heart rate monitor which offers a mixed bag of data.

Wareable

On some steady-paced workouts it performed well against the heart rate monitor chest strap as the data screens from a treadmill run show above.

There were also similar workouts that delivered very different data. The outdoor run below illustrates where we saw strangely high maximum and average heart rate readings compared to Garmin’s HRM-Pro Plus heart rate monitor chest strap.

Wareable

Fortunately like the Ignite 2 you can pair it up with an external heart rate monitor to improve that accuracy and you'll want to do that if you want more consistent data.

There’s a new voice guidance mode which is a simple way of saying you can hear your metrics being read out to you during and after a workout.

Polar has now added a back-to-start mode for some basic navigation support and its running performance and walking tests cut to offer additional ways to gauge your current level of fitness. Again though that walking test requires walking at a pretty slow pace to use it and is very much aimed at people entirely new to getting more active.

Polar includes its Training Load Pro and Energy Sources insights but stops short of its Recovery Pro and Running Index metrics which are reserved for its more expensive watches. One odd inclusion here is Polar’s FuelWise fuelling recommendations which felt like a good fit on its more performance-focused watches but less so on a watch aiming at people who are probably not thinking about tackling an ultra marathon.

Sleep tracking powers

Wareable

Polar’s sleep tracking has impressed since it started to pay more attention to it and offers a level of accuracy that can help inform your training and recovery needs.

Along with offering very reliable core sleep stats it introduced its nightly recharge measurements which still needs to deliver those recharge insights more engagingly.

Those core sleep-tracking features seem okay on the whole. We wore it alongside the Oura Ring 3 and they generally tracked similar sleep duration and times we fell asleep. Looking at the sleep stages and the Ignite 3 tended to record much smaller amounts of deep sleep in comparison.

Wareable

Along with breaking down sleep stages including REM capturing sleep duration time sleep scores and additional metrics like sleep solidity Polar is now adding what it calls SleepWise. This is essentially a way of communicating how sleep and your sleep rhythm contribute to alertness and readiness for the day. This is something we’ve seen in slightly different forms from the likes of Garmin Whoop and Oura.

Wareable

Polar’s approach is to ensure you’ve captured at least five nights’ sleep within the last seven days to get these SleepWise forecasts which take the form of graphs in the Polar companion app to show your boosted levels of sleep. These are represented by different green blocks in the sleep insights section of the app. Lighter green blocks indicate a big energy boost and darker green blocks mean smaller energy boosts.

There’s also a Sleep gate which requires sleep data from seven nights of sleep and aims to tell you when you should go to bed based on your other data. Again this isn’t a new feature to watches and wearables like Whoop.

If that explanation of how SleepWise sounds clunky well its presentation on the Ignite 3 and the Polar Flow companion app mirrors that clunkiness. Like Polar’s nightly recharge measurements it needs to be packaged on the watch which makes the information more useful and actionable and makes you more likely to pay attention to it. That just didn't feel like the case for us and the presentation of that additional data feels overwhelming.

Polar can churn out a lot of potentially useful data here but it needs to work on how it communicates that data.

Battery wins and losses

Wareable

Polar has a bit of a battery problem. Not with the level of the battery it offers but the way that battery can drain and when it drains.

The Ignite 3 promises and delivers the same 5 days of battery life as the Ignite 2 when you’re just using it day-to-day checking the time and notifications and counting your steps. Add an AMOLED into the mix and turn that screen on 24/7 and that battery number drops hugely. That 5 days goes to just over 1 day and you can see that drain within minutes of enabling the always-on mode.

There’s still an issue with the battery drain at night as well. Whatever Polar is tracking during sleep is demanding big loads of the battery and we found drop-off overnight could be anywhere from 8-10%. Polar needs to offer the option to restrict or be more selective about those richer sleep features.

Things are a little more promising in tracking mode where GPS battery life has gone from 20 hours up to 30 hours. It also has the same 100-hour battery in Polar’s power saving mode where heart rate monitoring is disabled and you lower the GPS recording rate.

We’d say those GPS battery claims are a little optimistic or do not apply to the most accurate GPS tracking option you have available here. An hour of outdoor running saw the battery drop by 5%. That doesn’t equate to 30 hours. This was a similar story on the Ignite 2 but it seems at least that battery drop-off during tracking isn't quite as severe.

Another annoying trait Polar has decided to keep around is essentially stopping you from tracking a workout when the battery hits a certain point. Our Ignite 3 dropped just below the 10% mark which initiated a prompt to tell us to charge before we think about tracking again.",,,,,,

(WMBF/Gray News) - A South Carolina boy battling a rare form of brain cancer has died.

Jonah Burton 8 passed away Saturday according to statements from his family.

“Jonah has gained his angel wings” a statement on a Facebook page dedicated to the boy’s cancer fight said. “He has become one of our many guardian angels.”

WMBF shared Jonah’s story earlier this month. He was a year-and-a-half old when his cancer battle started.

The family said the form of cancer Jonah was battling was so rare that not much was known about it. They said doctors told them that it is a form of cancer that grows fast which made it extremely difficult to treat. It also caused vision and hearing loss.

“It’s an HGNET with a BCOR mutation and was discovered in May 2016 and he was diagnosed in October” said Shane Burton Jonah’s father.

Doctors reportedly told the family in October that Jonah wasn’t expected to make it to his eighth birthday which was on Dec. 21.

WMBF also covered a special birthday celebration for Jonah where members of the community and first responders honored him and his family swearing him in as an honorary firefighter.

Jonah was also previously honored by the Horry County Police Department for his fight and was named an honorary junior police officer.

To change it in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually).

If you have an Amazon Tap Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa.

There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word if you enable it. When you do Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say ""Stop.""

Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like ""Alexa play folk music at volume six"" or ""Alexa add bread milk and eggs to my shopping list.""

Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen the living room or anywhere for that matter. Amazon

Other places you can access Alexa

While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant.

In fact there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have:

The Alexa app on iOS Android

The Amazon Shopping app

The Amazon Music app

Cortana on a Windows computer

You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will however disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. ""Hey Siri"" or ""Hey Google"" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant.

On an updated Windows computer you can summon Cortana and say ""Open Alexa."" After the initial connection is made saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana.

Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors for example).

The complete list of Alexa commands

The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect but it's pretty great at understanding natural language so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted.

When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com.

Words like “social distancing” “Zoom happy hours” “hybrid work” and “drive-by birthday celebrations” entered our lexicons as we attempted to grapple with slowing the spread of the virus.

Though life has returned to a more normal version of normal in 2022 the imprint of COVID-19 is still felt in the way we consume media. A report from Visual Capitalist an online publisher that seeks to make information more accessible broke down the shifts by generation based on a survey of more than 2000 people conducted at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the participants (2337 out of 2014) completed a follow-up survey in December 2020.

In the original survey almost half of Baby boomers (42%) were watching broadcast news with most other sources attracting 15% or less each (the one exception to this was online TV/streaming which 21% of respondents reported they consumed).

Recommended Videos

Gen-Z’s consumption of digital media spiked in the early days of the pandemic. As the world moved (and school which most Gen-Z participants likely attended) online people in this demographic watched more online played more video games and streamed TV and films. Podcasts were also huge with nearly 11% of Gen-Z-ers listening to them in April 2020. By December 2020 perhaps looking to diversify their consumption 25.8% of Gen-Z respondents said they were listening to podcasts.

Meanwhile only 17% of them were watching broadcast news in December 2020 down from 24% in April of that year.

Millennials also turned to digital media. However the people with Visual Capitalist noticed a trend in news consumption — it went down across the board. Broadcast TV fell 11.1 points from 35.7% in April 2020 to 24.6% in December 2020. Physical press consumption went from 20.3% to 8% — a difference of 12.3 points. Online TV and streaming tumbled from 42.2% to 39.2%. Hey maybe there decided to practice self-care by not doom-scrolling.

What did millennials do while they weren’t consuming news or streaming movies? It appears they listened to podcasts (increased from 20.9% to 29.6%).

Gen X had similar consumption habits to their millennial counterparts with broadcast TV viewing falling 16.6% and online TV/streaming films going down 10.9%.

Keep in mind both of these cohorts make up the majority of the workforce. As some states and businesses started pulling employees back to work these generations may have had less time to consume media.

Baby boomers’ use of broadcast TV saw smaller declines (42.3% to 36.7%).

When Americans were searching for news different generations considered different outlets as “trustworthy” sources for COVID-19 information.

Fewer than 30% (28.9%) of Gen-Z respondents said they found mainstream news stations like CNN trustworthy. Gen X was more amenable to mainstream media — 40.1% said it was reliable.

Gen Z preferred to look at the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website and publications. More than half (50.3%) of Gen Z considered the WHO the most trustworthy source compared to just 39% of Gen X followers.

As for the lasting effects of the pandemic nearly 30% of Baby boomers said they’d continue to watch broadcast TV. Meanwhile it didn’t even make the top three responses for Gen Z (online videos video games and online TV/streaming films did) or millennials (Online videos online TV/streaming films and music streaming did).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vcGV0YXBpeGVsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L3BpY3NhcnQtbGF1bmNoZXMtYWktc2VsZmllLWdlbmVyYXRvci1hbGxvd2luZy11c2Vycy10by1jcmVhdGUtdW5pcXVlLWF2YXRhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Picsart Launches AI Selfie Generator Allowing Users to Create Unique Avatars,"Picsart has announced a new AI selfie generator allowing users to create personalized avatars of themselves.

Called AI Avatar the new tool allows users to generate self-portraits that look like they were created by a digital artist. The avatars can be purchased in packs of 50 100 and 200 which cost $3.99 $4.99 and $6.99 respectively.

Artificially intelligent (AI) image generators have seen a surge in popularity in recent months with AI photo editing apps dominating the app store charts earlier this month.

Picsart’s offering is based on the Stable Diffusion software which uses advanced machine learning algorithms to turn users’ photos into “unique artistic portraits.”

It says: “Simply upload several selfies into the app and the technology will generate a selection of avatars that resemble you in a variety of different artistic styles including: Holiday Cheer Superhero Anime and Main Character Energy. Whether users want to create a more impressionist cartoonish or more realistic avatar the feature has them covered.”

Users will also be able to customize their avatars using the app’s editing tool enabling users to “take their digital creations to the next level to stand out online.”

Picsart says: “With endless options like superimposing avatars on new backgrounds changing up colors and adding illustrations text and more users can create self-portraits that truly reflect their personal style and make their creative visions come to life. Avatars can then be used in many different contexts such as profile pictures for social media personalized stickers and emojis and more.”

Picsart Chief Product Officer Mikayel Vardanaya says the pace of AI image technology development is staggering.

“The ability for AI to create completely new portraits of a person in minutes was unheard of a year ago” he says.

“Generative AI will only get better with time and features like AI Avatar showcase the magic of this technology and provide our users with more opportunity to express their creativity and individuality.”

Just last month Picsart announced its text-to-image generator that lives inside of its extremely popular mobile photo editing app and allows users to create an unlimited number of images based on text descriptions for free.

Can I make them stop simply because the music is terrible? If not can I make them stop on the same religious-freedom grounds that make it illegal for them to have mandatory Christian prayers? —Miserable Under Mistletoe

I feel a little guilty Miserable since (as you know) you sent this message over a year ago. By now you’ve probably killed your boss torched the shop and gone on a six-state murder spree so you don’t care anymore. But for the benefit of others in the same predicament I’ll furnish the answer to these (and many other) questions: You’re screwed.

You may be surprised to learn you’re far from the first person to notice that Christmas’ (nominally) denominational aspect might present a problem for the HR department. This is why a quick Google search for “nonreligious Christmas carols” will turn up reams of playlists specifically designed to help employers fend off objections from the likes of you.

For example your boss is on rock-solid ground with that genre of holiday carols that focus on the season rather than the holiday itself: There’s zero religious content to be found in frost-rimmed classics like “Winter Wonderland” “Sleigh Ride” “Let It Snow” and even “Jingle Bells.” (Also “Baby It’s Cold Outside” assuming you don’t consider sexual assault a religious practice.)

“Sure” I hear you saying “but how many carols don’t mention Christmas at all? Maybe a dozen?” To that I would reply that if you think an employer can’t make a monthslong playlist out of a dozen (or fewer) songs you’ve never worked retail. But it doesn’t matter anyway because hundreds of songs that do mention Christmas are effectively secular because they treat it as a generic celebration devoid of content. Good luck convincing a jury you feel religiously oppressed by “I’ll Be Home for Christmas”—it could just as easily be “I’ll Be Home for Taco Night.”

In any case the U.S. Supreme Court has held (in a case I’m going to call Grinch v. Nordstrom) that even overtly religious music is perfectly legal for private employers to play if they want to. “Perfectly legal” is not the same as “no one’s going to complain” and many retailers probably nix “Away in a Manger” in favor of “Silver Bells” just to play it safe. Your legal options are nil either way so you might as well get used to it. Look on the bright side; at least it’s been a while since we heard “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.”

The 1980s were a golden age for breakfast cereal with manufacturers jazzing up the marketing and bringing daring new ingredients to the fore. The two big movements in this sector were the opposite of one another — the '80s saw a glut of heavily-sweetened sugary cereals despite most brands trying to drop or avoid the use of the word ""sugar"" in their names (via MeTV) to avoid criticism. It was also a time when consumers were extremely interested in diet foods (according to Bon Appétit); the decade saw a boom in processed packaged foods marketing themselves as ""healthy."" Regardless the '80s were a rich era for the consumer economy and advertising alike but with the proliferation of children's television and the popularity of Saturday morning cartoons cereal became less of a food and more of a pop culture medium with TV shows toys and movies generating tie-in breakfast foods.

Many wonderful and memorable cereals were launched in the 1980s. While several were definitely products of their time a few hung around to become all-time favorites.

Peel Compton Foundation backers celebrated the holiday early at the annual Christmas at Peel Museum on Dec. 2 in Bentonville.

Javier Zavala Foundation Board member shared with those gathered a snapshot of the past year at the 32-year-old nonprofit organization.

""As many of you know the Peel Compton Foundation provides four community spaces in Bentonville: Peel Museum & Botanical Garden Compton Gardens & Arboretum Coler Mountain Bike Preserve and Osage Park. These amazing spaces encompass nearly 400 acres right here in our hometown one in which we are enjoying this evening.""

Zavala said that in the past year:

• Peel Museum welcomed 8300 guests plus more than 1100 4th graders explored Arkansas history at the annual School Days program.

• Compton Garden's annual Native Tree and Plant Sales got over 7000 native plants back into our community to support our Arkansas ecosystem.

• Coler Mountain Bike Preserve's trail counters have tracked more than 895000 trail uses this year.

• At Osage Park 550 hours have been spent on invasive plant removal and 450000 native plant seeds have been spread.

• We welcomed more than 5600 educational program participants across all four spaces which is more than double that number last year.

Also in the past year:

• We welcomed more than 400 members for archery at The Quiver Archery Range at Osage Park many trying the sport for the first time!

• We doubled the size of our pickleball courts at Osage Park to be the first park with eight dedicated courts.

• We opened The Rise the first exercise stairs in the region at Coler.

Demand has boosted prices for the crops which include field peas oats and canola grown in Minnesota North Dakota and South Dakota on varying numbers of acres.

Paul and Diane Overby operate Lee Farms near Wolford North Dakota where they farm 1300 acres that include those three crops and sunflowers flax hard red spring wheat and soybeans. Instead of planting large fields of two or three different crops they produce seven or eight grain and row crops.

The Overbys produce the crops on fields that average 70 acres which is at least half the size of the fields on which many farmers raise conventional crops such as corn. The smaller fields are necessary because the couple produces more than half a dozen crops on their 1300 acres of tillable land.

Over the years the Overbys have tried a variety of crops. A few like faba beans they no longer grow but most have become permanent parts of their rotations.

“We’ve dabbled in a lot of things as contracts become available” Paul Overby said.

As consumers’ demand for certain foods has increased food companies have taken steps to ensure they meet the growing demand by contracting with farmers for acreage Overby said.

Future of Food No matter what separates us we all have at least one thing in common — we all eat.

Agweek and our partners at Forum Communications Company are thinking about the Future of Food. This reporting series looks at the techniques and technologies that are advancing agriculture and the science around our foods and food production.









“The companies are saying 'I want healthy food'"" Overby said.

North Dakota especially has several small processing plants that buy and process specialty crops.

“You go back 15 20 years there wasn’t a lot of that going on. Now the food industry is getting better at handling segregation” he said.

In December 2022 the Overbys already have contracted about half of their total acreage of field peas canola oats sunflowers and flax for 2023.

Contracting the acreage reduces the Overbys price risk. They know their price going into the growing season and don't have to be at the mercy of the cash market which can wildly fluctuate.

The Overbys contract about 200 acres of Nexera canola a high-oleic variety with Bunge in Altona Manitoba. Contract prices for the 2023 crop are from $2 to $3.50 per hundredweight higher than the market price depending on the delivery month Overby said.

The Overbys contracted for March 2024 delivery which will be $3.50 over the market price. The cash Nexera canola prices were $30.83 per hundredweight in mid-December. The Overbys expected to begin locking in their price within the next month. They will price more of their 2023 crop as the year progresses.

Lee Farms also raises oats which they contract with General Mills and high-protein yellow field peas which they contract with ADM.

Pea protein potential

Yellow field peas have potential to become a hot commodity in the specialty crops world.

PIP International an agricultural technology company in Alberta has developed a new method of extraction of pea protein which CEO Christine Lewington believes will revolutionize plant-based proteins and result in more opportunities for farmers to market their yellow pea crop.

The company’s protein extraction process which is significantly different from other protein extraction processes that other companies use comes from the pharmaceutical industry Lewington said. Her company used technology from the pharmaceutical industry applied a “twist” on it and built its own equipment to extract the pea protein.

PIP International which plans to contract for acreage with farmers in Saskatchewan and western North Dakota has a $20 million pilot pea processing plant in Lethbridge Alberta which was in part funded by a $1 million grant from the Alberta government. PIP International plans to begin construction on a $150 million processing plant in the next few months.

The company has the ability to expand to process 126000 metric tons of yellow peas per year which would be the highest capacity of any facility in the world.

The company’s unique process has caught the eye of 39 private food companies that are negotiating with PIP International for use of its product the company said.

The company’s process to extract the protein results in a product that has a “good clean taste” that is unlike any other pea proteins which aren't always palatable Lewington said.

“They smell bad. They taste bad. They look bad” she said.

The pea protein will be highly functional for use across all sectors including beverages Lewington said.

“For farmers I can now give them a long-term contract to grow my peas” she said.

PIP International is in the process of negotiating contracts which are well above the market price of $10.50 per bushel in Canadian currency with North Dakota farmers.

Raising niche crops has potential to provide opportunities for small farmers to stay viable Overby said.

He also believes it could provide young people who want to grow their crops sustainably and connect with consumers a less costly way to get into farming.

""The opportunities are better now than I’ve seen in my 30 years of farming and I hope they continue in North Dakota” Overby said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8va2V6ai5jb20vdHdpbi1mYWxscy1yZXN0YXVyYW50cy1vcGVuLW9uLWNocmlzdG1hcy1kYXktMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Twin Falls Restaurants Open On Christmas Day,"It is unfortunate that not everyone gets to be home with family on Christmas Day.

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2lzLWZvcmRzLTI3LWJpbGxpb24tbWlzdGFrZS1hLXdhcm5pbmctZm9yLWdlbmVyYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Ford's $2.7 Billion Mistake a Warning for General Motors?,"Ford's big venture into autonomous vehicles cost it a whopping $2.7 billion write-off. GM isn't showing any signs of slowing its pursuits.

Over the past few years unmistakable buzz has surrounded autonomous vehicle technology as start-ups and major manufacturers are both battling to be king of a new frontier.

However with Ford Motor Company's (F -1.15%) shift away from trying to develop fully autonomous driving technology via Argo AI -- and the accompanying $2.7 billion impairment -- investors might be wondering if driving toward fully autonomous vehicles is a mistake and whether General Motors (GM -0.33%) will soon be admitting what Ford did.

Ford: The payoff will take longer than anticipated

Argo AI was a self-driving vehicle technology start-up with Ford and Volkswagen Group as the main backers. Long story short it was unable to attract new investors and announced in the fall that it would shut down operations.

That decision cost Ford a whopping $2.7 billion in a noncash pre-tax impairment on its large investment in Argo and largely led to the automaker's $827 million net loss during the third quarter.

Perhaps more telling for Ford investors and more concerning for broader automotive investors was the company's admission that bringing Level 4 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to the market profitably isn't close to feasible right now.

""We're optimistic about a future for L4 ADAS but profitable fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off and we won't necessarily have to create that technology ourselves"" said President and CEO Jim Farley in a press release.

Ford switched gears and decided the better opportunity for its investors would be to focus on Level 2 and Level 3 systems which do not totally cut out a human driver. Management believes that strategy could better serve customers by providing services options and thus profitability in the near term.

What about Ford's crosstown rival?

Ford's moves with Argo AI mark a rare divergence between it and rival General Motors which has received much admiration for Cruise its autonomous technology subsidiary into which it put $2.1 billion this year to up its stake from 60% to 80%.

It's a fair question for investors to ask if General Motors is throwing capital into a money pit and not cutting its losses on technology that is far out from scale and profitability. So far GM is adamant it's not making a mistake and believes Cruise is making operational progress.

Cruise is expanding into two new markets Austin and Phoenix with its San Francisco operations continuing to grow. Management believes Cruise will generate revenue of $1 billion by 2025 but that's dependent on safety and regulatory approvals.

Investors won't have to wait long to see if that $1 billion figure is hit by mid-decade and as they see how the dollars start to add up they'll have better insight into whether Cruise's $50 billion annual revenue target by 2030 makes sense.

Fork in the road

If GM succeeds and hits its targets with Cruise revenue by the end of this decade it will be one of the most massive victories by an automaker this century. And investors will be well rewarded for this success.

If it turns out GM is replicating Ford's mistakes and throwing money into a buzzword that's far from helping the company's bottom line investors will have plenty to complain about.

It's impossible to know how this will turn out and investors choosing between Ford and General Motors need to figure out their stance on autonomous vehicle development as it represents a rare major difference in strategy between the two.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2NoZXZ5LWNyYXRlLWVuZ2luZS1jb3BvLWNhbWFyby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 10.4-Liter Chevy Crate Engine In The COPO Camaro Is Simply Insane,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2NoZXZ5LWNyYXRlLWVuZ2luZS1jb3BvLWNhbWFyby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8xMi9nbS1idWlsdC1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNDAwMDAtc3VwZXItY3J1aXNlLWVxdWlwcGVkLXZlaGljbGVzLXNvLWZhci_SAWhodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMTIvZ20tYnVpbHQtbW9yZS10aGFuLTQwMDAwLXN1cGVyLWNydWlzZS1lcXVpcHBlZC12ZWhpY2xlcy1zby1mYXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Built More Than 40000 Super Cruise-Equipped Vehicles So Far,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='gmauthority.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /blog/2022/12/gm-built-more-than-40000-super-cruise-equipped-vehicles-so-far/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212259295A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8xMi9nbS1idWlsdC1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNDAwMDAtc3VwZXItY3J1aXNlLWVxdWlwcGVkLXZlaGljbGVzLXNvLWZhci_SAWhodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMTIvZ20tYnVpbHQtbW9yZS10aGFuLTQwMDAwLXN1cGVyLWNydWlzZS1lcXVpcHBlZC12ZWhpY2xlcy1zby1mYXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdGhlLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtYnVpY2staW4tbmFzY2FyLTIwNzA4MS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The History of Buick in NASCAR,"Let me give you a challenge.

Photo: Buick

It is a brand of cars stuck out in no man's land because it's neither a luxury brand nor an economy make with no timeless classics or modern masterpieces. Buick it's out there just to... well just to exist. People mostly remember Buick as grandma's grocery-getter or something very similar. Basically they were nice cars that were relatively affordable but other than that nothing was exciting about them. Even in marketing campaigns and advertisements on TV they seemed to accept and resign to their role as the forgettable family wagon. The entire ads focus on people not even recognizing the cars as Buicks.However for a brief moment in history they had their time in the spotlights and immediately vanished right after that. As a result let's take a look at their life in NASCAR and how they become the most forgettable manufacturer of this competition.Buick's journey in NASCAR begins with the very first NASCAR Cup Series race held in the summer of 1949 at the old three-quarter mile dirt over Charlotte Speedway (which by the way has no relation to the Charlotte Motor Speedway of today). In that race Curtis Turner and Lee Petty raced in 1946 and 1948 Buick vehicles. Still only Turner managed to stay out of trouble and finish in the top ten while Lee Petty crashed out past the halfway point. The manufacturer with the triple shields as a logo would be a constant presence in NASCAR fields from that point forward although in limited numbers. There wasn't a whole lot of them running around with most races only having a couple of them being fielded at any given time and even the big tracks with 70 cars racing saw only a few Buicks running around. Even back then not a whole lot of people paid attention to this brand.With seasons in the 1950s often consisting of almost 40 races you may think that Buick surely won something right from the beginning. Well not really. However fans had to wait six years to see Buick win its first race. It took 187 races to get the job finally done. Besides it's worth noting that pretty much every single other manufacturer had won up to this point. Brands like Hudson Nash and Studebaker all had victories. Take the legendary Hudson Hornet for example who absolutely destroyed the competition in the early 1950s. Besides they were the first automaker to provide factory support to NASCAR but all these manufacturers aren't even around to talk about them. By the way even Jaguar scored a victory before Buick did.But what about the big three of GM Ford and Chrysler? Ford cars and their 'children' Lincolns and Mercurys won tons of races in the early days. At the same time Chrysler also had victories for all of its brands like Dodge and Plymouth and even GM had wins for Chevrolet and Oldsmobile. On the other side Pontiac hadn't achieved any victories yet but that was just due to a lack of trying on their part as they had only made a handful of starts and total up to this point.Buick tried a lot with all types of drivers over the course of years and on all sorts of different racetracks. After 187 tries the planets aligned at the Charlotte Speedway and Buck Baker finally got the job done. Herb Thomas was racing the only other Buick that day but unfortunately crashed out. Considering that Herb Thomas has an absurd win percentage of 21% across his entire career the fact that he didn't bring his Buick home is quite crazy to be honest. Still that is kind of the Buick story. Give them the best driver with the best team around him and they will still find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Speaking of Herb Thomas he got to make the second victory for the team three months later at the one-mile paved Rowley Speedway. Now Buick had a win on a short dirt track and the other on a big paved superspeedway.Those 1955 Buick vehicles were extremely fast on all manner of tracks so naturally you will think that the third victory is right around the corner. No they had to wait quite a while. Not one or two years. Not five not ten hell not even 20 years. Win number three came in 1981 nearly three decades later. That is the longest drought between victories of any manufacturer in NASCAR history by a mile. But what happened? Was Buick coming to the tracks only to watch the race without participating in it? No they were out there with everyone else. During the 1960s and 1970s there was a lot of Buicks racing. For example Dale Earnhardt's first Daytona 500 in 1979 where he led for a few laps and finished in P8 was in a Buick Regal. However everybody believes that he did that in a Monte Carlo model because Buick and the Monte Carlo are so similar. However the Regal was a reasonably popular make and model with everyone back then. Dale Earnhardt made three starts in a Buick that year en route to his Rookie of the Year title.During this winless streak Buick had a lot of models to try and win the championship but nothing worked for them at all. Nothing was revolutionary or inspiring about them. In comparison Oldsmobile vehicles at that time redefined what the NASCAR world thought about aerodynamics. Chevrolet cars were out there winning out of sheer tenacity and had a massive following while Ford had an enormous conglomerate that threw tons of money around. Buick hadn't anything special. They were just out there collecting paychecks.However as the 1980s rolled around a simple rule modification would change everything and Buick won in that decade three championships achieving 62 wins and three Daytona 500 victories. In 1981 NASCAR implemented new rules to make the cars look like their showroom counterparts. Besides the competition officials shortened the wheelbase to make the car look more like the compact models and declared that the manufacturers had to provide the body panels. The outer shell was the same because the racing teams built the rest of the vehicle from zero.The drivers did not receive those new changes well because the shorter wheelbase made the cars extremely unstable. A lot of manufacturers created some bad aerodynamic vehicles. However Buick got the perfect recipe for their Regal model and the main competition for them was Pontiac who had an even greater car on paper. As a result everyone believed that Pontiac had the 1981 Daytona 500 in the bag. Still Richard Petty surprised everyone by taking home his Regal in the first place winning his seventh Daytona 500 race a record that still stands today.Buick wasn't done because they would go on to win the next 47 out of 61 races and the 1981 1982 and 1983 championships. However by the time 1984 rolled around Buick doubled down on the recent NASCAR success and relaunched the Buick Grand National for consumers which was essentially a showroom Buick Regal with a turbocharged V6 power unit. By the time they ran its final iteration in 1987 under the GNX they had somehow created one of the fastest production cars in the world being beaten only by the Lamborghini Countach. Their experience in NASCAR helped them to turn an ordinary family car into something that competed with supercar brands like Porsche Ferrari and Lamborghini  but with a much lower price. As a result the GNX was a hit when it came to sales numbers.In addition to NASCAR they started running well in the Trans-Am series and even made a name for themselves in IndyCar with a brilliant strategy. They created some stupid fast but wildly unstable engines. At the time Buick had a lot of buyers because those power units were very cheap. Buying a Buick engine theoretically guaranteed a starting slot and finishing dead last in the Indy500 paid out way more than the engines were worth. They were so fast that they were setting track records but so unreliable. For example only two Buicks ever ran the entire 500-mile distance in the Indy event.In 1988 Buick dropped the LeSabre and switched back to the Regal which was a significant departure from his street-faring counterpart but crazy fast. In 1988 and 1989 they achieved only three victories; the last win came in 1990 at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Buick ran one final season in 1991 went winless and dipped before the 1992 season began.Buick still stands in the consumer market despite having no presence in motorsport or anywhere else. Surprisingly they are doing well for themselves and selling about a million new cars a year in China. If you didn't know almost 80% of their sales come from China where Buick is seen as a high-end luxury brand like we see Mercedes in our area. They are talking about a new Grand National model or a comeback in NASCAR but nothing is sure.And if it's something we learned from the history of this brand is that nothing is sure with Buick and they will always surprise us in a good or bad way. Still their importance and the way they changed NASCAR are incontestable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yYmlzY3VpdC5jb20vdGhlLWhvbGRlbi11dGUtcG9udGlhYy1nOC1zdC1pcy10aGUtbW9kZXJuLWNoZXZ5LWVsLWNhbWluby10aGF0LWNvdWxkLWhhdmUtYmVlbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Holden Ute/Pontiac G8 ST Is the Modern Chevy El Camino That Could Have Been,"Learn the strange yet true story behind the Australian muscle truck that nearly inspired a new generation of El Camino.

The compact car-based pickup trucks are having quite the moment: The Hyundai Santa Cruz debuted to fantastic reviews and Ford can’t seem to build enough Mavericks pickups to meet demand. But a decade before both these compact trucks we almost had a modern Chevy El Camino: the Pontiac G8 ST/Holden Ute.

The Holden Utility

2008 Pontiac G8 ST concept | General Motors

Holden was General Motors’ Australian division. It built several trim levels of the Holden Commodore sedan including one pickup truck variant. Until 2017 the Holden Utility was a two-door utility coupe. Holden also advertised it as the “ute” which is Australian slang for a pickup truck.

The Australian automaker built various Utes as early as 1951. But the 2000 through 2017 Holden Utility was a distinct vehicle. By the end of its run you could choose between a 3.6-liter V6 and a 6.0-liter V8 with special SS trims.

Other Ute variations included the four-door Holden Crewman the chassis/cab Holden One Tonner and the performance-oriented Maloo which was built by the standalone Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) division. In 2006 a Maloo even beat out the Dodge Ram SRT-10 for the world’s fastest pickup when it reached a top speed of 168 MPH.

The Pontiac G8 ST

2008 Pontiac G8 ST concept | General Motors

General Motors revealed an American market version of the Holden Ute at the 2008 New York International Auto Show. This coupe utility was badged as the Pontiac G8 Sport Truck (ST).

Despite the different branding the Pontiac G8 ST featured the same specifications as the Holden Ute. This included a 73-inch cargo bed a 3.6-liter V6 and even the available 6.0-liter V8. PickupTruck.com reported that GM had told the press that the Pontiac Sport Truck would be a 2010 model–according to Web Archive. It was slated to start at $31000.

Right before the Pontiac G8 ST could go into production and international recession struck. GM like most automakers decided to reduce its lineup. The shifting exchange rate between Australian dollars and US dollars made the G8 ST especially risky so GM cut the project.

The new Chevy Camino SS that could have been

2008 Pontiac G8 ST concept | General Motors

General Motors canceled the Chevrolet Camino back in 1987. The Pontiac G8 ST was set to be its first coupe utility in two decades. But why wasn’t it badged as a Chevry Camino?

From an engineering perspective the Pontiac badge made sense. The Holden Commodore of the era was directly based upon the Pontiac G8 and the Holden Ute was a modified Commodore.

But the Commodore rode on GM’s Zeta platform so it shared a chassis with the Chevrolet Caprice and Camaro. It also was related to the Chevrolet Lumina that General Motors offered in the Middle East parts of Asia and Africa. In fact General Motors did briefly offer a rebadged Holden Ute in parts of the world: the Chevrolet Lumina SS.

General Motors went so far as to hold a naming contest for the Pontiac G8 ST. The company received over 18000 suggestions some of which must have been “El Camino” yet it held onto the Pontiac G8 ST name until it canceled the project. Perhaps GM planned to release a special edition–with an even more powerful engine–badged as the Chevy El Camino. Sadly we’ll never know.

Ribociclib an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) given with endocrine therapy led to a doubling in median progression-free survival compared with combination chemotherapy and was associated with fewer adverse events according to Yen-Shen Lu MD PhD Professor and Division Chief of Medical Oncology at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei. Dr. Lu presented the findings at the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.



Yen-Shen Lu MD PhD

“The results of the RIGHT Choice trial reveal that front-line ribociclib plus endocrine therapy can be an efficacious clinically meaningful treatment option for patients with aggressive advanced breast cancer and helps to avoid the need for combination chemotherapy and its associated toxicities” Dr. Lu said.

As Dr. Lu noted the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors plus endocrine therapy has been widely adopted as first-line treatment in hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. However many guidelines continue to recommend chemotherapy for the subset with rapidly progressing or highly symptomatic disease. The RIGHT Choice trial challenges that recommendation.

Moderator of a press briefing Virginia Kaklamani MD SABCS Co-Director and Professor of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio said the study is the first to compare a CDK4/6 inhibitor with combination chemotherapy. “I agree that these findings will change some of the standard of care” she said. “We don’t use a lot of chemotherapy nowadays because of how well the CDK4/6 inhibitors work but I think the little that we use is probably now dead.”



Virginia Kaklamani MD



Ruth O’Regan MD

Also at the press briefing Ruth O’Regan MD Professor and Chairman of Medicine at the University of Rochester in New York commended the investigators of the study. “I think this is a question we’ve had and even though this is a phase II study it is really showing us that we don’t need to use chemotherapy for these patients.”

RIGHT Choice Details

The trial enrolled 222 pre- or perimenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative previously untreated aggressive breast cancer. More than half (52%) were determined to be in visceral crisis as indicated by rapidly progressing disease or impending visceral compromise symptomatic visceral metastases or markedly symptomatic nonvisceral disease. The population was 54% Asian and 46% White.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive ribociclib at 600 mg for 3 weeks on 1 week off given with letrozole or anastrozole plus goserelin or investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy which could be docetaxel plus capecitabine paclitaxel plus gemcitabine or capecitabine plus vinorelbine. Patients were followed for a median of 24 months. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by local assessment. At the time of data cutoff 46% of patients were continuing ribociclib compared with 24% continuing combination chemotherapy.

Doubling in Progression-Free Survival

“There was a significant progression-free survival benefit of 1 additional year [with ribociclib] compared with combination chemotherapy. The benefit was consistent for most subgroups of patients” Dr. Lu reported.

Median progression-free survival was 24.0 months with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with 12.3 months with combination chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54; P = .0007). Overall response rate was 65.2% for ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with 60.0% for combination chemotherapy and the time to response was rapid and similar: 4.9 months and 3.2 months respectively (HR = 0.78).

“Combination chemotherapy is known to have a high response rate which is why it is sometimes preferred for this patient group. In both arms the overall response rate was similar” he said. “Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy can generate a high tumor response rate matching the data with combination chemotherapy.”

KEY POINTS In the phase II RIGHT Choice trial ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was compared with combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment of patients with advanced hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative breast cancer more than half of whom had visceral crisis.

Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy led to a doubling in median progression-free survival vs combination chemotherapy: 24.0 months vs 12.3 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54; P = .0007).

Overall response rate was 65.2% for ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with 60.0% for combination chemotherapy and the time to response was rapid and similar: 4.9 months and 3.2 months respectively (HR = 0.78).

Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was reported to be better tolerated than combination chemotherapy.

Tolerability

Tolerability was better with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy than with combination chemotherapy with serious treatment-related adverse events seen in 1.8% and 8.0% respectively and treatment-related discontinuations reported in 7.1% and 23.0% respectively. Although neutropenia and leukopenia were more common with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy chemotherapy-treated patients were much more likely to report nausea vomiting and diarrhea—“which impact quality of life” Dr. Lu noted.

“Younger patients with aggressive disease often show resistance to treatment resulting in worse prognoses. So it is encouraging to see RIGHT Choice data demonstrating a significant 1-year benefit for this patient population with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy” he concluded.

Gilead Sciences Inc. announced this week that Sunlenca® (lenacapavir) in combination with other antiretroviral(s) (ARV) has been granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) adults with multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 infection. Sunlenca has a multi-stage mechanism of action distinguishable from other currently approved classes of antiviral agents and no known cross resistance exhibited in vitro to other existing drug classes. Sunlenca offers a new twice-yearly treatment option for adults with HIV that is not adequately controlled by their current treatment regimen.

“An effective antiretroviral regimen can be devised for most people living with the virus; however some people living with HIV no longer have durable viral suppression due to resistance to multiple classes of antiretroviral therapies” said Sorana Segal-Maurer MD Director of the Dr. James J. Rahal Jr. Division of Infectious Diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian Queens Professor of Clinical Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and the Site Principal Investigator for the CAPELLA trial. “The availability of new classes of antiretroviral drugs is critical for heavily treatment-experienced people with multi-drug resistant HIV. Following today’s decision from the FDA lenacapavir helps to fill a critical unmet need for people with complex prior treatment histories and offers physicians a long-awaited twice-yearly option for these patients who otherwise have limited therapy choices.”

Despite the significant advances in ARV therapy there remain numerous critical and pressing unmet needs for people living with HIV. This is particularly true for individuals who are heavily treatment experienced – which account for an estimated 2% of adults living with HIV who are on treatment globally –- and are unable to maintain virologic suppression due to resistance intolerance or safety considerations. This type of complexity further increases the chance of treatment failure underscoring the need for new treatment options that are active against resistant variants of the virus with a novel mechanism of action.

Lenacapavir is a breakthrough innovation with the potential to be a preferred and versatile foundational long-acting agent due to its therapeutic potency and a range of dosing frequencies and routes of administration. Lenacapavir is being developed as a foundation for Gilead’s future HIV therapies with the goal of offering several long-acting options that help address individual needs and preferences that may help optimize outcomes and reduce burden of care. Lenacapavir is being studied in multiple ongoing early and late-stage development programs and has the potential to offer a diverse set of person-centric options for treatment and prevention that could uniquely fit into the lives of people living with HIV and people who would benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The use of lenacapavir for HIV prevention is investigational and the safety and efficacy of lenacapavir for this use have not been established.

“This news is an important milestone in the work to help end the HIV epidemic as Sunlenca is now the only FDA-approved twice-yearly treatment for people with multi-drug resistant HIV” said Daniel O’Day Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gilead Sciences. “Gilead scientists have developed a unique and potent antiretroviral medicine in Sunlenca with the potential for flexible dosing options. Our goal is to deliver multiple long-acting options for treatment and prevention that are tailored to the needs of people living with HIV and people who could benefit from PrEP medicines.”",,,,,,,,,

On a recent episode of the Stadium Journey Podcast our correspondent Dave Cottenie asked ""how can you not be romantic about baseball?"" Of all the sports none come close to the feelings evoked by a visit to our favorite ballpark.





Stadium Journey endeavors to visit every Major League Baseball ballpark annually to keep our reviews current for those of us who love to travel the country visiting these cathedrals to the sport. In 2022 we were able to visit 21 of the 30 parks nationwide. Not bad considering we're not back to normal.





Here we are ranking the 30 ballparks according to our patented FANFARE rating scale. This scale takes into consideration a ballpark's concessions game day atmosphere neighborhood fan support access value and more. It's a bit of a different way to evaluate a ballpark and historically our rankings have created much debate. That's OK we can take it. Plus isn't healthy debate the reason why we make lists like this?





The fact that over two-thirds of the Major League ballparks scored a 4.00 rating or better is a testament to the quality of the ballparks and the game-day entertainment provided by the team staff around the leagues. To see the full review of each ballpark just click the link underneath the photo.





You'll notice that there have been some changes in our rankings as we move to this new site. There is no longer a place for readers to contribute their scores. After much consideration the decision was made to discontinue crowd reviews as the vast majority of them came from previous Stadium Journey reviews and simply were not being utilized as designed.





Our rankings are now based solely on the reviewer's FANFARE score. Where two or more venues are tied a counsel of Stadium Journey elders is consulted to break any ties. We encourage our readers to share your input on our social media channels. Stadium Journey can be found on Facebook Twitter  and Instagram.





We hope you are enjoying our new site. Without further ado we present our ranking of the 2022 Major League Baseball stadiums.





Andrei Ojeda - Petco Park continues to play a huge role in the revitalization of the local area throughout the East Village. Despite last year’s late-season collapse the excitement level and expectations remain high among the Friar Faithful. Now in its 18th year Petco Park continues to bring high energy to the East Village and continually ranks among the top ballpark experiences year in and year out.





Chris Green - The Guardians continue to showcase what makes their home one of the best home stadiums in the major leagues. Progressive Field has everything you would want in a perfect setting. Top food and beverage options mix here with a constantly improving stadium that remains one of the best in baseball. Affordability and easy access create a welcoming environment that makes for one of the best game-day experiences around.





Andrei Ojeda - One visit to this beauty and you will see why Oracle Park consistently ranks among the top ballpark experiences among baseball fans. As you walk away to the tune of Tony Bennett’s “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” a piece of your heart will undoubtedly be left at 3rd and King.





Paul Baker - Fenway Park’s mix of historical touches quirky features and modern comforts are unmatched anywhere. Other cities try again and again to find the magic formula that has existed in Boston for 111 years. Simply put Fenway Park is the standard against which all other ballparks are measured.

Paul Baker - Fans who haven’t visited the North Side of Chicago in a while will be amazed by the transformation that has taken place in the home of the Cubbies. Modern features have been integrated into the ballpark in a way that does not detract from the historic aspects of the facility. Wrigley Field is truly a special place to take in a baseball game.





Dave Hanson - Citi’s unique location in Flushing extensive food offerings and rabid fanbase make visiting the park feel completely different from the experience across town at Yankee Stadium. Citi Field is a world of its own both of the city and simultaneously removed from the dense urbanity of Manhattan Brooklyn and the Bronx. Yankee Stadium is a tourist trap that happens to contain a baseball diamond. Citi Field is a proper ballpark. There’s a difference.





Patricia Beninato - PNC Park is a mecca for MLB fans two decades after its opening and the recent right field plaza refurbishment combined with a ton of promotions and discounts make it a relatively cheap day or night out for locals and visitors alike. Pittsburgh hopes that one day the Pirates will field a team that’s worthy of the beautiful ballpark they call home.





Andrei Ojeda - Coors Field was among several yards that opened during the so-called “retro parks” era. The recent enhancements to Coors Field most notably the new video/scoreboard and The Rooftop have only helped improve the game day atmosphere. Coors Field trails only Dodger Stadium and Wrigley Field in the National League senior circuit for years of service.





Gregory Koch - The difference between Target Field and the old Metrodome is like night and day. While the Twins previously played in one of the worst stadiums in Major League Baseball they now play at one of the best. Just walking up and gaping at its gorgeous exterior you get the sense that this place is different and once you get inside you will not be disappointed. From the Minnie and Paul sign to the unique concession items to all the other extras here a trip to Target Field for a Twins game should be on every fan’s bucket list.





Andrei Ojeda - The recent enhancements throughout the third oldest yard in the Majors have made the Dodger Stadium experience much more accessible for fans wanting to experience as much of the historic venue and have assured us that Dodger Stadium will be the home to Dodger Baseball for many more years to come.





David Berger - Busch Stadium offers enough history class and views to make it an ideal baseball destination. The ballpark is a favorite among many ballpark enthusiasts and is considered home to many Cardinals fans during the season. Does it have to stand out among the copious “retro-classic” facilities built in the past 25 years? Perhaps Busch doesn’t necessarily need to be anything more than what it is a nice spot for baseball.





Richard Smith - Philadelphia fans often get a bad reputation and it can be well-deserved at times. The stadium itself can also get lost in the sea of new stadiums across the league but the fact is that Citizens Bank Park is a modern ballpark that offers all of the best things that fans expect out of their stadium experience. It should not be forgotten.





Richard Smith - Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened in 1992 and has been considered one of the best Major League Baseball stadiums in the league. Before its opening the landscape of professional baseball was littered with boring multipurpose bowl stadiums. Now nearly every team has a great baseball stadium. Luckily Oriole Park has kept up with the experiences. Out were lackluster parks and in were fan-friendly stadiums that were designed for the optimum fan experience.





Chuck Utech - Stadium journeys have to include a trip to Kansas City. This is an experience for an individual couple or group that can be done at a variety level of expenses. The level of entertainment however is high.





Eric Moreno - After moving out of the Eighth Wonder of the World the Astrodome the Astros moved into their new luxury downtown facilities at (the now-named) Minute Maid Park. From the friendly confines of their new home at the Juice Box the Astros have made the playoffs nine times claimed four pennants (one when they were still in the National League and three since joining the American League) and won one World Series championship in 2017.





Andrei Ojeda - From the baseball-themed artwork to the vast food selections and the majestic views of Puget Sound along the left field upper concourse the cool Pacific Northwest summer nights with a welcoming fan base and an exciting young team a visit to T-Mobile Park will rank highly among your list of ballpark visits.





Richard Smith - The best feature of Comerica Park is the giant Tiger statues that guard the various entrances to the stadium. These are popular photo spots and/or meet-up locations before games. They are not only a great feature but show a team knowing how to double down on their mascot.





Gregory Koch - In 2005 the Nationals came to town and in 2008 they got a brand-new stadium. Since then the excitement has worn off and the crowds have steadily declined especially as the Nationals’ performance on the field has gone downhill. That being said Nationals Park is still a nice stadium for fans to take in a Major League Baseball game.





Marc Viquez - Great American Ballpark is one of the better values in all of Major League Baseball. It includes a modern Stadium with plenty of great views and concession options affordable ticket pricing a great location along the river and multiple entertainment districts surrounding it. Cincinnati is a town that offers a lot of other things to do besides watching the baseball game; you may find yourself spending a lot longer going up and down the hills of Queen City.





Marc Viquez - The Chicago White Sox has been working very hard to improve the amenities at the stadium. The past few seasons have seen renovations to the concourse regarding food and beverage service social areas for fans a brand new scoreboard and fan-friendly pricing on game day tickets. If you haven’t been to a Sox game lately perhaps you need to come back sometime soon for a game.





Meg Minard - Chase Field provides good game day enjoyment and it is easy to reach and traverse. The swimming pool and the retractable roof and panels offer unique elements to the ballpark. A recommendation is to visit early in the season (April) to enjoy a game with the roof open. Phoenix is a vacation destination in early spring and late fall so enjoy a D-Backs game when in town.

Chris Green - Miller Park is a beautiful stadium and it features a unique roof design mixed with appropriate architectural design. The food is plentiful and top quality and the fans are among the best in baseball. Almost every game is a packed house so you get that exciting experience sports fans to yearn for. If you’re visiting Milwaukee or even just passing through a stop here is a must-consider even for the casual sports fan.





Lloyd Brown - A visit to Truist Park and the Battery provides a daylong set of options for baseball fans. Arrive early or stay late and enjoy a wide range of dining and entertainment options. In between you can enjoy some great baseball featuring the defending World Champion Atlanta Braves. Chop on!





Andrei Ojeda - Angel Stadium is the 4th oldest yard in the bigs behind Fenway Park Wrigley Field and Dodger Stadium. It has gone through its share of changes. From being enclosed in 1979 to accommodate the Rams to its return to its current form as a baseball-only park compared to other yards of the post-Camden era Angel Stadium could use some updates.





Chris Green - While many may regard Tropicana Field as one of the worst stadiums in baseball the facility still has some life in it. Yes the age and overall aesthetic of the place just feels “meh” worthy but the Tampa Bay Rays have called it their home since their inception in 1998 and you can almost feel a bit of history when you walk through the ballpark doors.





Dave Cottenie - With the renovations long overdue coming to Rogers Centre it will be interesting to see if as Blue Jays President Mark Shapiro hopes the former SkyDome becomes a “ballpark” and not a “stadium.” What the future holds will be exciting but for now Rogers Centre remains one of the most influential stadiums in the league and one that needs the most TLC.





Greg Venuto - Yankee Stadium overall is impressive and a must-see for baseball enthusiasts. It can be a bit too much splash and often tries too hard to remove as much money as possible from your wallet. Some detractors also say it’s too much of a museum and not enough of a conventional ballpark.





Michael Davis - Globe Life Field is the newest ballpark in Major League Baseball yet it fails compared to the old ballpark. Maybe my emotions have entered into this review as I loved Globe Life Park. Somewhere the baseball fan was forgotten in leaving the old ballpark – overall attending a game at Globe Life Field is more expensive than its predecessor yet the Rangers product on the field is less.





Matt Fiedler - loanDepot Park is a very interesting place. It has some unique features that make it stand out from the pack of bland ballparks. The park does a good job of showcasing Miami's culture and cuisine. The fans and atmosphere drag things down though. The laid-back vibe of Miami does show at the games.





Chris Green - Oakland baseball deserves better – most everyone agrees on this. The fans who do show up are passionate and proud of their team’s history. And while the Athletics have done the best they can with what they have in their current state the shortcomings are so vast that it is hard to overlook one if not most. The beauty of the weather and climate helps but Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum could use a proper facelift to make it more enjoyable for the fan experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L21ldHJvL3RoZXktd2VyZS1mcmVlZC1hZnRlci1zZXJ2aW5nLWRlY2FkZXMtcHJpc29uLW5vdy1pdHMtcHJvc2VjdXRvcnMtZmFjaW5nLXNjcnV0aW55L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,They were freed after serving decades in prison. Now it’s their prosecutors who are facing scrutiny.,"Watson served 41 years in prison for murder before that memo and other evidence of O’Neill’s wrongdoing came to light. Now a free man Watson is fighting back against the prosecutor who put him behind bars.

But instead of coming clean prosecutor Timothy P. O’Neill buried a memo that detailed the “error of major proportions” and put the witness on the stand.

The Suffolk County prosecutor who sent James Watson to prison for life knew Boston police had made grievous mistakes in the interview of a key witness — mistakes that made the witness’s account suspect.

“He ruined my life” Watson said of O’Neill. “He knew. He knew I was innocent and he pursued it anyway.

“Now I’m holding [him] accountable.”

In August Watson filed a formal complaint against O’Neill with the Massachusetts Office of the Bar Counsel which investigates lawyers for misconduct. The push for accountability after four decades may be largely symbolic — O’Neill has retired from legal practice — but it matters to Watson and at least three others who served decades in prison because of prosecutors who are now accused of violating their oaths.

The complaints are long shots: Prosecutors rarely if ever face repercussions for bad behavior. Unlike rogue police officers they are almost never charged with crimes. They generally don’t face civil rights lawsuits even when they knowingly break the law. They have perhaps the broadest immunity from accountability within the criminal justice system.

For the wrongfully convicted that leaves the state Board of Bar Overseers as the lone avenue to hold prosecutors accountable.

Currently the disciplinary board has misconduct complaints pending that involve at least six current or former prosecutors accused of wrongdoing in murder convictions that were eventually thrown out according to legal records and defense attorneys. In each case judges or defense attorneys documented alleged efforts to hide evidence knowingly elicit false testimony or withhold records that pointed at another suspect.

“Our entire legal system is built on the assumption that . . . we can trust prosecutors to do the right thing — to ‘seek justice’ within the confines of the law” said Lisa M. Kavanaugh director of the Innocence Program at the Committee for Public Counsel Services.

When prosecutors break that trust she added “the public has a right to know and to be assured that they will face real consequences.”

Put off in many cases by the long odds against them those wronged by the system rarely seek action. On average less than 2 percent of all legal misconduct complaints are against prosecutors according to the state Office of the Bar Counsel. The process is so cloaked in secrecy that the Board of Bar Overseers declined to even say whether it was taking a harder line against prosecutors who abuse their power.

However that may change as more wrongful convictions come to light in Massachusetts and across the United States. In Boston alone judges have thrown out murder and rape convictions against more than a dozen men since 2019. Almost all of them are Black and had been sentenced to life in prison.

Often the injustices are blamed on police tactics — evidence planted falsified or ignored flawed interrogations and the like. But a series of recently overturned cases shows how prosecutorial missteps can put the wrong person behind bars.

Consider allegations pending for more than two years against former Plymouth County prosecutor Karen O’Sullivan.

A judge in September 2020 threw out an arson and double murder conviction citing O’Sullivan and another prosecutor’s “racially and sexually offensive e-mails” to each other. The judge found that the missives demonstrated their “their racial animus” against the defendant Frances Choy and her family who are of Asian descent. The ruling also alleged that O’Sullivan knowingly elicited false testimony from a police detective.

Choy was accused at 17 of setting her Brockton home on fire and killing both her parents. She served 17 years in prison before her release. Choy’s legal team sent the ruling detailing the prosecutors’ misconduct to the disciplinary board on Oct 1 2020. One of her attorneys Sharon Beckman of the Boston College Innocence Program said legal ethics required attorneys to report the behavior.

O’Sullivan and her fellow prosecutor John E. Bradley Jr. have said that the offensive e-mails were fabricated as political payback by their former boss Plymouth District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz. Bradley said it was part of a smear campaign because he had sued Cruz and run against the district attorney when he was reelected in 2018. Cruz’s office has said claims that the e-mails were fabricated or tampered with were “ludicrous.”

O’Sullivan who did not respond for comment left the Plymouth district attorney’s office in 2012 but remained a prosecutor. She moved to Bristol County where she now serves on District Attorney Thomas M. Quinn III’s leadership team.

Quinn has repeatedly defended O’Sullivan and dismissed the judge’s findings in the Choy case. “If I thought Karen O’Sullivan was biased towards any defendant she would not be working for me” Quinn said in a statement.

The legal community is also closely watching the outcome of a 2017 misconduct case against three former state prosecutors tied to the state drug lab scandal. The allegations include concealing documents and making misrepresentations in court. In a rare move the board that evaluates complaints against lawyers urged that one of the former prosecutors be disbarred a penalty more severe than had been recommended by a hearing officer.

The ultimate decision will be made by the state’s highest court which is the final arbiter of attorney discipline. The case like most legal misconduct investigations has moved so slowly that legal experts say it discourages others from filing complaints.

“There’s a sense of resignation in the defense bar that prosecutors are often above the law and they won’t be held accountable” said law professor Daniel S. Medwed of Northeastern University who filed the drug lab complaint. “It’s not just Massachusetts. It’s really every state.”

In Massachusetts complaints about attorneys remain confidential unless investigators file public charges which can take years. If a complaint is investigated but the Office of the Bar Counsel determines no public charges are warranted it remains secret.

The Office of the Bar Counsel cited its confidential rules and declined to disclose whether any of the prosecutors identified by the Globe had pending complaints. The cases are not public and it appears no charges have been filed.

But nothing prevents people from airing the allegations they report about attorneys.

Robert Foxworth who served nearly three decades in prison for murder before his conviction was thrown out in 2020  went public in November with his complaint against high-ranking Suffolk homicide prosecutor Mark Lee. Foxworth and one of his attorneys accused Lee of withholding evidence from a federal informant who said he was innocent. Foxworth then served another dozen years in prison.

Suffolk District Attorney Kevin R. Hayden launched an investigation and suspended Lee with pay in November. Lee has vigorously denied the allegations through his attorneys who issued a statement describing the complaint as “baseless and malicious.”

Last year another case revealed more allegations of wrongdoing by prosecutors. A Suffolk Superior Court judge ruled in December 2021 that he had an ethical obligation to report the conduct of former Suffolk prosecutors who withheld evidence and lied about it in court. This case involved Shaun Jenkins who served nearly 20 years in prison for murder until his attorneys made a series of discoveries.

The defense learned that prosecutors had wrongly withheld phone records and other evidence pointing to another possible killer. In court former Suffolk prosecutor Timothy J. Bradl made legal arguments that contradicted the records and other evidence in the prosecution’s possession. In a statement an attorney for Bradl said his client had an “an unblemished record” and “made no false statements and hid no evidence” in Jenkins’s case.

The Suffolk district attorney’s office said it was aware of the allegations against Lee and the former prosecutors but declined to comment while the complaints were pending. In a statement Hayden encouraged people to report law enforcement misconduct and pledged to be “as vigilant in using facts to address unjust convictions as we will in using facts to secure convictions.”

Then there is the case of James Watson who along with codefendant Frederick Clay was wrongly convicted in the 1979 Boston killing of cab driver Jeffrey Boyajian.

There was a litany of problems with the case including Boston detectives who used hypnosis in an improper way on a key witness. After being hypnotized that witness allegedly identified Watson and Clay as two of the culprits. But new records unearthed by Watson’s legal team showed that O’Neill the prosecutor on the case knew back then that detectives had botched the interview.

In a September 1980 letter O’Neill asked a Harvard psychiatrist to testify as an expert vouching for the hypnosis procedures.

The Harvard psychiatrist wrote back that he would not testify because not only had police done it wrong but their mistakes were irreversible. Detectives failed to record the witness’s memories before the hypnosis and they used leading questions that can elicit “inaccurate information.”

O’Neill was undeterred court records show. Instead of disclosing the psychiatrist’s criticism to the defense as required he withheld the letter found a different expert and offered a new description of the detectives’ procedures. The prosecution now claimed that the witness identified Watson before he had been hypnotized — an assertion contradicted by O’Neill’s own letter to the Harvard psychiatrist according to filings by Watson’s attorney Barbara A. Munro.

After Watson and Clay went to prison O’Neill went into private practice where he boasted on his firm’s website of a 90 percent conviction rate during his years as a prosecutor. As a defense lawyer he represented priests accused of sexual abuse.

Watson filed a complaint this summer against O’Neill. The former prosecutor who is retired and living in Colorado declined to speak to Watson’s investigators and he did not respond to the Globe’s request for comment.

Any discipline would be symbolic but Watson believes it could be a small measure of justice.

Watson refused a plea offer that would have freed him after less than two years behind bars if he testified against his codefendant. Watson maintained his innocence refused to turn on the other man and spent four decades in prison.

“The man that convicted me knew I didn’t do it and he went through with it” Watson said. “What does that tell you about the world we live in?”

He has in the past admitted to killing Western tourists around Asia.

PARIS — Convicted killer Charles Sobhraj suspected in the deaths of at least 20 tourists around Asia in the 1970s arrived in Paris as a free man Saturday after being released from a life sentence in a Nepal prison.

Convicted killer Charles Sobhraj looks at his mobile phone in transit at Doha airport to France on Dec. 23.

Sobhraj a 78-year-old French citizen had been serving time for the deaths of American and Canadian backpackers in Nepal in 1975 but was released Friday for health and other reasons.

He arrived Saturday at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris on a flight from Nepal via Qatar his French lawyer Isabelle Coutant-Peyre told The Associated Press.

He is glad to be free she said and “now he will rest."" She described him as an “optimist"" and resilient.

French filmmaker Jean-Charles Deniau who spoke to Sobhraj upon his arrival in Paris and is releasing a film and book about his life said “He’s doing well. He has medicines. He will live in Paris and a little bit everywhere.""

The French government did not respond to requests for comment on whether he could face judicial challenges in France. Sobhraj was born in Vietnam during French rule and claims French citizenship.

He is believed to have killed at least 20 people in Afghanistan India Thailand Turkey Nepal Iran and Hong Kong between 1972 and 1982.

But despite multiple legal cases opened against him judicial authorities across the region struggled to convict him for the killings — or to keep him behind bars.

He was arrested in New Delhi in 1976 and accused of murdering two tourists and stealing their jewelry. He was convicted of the theft but acquitted of murder. In Thailand he faced 14 murder charges. He avoided being extradited by staying before the courts in India until the Thai case expired in 1996. In Thailand he faced the death penalty.

In 1986 he escaped from New Delhi’s maximum-security Tihar prison after luring guards into sharing a drug-laced birthday cake but was later recaptured.

In 1997 he was deported from India to France where he lived freely but was investigated for allegedly trying to poison a group of French tourists in India.

He resurfaced in 2003 in a casino in the Nepalese city of Kathmandu and was questioned about the unsolved murders of an American and a Canadian backpacker whose charred bodies were found on the city’s outskirts. He was convicted the following year and handed a life sentence.

Sobhraj insisted on his innocence in that case though had in the past spoken of killing other tourists. When he was released from the Indian prison he said he regretted aspects of his past.

Life sentences in Nepal are 20 years. In announcing his release this week the Nepal Supreme Court said he has heart disease and had already served more than 75% of his sentence and had behaved well in prison making him eligible for release.

He was freed Friday and ordered to leave Nepal within 15 days. A friend helped finance a ticket to France and the French Embassy prepared travel documents allowing him to leave attorney Gopal Siwakoti Chitan said.

His French lawyer welcomed his release. “I’m very happy but very shocked that it took 19 years to obtain his normal freedom” Coutant-Peyre said at the airport. She said his murder conviction in Nepal was a “fabricated case” and said the French government didn’t do enough to help or defend him.

She said Sobhraj watched the series “The Serpent"" and said it was “garbage first of all and that 70 percent of it is totally false.""

His “serpent” nickname stems from his reputation as a disguise and escape artist. He was also known as “the bikini killer” because he often targeted young women.

Sam Bankman-Fried the fallen crypto mogul who told The Times last month that his personal fortune had dwindled to $100000 won’t be spending the holidays behind bars. He and his defense team on Thursday negotiated a whopping $250 million bond deal that secured his release from federal custody.

The terms are highly restrictive. Mr. Bankman-Fried 30 had to turn over his passport and will remain under house arrest at the California home of his parents the Stanford Law School professors Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried. He’s been fitted with a bracelet that monitors his movements must undergo a mental health evaluation and will have to get government or court approval for any expenses above $1000.

The bail deal was negotiated before Mr. Bankman-Fried boarded a plane on Wednesday night back to the U.S. If he misses a court date or flees his parents would be liable for that quarter-billion-dollar bond hit.

The legal case against him is moving swiftly.

Who knew what when and why are we flogging essential monopoly services to cuff-linked tax crooks? Callum Foote and Michael West report.

Two months after losing his seat at the federal election former treasurer Josh Frydenberg landed on his feet with Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs.

Goldman Sachs was a banker to most of the large foreign takeovers that the Treasurer approved during his time. And there were some monsters: Afterpay AusNet Spark Infrastructure and Sydney Airport among them.

Once famously labeled the “Giant Vampire Squid wrapped around the face of humanity” Goldman made a truckload of money from the decisions of Scott and Josh’s Treasury.

So Australia’s reputation as an attractive destination for foreign capital was surely burnished during the Treasury stewardship of the dynamic duo. Burnished that is as a destination for easy-pickings.

Sadly for Australians however – as opposed to Wall Street – we are too attractive; chumps and fools for foreign vulture funds with a penchant for snatching our assets on the cheap: things the public have already paid for built privatised and subsidised – and then plonking them in tax havens.

A swarm of Caribbean vultures

Look no further than Brookfield’s control of Australia’s private hospitals in the Cayman Islands and aged care homes in Bermuda. And now a large chunk of the electricity grid.

So slick is our own political leadership and the Department of Treasury at dudding ordinary Australians that they are about to do it again but even bigger and more boof-headedly this time by approving Brookfield’s $18bn bid for Origin Energy a deal which not only cements control of Victoria’s power industry somewhere in the Caribbean but with a big red bow on it and a card embellished with the gilt inscription Please Rob Us Now.

Treasury approval is required for big foreign takeovers on “national interest” grounds – and the Department is a patsy for foreign tax dodgers – but even the fact that Brookfield has the chutzpah to think it can slide this one by past the competition regulator the ACCC as well as Treasury shows what pushovers we have become to Wall Street’s cuff-linked buccaneers indeed what pushovers they think we are.

Is there any other country which so cavalierly lets its services be pillaged by foreign tax cheats?

Cradle to grave

After all Brookfield just nabbed electricity giant Ausnet for $20bn with all its poles and wires and pipelines (distribution and transmission) and now we are about to gift them our mines and shopfronts (generation and retail distribution). The game plan is “cradle-to-grave”: total control over the power industry on a plater: from mining drilling and storing coal gas and renewables and running power plants “generation” that is to “transmission” (big coat-hanger poles and wires) to “distribution” (the street poles and wires) to “would you like to save money on your electricity bill Madam?” (retailing the stuff) to millions of Australians.

Vertical integration post the Origin Energy takeover will deliver them greater power to charge what they like – a total regulatory surrender an antitrust apocalypse a license for another crew of tax haven merchants to stick it up millions of Australians.

The co-bidder with Brookfield for Origin is another American private equity mob EIG.

Scott Morrison and the pushover that is FIRB

The second half of last year featured the biggest takeover boom in Australia’s history. It was a fabulously profitable year for the Wall Street bank as these enormous assets fell to foreign buyers.

When he was Treasurer Frydenberg had carriage of the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) a small and secretive yet powerful division of the Department of Treasury. He signed off on the takeovers.

There was also another treasurer at the time however and that was Scott Morrison who now we know had himself secretly appointed to a slew of senior ministries including as treasurer.

Goldman Sachs is renowned for its revolving door connection with governments and governmental bodies globally. The investment bank once famously dubbed The Giant Vampire Squid by Rolling Stone magazine for having its greedy tentacles wrapped around so many transactions has held much influence over successive US administrations spanning both sides of the aisle. The new Securities and Exchange Commission chair was a former Goldman banker.

As ultimate sign-off at FIRB Frydenberg was the gatekeeper for bankers executing transactions for foreign buyers and defending them too.

In 2020 and 2021 alone FIRB made decisions on 6651 proposals. According to the board’s annual report “6650 were approved with a value of $233 billion and one was rejected”.

Frydenberg is the classic case of “gamekeeper turned poacher”. His tenure as Treasurer endured from 2018 under the prime ministership of another former Goldman Sachs alumni Malcolm Turnbull until the end of the Liberal time in office under Morrison.

Goldman refused to respond to questions for this story and rarely makes public statements relying mostly on backgrounding finance journalists on transactions when it suits them. It did say something when it picked up the former treasurer though:

“We are fortunate to bring to Goldman Sachs a person of Josh’s deep public and private sector experience connectivity and insight” Kevin Sneader co-president of Goldman Sachs in Asia-Pacific ex-Japan said in a statement.

The former treasurer who in that role also had responsibility for giving the final approval on large foreign mergers or acquisitions of Australian firms said was pleased to join the bank.

“I am pleased to join Goldman Sachs which is the pre-eminent mergers and acquisitions and capital markets adviser to clients globally” he said in a statement.

“I look forward to joining the team and contributing to the firm’s leadership its global capability and its strength of client franchise.”

M&A explodes

As pandemic lockdowns came off and Australia’s ASX-listed assets were at bargain cheap prices 2021 was open season for mergers and acquisitions – up from a 10-year average of $100 billion in deals by value to $308 billion in 2021 alone.

“None of us can remember a market where there has been so much volume at such a material scale” said Marissa Freund head of mergers and acquisitions for Goldman Sachs in Australia and New Zealand.

The second half of 2021 the treasurer was prolific on the takeover front featuring 63% of all deals which added up to 78% of aggregate transaction value) for the year.

Foreign investors swooped in on the ASX which drove the value of corporate transactions from $33bn in 2020 to a record $131bn billion in 2021.

In December last year FIRB ticked off on the sale of the essential monopoly and gateway to Australia Sydney Airport after a $24bn takeover bid by a consortium of super funds led by New York private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners who were advised by Goldman Sachs.

The quid for the Squid

FIRB gave the green light to a consortium led by controversial US private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and the Ontario Teachers’ pension fund of Canada in 2021 to buy out energy provider Spark Infrastructure paving the way for the $5.2 billion deal to be closed by year-end. Spark Infrastructure was advised by Goldman Sachs.

Then there was electricity juggernaut AusNet which fell to the tax dodgers from Brookfield in a $20bn takeover deal signed off by FIRB. Goldman Sachs did not advise either party for the finalised deal however they did advise a rival bidder the APA Group.

The $39bn takeover of Afterpay by Block Inc of the US Australia’s largest ever takeover was cleared by FIRB last November. Afterpay had Goldman Sachs as their advisor throughout the deal.

Frydenberg as treasurer also appointed Goldman Sachs’ executive director Marina Kelman as a member of the Takeovers Panel. The Takeovers Panel is the statutory body responsible for resolving disputes in a takeover bid during the period of the transaction deciding whether bids are fair properly executed and so forth.

Former Liberal Senator and ambassador to the United States Arthur Sinodinos is also among Goldman Sachs alumni in Australia.

All this is not to say that Goldman Sachs’ influence over Australia’s takeover market is in any way Frydenberg-related. The bank is ubiquitous in financial markets worldwide.

Globally Goldman Sachs advised on over $1.5 trillion dollars worth of successful mergers and acquisitions in 2020-21 up 50% on the year before.

The total net earnings for the Goldman Sachs Group was $21.6 billion in 2021 with $2 billion of that coming from the Asia Pacific including Australia.

Secret treasurer Morrison

During last year’s takeover boom when PM Scott Morrison secretly had himself sworn in as Treasurer along with six other ministries he had an interest in FIRB.

We know this because according to the Bell Report an independent review produced by former High Court Judge Virginia Bell to investigate Morrison’s secret appointments there is an email dated April 21 saying: “We are advised the Treasury swearing [appointment of the PM to Treasurer] relates to FIRB”.

It seems from the Bell Report however that Josh Frydenberg had no idea about Morrison’s appointments.

“Mr Frydenberg the then Treasurer was not informed of Mr Morrison’s appointment to administer the Department of the Treasury. Mr Frydenberg first became aware of this appointment and Mr Morrison’s appointment to administer the Departments of Finance Home Affairs and Industry Science Energy and Resources in August 2022” the report reads.

The scandal over his multiple ministries only came to light in media articles in Murdoch’s The Australian newspaper after Scott Morrison had revealed it to two journalists writing a biography about him. (The very same media along with Nine Entertainment which sings the praises of the foreign takeover merchants and sells out the national interest.)

The Bell Report also notes that FIRB’s oversight was broadened under Josh Frydenberg in March 2020 when “the monetary threshold for all foreign investments subject to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act was reduced to nil”.

This was enacted due to Covid and meant that there was a significant increase in the number of investments that were required to be notified to the Treasurer who could reject a proposal if he deemed it was against the national interest.

The threshold was reinstated for investments other than those in sensitive national security businesses on January 1 2021.

To block the Chinese?

The AFR has reported that Morrison had wanted to control FIRB to block the Chinese from purchasing Australian assets.

It was the deputy secretary of the department of Prime Minister and Cabinet who revealed that the swearing-in related to FIRB in an email released under Freedom of Information.

“We are advised the Treasury swearing relates to FIRB and the home affairs swearing relates to decisions on citizenship loss” Reid wrote.

Frydenberg has been contacted by MWM with questions about whether at any point Morrison attempted to influence FIRB decisions or whether the former treasurer had any dealings with Goldman Sachs executives outside of his usual role of treasurer.

FIRB has also been contacted to ask whether it was aware of Morrison’s appointments and to provide a list of approvals given during 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbW9uZXkvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS93aHktcHJhc2hhbnQta2hlbWthLWlzLWV4Y2l0ZWQtYWJvdXQtcmV0dXJuaW5nLXRvLW11dHVhbC1mdW5kcy0xMTY3MTk4ODkzNTAyNC5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tb25leS9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlL3doeS1wcmFzaGFudC1raGVta2EtaXMtZXhjaXRlZC1hYm91dC1yZXR1cm5pbmctdG8tbXV0dWFsLWZ1bmRzL2FtcC0xMTY3MTk4ODkzNTAyNC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Prashant Khemka is excited about returning to MFs | Mint,"Prashant Khemka is palpably excited. His company WhiteOak Capital Partners is readying plans to launch a global emerging markets (GEM) fund for Indian investors. That will happen as soon as market regulator Sebi lifts the overseas investing limits for Indian mutual funds. The boutique investment management and advisory firm had recently launched a similar fund in its offshore platform for foreign investors.

But that is not the only reason for Khemka’s exuberance. It has more to do with his passion for and long-time association with mutual funds (MF). In 2006 he grabbed the opportunity to head Goldman Sachs asset management business in India. That was a long time ago and Goldman Sachs has also exited its Indian business selling it to Reliance Capital in 2015. But Khemka is back in the saddle this time with WhiteOak Capital which he founded in Singapore in 2017. His firm even secured approval from market regulator Sebi last year to launch a MF scheme for Indian retail investors.

Trends that defined India’s stock markets this year

As of now WhiteOak Capital caters to foreign investors through its offshore funds and India’s high-net worth investors (HNIs) via its portfolio management services (PMS) and alternate investment funds (AIFs).Overall it manages $5.9 billion ( ₹48000 crore) worth of assets. Of this 69% is offshore money (investments made by foreign investors in Indian stocks). More on that later.

Early life

Khemka 51 attributes his fascination for the stock markets to his humble beginnings. He was brought up in a middle-class Marwari household in the Mumbai suburb of Andheri where his father ran a hosiery shop and where he worked occasionally and remembers being surrounded by neighbours and relatives who were quite well-off. He claims that he realized the importance of wealth-building quite early in life having read ‘Think and Grow Rich’ a best-selling self-help book back then.

Stock markets were always part of his life in some form or the other. His father and grandfather had in their possession some physical share certificates of Indian companies. At times he even traded on these company stocks.

But it was only in the mid-1980s that Khemka started getting serious about stock markets. He recalls that in July 1985 his relatives had gathered for his grandmother’s funeral and the only topic of discussion that time was the markets. And then between 1985 and 1986 the BSE Sensex delivered more than 100% returns. This was India’s first market bull run.

At around this time Khemka decided to become an entrepreneur. He set up a small firm called Trinity Ventures with two friends with a capital of ₹3 lakh (each of them contributed ₹1 lakh). He had even borrowed some money from relatives and friends then. But these early investments didn’t turn out well. Khemka also fell prey to fraudsters who duped him with fake share certificates but that did not in any way dissuade him from entering the markets .

View Full Image In 2003 he became a portfolio manager. He managed US mutual funds besides accounts for US investors and those outside separately.

Career path

Those were the days when the investment industry in India was at a very nascent stage with very few career opportunities. Khemka says many of his friends wanted to study engineering and then go to the US. And so did he. Khemka studied mechanical engineering at a college near his house. After getting his degree he even got an admission at both the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies and IIM Ahmedabad. But that was when he got the US visa. He went to the US and pursued Masters in Business Administration (MBA) at Vanderbilt University (1996-1998) on a full scholarship.

In 1998 he joined State Street Global Advisors in Boston as a senior portfolio manager. “My professor recommended me to State Street for their quant business because of my engineering background"" Khemka says.

It wasn’t easy getting opportunities in the investment industry. He says quant helped him get a footing there. “But I always wanted to get on the fundamental analysis side and on the buy-side.""

The baby steps

In one year he moved from quant to fundamental side within State Street itself. The following year Khemka got the opportunity to move to Goldman Sachs on the buy-side where he could manage clients’ investment portfolios.

Initially he tracked telecom then print media and publishing as a sector analyst for the US Growth Equity. Telecom in US was in a big boom phase at that time Khemka recalls.

In 2003 he became a portfolio manager. He managed US mutual funds besides accounts for US investors and those outside separately.

Around this time Khemka got to analyse several internet companies in their early stages which today are global giants. Google was one of them and Khemka was able to participate in Google’s listing in the US equity markets. However he missed out on Amazon because its business model didn’t make sense to him back then. “It seemed that the more sales it was doing the more losses it was incurring"" Khemka says. Only later several other companies started adopting its sales strategy in the hope of becoming the next Amazon.

Almost 11 years after he stepped foot in the US Khemka was keen to move back home. In 2006 he got the opportunity to set up and lead the asset management business of Goldman Sachs in India. Goldman Sachs obtained a MF license from Sebi only in 2008 and that happened in the aftermath of the Lehmann crisis. “So the MF launch plan was put on hold for some time. But Goldman Sachs had already launched an offshore strategy focusing on Indian markets in March 2007 which did quite well. It took quite some time to scale that because of the 2008 financial crisis but we got clients through separately managed accounts for that strategy"" Khemka recalls.

In 2011 Goldman Sachs finally launched its India Equity Fund for domestic investors. This coincided with its acquisition of passive funds business of Benchmark Mutual Fund.

However at that time the markets were going through a turbulent phase. The S&P BSE Sensex had fallen 25% in 2011. It recovered strongly the very next year but taper tantrums started in 2013 putting pressure back on the markets.

By 2013 when Khemka was headed to Singapore to oversee investments in emerging markets (EMs) for Goldman Sachs the latter was planning to exit the MF business in India since it did not achieve the desired scale.

Wider investment canvas

Khemka says managing investments in EMs was a great experience. “I had already managed funds and strategies in the developed world. I had also been managing funds in India for long. The EM opportunity allowed me to look at businesses across 25-30 countries from South Korea to Mexico. This gave me a lot of investment insights and understand how different economies have evolved over the years vis-a-vis India"" he says.

In 2017 he called it quits at Goldman Sachs and launched his entrepreneurial journey again. He started WhiteOak Capital which initially managed offshore money in its India-dedicated strategies. Later it offered AIF and PMS strategies for domestic Indian investors. However Khemka wanted to launch a mutual fund business. In September 2021 WhiteOak got Sebi approval for the same. What explains the delay? “Because it deals with retail money regulators all over the world try and ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place"" Khemka says.

WhiteOak Capitial Mutual Fund today manages AUM of about ₹1500 crore. The fund launched its first equity fund—WhiteOak Capital Flexi Cap Fund—on 12 July 2022.

The fund house plans to launch a GEM fund for Indian investors soon —once Sebi lifts the overseas investing limits for Indian mutual funds. It will be the first-of-its-kind scheme for Indian investors since it will be actively-managed by the in-house investment team of a domestic fund house rather than feeding from another international mutual fund. WhiteOak Capital has launched a similar fund in its offshore platform for foreign investors.

R﻿ecently it acquired an investment management firm that invests in developed world markets. As of now this acquisition is just to complement its offshore EM strategy where it also invests in developed markets. “For example you can take exposure to China through a French luxury brand as this country accounts for one-third of its revenues and get EM exposure through other developed world companies"" Khemka says

While the MF business will have separate fund managers and a chief investment officer the 40-member strong research team of WhiteOak will be shared across AIF PMS and MF.

What next?

In the coming years Khemka expects the ₹40-trillion Indian MF industry to become much larger. He recalls the conversation he had with his boss at Goldman Sachs when he was looking to relocate to India. “The data I was sharing with my boss back in 2004 was that Indian asset management companies (AMCs) had a total AUM (assets under management) of $4 billion only while our team in the US alone managed $30 billion of assets and I had been assigned as senior portfolio manager overseeing close to $10 billion of assets.""

Khemka is very bullish about India’s investment scenario. “Today just the Indian AMCs’ equity asset base has grown to over $200 billion which is 50-times growth in dollar terms"" he says. That explains about why he is betting big on mutual funds and its growth in India.

Two cars crashed shortly before 6:49 a.m. Sunday morning.

Two occupants were pronounced dead on the scene while the third was transported to the hospital.

The third victim was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

West Hartford police identified the victims as Raheim Dante Barry Nelson 17 of Hartford Faye Dawson-Judkins 52 of Hartford and Novelette Bailey 55 of Hartford.

Officials say Raheim Dante Barry Nelson was the son of Faye Dawson Judkins.

The road was shut down from Mohegan Drive to Bloomfield Avenue for an accident investigation but has since reopened.

“We are deeply saddened and heartbroken by the tragic loss of life especially during this holiday season” said Mayor Shari G. Cantor. “The families and friends of those involved in today’s incident will be in our thoughts and prayers.”

West Hartford has seen multiple fatal crashes recently including a 60-year-old Bridgeport resident who died after being struck by a car and an 89-year-old West Hartford resident who was killed in a hit and run.

In light of these events Mayor Cantor says she has spoken with the Town Manager to convene a task force on traffic and pedestrian safety.

“The Town Council wants actionable steps we can take to make our roads safer” said Cantor.

The Town Manager Richard C. Ledwith said the safety of residents and travelers on roads are always a top priority.

“Although the fatal motor vehicle collisions that have occurred in town over the last week are isolated incidents any loss of life is unacceptable” said Ledwith. “We are constantly studying evaluating and improving road safety and plans are already underway to step those efforts up with the creation of a traffic and pedestrian safety task force.”

Police Chief Vernon Riddick urged pedestrians and motor vehicle operators to follow traffic laws.

“There are many factors that come into play involving motor vehicle collisions and especially motor vehicle and pedestrian collisions” said Chief Riddick. “The consequences of a crash between a 4000 pound vehicle and a human being can result in death or serious physical injury. Motor vehicle operators and pedestrians must comply with the law. Moreover I strongly urge motor vehicle operators and pedestrians to avoid distractions such as cell phones ear phones etc. and to focus their attention on the road – literally lives depend upon it.”

Many residents think the task force is a good idea.

The tragedy on Sunday is the latest deadly crash in town.

“Obviously it’s horrible” said Tamara Schmidt of West Hartford.

Town officials say the collisions are isolated but regardless any loss of life is unacceptable.

“I’m glad to hear about the task force” said Jill Shalan of West Hartford. “Make it a lot safer a lot quicker. Yeah get people off their phones.”

“I don’t know if people need to just take more pause in their lives or what. It’s just being more aware of other people really” said Tamara Schmidt of West Hartford.

Tamara thinks the task force is a good idea.

“Yeah fantastic. Whatever they can come up with to try to come up with a solution I say more power to them” Tamara said.

West Hartford residents hope to see safety improve throughout town.

“I think ever since COVID people have been driving worse either too fast or too slow and they’re on their phones” said Jill.

Plans are already underway though specific details have not yet been released.

More details on that task force will be released in the coming days.

There have been three total fatal crashes within the last two weeks.

Officials are asking drivers to avoid distractions behind the wheel.

Three people have died following an accident on Simsbury Road.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

Oil production in Guyana and Brazil is expected to substantially increase in 2023 successfully anchoring production growth in the Latin America region according to Hart Energy- a globally-recognised provider of information on the petroleum industry.

Hart Energy in a report published on Thursday detailed that Guyana and Brazil are expected to produce an additional 850000 barrels of oil per day in 2023 from new oil ships.

Although other countries in the region including Colombia Mexico and Venezuela are oil producers the report said that the continental neighbours will see greater output.

“…the lion’s share of the production will come from developments in exploration hotspots Brazil and Guyana” the report noted.

With production underway at two developments- the Liza I and Liza II- in Guyana’s prolific Stabroek Block the country is already producing about 360000 barrels of oil per day.

Production at this block is managed by an ExxonMobil-led consortium that includes the United States’ Hess Corporation and China’s CNOOC.

According to Hart Energy in late 2023 once production at the new development Payara starts output should increase by 220000 barrels of oil per day.

At Payara a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel or oil ship known as the Liza Prosperity will produce oil.

In 2025 and 2026 new developments at the Yellowtail and Uaru projects are expected to come on stream.

Meanwhile Petrobras estimates that another 630000 barrels of oil will be added to Brazil’s production in 2023. This output is expected to come from five oil ships.

The report also noted that another 13 new oil ships will start production in Brazil between 2024 and 2027.

For years New York JFK has been a hotel wasteland. The two top properties used to be the Hilton Garden Inn and Sheraton JFK. That Sheraton left the brand in mid-2018 and was mostly used as a homeless shelter after that.

In recent times I’ve preferred the Hilton JFK. It’s a mediocre property but towered above other options near the airport. Rooms were generally clean there was a restaurant and a club lounge and a coffee shop where employees often showed up late.

I want to love the TWA Hotel. It’s gorgeous and certainly most convenient since it’s literally on the airport grounds. However it’s expensive even before you start talking about food options and the nickel and diming there is outrageous (they charge guests extra for use of the pool after 11 a.m. much of the year!).

Recently I needed a JFK airport hotel night and I really did want to stay at the TWA Hotel but couldn’t justify $295++ out of my own pocked when I could try the still-new Hyatt Regency JFK at Resorts World using a category 1-4 free night certificate. I normally have a hard time using these (and just take 10000 points when they expire) because my leisure stays are mostly with my wife and daughter where I want a confirmed suite but suite upgrades can’t be used with free night certificates. On this stay I was on my own.

Getting To The Hyatt Regency JFK Resorts World From JFK Airport

The Hyatt Regency JFK Resorts World turns out to be a fantastic hotel! The only downside is that there’s no hotel shuttle. Then again hotel shuttles if you have luggage can be a pain at JFK. You need to factor in transportation to and from the hotel. Both Uber and Lyft wanted ~ $24 from JFK terminal 8 when I arrived.

Arriving At The Hotel

There’s an entrance straight into the hotel before first there’s an entrance to the arcade that leads to the casino. I walked in that door on arrival and was struck by how separate the casino element was here. You can see it in the distance. Instead I turned left down a corridor and into the hotel portion of the complex.

I walked past the 24 hour market and up to the check-in desks. There was one person checking in ahead of me but I was quickly assisted by an agent at the next desk.

The woman let me know I’d been upgraded to a suite and provided a welcome letter. This hotel is reportedly very good about upgrading Globalists to available Executive Suites. A manager stepped in and explained the club lounge which is down a corridor behind the check-in desk. We were past evening appetizers but he suggested I grab a drink there once I’d put my stuff down in my room. He walked me to the elevator and told me about using my key card for access to guest floors. And I was on my way up.

Suite Upgrade At The Hyatt Regency JFK

I was assigned to an Executive Suite on the 10th floor room 1013. It had a half bath in the entryway and then a corridor to the living room with desk area coffee bar and refrigerator and a couch.

Then there was a separate bedroom and off of that the master bath that was quite large with separate shower and toilet room as well as bathtub.

Rather striking for a Hyatt Regency – Le Labo toiletries – not wall mounted but in individual bottles – this hotel was speaking my love language.

Club Lounge

Here was the welcome letter which – among other things – explained the club lounge (which was available as an upcharge for any guest).

The club lounge is on a ground floor. It’s small but it was never busy while I was here. In fact there were never more than a couple of other guests there. The hotel itself seemed remarkably empty at the time though. Operating at anything close to capacity goals I wonder if this club would be overrun.

It’s accessible 24 hours via key card with drinks in a refrigerator and a coffee machine providing coffee access before the 24 hour market offers it.

I wasn’t there for the evening spread but the morning breakfast offerings were quite good – hot items (eggs potatos pancakes pork and chicken sausage) smoked salmon breads meats cheeses fruits pastries and more.

Overall just like with the hotel’s overall design and little touches like Le Labo individual toiletries in my suite I was impressed by the club’s lounge.

24 Hour Market

The hotel has a 24 hour market and I was excited to think it meant access to proper espresso drinks when I first woke up. I walked downstairs only to discover that it’s a grab ‘n go (you register your purchase at the front desk) until 7 a.m. when service is available. So I stopped in at the club lounge for a coffee from their machine with a packaged creamer. That wound up sufficing albeit barely.

Hyatt Regency JFK Overall

There’s a roughly $50 roundtrip transportation cost to factor when considering this hotel for an airport layover compared to an airport property with complimentary shuttle. However the hotel is also clearly nicer than anything besides the TWA Hotel. And as a Globalist I’d choose this hotel over the Hilton since it’s far nicer and the Hilton never did upgrade me to a suite when I was a Diamond. The club lounge at the Hyatt is also nicer than the Hilton.

Overall the property – from Globalist recognition to details in the room to the club lounge – exceeded my expectations.

The Hyatt Regency JFK at Resorts World will be my new go-to for New York JFK airport overnights and the cost of a roundtrip Uber will be worth it for the speed and convenience compared schlepping over to the shuttle pickup and then waiting for a hotel shuttle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5mbC5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3dib3lzLXQteS1oaWx0b24tYWZ0ZXItZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2luZy10aGlyZC1kb3duLWNhdGNoLXRoYXQtcy13aGF0LWktZG8tbWFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cowboys' T.Y.

Some of them are among the best laptops you can buy. HP’s Spectre x360 13.5 is a prime example making our lists of both the best 2-in-1s and best laptops and for quite some time representing the best that the class has to offer.

But Asus has been a serious player in this form factor as well putting out several machines that have been close to making both lists. Its latest ZenBook S 13 Flip is a prime example and it has an ace up its sleeve: it’s a very light laptop that makes it easier to use as a tablet. Does that give it enough to dethrone the Spectre x360 13.5?

The ZenBook S 13 Flip UP5302 still isn’t available for sale but when it is there will be just one configuration in the US. For $1500 you’ll get a Core i7-1260P 16GB of RAM a 1TB SSD and a 2.8K OLED display.

The Spectre x360 13.5 has a range of options on the other hand starting at $1250 for a Core i5-1535U 8GB of RAM a 512GB SSD and a 13.5-inch WUXGA+ display. You can fork out up to $1825 for a Core i7-1255U 16GB of RAM  a 2TB SSD and a 3K2K OLED display. If you opt for an IPS panel you can also configure 32GB of RAM .

Design

The Spectre x360 13.5 has perhaps the most refined aesthetic among all 2-in-1s with a subdued gem-cut design that’s rounded in all the right places and comfortable to hold. It has colored accents that add some panache without going overboard and offers three color schemes in Natural Silver Nightfall Black and Nocturne Blue. The ZenBook S 13 Flip on the other hand is quite minimalist with Ponder Blue (the only color in the US) or Refined White colors and simpler lines. Both are attractive laptops but the HP sticks out.

In terms of their construction the Spectre x360 13.5 is all-aluminum and enjoys a rigid design with no bending flexing or twisting. The ZenBook S 13 Flip is also quite solid even though it uses magnesium which tends to result in some bending and flexing in other machines. Where the ZenBook is most impressive is its weight coming in at just 2.43 pounds compared to the Spectre’s 3.01 pounds and it’s also considerably thinner at 0.59 inches versus 0.67 inches. They’re close to the same width and depth although the HP is slightly deeper thanks to its taller 3:2 display versus the ZenBook’s 16:10.

The Spectre x360 13.5’s keyboard is snappier and more precise than the ZenBook S 13 Flip’s but both are great for long typing sessions. They both have large touchpads that are responsive with quiet button clicks but Asus adds its NumberPad 2.0 LED numeric keypad for anyone who enters a lot of numbers.

Connectivity is identical with both offering Thunderbolt 4 ports for contemporary device support and a legacy USB-A port. Wireless connectivity is up-to-date on both as well.

The HP does have a 5MP webcam that’s theoretically higher resolution than the Asus’s 1080p version but both provide excellent video quality. HP builds in a few more tools to optimize video but there’s no huge advantage here. Both use infrared cameras to support Windows 11 Hello passwordless login via facial recognition and the Spectre also features a fingerprint reader if you prefer that login method.

Performance

The Spectre x360 13.5 uses Intel 12th-gen U-series CPUs which are 15-watt chips with 10 cores (two Performance and eight Efficient) and 12 threads. The ZenBook S 13 Flip uses P-series processors with the same core and thread counts but runs at 28 watts. In our benchmarks both laptops provided excellent productivity performance and the Asus was just slightly ahead on a couple of our benchmarks. You won’t want to choose between these laptops based on performance alone.

Display

The Spectre x360 13.5 has a few 13.5-inch 3:2 display options including WXUGA+ (1920 x 1280) IPS panels with and without privacy screens and a 3K2K (3000 x 2000) OLED panel that we reviewed. The ZenBook S 13 Flip comes with just a 13.3-inch 16:10 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED display. Both are excellent with the HP being a bit brighter having slightly deeper contrast and better color accuracy. But again you won’t want to choose either laptop based on its display.

Portability

We’ve already reported that the Zenbook S 13 Flip is lighter and thinner than the Spectre x360 13.5 and it’s enough to make a difference particularly in tablet mode. You’ll find both laptops easy to carry around but if you want to hold the tablet for inking the ZenBook will be more comfortable.

Thanks to its lower-wattage CPU the Spectre x360 13.5 got better battery life on all but the PCMark 10 Applications test where the results were close enough to even. You can likely expect about an hour more longevity from the HP in most usage conditions and that too isn’t enough to differentiate these laptops.

The Spectre is more refined but the ZenBook wins on size

You’ll spend about the same amount for similarly configured machines so set the price aside. You’ll get similar performance battery life and display quality so those aren’t significant differentiators either.

Where the ZenBook S 13 Flip wins out is in its lightness and its thinness. If you want a laptop that looks great and stands out then the Spectre is for you. But for the typical person the ZenBook S 13 Flip ends up being the winner.

The year witnessed the ruling BJP's fight to maintain the dominance in the Parliament and state assemblies.Out of all BJP bagged own record breaking win in Gujarat won Uttar Pradesh Goa Manipur and Uttrakhand. BJP also toppled down the Shiv Sena Government in Maharashtra and formed alliance government there.The action-packed year saw BJP's victories in high-stakes state polls tussle over chief minister posts Congress campaign to 'unite the country' maritime show of strength and India's G20 presidency.BJP lost two states- Punjab Himachal Pradesh and crucial Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections. However it was important for the BJP to win in Himachal Pradesh as party President J.P. Nadda and Union Minister Anurag Thakur hail from the hill state. The Himachal Pradesh outcome is instructive of the latent anti-incumbency that the BJP faces and the Opposition's occasional capacity to harness it.In MCD it was a direct fight with Aam Adami Party (AAP) which rules in Delhi. Winning MCD 2022 AAP broke the streak of BJP maintained from last 15 years. This is also a major setback for BJP.After losing these elections BJP got a shot in the arm as it retained the government in Gujarat and now has kickstarted its preparation for 2024 Lok Sabha elections.A two-day meeting in Delhi organised by the BJP for its national office-bearers functionaries in charge of states and various frontal organisations and presidents and general secretaries in charge of the organisation in states is being seen as a stock-taking exercise by the party.The Lok Sabha elections are more than a year away but the BJP has geared up keeping itself busy on the ideological and organisational fronts and dominating at the macro and micro levels.The BJP may never have felt as secure as it is today about the public acceptance of its Hindutva ideology. The inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya  now scheduled for December 2023 will be a prelude to the 2024 campaign anyway.The party will be facing some crucial Assembly elections in 2023 in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh where it is in power and in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh which it wants to wrest back. Speculations are rife that J.P. Nadda whose term as president ends in January will remain in charge in the run-up to the 2024 general elections.Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged BJP leaders to ensure that India's Presidency for the G20 Summit be made an inclusive event as it is an opportunity to showcase the country's culture and diversity. He also asked the party leaders to make every Indian feel proud of this achievement and make them also a participant of this historic occasion.G20 is also a great platform for BJP to solid the people's confidence in its favour. Success of G20 meet may give an edge to BJP in Lok Sabha election in 2024. Construction of Ayodhya's Ram Temple floor where Lord Ram will be seated will also be completed by the end of 2023 that again could be a bonus point for BJP.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2xlZ2VuZGFyeS10dW5pbmctc2hvcHMtamFwYW5lc2UtYXV0by10dW5pbmctc2NlbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Most Legendary Tuning Shops In The Japanese Auto Tuning Scene,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2xlZ2VuZGFyeS10dW5pbmctc2hvcHMtamFwYW5lc2UtYXV0by10dW5pbmctc2NlbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

The Columbus Metropolitan Library is more than books – something that’s apparent every day but especially at the holidays.

The main library located Downtown is in festive shape with a Christmas tree made of books a merry diorama of woodland creatures and the Huntington Holiday Train – celebrating its 30th anniversary – all on display in the lobby.

About the Huntington Holiday Train

The train was built in 1992 by Paul Busse who also designed the Garden Railway at Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. The original home of the Holiday Train was the Huntington Bank Downtown.

Since 2009 the train has been shown during the holidays at the library with the exception of the library’s 2015 renovation year and the 2020 year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the library the train covers more than 600 square feet has more than 280 feet of train track 50 pounds of “snow” and multiple trains traveling through the layers of the exhibit.

Busse designed the buildings after real churches homes and stores in Bavarian towns in Germany and constructed them all of natural materials including bark leaves seeds pinecones and moss. There’s a castle a cathedral and a waterfall. He created miniature townspeople vendors and children who gather and watch the trains pass by.

At the library’s holiday open house earlier this month the more than 4000 people attending enjoyed this year’s version of the train.

“It’s assembled a little different every year and it’s magic every year” said Ben Zenitsky media specialist for the library.

Charming 'Weasel Burrow' still a big hit

When my adult daughters were little one of our holiday traditions was visiting “Weasel Burrow” at the main library. Created in 1990 by design students at Columbus College of Art & Design the charming diorama has stood the test of time.

The detailed glass-encased scene this year is located on the first floor in the children’s area of the library. Throughout the clever landscape anthropomorphic critters – turtles squirrels rabbits mice birds beavers and of course weasels – celebrate Christmas.

In their underground house little forest creatures gather near a Christmas tree and a fireplace mice toddlers sleep in a cozy bedroom a mama squirrel tends to dinner at the stove a toad takes a bath and a little bunny wanders around in pink bunny slippers.

Above ground a group of turtles and rabbits sing carols a chipmunk skates on an icy pond and a big beaver seems stuck trying to get out of a tree hole. The whole scene is a delight with unending characters to look at.

More art at the library

While the holiday attractions continue only through Jan. 8 many more art works can be found year-round at the Main Library and 22 branch libraries.

Through Ohio’s Percent for Art program in new and renovated buildings and the library system’s own portion of renovation budgets dedicated to art works many paintings sculptures photographs and works in other mediums are displayed.

Among these at the main library is Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson’s colorful “Sellsville & Blackberry Patch” mural ascending the lobby staircase; Todd Slaughter’s suspended sculpture “Vanitas” in the atrium; Virginia Overton’s outdoor sculptures on the east plaza made from marble salvaged from the library’s 2015-16 renovation; Ann Hamilton’s ink jet prints “book weight” located near bookshelves and much more. These attractive and stimulating works of art add a visual dimension to the powerful media force of the library.

Dropping your kid off at college has long been a milestone for parents just as much as their teens. But is getting a degree going the way of bell bottoms cable television and calling someone on the phone?

With a strong economy and an excess of jobs with few workers to take them big companies like Google IBM and Delta Air Lines have eased up on educational requirements in an effort to find hires based on skills and experience instead.

With a four-year degree perhaps seemingly not as crucial for Americans climbing the career ladder as it once was — young people might be rethinking the need for higher education as well.

“It's a bit [like] musical chairs right now” says Alicia Modestino an associate professor and labor economist at Northeastern University. “We're seeing a lot of people shift jobs move up in the labor market. That’s great.”

However she warns that with the Fed raising interest rates in an effort to quell inflation Americans need to be prepared for the job market to slow in the coming months.

“Pretty soon the music's going to stop — so you want to have someplace to land that's going to be good for the long term.”

Employers responding to tight labor market

The tech industry in particular has been struggling with a talent shortage since pre-pandemic times.

Google and 150 other companies use the tech giant’s online college-alternative program to train and hire entry-level workers reports The Wall Street Journal. And according to CNBC IBM doesn’t ask for a bachelor’s degree for half of its U.S. roles.

Bank of America also doesn’t request college degrees for most of its entry-level jobs while Delta says degrees for pilot applicants are “preferred” but not required.

And applicants for thousands of government jobs in the state of Maryland no longer need a bachelor’s degree — instead they can submit any relevant work experience military training or other educational certificates.

This shift arrives during a thriving labor market with low unemployment and high job vacancies. And although there’s been talk of that coming to an end the Labor Department’s latest jobs report indicated that hiring slowed only slightly in November with 263000 jobs added last month compared to 284000 jobs in October.

Story continues

Modestino adds there’s precedent for this approach. During the Great Recession employers responded by focusing on skill requirements in addition to educational requirements since there were more college-educated workers available to them.

It may not be an actual ‘culture shift’

So should parents stop putting cash away for their kids’ college tuition? Modestino is “pessimistic” about whether big employers relaxing their educational credential requirements is truly part of a “culture shift.”

And with recent shifts in the economy she has concerns about the future of work.

“Looking at where we are in terms of the business cycle and what the Fed’s doing with interest rates [there’s] the potential for us to overshoot and tip into a recession” Modestino warns.

The Fed raised its federal funds rate for the seventh time this year and more hikes are expected to arrive in 2023. Experts like Modestino worry this could trigger a recession which would mean a slowdown in hiring and potential job and salary cuts.

Modestino advised her own son — who has a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice — that he needs to capitalize on the hot job market and get on a career path.

“We don't know if it’s going to be a soft landing in the labor market in the next six months” she says. “So I would certainly urge any young people … that now's the time to make those decisions. Because I do worry that the window’s closing on those opportunities.”

She anticipates that when workers are plentiful again and employers have many applications to sift through many companies will “revert back to the lowest common denominator” when they’re hiring — a four-year college degree.

So is getting a bachelor’s degree actually worth it?

Parents may have long encouraged their kids to pursue higher education but Modestino points out that there are many jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree. And so making that big decision about whether to go to college should depend more on the young person’s career goals.

For example you don’t need a bachelor’s degree to become a phlebotomist but it’ll likely require a certification in phlebotomy. On the other hand a PhD is necessary to become a tenured college professor.

That said having more credentials can look good on a resume and open doors for inexperienced workers — especially when job opportunities aren’t as abundant and employers can afford to be choosy.

In a recession or weaker labor market having an academic credential to your name can often have a “sheepskin effect” Modestino says — an economic phenomenon where employers pay higher wages to workers with degrees.

A study from Georgetown University found that bachelor’s degree holders earn 31% more than those with an associate’s degree and 84% more than someone with a high school diploma. But higher education doesn’t always equate to higher earnings.

“When you're in a labor market like this we've seen wages actually rising faster at the bottom because they're so desperate for talent. And so [employers are] actually trying to hire on talent and reward on talent rather than just a credential” explains Modestino.

But keep in mind that students pay a price for that extra earning potential. With about 43 million borrowers in the U.S. who owe over $1.6 trillion in student debt getting a degree isn’t always worth the financial burden. Parents pushing their kids to get higher education just for the sake of it might want to have a bigger conversation about whose interests they’re prioritizing.

“There's been this message for at least the last two decades that college is the only pathway” says Modestino.

“That's been a disservice I think to some young people who would have been better off going to a vocational technical school or taking a different pathway through workforce training and development.”

Editor’s note:The following story by Charlene Nevada appeared in the Akron Beacon Journal’s Lifestyle section on Wednesday Feb. 3 1982.

When Ray Thomas’ twins were born he was standing at the hospital nursery admiring them.

“Aren’t they beauitiful” commented another woman who was also looking at the babies.

Thomas the proud father admitted they were his.

“How wonderful” the woman said. “Are they your first?”

“No” said Thomas. “They’re my eighth and ninth.”

“My God that’s unpatriotic” she exclaimed.

Average Joe writes about 1982 article:A holiday toast to angels who light the way

NOW NINE YEARS and three more babies later Thomas can laugh about the incident. But at the time he was quite angry.

Thomas and his wife Marie Ann who were married in 1959 always wanted a large family — and the 12 children they have now suit them just fine.

And while not cheaper by the dozen they are a lot more fun.

The Thomases eat dinner at an IBM conference table. They sit on church pews. And the family members have lots of stories to tell about being part of a big family. Yes they have left a couple of children in the bathroom while on a trip once.

As far as actually planning each child says Mrs. Thomas “We didn’t do that. But we never had an unwanted pregnancy.”

IN ORDER THE Thomases are: Jerry who will be 21 on Sunday; Brian who will be 20 later this month; Theresa 18; Kevin 16; Jimmy 13; Danny who will be 12 later this month; Ann Marie 10; Joe and Molly the twins who will be 9 on Sunday; Mary Beth 7; David 4; and Kathleen 8 months.

All of the children except Theresa — who is at Kent State — live at home.

At a time when families are getting smaller a family this size doesn’t go unnoticed.

The Thomases aren’t part of a trend to be sure. In fact the latest census statistics show the average married woman today will have 1.8 children. By comparison a woman 15 years ago would have had three children. Families formed during the ’50s had an average of four children.

But this large family seemed worth looking at not because they are so unusual but because they work so well as a family unit.

THOMAS 45 SAYS he is “amazed when people are amazed” that the family gets along so well.

“But you can’t live in peace with this many people without learning to accommodate” says son Brian.

Thomas is executive director of the Summit County Association for Retarded Citizens. Previously he was with the Catholic Youth Organization.

His job he says is not a high-paying one “but we adjust accordingly. We enjoy each other rather than a lot of frills. It’s a lifestyle we prefer.”

THE THOMASES spend $100 to $120 a week on groceries. Mom and Dad shop together every Friday night.

“It’s the most expensive date we have” he says.

Mrs. Thomas buys generics and clips coupons. But she doesn’t spend hours clipping coupons to the exclusion of other things.

The Thomases generally shop two or three stores for the best bargains.

“We don’t usually plan seconds and we rarely have leftovers she says. At the same time nobody leaves the table hungry.

Snacks are usually healthy things — apples and cheese. During the winter breakfast is cooked cereal which is a lot cheaper than dry cereal.

Once laughs Mrs. Thomas Hunt-Wesson offered a promotion to families. A homemaker could write the company telling the amount of money spent on food each week and the size of the family. The company would in turn supply sample menus. When Mrs. Thomas sent in the data the company sent back a reply “that obviously I was not feeding my family well and should apply for food stamps.”

But the Thomases are feeding the family well they don’t get food stamps and they don’t feel like they are doing without anything.

The three oldest are in college although Jerry — who is enrolled at the University of Akron — is not taking any classes this semester so he can earn money to return next term.

The younger children — those who are school-age — all attend parochial schools.

“I MADE THEM a deal” says Thomas who is president of the Catholic Board of Education. “I would send them through parochial school and they would have to put themselves throigh college. So far they are getting the better part of the deal.”

Two of the three oldest have managed to get grants to help pay college costs although that could change if federal education money becomes more scarce.

But most of the children have also worked to help pay their own expenses. Theresa for instance wanted to spend at least a year living on campus so she worked at McDonald’s and a number of other place to save the money for room and board.

Two of the boys work at the Akron Automobile Club. The younger boys used to be Beacon Journal carriers.

""I made them a deal. I would send them through parochial school and they would have to put themselves throigh college. So far they are getting the better part of the deal.” Ray Thomas

THE FAMILY takes a vacation every year — and once even piled nine kids into a station wagon and headed to Florida.

Lately vacations have been at state parks.

The “lost child in the bathroom” incident happened in Chicago.

The Thomases were going from visiting one family to visiting another in two cars. But one of the younger children had to go to the bathroom — and an older one went to assist.

Each driver left — believing the “missing two” to be in the other car.

“We are driving down the Dan Ryan Expressway when this car comes up behind us honking.” says Thomas. Noses were quickly counted and realization set in.

Before anyone could figure out what to do another car came up behind them also honking. The family where the Thomases had been visiting quickly piled the stranded children into a third car and had managed to play catch-up.

THEN THERE WAS the vacation where the Thomases took one national hotel chain up on its offer that children could sleep free in the parents’ room.

Thomas registered and told the clerk he had children in his car. The Clerk handed him the pen and asked him to put their names in the register.

By the time he finished listing nine names “The clerk looked pretty disgusted.”

Of course people are always going up to one or other of the children asking “Which number are you?”

Kevin tells them: “We don’t have numbers we have names.”

But once Danny the sixth-grader at St. Sebastian’s got confused when someone asked his number.

He responded: “85.”

“It was his soccer number and all he could think of” says Mom.

WHEN PEOPLE come up to Mrs. Thomas and make comments about the family size she simply tells them “’They are my husband’s by his first wife.’ Everyone thinks you are wonderful for taking care of them.”

She doesn’t always add that she is her husband’s first wife.

Mrs. Thomas 43 is a registered nurse which makes her invaluable for fixing up scrapes. Before her family got so large she worked in the delivery room at Akron General Medical Center. But she kept getting pregnant and finally concluded that pregnancy “must be a communicable disease.”

The Thomases live in a five-bedroom house on Akron’s west side. They bought it in 1970 before interest rates and home prices went sky-high.

THE IBM conference table wound up in their home quite by accident. A friend heard IBM was getting rid of some equipment and made a bid thinking the table could be used at one of the group homes for the retarded that Thomas had been instrumental in setting up.

But by the time the friend told Thomas about the table other eating arrangements had been made for the group home.

At that point the Thomas family was getting bigger and the old dinner table smaller. So Thomas bought the table from the friend.

St. Bernard’s was doing some remodeling shortly after that and had removed some pews from the church. They just fit the IBM table.

The main floor of the Thomas house has no TV. Although there is a portable set in the basement that gets carried around occasionally the Thomases spend more time putting together puzzles and playing Monopoly.

“People think you have to spend a lot of money to have a good time” says Thomas “but we don’t.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnVzaW5lc3Mtam91cm5hbC9jZW50ZW5lLWNvcnBvcmF0aW9uLWxvc2VzLTY1LWJpbGxpb24tZGVmZW5zZS1oZWFsdGgtY29udHJhY3QvNjMtNzAyYjkwNzQtYTU3Zi00NjBlLThkODItYjQ4MWI0YWQxMjgx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Centene Corporation not given $65B defense health contract,"Centene said in a statement that ""we are disappointed by the DHA's decision.""

CLAYTON Mo. — The U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday bypassed Centene Corp. (NYSE: CNC) in awarding $136 billion in contracts for the health insurance provided to active-duty military members a blow to the Clayton giant and St. Louis' largest public company by revenue which has long held some of the work.

The Defense Health Agency said it was awarding the TRICARE contract for its west region to TriWest Healthcare Alliance of Phoenix owned by Blue Cross Blue Shield nonprofits including Blue Shield of California Regence Blue Shield and BCBS of Arizona along with the University of Colorado Hospital Authority and the University of New Mexico Hospital.

The $65.1 billion contract held by Centene for years through its Health Net Federal Services subsidiary includes a 12-month transition-in period plus eight one-year option periods a Defense Department spokesman said. The west includes 1.5 million beneficiaries in Arkansas Illinois Louisiana Oklahoma Texas and Wisconsin.

Centene said in a statement that ""we are disappointed by the DHA's decision.""

""We have a debriefing scheduled with the DHA in early January and have requested details to which we are entitled under the government's procedure rules"" it said. ""Following receipt of this information we will be in a position to determine our options regarding the Agency's decision.""

Centene this year lost another major award when the California Department of Health Care Services announced in August its intent to award contracts for Medicaid managed care contracts to Centene’s subsidiary Health Net of California Inc. in nine counties but not in others including Los Angeles and Sacramento counties. Centene is preparing to take legal action if a California state agency rejects its protest over how bidders were chosen. And Centene which has had a stagnant stock price this year has grappled with allegations of improper Medicaid billing to states. It's set aside $1.1 billion to resolve the claims which are now also the subject of a shareholder lawsuit against ex-Centene executives.

Responding to Thursday's decision TriWest said in a statement that several entities were also assisting it with the work: Accenture Blue Health Intelligence BizFlow Cognitive Medical Systems eviCore EXL FindHelp HealthSparq IBM MDLIVE MyRevelations Omada PsychArmor PGBA Signature Performance and Wells Fargo.

It also said it previously held TRICARE contracts with the Defense Department for 17 years beginning in 1996 through 2013 also in the western U.S.

Many know Single Root I/O Virtualization or SR-IOV. The new standard is emerging as Scalable IO Virtualization. Originally this was donated as an Intel specification but it is now part of OCP. The main goal of Scalable IOV is to provide performance paths to access hardware while that hardware is shared in an increasingly virtualized containerize and composable infrastructure.

Scalable IO Virtualization is Replacing SR-IOV

These days SR-IOV is well supported but it is not perfect. SR-IOV was designed originally for 20 or so VMs. The vast majority of cloud instances are 8 vCPUs or less. As we move to 60-128 cores/ 120-256 threads in 2023 and then into several hundred cores per socket going forward each CPU in a dual socket server will easily eclipse that 20 VM mark. Beyond that new devices and topologies with things like CXL mean that the industry needs a different solution. That solution seems like it is going to be Scalable IO Virtualization or Scalable IOV.

The main benefits that OCP members like Microsoft are touting are scalability flexibility over-provisioning and compatibility. For those wondering SR-IOV can still be supported with backward compatibility in a Scalable IOV system.

Scalable IOV uses hardware-assisted efficient routing and has different modes for direct path and intercepted path functions. The intercepted path can be handled in software or on an embedded controller. While allowing more fine-grained and performance and access.

Final Words

If you want some holiday reading material checking out the OCP Scalable I/O Virtualization spec would be a great way to learn more. At STH we will cover Scalable IOV as we start to see it more in future generations of servers.

Since it is Christmas Eve and I am on my second-to-last flight of 2022 I just wanted to share some of my holiday reading material that I have had bookmarked since it was presented at the OCP Summit 2022 Keynote a few months ago. Tomorrow we will have our Q4 Letter from the Editor but I wanted to get a quick piece up and say Merry Christmas to the STH community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvbWV0ZW9yLWxha2UtZGVza3RvcC1jcHUtcnVtb3JlZC1zY3JhcHBlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Meteor Lake-S Desktop CPU Rumored Scrapped In Favor Of Raptor Lake-S Refresh,"Given that the latest rumors probably shouldn't be surprising: Intel may have canned plans to bring Meteor Lake to the desktop. This rumor comes by way of Raichu (@OneRaichu on Twitter) whose tweet you can see below. MTL-S refers to desktop Meteor Lake processors. The rumored configuration for these chips was 6 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores which would be pretty unlikely to unseat the 6GHz Raptor Lake Core i9-13900KS in any case.





According to leaked roadmaps Meteor Lake was originally intended to come after Alder Lake but seemingly difficulties with the manufacturing process led to it being delayed. That resulted in the creation of Raptor Lake which is more than just a refresh of Alder Lake but still very closely-related.







Intel's desktop Raptor Lake processors are insanely fast  to be sure. A significant portion of that speed originates with their sky-high clock rates and to hit those numbers it needs quite a bit of power. Rumors have been swirling for a bit that Meteor Lake fabricated primarily on Intel's next-gen ""Intel 4"" process wouldn't be able to hit those kinds of clock rates. That's fine for mobile but it doesn't look great if the company's next desktop generation is slower than the previous. See: AMD Bulldozer If you're lost let us explain. Meteor Lake is the code name for Intel's next generation of client processors. It is to be the first generation of Intel processors to use chiplets—or to stick to Intel's own nomenclature ""tiles""—making it a ""disaggregated"" processor. The idea is that it would have separate tiles for the Intel Architecture (x86-64) processor cores for an Alchemist-derived GPU and for the ""uncore"" elements of the processor not totally unlike AMD's Ryzen processors.Now the latest leaks on the subject seem to indicate that we're going to see a refresh of Raptor Lake possibly on the same socket and platform . That'll slot into the product stack where Meteor Lake desktop processors would have gone. In that sense it looks like the next generation of Intel processors will be somewhat like the relationship between the 11th-generation Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake processors where the mobile models were significantly different from the desktop processors from the ""same generation"" (in marketing terms).If Raichu's latest rumor is true then it means that we're likely to see Raptor Lake mobile and a Raptor Lake refresh in 2023 with a possible launch of Meteor Lake for just mobile late in the year or early in 2024. It will be interesting to see if Intel can bring any major changes to Raptor Lake with the refresh. Team Blue could face major competition from Team Red if rumors about AMD's Zen 4 ""X3D"" processors are accurate."

She was affectionally known as “Linda Faye” until her grands came along and gave her another name.

Linda attended and graduated from the Plum Bayou Tucker School District and was selected as Valedictorian of her class; however she was unable to complete school during that year. She returned the following year to graduate as Salutatorian of the Class of 1968.

Linda was described as a genius! Her little sister JoAnn would often ask her questions and Linda always knew the answer. JoAnn remembered always saying “Nonna (Linda) knows everything!” At a very young age she was tasked with keeping the tax books for Alex Brown and she did it quick with ease and made no mistakes! After high school Linda enrolled in classes at Capitol City Business College and completed her coursework to earn a degree. Her education skills and natural smartness landed her in positions at the Pine Bluff Arsenal AM&N/UAPB International Paper and later Evergreen Packaging.

Linda Tillmon met the love of her life – Roy Kirkland – early in life and a son (Carl L. Kirkland) was born and died on January 1 1967. Two (2) years later Danita Michelle was born on April 5 1969 and Roy Kirkland Jr. was then born on June 13 1977 – only a week after Roy Sr.’s born day of June 20th. Although Roy and Linda divorced after several years of marriage Linda was devastated of Roy’s passing on January 1 1997 – the same day as their 1st child’s born and death day.

Linda accepted the Lord as her Personal Savior at New Hope AME Church but later changed her membership to New Salem MBC under the leadership of Pastor Clark E. Thomas. She remained as a faithful Usher Deaconess and member until her demise. During her tenure she also served as a Sunday School Teacher the Prison Ministry Coordinator and a Trustee. Her favorite scripture was Psalms 73. She enjoyed traveling with the church and making sure that her “Grands” had the ability to travel to various states as well. Perhaps her greatest love was playing the role of “Julie” in many Christmas plays written by Pastor Thomas. Linda gave up her acting role only a few years ago.

Linda’s memory will forever be cherished by her daughter Danita Kirkland of Jacksonville AR and her son Roy Kirkland Jr. of Pine Bluff AR.; Two (2) brothers – Curtis (Margaret) Brown of Sherrill AR. And Corey (Mary) Pope of Sherwood AR.; Three (3) sisters – JoAnn (Donald) White of Monroe LA Karen (Darrell) Marshall of Sacramento CA and Kathy Pope of Tucker AR. Her grandchildren who affectionately called her “Grandma Fuji” are Kenneth Manning of Pine Bluff AR. Alexander Manning of Kansas City MO Shanai Manning of Jacksonville AR and Braylon Kirkland of Pine Bluff AR. She will be greatly missed by her Great Grands Kennedi and Kendyn who she referred to as her “Greaties!” Her nieces – Tomeka Shanetta Leslie and Shavonjia will miss her dearly; as well as her nephews Marco and Curtis Jr. She will never forget her cousins in laws church members and friends; especially Linda Jackson (Best Friend) and Earlee Robinson and Nancy Brown. Linda was preceded in death by her aforementioned parents Carl Kirkland (infant son) Sammie Brown (brother) Connie Pope (sister) and Ashlea White (niece).

A celebration of life is scheduled for Saturday December 31 2022 11:00 a.m. at New Salem Missionary Baptist Church with Pastor Clark E. Thomas officiating. Our dear friend will lie in state on Friday December 30 2022 from 5:00pm-6:00pm at New Community Church.

This is an important paper that makes a number of key points but the bottom line is we must act immediately to address the climate crisis. Hansen uses the framing ""human-made geoengineering of Earth’s climate must be rapidly phased out” to call for emissions elimination Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management (SRM).</p>

Here is a summary of some of the key points of this quite long (48 page) paper:</p>

1. The Earth Climate Sensitivity (ECS) — the Earth’s short-term response to a CO2 doubling — is higher than previously assumed. Most scientists said it was ~3ºC but Hansen et al now say it is 4ºC or more based on paleoclimate data. This means there is more warming “in the pipeline” than previously assumed.</p>

2. While humans have increased atmospheric CO2 by 50% since the industrial revolution the actual climate forcing from all the added greenhouse gases is now ~4W/m^2 which is equivalent to a doubling of CO2 (i.e. CO2e (including all greenhouse gases not just CO2) is about 560 ppm).</p>

3. Part of the current warming has been hidden by human-made particulate air pollution (aerosols) mainly sulfur. When North America and Europe started to reduce emissions after the introduction of clean air acts in the 1970's regional and global warming became more pronounced. In the past decades China and global shipping slashed sulfur emissions through cleaner fuels and sulfur filter systems ('scrubbers'). There are clear signals from ground ocean and satellite based observations that the rate of global warming has recently doubled which needs to be taken into account in risk assessments.</p>

4. Assuming today’s forcing (4 W/m^2) stabilizes and human-made aerosols are eliminated when all feedbacks — including “long-term” feedbacks — play out we are on track for about 10ºC warming and 6~7ºC if aerosols stay at today’s levels. This is a “scenario” and we still control our future though we are on track to increase climate forcing from today’s 4 W/m^2.</p>

If greenhouse gas forcing keeps growing at the current rate it could match the level of the PETM mass extinction within a century. We are increasing climate forcing 20X faster than in the PETM so “long-term” feedbacks won’t take as long as in the paleo record (though some feedbacks will still be much longer than a human lifetime).</p> 5.. We are increasing climate forcing 20X faster than in the PETM so “long-term” feedbacks won’t take as long as in the paleo record (though some feedbacks will still be much longer than a human lifetime).

""human-made geoengineering of Earth’s climate must be rapidly phased out” i.e. we must stop emitting greenhouse gases remove CO2 from the atmosphere and research and implement safe solar radiation management to counter the massive geoengineering experiment we are currently running; and (c) we must improve international cooperation to allow the developing world to grow using clean energy.</p> 6. The paper concludes that we must: (a) implement a carbon fee and border duty ( Fee and Dividend ); (b)i.e. we must stop emitting greenhouse gases remove CO2 from the atmosphere and research and implement safe solar radiation management to counter the massive geoengineering experiment we are currently running; and (c) we must improve international cooperation to allow the developing world to grow using clean energy.

7. A companion paper will be coming out that addresses the near-term shutdown of the AMOC and associated “multi-meter” sea level rise on a century timescale.</p>",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmFuZGJlbmNoLmNvbS9hcHByZW50aWNlLWxhd3llci9jYWxsLWZvci1wYXBlcnMtZ2xjLXNwaWwtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1sYXctam91cm5hbC1zdWJtaXQtYnktMTUtZmVi0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmFyYW5kYmVuY2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9hcHByZW50aWNlLWxhd3llci9jYWxsLWZvci1wYXBlcnMtZ2xjLXNwaWwtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1sYXctam91cm5hbC1zdWJtaXQtYnktMTUtZmVi?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Call for Papers: GLC - SPIL International Law Journal (Submit by 15 Feb),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.barandbench.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /apprentice-lawyer/call-for-papers-glc-spil-international-law-journal-submit-by-15-feb (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225631030>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmFuZGJlbmNoLmNvbS9hcHByZW50aWNlLWxhd3llci9jYWxsLWZvci1wYXBlcnMtZ2xjLXNwaWwtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1sYXctam91cm5hbC1zdWJtaXQtYnktMTUtZmVi0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmFyYW5kYmVuY2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9hcHByZW50aWNlLWxhd3llci9jYWxsLWZvci1wYXBlcnMtZ2xjLXNwaWwtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1sYXctam91cm5hbC1zdWJtaXQtYnktMTUtZmVi?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

ATLANTA — Parts of metro Atlanta's infrastructure are coming apart as the blast of arctic weather continues across the state with residents and businesses alike are feeling the harsh impacts of the sub-freezing temperatures just one day before Christmas.

Burst water pipes are now one of the major consequences being felt by places such as Delta Sky Lounge Putt Shack Lenox Square Marietta Diner and residences across the metro.

A shopper at Lenox Square captured pools of water sitting on the first floor of the mall after pipes burst causing flooding which subsequently caused the entire wing of the floor to be closed.

Another viewer captured water spewing from the ceiling as she turned the corner of one of the hallways inside the popular shopping destination just a day before Christmas.

Lenox Square released the following statement regarding the burst pipes and subsequent flooding:

""Due to extremely cold temperatures a ruptured sprinkler head in Lenox Square’s ceiling leaked water onto the common area floor. For the safety of our patrons a section of the common area was roped off by security. This swift action prevented mall patrons from traversing a potentially hazardous area and allowed housekeeping to mitigate water from spreading. Lenox Square operations staff has successfully shut off the water to the ruptured sprinkler head and cleanup efforts continue. Closed tomorrow for the observance of the Christmas holiday Lenox Square will resume its normal operations Monday Dec. 26.""

A traveler at the Atlanta airport sent 11Alive the following video on Instagram of the Delta Sky Lounge -- with water pouring down from the ceiling onto computers at one of the lobbies.

In addition to popular places such as the ones listed above residents experienced severe flooding from burst water pipes at The Atlantic Brookwood apartment complex located at 2035Peachtree Road NE in Atlanta.

Another resident experienced devastating flooding in Cobb County at the Galleria Manor Senior Apartments in Smyrna.

11Alive spoke with Phyllis Thompson who lives at that complex. She said that she first heard the alarms and then describes what she saw out of her bedroom window.

""I just saw torrential water coming down"" she said. ""And then I heard the bathroom puttering water but within the course of 10 minutes the bathroom is flooded the kitchen is -- everything is flooded. So I don't know what to do now.""

Daphne and Ron Tardy live at Galleria Manor and felt horrified seeing their bedroom.

“She opened the door and it was raining cat and dog. I mean raining! The thump she heard was that clock. The clock fell off the wall. It was right there"" Ron said.

A burst water pipe on the roof of the building caused all the damage and flooding to numerous units.

“I looked out my balcony window at my bedroom window and I just saw torrential water coming down"" Thompson said.

Thompson's apartment is also covered in inches of water.

“It’s coming out of the light fixtures is coming out of the carbon monoxide detectors"" Thompson said. ""It's coming out of the ceilings. It's just coming from everywhere.”

Neighbors are helping her but this couldn't have happened at a worse time on Christmas Eve.

Most people who live in the apartments have renter's insurance and are filing claims to replace damaged furniture and other items.

“It's Christmas weekend so I really don't know. We're going to contact the insurance company and see if they can be of any assistance to us and maybe have to reach out to some friends and family"" Daphne Tardy said.

City of Smyrna Fire Department said the broken pipe was isolated to the sprinkler system. Fire officials said the apartment maintenance crew are working to fix the issue.

Take a look at Thompson's flooding issues below:

Residents in Douglas County have also experienced flooding as a county official released a statement saying that drivers should avoid the intersection of Highway 5 and Douglas Boulevard due to residential flooding that has iced over roadways.

In the statement officials said that drivers are experiencing ""gridlock traffic"" because of it.

Flooding in DeKalb County has prompted the county to issue a statement saying that residents should not call 911 for flooding inside their homes but rather call property management or a private plumber.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You better watch out this Santa Claus is watching you,"MINNEAPOLIS — Reports started filtering in during Mountain Iron-Buhl’s IX-Man football semifinal victory Nov. 17 at U.S. Bank Stadium.

They indicated one of the officiating crew resembled a certain jolly old elf that kids big and small hope pays them a visit this Saturday night.

It wasn’t the first time a Santa was reported officiating a state playoff game — though perhaps the first at U.S. Bank Stadium. This particular Santa-look-alike also officiated MIB’s state quarterfinal loss in 2021 in Grand Rapids as well as the Section 7AAA title game Nov. 3 between Esko and Pequot Lakes in Duluth and numerous other contests the last two seasons.

His name is Mike Pope a retired Navy veteran and “Ely’s best volunteer” according to Paul McDonald. McDonald is the head referee on Pope’s crew and here’s the thing Pope actually is a Santa.

In fact McDonald said all of his kids have told Pope what they want for Christmas at some point.

Pope moved to Ely in 1998 after retiring from the Navy and claims he hasn’t shaved since 2000 but only started doing appearances as Santa Claus a few years ago.

“I’d always been looking for suits at garage sales or secondhand stores and that kind of thing” Pope said. “I’m not going to throw a bunch of money into this willy-nilly. So my birthday is Nov. 22 I guess maybe four or five years ago my wife actually bought me a suit for my birthday. She said ‘I know you’d never buy it on your own so here you’ve got it. You can be mad but it’s not going back.’”

Since then Pope has done a few paid appearances but mostly he’s volunteered for appearances at schools retirement homes and churches. He’s also active with the Ely honor guard and with Team Rubicon “a veteran-led humanitarian organization that serves global communities before during and after disasters and crises” according to the organization website.

“No matter what the thing is no matter what kind of volunteerism it is and this is something I try to tell the kids when you were coming up somebody was giving back to you” Pope said. “What people don’t realize is it’s a proven fact — it’s science — that doing volunteer work or helping somebody releases endorphins and makes your mood better.”

Referee Mike Pope runs the ball downfield at U.S. Bank Stadium at the beginning of the fourth quarter of the state semifinal game between Mountain Iron-Buhl and Wheaton-Herman-Norcross in Minneapolis on Nov. 17. Jed Carlson / Superior Telegram

Pope said he became involved in coaching football and baseball years ago when his kids were playing and he started umpiring baseball as another way to give back. Soon after he was recruited into McDonald’s football crew and it wasn’t long until he was turning heads at U.S. Bank Stadium.

There are few schools in the area that haven’t had games delayed or even postponed over the past few years because of a lack of game officials. Pope said “the doggone money’s not bad” but that’s not a reason to do it.

“If they’re doing it for the money they’re doing it for the wrong reasons” Pope said. “There’s flexibility built in there’s exercise built in and it’s going to help you meet people.”

Pope encouraged young people especially those going into education or coaching to try officiating because it can help you make connections at schools or become a better coach.

He said he’s heard “horror stories” of referees being harassed by fans or parents but he said he can count on one hand the number of “negative interactions” he’s had with fans over the years.

The greenway is a 40-mile trail extending from south Fayetteville to Bella Vista according to the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission.

In 2000 the commission began a long-range planning process that included existing regional trails. The inaugural 36 miles of the greenway were designed and developed in 2009 and 2010 when the commission received $30 million in private money and public grants according to the website razorbackgreenway.org.

The original plan connected 19 shared-use paved trails into a continuous greenway from south Fayetteville to Lake Bella Vista. The 36-mile trail was officially dedicated May 2 2015. Since then under the leadership of the NWA Razorback Greenway Alliance 4 miles have been added to round out the Razorback Greenway's total to 40. The trail now begins at ""mile 0"" at Kessler Mountain Regional Park in Fayetteville and ends at Mercy Way Bridge in Bella Vista according to the website.

Josh Stacey recreation services manager with Bentonville Parks and Recreation Department said city crews take care of everything from mowing to sanitation services along the approximately 8.5-mile part of the greenway rolling through the city.

People who use the greenway want its appearance kept up he said. Consistency such as a cohesive look with signs also is expected he said.

""All the cities do their part to keep the greenway looking nice"" he said.

A brand refreshening for the greenway paid for by private donors will include the newly launched razorbackgreenway.org website and interactive map. An online merchandise store also is expected to go live soon and there will be improvements such as updated signs along the entire greenway. The work should wrap up next spring said Tristan Hill Razorback Greenway Alliance's greenway manager.

Consistency in signs along the greenway is important as it helps people in getting where they want to go on the trails Hill said.

""That's why we've introduced new tools like the city colorway system which labels signs with a distinct color unique to each city so that trail users can know where they're at and where they're headed at a quick glance"" Hill said.

There is a standard for upkeep many people expect when they step out on the greenway he said.

""The trail system was very ahead of its time at its inception and the cities of Northwest Arkansas have been and still are eager to continue to support active transportation"" he said. ""For those reasons I think people are well aware of what Northwest Arkansas is capable of when it comes to maintaining the region's elite trail systems. We set high expectations for ourselves when the greenway was planned and built several years ago and now we want to maintain those standards that we have created.""

Established in 2020 the purpose of the Northwest Arkansas Razorback Greenway Alliance is to provide a multi-jurisdictional approach to trail governance to ensure the greenway remains best in class nationally and continues to improve and innovate. The seven communities represented are Bella Vista Bentonville Rogers Lowell Springdale Johnson and Fayetteville according to the Razorback Greenway website.

The greenway connects three hospitals 23 schools the University of Arkansas and the corporate headquarters of JB Hunt Transport Services Tyson Foods and Walmart.

Rogers maintains a little over 7 miles of greenway said Jim White Parks and Recreation director.

""Mainly we mow and weed eat those 7-plus miles with a minimum of two 4-foot swipes on either side [of the trail]"" he said.

In the past couple of years the Walton Family Foundation granted the city $1 million for repairs and enhancements on the part of the greenway in Rogers White said.

""I can guarantee you that as far as Rogers goes there is a demand for these type of amenities"" White said. ""But it is high for all park amenities. The region is growing and we have many people moving to Northwest Arkansas from metropolitan areas with great park amenities.""

Chad Wolf Springdale Parks and Recreation director said his staff maintains about 9 miles of the greenway. About $40000 a year is used for that work he said.

The department's scope is to maintain 10 feet on either side of the trail which includes mowing edging trimming weed eating and anything else within that combined 20 feet. Irrigation and lighting within those parameters also is maintained by the city he said.

""We also take care of the maintenance in our downtown entertainment district which consists of Emma Avenue Shiloh Square and Turnbow Park"" Wolf said.

Byron Humphry Fayetteville Park maintenance superintendent said the city doesn't have a specific budget used to maintain the greenway. That work is figured into the overall parks budget he said.

About 13 miles of the greenway are in Fayetteville.

Humphry said there's certainly an expectation the greenway maintenance be consistent for the whole 40 miles.

""Since the greenway goes through many different jurisdictions that's why the Razorback Greenway Operations and Maintenance plan was drafted and adopted by the different cities"" he said.

There is a about 3 miles of greenway in Bella Vista with an additional 2½ miles of greenway under design said Cassi Lapp city communications director.

The city spends about $16000 to maintain the part of the greenway in its jurisdiction though that much is rarely spent due to a great volunteer base that helps out Lapp said.

Typical maintenance work includes sweeping; vegetation management including tree and branch trimming the removal of fallen debris mowing and erosion control; litter and trash removal; the repair of trail structures; the repair of signs/maps; pavement marking refreshing including trail crossings and trail centerline stripe; and servicing drinking fountains Lapp said.

Story continues

Let's now transition to our quarterly results. We're very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and overall business performance. As always I'd like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024 total revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 3% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a strong quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

We also had a solid quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release this was our best third quarter ever for sales bookings. During the quarter we inked 11 competitive core takeaways with one of them being a multibillion-dollar institution. For the year we've now signed six multibillion-dollar institutions topping last year's full-year total of five. Additionally we signed seven deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We are seeing strong interest in our new Financial Crimes Defender solution with 11 new contracts in Q3. Additionally we signed 45 new contracts for our new Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for the Zelle FedNow and RTP payments networks that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time.

We continue to see success with our card processing solution signing 14 new card processing clients this quarter. Our Banno digital banking platform remains very popular with 69 new signings in Q3 including 37 contracts for Banno business. We now have over 11.6 million users live on Banno and we're continuing to add approximately 200000 users per month. Even with our strong sales success in Q3 we continued to replenish our sales pipeline and keep it near an all-time high. As we look towards the end of our fiscal year we remain very optimistic about the industry the demand for our solutions our ability to deliver outstanding service and our long-term prospects for success. With that I'll turn it over to Greg for more detail on our solutions and businesses.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you Dave. As some of you have seen we recently released the 2024 results from our Annual Strategy Benchmark survey. This survey offers insight into concerns opportunities and technology priorities from bank and credit union CEOs. The survey indicated that 80% of bank and credit union CEOs plan to increase technology spending over the next two years. Of those the largest segment 35% plan to increase investments between 6% and 10%. We also inquired where they plan to invest over the next two years. The top four areas for planned investment were fraud detection digital banking data analytics and automation all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions through our technology modernization strategy.

As previously announced we recently launched our cloud-native AI-powered Financial Crimes Defender fraud detection platform. We now have 16 clients live and another 175 clients in the implementation queue. In addition we announced in March the Financial Crimes Defender was named the best fraud prevention platform by fintech breakthrough an independent market intelligent organization. Dave mentioned earlier that we have more than 11.6 million registered users on our cloud-native Banno digital banking platform. We continue to see strong interest in our recently launched Banno business solution that provides a modern banking experience for small and medium-sized businesses. As of March 31st we had 124 clients live and about 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation.

In terms of data analytics we continue to make progress on our data broker and executive dashboard solutions. Both are part of the cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. Data broker which is currently in beta will eventually provide access to all of a client's Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution we are developing an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help executives at our financial institutions make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize. Related to automation technology one new Jack Henry platform offering we haven't spoken much about yet is our cloud-native online deposit and loan account opening solution.

This integrated solution will provide a seamless digital account opening experience for our clients that enables them to streamline processes automate workflows and better serve both retail and commercial loan clients. We plan to begin the beta phase with clients in early calendar year 2025. The survey also found that 96% of our clients plan to add payment services over the next two years. We continue to offer a full range of payment solutions in our pay center application as well as other areas of our payment groups. As of March 31st we had 312 clients using Zelle 275 clients using RTP the real-time payments network which represents 48% of the live RTP clients and 190 clients using FedNow representing 29% of the live FedNow clients. One final point on the survey findings.

They were consistent with what we heard from our clients at our Annual Strategic Initiative Symposium in late April. While financial institutions are concerned about the increasing cost of deposits and impact to interest margins there is a general feeling of optimism and less concerned about an economic slowdown this year versus what we heard a year ago. One topic we spent a lot of time discussing that the strategic initiative Symposium is artificial intelligence. We presented in detail Jack Henry's framework for building the necessary guardrails education training use of acceptable tools et cetera. We continue to actively identify opportunities to leverage AI aiming to enhance client solutions and optimize internal process and work streams.

Incorporating AI into select client solutions like financial crimes defender data broker executive dashboard and Banno conversations is part of that strategy. We are approaching AI deployment thoughtfully ensuring it benefits our clients and associates and aligns with our commitment to data privacy protection and security. Our strategy ensures we are responsibly bold and balanced. It's been about 18 months since our corporate rebranding initiative to retire the Symitar ProfitStars and Jack Henry banking brands as we now simply go-to-market as Jack Henry. As we said at that time uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry's role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice one Jack Henry.

We recently received results from an independent brand study that showed that Jack Henry's brand equity has increased by nine points in just 18 months. We specifically saw significant improvement with large regional financial institutions and millennials. This is important as we continue to execute on our strategy to provide innovative technology solutions to larger financial institutions beyond what we already provide today through both our payment and complementary groups. And millennials are a critical audience because they are taking on larger leadership roles at these financial institutions and having more influence and technology buyer decisions. Speaking of brand equity hopefully you all have seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 29th.

We believe the 2024 report is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on over the past year. This year's report details how we are we're supporting local communities with a focus on financial wellness through both our investments and innovative technology in a variety of philanthropic efforts. We also continue to further our commitment to valuing people with disabilities with the launch of a new associate-led business innovation group focused on awareness of visible and invisible disabilities. The report also highlights some of the public Best Places to Work recognition we received from organizations like Newsweek Computer World and USA Today. As part of our planned organizational changes we recently announced the promotion of Shannon McLaughlin who is currently President of Jack Henry Credit Union Solutions to Chief Operating Officer effective July 1st.

An executive overviewing a data center full of servers and systems managing their technology solutions.

Shannon has been with Jack Henry for nine years but has close to 30 years working with both banks and credit unions and senior technology and operational roles. Shannon is a strategic visionary leader who has significantly contributed to our company's overall success and we'll continue to do so as the next Chief Operating Officer. I want to close by recognizing Dave for the exceptional job he has done as CEO over the past eight years. Under Dave's leadership Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions. I also want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance. He has prepared me well as I step into the CEO role on July 1st and I'm honored to continue leading our company with an unwavering focus on our associates clients and shareholders.

With that I will turn it over to Mimi for more details on the numbers.

Mimi Carsley: Thank you Greg and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll start with the details driving our third quarter and year-to-date results then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Q3 GAAP revenue increased 6% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7% a continuation of consistently solid performance and keeping us on track for a strong fiscal 2024. Year-to-date growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and stronger on non-GAAP at 8%. Deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 which we pre-released last week was down approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients.

Year-to-date deconversion revenue is $9.9 million $7.2 million less than the prior period. Now let's look more closely at the details. GAAP services and support revenue increased 4% while non-GAAP increased a more robust 6%. Year-to-date the increase was 6% for GAAP and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Service and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for the year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has long been a key to double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue which is 43% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model.

We saw positive performance with 8% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date delivered 9% for both. Consistent with recent results drivers include positive demand for our digital solutions card processing other payment processing and other processing revenues. In closing out revenue commentary I would like to highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue which increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees. Next R&D increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter.

The increase is primarily due to cloud consumption costs net of capitalization. For the year-to-date R&D increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly on a GAAP basis SG&A rose 7% for the quarter and 8% on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to higher personnel costs. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased 23% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The primary GAAP differences are the $16.4 million in onetime related costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program. [indiscernible] in Q1 and prior period $7.4 million gain on asset sales. For non-GAAP the difference is primarily due to the higher personnel costs and absence of gain on sale of assets. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 30 basis points of increased non-GAAP margin which was 20.8%.

Non-GAAP margin benefited from focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce while retaining key talent. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.19 up 7%. Separating results into the 3 operating segments we're pleased to see across the board positive performance. Our core segment revenue increased 8% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 216 basis points. We continue to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 124 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 121 basis points.

This was due to continuing growth in our EPS business and moderate card growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends and a slightly tough comp combined with the focused cost management. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 103 basis points of margin expansion. And finally complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 33 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 8% with 28 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date reflects digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Segment quarterly margins were impacted by moderate headwinds from direct support costs and license and fees. Let's now turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation.

Year-to-date operating cash flow was $336 million $129 million increase over prior period. Excluding proceeds from the sale of assets free cash flow was $172 million significantly more than the $54 million last year. Our base case entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximately $29 million overpayment last fiscal year as well as improved cash tax outlook this fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to share value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 19%. Additionally I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year-to-date period including $20 million in share repurchase offsetting annual dilution $25 million in debt reduction and $116 million in dividends.

With three quarters of the year complete we're nearing the conclusion of our fiscal year and therefore I'll conclude with guidance changes. As you're aware yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2024 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP metrics. As a reminder we filed an 8-K on August 3rd that described how starting in the current fiscal year we're using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. While we reported third quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 we are reiterating our full year deconversion guidance of $16 million. We are reiterating both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth and expect non-GAAP growth to potentially have a bias towards the lower end of our 7.4% to 8.0% growth range.

Due to the continued positive operational results and a focus on cost management we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 45 to 50 basis points compared to the 35 to 40 basis points previously provided. The full-year tax rate estimate remains at 23.5%. Incorporating the noted positive update full-year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $5.15 to $5.19 per share from the previous guidance of $5.09 to $5.13 per share. As a reminder the guidance or deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue VEDIP severance-related costs and nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2024. Due to the better than initially anticipated cash tax payments improved margins and contributions from favorable net interest our full year guidance for free cash flow conversion has increased to 70% to 75% from the previous commentary of 60%.

In conclusion Q3 results reflected continued momentum of the strong execution we've seen thus far this year and we expect a solid finish for the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation.

Walk down a 30-foot hallway through a mosaic of photos showing hundreds upon hundreds of children with parents siblings and staff from Jacob’s Heart each image holding a story that starts with cancer and ends in triumph or in grief.

Take a turn past Maddy’s Jungle where toddlers frolic across the room’s tiger-print carpet ride stuffed-animal rockers and play with toys in front of a wall covered in an animal-filled forest scene. The room is named for the little girl who was among the first kids served by Jacob’s Heart to pass away. Maddy loved jungle creatures.

Pause before Art from the Heart a section of wall showcasing the work of bereaved siblings. There’s a cheerful goldfish beside handprints from a sister and brother named Angela and Alex and a green flower against a pastel background painted for Janet by Noemi who drew a heart by her sister’s name.

Head over to the volunteer room and check out decorations added to brown shopping bags to brighten the days of the children and families who receive weekly grocery deliveries to help them through unimaginably hard times. You’ll see bunnies and rainbows and nearby you’ll find the cards that healthy kids make to be mailed to kids who are sick: One has two penguins with a heart between them and a message that says “Let’s stick together.” Another has a sheep with googly eyes and a message in Spanish saying “There’s no one like you.”

Take a look at the mural in the Full Hearts room where volunteers bag groceries. The artwork shows a majestic lion its mane surrounded by a heart. After Johnny Robledo died at 16 his cousin painted the mural adding beside the lion some words Johnny left behind so people would know he didn’t depart this world in defeat: “I want people to know that I was here and that I fought.”

Poke around Caroline’s Closet a room full of clothing from a partner thrift store. You’ll see clothing for all ages plus necessities like soap cleaners and toothpaste. In a stack are about a dozen volunteer-knitted beanies to fit babies suffering the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. “Beanies are a big request when the kiddies start losing their hair” says family support specialist Daniela Ramirez.

Stop in front of the large pinboard map showing the region from San Francisco south to King City. Each of the multitudinous pins represents a child with cancer whom Jacob’s Heart has helped colored according to the type of cancer. Most of the pins are clustered in Watsonville Santa Cruz and Salinas within the Watsonville-based nonprofit’s primary coverage area. Jacob’s Heart is seeking $40000 to bolster its services — and to start offering its help throughout Santa Clara County.

For parents whose child receives a cancer diagnosis troubles pile onto fears and worries: Caring for the young girl or boy — whose life has been catastrophically altered by a life-threatening or terminal illness and who may be hospitalized for months at a time and require treatments far from home — becomes all-consuming. A parent sometimes a single parent often has to quit their job. For the families Jacob’s Heart serves many with low incomes there’s not enough money not enough time. Siblings already traumatized by the knowledge their beloved family member may die can feel neglected putting more pressure on distressed mothers and fathers already struggling to meet one child’s now-vast needs.

Sebastian Van Deren of Gilroy was diagnosed in August 2020 with a rare brain cancer a week before his sophomore year in high school was to start. The diagnosis sent the Van Deren family into “hell on earth” says Sebastian’s mother Andrea 43 a yoga teacher and photographer. “Your whole world just falls out from underneath you” she says. Sebastian’s father James recalls watching his healthy and active son turn sick and weak from the cancer and the side-effects of radiation and chemotherapy. “We were happy when he would eat two grapes” says James 52 an electrician.

A school district nurse connected the family with Jacob’s Heart and the organization’s financial support guidance and compassion helped the Van Derens through their two-year nightmare. Today after two surgeries trips as far as Ohio for precision radiation treatment and six rounds of chemotherapy Sebastian 17 is cancer free on the honor roll in high school loves studying physics rides his bike for miles around his Gilroy neighborhood and continues attending teen events at Jacob’s Heart. “I’m just really glad to have who I have with me especially my family and Jacob’s Heart” Sebastian says. “Everybody there is so kind.”

In operation for 25 years Jacob’s Heart is named for another boy who survived cancer against long odds whose mother had to leave her job to care for him. The organization serves upward of 350 families at any given time working closely with the Bay Area healthcare facilities where young patients receive much of their treatment including Stanford Medical Center UC San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente. Jacob’s Heart relies on 14 full-time staff a host of contractors and hundreds of volunteers like Tanner Tedsen a local insurance agent who drops off groceries at families’ homes every week. “It’s all the cutest little kids you can imagine running out to thank you” Tedsen says.

The goals at Jacob’s Heart are fairly straightforward: to lighten the burdens on children and families from a life-changing diagnosis and to bring light to lives suddenly shadowed. The nonprofit takes a wrap-around approach embracing young patients and their families from babies to grandparents and helping them through every stage of illness treatment and beyond.

“We have a saying: Once a Jacob’s Heart family always a Jacob’s Heart family” says Allyssa Gil-Ojeda a coordinator at the nonprofit.

Jacob’s Heart’s offerings include family support in English and Spanish professional counseling peer mentorship transportation to medical appointments gas cards grants for bills and funerals social gatherings for teens trips to the beach zoo and amusement parks and Holiday Hearts seasonal gifts. It also provides an annual Forever Loved camp for parents and siblings who have lost a child to cancer and an annual Camp Heart & Hands staffed by Stanford pediatric nurses for families and their children in treatment or remission.

The nonprofit also forges links — between families and other service providers between kids and other kids who share a diagnosis that no other child can really understand and between families sharing similar ordeals including siblings going through traumatic events that have not touched their peers.

“What we really bring into a community is the social and emotional connection” says Heidi Boynton executive director of Jacob’s Heart and a cancer survivor. “Knowing that you’re not alone definitely changes things.”

Outside Jacob’s Heart on this particular day up in the mountains between Watsonville and Gilroy the Van Derens are camped in a county park among redwoods and oaks with their two small dogs Dexter and Lincoln. They camp there often.

The family walks down the trail to the redwood they call Big Tree. It’s a dozen feet across at the base — blackened by fire and bears scars from someone trying to cut it down. For the Van Derens Big Tree has become part of the story of their trials. “I don’t know how it survived but it did” James says. Sebastian tips his head back and gazes upward. “Through it all it’s just kept going” he says. “Look at it. You can’t even see the top. This tree is just so tall.”

The Steelers won the game 13-10 after scoring 10 points in the fourth quarter. Las Vegas only put up 201 yards of total offense and the lack of an attack is something that didn’t sit well with Jacobs.

""Yeah man it’s bulls--- for real"" he said via the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""It’s bulls---. And it’s on us you know? Everybody wanna talk about the defense before. They made their stops when they were supposed to. S--- we’ve got to help them out. And you know I’m tired of saying we’ve got to f-----g help them out and it’s just frustrating.""

Jacobs was asked whether the Steelers’ game plan was about stopping the running game. Las Vegas had 58 yards on the ground. Jacobs Derek Carr and Brandon Bolden each had rushing attempts. Jacobs’ 11-yard run was the longest of the game for the Raiders.

""We still had opportunities to make plays"" Jacobs said. ""I feel like in times where we was close and we felt like we was about to get a big one we went away from it. You know and the pass game was working early. So you know that is what it is but to win these games you know especially in the stretch especially you’re up against a team like this in the cold you’ve got to run the ball. So that’s a factor on everybody involved top to bottom.""

Jacobs added: ""I’m tired of dealing with this. Every day I come here and bust my a-- and I see the guys busting their a-- and the result is not there. For me the last four years the result has not been there. And quite frankly I don’t know what else to do.""

Las Vegas fell to 6-9 on the year with the loss and their playoff hopes are dwindling.

Former WWE producer Jimmy Jacobs was fired for taking a photo. It sounds blunt and simple because it is. Jacobs posed for a photo with The Young Bucks Hangman Page and Marty Scurll during a Bullet Club invasion of the parking lot of Citizen's Business Arena in Ontario CA where WWE was broadcasting an episode of ""WWE Raw.""

""I knew it wasn't gonna be received well that's for sure"" Jacobs told Conrad Thompson on ""The Insiders"" podcast. ""I was in the arena and I think Kevin Owens texted me 'Hey are The Bucks there? Are they there?' And I hadn't heard anything about it from inside the arena. He goes 'Yeah I think they're outside. I think they're shooting something.' So I went out there and it's like 'Holy crap The Bucks are here' and I just saw them we exchanged pleasantries and just as I was getting ready to leave I said 'Hey guys let's take a picture' and I took a picture never intending to post it.""

Jacobs said the photo stuck itself in his mind while he was backstage. ""I was in gorilla position during segment 3 or 4 and I just go 'screw it' and I just post it. I knew there was a chance people wouldn't like it. I didn't care. I look back at it and I really see it almost like a child acting out. 'I want to get in trouble.'""

Jacobs explained that he wanted the same treatment that is supposedly given WWE Hall of Famer Michael Hayes backstage ""but I'm not Michael Hayes so I don't get it.""

According to Jacobs this means he wanted his work to speak for itself. ""I wanted to get in trouble and them be like 'well he's good at his job so let's keep him around.' I wanted to just expand my wings. I wanted to go [exasperated sigh] 'let me just be how I am however weird that is' so I took the picture.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3Vyc3VsYS1qYWNvYnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Mzg0NjUyNjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ursula Jacobs Obituary - Krauss Funeral Home - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/ursula-jacobs-obituary?id=38465261 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3Vyc3VsYS1qYWNvYnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Mzg0NjUyNjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC91cy9tZWxvZHktZmVsaWNhbm8tam9obnNvbi1zZW50ZW5jaW5nLWFyaXpvbmEvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBUGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvdXMvbWVsb2R5LWZlbGljYW5vLWpvaG5zb24tc2VudGVuY2luZy1hcml6b25h?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arizona woman accused of trying to kill her husband with poisoned coffee sentenced to probation,"CNN —

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcGdhLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvd2h5LWR1c3Rpbi1qb2huc29uLXNheXMtbGl2LXBsYXllcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLXJld2FyZGVkLWluLXBnYS10b3VyLW1lcmdlci83MzYyOTg3NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Dustin Johnson says LIV players should be rewarded in PGA Tour merger,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.palmbeachpost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/sports/pga/2024/05/09/why-dustin-johnson-says-liv-players-should-be-rewarded-in-pga-tour-merger/73629875007/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226FC1240>, 'Connection to www.palmbeachpost.com timed out.

They were right.

Johnson’s first year in office has been a roller-coaster ride filled with the ups of having delivered on a checklist of progressive promises — and the downs of managing contentious relationships with Gov. J.B. Pritzker the Illinois General Assembly the business community and police.

There’s even mounting tension with a City Council emboldened by Johnson’s failure to deliver on his signature promise to secure a new revenue source to combat homelessness.

In an interview with the Sun-Times and WBEZ Johnson reflected on his “remarkable journey” to the mayor’s office and the very “different trajectory” he followed to get there.

He said he’s proud of fulfilling so many items on his progressive to-do list and described a year of accomplishments tempered by impatience.

“There are frustrating moments that I do have where you … just wish you could address everything at the same time” Johnson said. “That’s just unfortunately not where we are — just because the damage has been so severe and it has been so widespread” especially in “historically marginalized” communities.

Johnson acknowledged he hasn’t made everybody happy but that comes with the turf.

“If the role of the mayor is to satisfy everyone then we would not have had 56 prior to me” he said.

Migrant crisis missteps

From the beginning Johnson has been dogged by the migrant crisis he inherited. One of his first Council meetings included a cathartic vote on $51 million in surplus funding for the crisis — after a contentious “us-versus-them” debate that reduced one alderperson to tears.

Johnson’s handling of the crisis telegraphed the freshman mayor’s growing pains. He unveiled plans for a winterized camp at a contaminated Southwest Side industrial site only to have Pritzker reject the idea amid environmental concerns.

The local alderperson a progressive ally felt blindsided by the mayor’s plan and was subsequently physically accosted by furious constituents.

The abandoned plan ended up costing Chicago taxpayers nearly $1 million.

But Johnson succeeded in emptying Chicago police station lobbies filled with migrants and returning Chicago Park District field houses to their intended use. He did that by opening brick-and-mortar shelters at a furious pace. At its peak 27 shelters held more than 14600 migrants.

“When I stepped into office … you had contracts that were bloated and it was costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of dollars. ... We’ve transformed all of that. … We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million” Johnson said.

But the biggest shelter in Pilsen was crowded and unsanitary. A 5-year-old boy there died of sepsis and it later was the epicenter of a measles outbreak.

Alderpersons are now pushing back on the mayor’s 60-day eviction policy — which was delayed three times and already has forced more than 650 people from shelters.

Johnson also stumbled by initially reneging on a deal with Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle one of his political patrons to provide $70 million in additional city funding to support migrants through 2024.

His first budget included just $150 million in funding he knew would last only until April 1. He deliberately lowballed the figure to put pressure on the federal government but the tactic failed. At one point he used $95 million in federal stimulus money to slap an end-of-year Band-Aid on the migrant crisis. But that alienated some alderpersons who control spending and were not consulted.

Johnson’s hand-picked chair of the Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee has frequently complained about being shut out of conversations about the migrant crisis including about the mayor’s eviction policy. Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) eventually strong-armed the administration into publishing regular data on evictions.

“There needs to be some work done as it relates to transparency and accountability as well as cooperation and engagement and dialogue with the alders” Vasquez said. “It’s about figuring out how to engage with everybody.”

Alderpersons’ grievances with Johnson were on full display at the last Council meeting where they called for the mayor to be more forthright about migrant funding and equal spending on long disinvested communities.

Even after the griping the Council ultimately passed two of Johnson’s top spending priorities including $70 million from city reserves for migrant spending to honor the deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle.

“I know how to count and both those votes received more than 30 votes from City Council” said Workforce Development Chair Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd). “That sounds like a win to me.”

After closing nearly a dozen shelters amid declining numbers Johnson said he’s “preparing” for a possible influx of migrants in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. But there are “limitations to what we can do” without more federal help he said.

Progress on progressive wish list

Johnson’s legislative successes have been impressive.

In the first year alone he has phased out the subminimum wage for tipped workers; pushed through the most generous paid leave policy in the country; reinstated the city’s Department of Environment; and laid the groundwork to reopen two shuttered mental health clinics.

The mayor has also begun to ease the pressure on Chicago police officers by expanding a plan to send mental health providers instead of police to nonviolent mental health emergencies.

Johnson kept his promise to put a binding referendum on the ballot that would have authorized the Council to increase the real estate transfer tax to create a dedicated funding source for homelessness prevention. But Chicago voters rejected it a major defeat widely viewed as a referendum on the mayor’s first year in office.

Mayoral allies in the Council’s Progressive Caucus heard the message loud and clear and vowed to work harder to win voters’ trust and simplify a complicated referendum that many voters didn’t understand.

“Ignoring what those critiques are and thinking that we’re just morally right isn’t going to lead to future wins” Vasquez said.

At the time Johnson responded to the defeat with bravado warning anyone who might assume one defeat would make him put the brakes on his progressive agenda to “buckle up.”

More recently the mayor won Council approval for a $1.25 billion bond issue devised by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fund housing and economic development programs. The same goes for Lightfoot’s plan which Johnson expanded to transform nearly vacant buildings along La Salle Street into more affordable residential units.

Canceling the city’s contract with the gunshot detection technology company known as ShotSpotter also delivered on a progressive promise. Johnson and his base have long viewed ShotSpotter as a surveillance tool that leads to overpolicing in Black and Brown communities.

But Johnson’s decision was somewhat overshadowed by his delivery. He announced it just days before the contract was to expire then scrambled to negotiate an extension through the historically violent summer months and the Democratic National Convention.

ShotSpotter and the broken migrant funding promise with Pritzker and Preckwinkle were the subject of a disastrous Feb. 15 news conference showcasing a communication problem dominating Johnson’s first year in office.

He evaded some questions answered in platitudes and declined to say if he’d walked away from a migrant funding deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle or nailed down the ShotSpotter extension before announcing a phase-out.

That defining moment in his relationship with the media seems to have led to a course correction. Johnson finally named a permanent communications director in Ronnie Reese who had essentially filled the role since Johnson took office. Johnson also hired a chief strategy officer Joe Calvello who learned the art of being “radically open and honest” while guiding U.S. Sen. John Fetterman D-Pa. through a difficult campaign dominated by health issues.

The changes appear to have made an impact already with Johnson taking media questions more often and answering those questions a bit more directly.

Mixed bag for business

Johnson’s aggressive agenda such as costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage put him at odds with the business community.

But labor leaders said Johnson also had displayed a willingness to compromise on both issues even as business groups kept “moving the goalposts.”

“They were looking not to compromise. They’re just looking to stop the policy. And that’s not realistic” said Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter noting similar policies have been adopted by other major cities.

Johnson also appeared to extend an olive branch with recent rollouts of pro-development policies. And his choice of seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright as commissioner of Planning and Development also was applauded by the business community.

Besides the La Salle Street plan the mayor proposed recommendations to cut bureaucratic red tape on business development and revived the long-stalled O’Hare expansion project by hammering out a cost-cutting deal with the major airlines.

Johnson also held the line on city property taxes — though he allowed Chicago Public Schools to boost property taxes to the limit two years in a row.

“It’s been a little bit up and down. Some positives. Some negatives” Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin said of Johnson’s first year adding there’s “a lot of work to be done to improve communication” and trust between the mayor and the business community.

“He has a tax agenda. We have ideas on how we can grow the economy. And we’re going to have to come together because federal money is drying up. There’s lots of fiscal cliffs and fiscal challenges coming up” Lavin said. “He’s the mayor. We’ve all got to work together. If the mayor is not successful Chicago’s not going to be successful.”

With two of four city employee pension funds hovering perilously close to insolvency Johnson has displayed some financial acumen by continuing a Lightfoot policy of making additional payments. He also appointed a working group to study the $35 billion crisis — which has yet to produce any ideas on solving it.

Goodwill from police is short-lived

Johnson’s choice of Larry Snelling as police superintendent played to rave reviews. A commanding and reassuring presence he’s already won the support of the demoralized rank and file.

The mayor also extended the police contract and sweetened police raises. But the feel-good period was somewhat short-lived.

He infuriated officers by twice asking Council members to reject an arbitrator’s ruling allowing officers accused of the most serious wrongdoing to bypass the Police Board taking their cases to arbitration.

“For a Democratic mayor to be so anti-union it’s pretty breathtaking” said Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

As expected a judge sided with the union — but agreed to make the arbitration process more public and that meant the back-to-back Council votes were more than “symbolic” Johnson said.

Johnson did keep a campaign promise to hire 200 new detectives and free officers for street duty by hiring civilians to perform office jobs. And to the consternation of some progressive allies he increased the police budget to nearly $1.99 billion.

Still Snelling told a town hall in Jefferson Park recently that Chicago remains down about 2000 officers citywide and struggles with low recruitment.

Like Lightfoot Johnson has devised a plan to get at the root causes of crime. His hyperlocal version focuses on 10 multiblock areas in four neighborhoods: Englewood Austin Little Village and West Garfield Park.

Those neighborhoods — plagued by school closings and high dropout rates while lacking public amenities like parks and libraries — will receive an array of services including priority in another round of the city’s guaranteed minimum income program.

Johnson has also put a heavy focus on creating more summer jobs and neighborhood recreational opportunities for young people to give them alternatives to a trend of mass downtown gatherings that have turned violent.

Shootings and homicides are down slightly but robberies remain stubbornly high. In neighborhoods citywide Chicagoans continue to feel unsafe waking up to reports of another wave of strong-armed robberies store break-ins and carjackings.

Reducing violent crime remains such a priority alderpersons who believe ShotSpotter is an effective prevention tool have vowed to perhaps symbolically defy the mayor and tie his hands on ending the contract.

Johnson plays Council tie-breaker

Twice in the first year Johnson was forced to cast tie-breaking Council votes: To save his now-ousted Zoning chair and floor leader Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) from censure; and to approve a nonbinding resolution for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The cease-fire resolution strained Johnson’s relationship with many Jewish leaders and the only Jewish alderperson Debra Silverstein (50th). Some Jewish elected officials and civic leaders — including the Anti-Defamation League Midwest state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz and state Rep. Bob Morgan — later declined the mayor’s invitation to a recent meeting meant to ease the tension.

But not supporting the resolution would have diminished his relationships with progressives and Arab Americans. He noted that calling for a cease-fire is in line with his values and several progressive pro-Palestinian Jewish groups did attend the meeting.

“As far as me calling for peace I hardly consider that controversial. ... The entire country and people around the world are calling for that. That’s something that we value as residents of the city of Chicago but it’s also part of our responsibility as global residents that calling for peace and an end to war is a part of our very profound tradition” he said.

The Chicago area’s large Palestinian community demanded for months that Johnson and his Council majority take a stand voicing their feelings at numerous raucous Council meetings.

The division caused by the war has spread to college campuses in Chicago and nationwide foreshadowing the civil disobedience that might occur when Democrats gather here in August to formally nominate President Joe Biden for reelection.

If Johnson is too timid he risks allowing demonstrators to run roughshod over Chicago. If he allows Chicago police to be too heavy-handed he runs the risk of civil rights violations and the inevitable comparison to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Johnson’s first chief of staff Rich Guidice a seasoned City Hall lifer was widely expected to serve through the convention bringing the expertise garnered from guiding Chicago through decades of major events. But Guidice abruptly resigned last month.

The tie-breaking vote that spared Ramirez-Rosa from censure followed his resignation from leadership after apologizing for bullying and threatening colleagues to block a symbolic referendum on whether Chicago should remain a sanctuary city.

Johnson hasn’t named a replacement for Ramirez-Rosa — either as Zoning chair or floor leader. Some Council members are demanding a replacement from the Latino Caucus but Johnson has yet to find someone he trusts who can also win alderpersons’ support.

Meanwhile some of Johnson’s progressive supporters said they believe rushing to force Ramirez-Rosa’s resignation went too far and an apology should have sufficed.

Backing the Bears puzzles progressives

Progressives were also left scratching their heads when Johnson embraced the Bears’ plan for a sprawling domed stadium south of Soldier Field — a project requiring billions of state and federal dollars that haven’t been approved or identified.

When the Bears unveiled their stadium plan Johnson acted more like a cheerleader than a guardian of taxpayers and protector of precious lakefront parkland.

Asked if the plan violated the city ordinance prohibiting new construction along the lakefront Johnson referred to the Bears’ promise of increased green space on the Museum Campus. But he failed to mention those additional 14 acres are possible only if the state and federal governments cover all $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs.

Putting the Bears stadium near the top of his legislative wish list contradicts Johnson’s campaign stance. Now though Johnson calls Soldier Field a “100-year-old building” — even though it was rebuilt in 2003. Paying off what’s owed on that renovation will drain city coffers unless the debt is refinanced in the new stadium funding package.

“If someone else has another solution that addresses this problem then they should put that on the table” Johnson said.

Every mayor loves a giant public works project. They generate jobs contracts and political donations and are a feel-good diversion from Chicago’s intransigent problems. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley had his failed 2016 Olympic bid. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel had Elon Musk’s high-speed tunnel train to O’Hare Airport.

Johnson’s stadium plan similarly appears to be going nowhere. Springfield has far higher priorities.

“The position he’s taking there … seems to run at odds with his key base of support from progressives. I understand the temptation and desire to put forward a signature project — a legacy project if you will … But it just seems like an unforced error in the way he rolled it out” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.

“Unforced errors is sort of a common theme that we are seeing in many respects. … Communication with the public and the press remains lacking” he said.

At the Bears’ announcement Johnson was “speaking in platitudes from scripted remarks” and couldn’t “really engage with the questions being asked” Greising said which undermined “his ability to earn support from people most affected by the decisions he is making.”

Pritzker did not address the Bears stadium controversy or other points of tension with Johnson saying instead: “The first year of any administration is often the most challenging and I commend Mayor Johnson and his team for reaching this milestone.”

Springfield stumbles

A stadium defeat would not be Johnson’s first in Springfield.

Last month the Illinois House voted 92-8 to approve a bill curbing the power of Johnson’s revamped hand-picked school board. A Senate committee did the same last week during Johnson’s first Springfield lobbying trip as mayor. The bill would prevent Chicago Public Schools from making any admissions or funding changes to selective-enrollment programs and from closing any schools until a fully elected school board takes control in early 2027.

There was no mistaking the message to Johnson’s board which wants to prioritize investing in neighborhood schools over choice schools like selective-enrollments. The original bill was amended to extend an existing moratorium on closing all schools and not just selective schools after lobbying by the CTU.

Asked what message he took from the vote to tie his hands on an important education issue Johnson noted it still needs final approval.

“It’s not a law so nothing has happened” he said.

An emotional CTU President Stacy Davis Gates — perhaps reflecting on setbacks like these — told supporters last fall she was “ashamed of myself” for having helped put Johnson — “my brother” she called him — in “an impossible place.”

Asked recently what made her ashamed Davis Gates talked about the resistance Johnson had faced during his first year.

“Transformation is happening right now in Chicago and every corner of the city because of his leadership. And that level of transformation either makes you a hero or it makes you a villain” Davis Gates said. “It’s not lukewarm. It’s either hot or cold and that is a very precarious position to live in.”

Remaking Chicago Public Schools

As a candidate Johnson promised to make progressive changes to CPS and he has.

His revamped board is led by former science teacher Jianan Shi who also led the parent advocacy group Raise Your Hand for Illinois Public Education. Johnson’s board is filled with others with community-organizing experience.

That board has delivered on a promise to shift away from student-based budgeting that progressives argue exacerbates challenges at schools serving low-income communities and toward a need-based funding model.

But he’s already disappointed some parents by sticking with a plan for a phased-in elected school board instead of delivering that pivotal reform in one fell swoop.

Johnson will also have to find a way to deliver for the schools parents and his former colleagues at the teachers union without breaking the bank in the CTU contract he is now negotiating. Teachers started out by demanding a 9% raise or to match inflation whichever is higher.

“I know what it takes — from a teacher’s perspective as well as a parent’s perspective and a student’s perspective — to have a more transformational educational experience” Johnson said. “And that’s what our focus has to be: funding our schools and actually transforming them so that they are fully fully expressed in an equitable way.”

CPS faces a $391 million deficit for the upcoming school year not including raises being negotiated for teachers and a 4% raise already promised to support staff. The CTA and other mass transit agencies are facing their own funding cliffs.

That’s another point of contention between Johnson and Pritzker.

The governor and others are demanding a leadership change at CTA before providing any new money. Others want to merge all four Chicago-area mass transit agencies into a single super-agency to reduce costs improve operations and create a uniform fare system.

Johnson harshly critical of CTA performance during the campaign has stuck with embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. no favorite of Chicago alderpersons.

When Pritzker dared demand a leadership change the mayor replied he alone gets to choose the CTA president adding “If people want to be mayor they should run for it.”

Room to grow into job

Johnson likes to say he intends to serve for 23 years — long enough to become Chicago’s longest-serving mayor bypassing Richard M. Daley.

But that will require him to grow and mature in the job and survive many upcoming tests. While his first budget made no real political waves the second will demand making cuts raising property taxes or finding new sources of revenue while still chipping away at his commitment to invest in people.

Despite Johnson’s gestures to the business community Greising said many business leaders he talks to “feel like they still don’t know him still don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what they can do for him — and still don’t feel heard by him.

“Every successful mayor has found a way to have the business community with him. And this mayor so far doesn’t seem to work very hard on that.

“We shouldn’t be all that surprised when we elect someone with his background that there’s a very steep learning curve” he said. “But … he really needs to invest his effort into growing in those areas where he is falling short. If he doesn’t do that with urgency then it will be too late.”

Davis Gates acknowledged the growing pains.

“For so long in this city people who have needed [the most] have been told ‘no’” she said. Now after years of “demanding a thing happens fighting for a thing to happen protesting rallying door-knocking” progressives are in charge she said.

“To make things happen those are different muscles ... The muscles that we have to develop now — not just as a movement not just as a mayor but as an entire city — is No. 1 we’ve got to get more inclusive. We’ve got to figure out how to work past our differences” she said.

It will take some time for this “new formation that we have in Chicago” to settle in Johnson said.

“The way these systems have been built particularly government they have been built in a very complex way to favor the few” he said.

“There has been sort of an unfettered access of a handful of powerful people having access to the fifth floor” the mayor said. “Maybe they’re not used to sharing. And that’s going to take some adjustment.”

Mayor's up-and-down first year in office Mayor’s up-and-down first year in office • The migrant crisis has dominated much of Johnson’s first year: The crisis exposed the growing pains of a new mayor and exacerbated historic tensions between Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities. One key setback: Johnson’s determination to locate a migrant camp at a contaminated industrial site in Brighton Park. Gov. J.B. Pritzker canceled that project over those environmental concerns.



• It’s been a mixed bag on progressives’ wish list: Johnson was able to get the Chicago City Council to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and require city employers to give their employees at least 10 paid days off a year. But voters rejected his “Bring Chicago Home” referendum which would have increased the real estate transfer tax and used the money to fund programs to reduce homelessness.



• His relationship with the business community has been rocky: He enacted those costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage but also helped developers with an initiative to cut bureaucratic red tape and his decision to move forward on a plan to convert some LaSalle Street office buildings in the Loop for residential use. And he broke a stalemate with United and American airlines to reduce costs and move forward with a massive multi-billion-dollar expansion and renovation of O’Hare International Airport.



• Unease about Johnson’s inexperience was soothed by some of his early appointments: Rich Guidice a City Hall veteran recently retired from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications returned as Johnson’s chief of staff though he lasted less than a year. Seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright became commissioner of the city’s Planning and Development Department. And Johnson’s choice as police superintendent Larry Snelling had been with CPD for years and remains popular with the rank-and-file.



• Johnson spent some of his fragile political capital in casting tie-breaking votes in the Council: One was on a symbolic resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The mayor’s other tie-breaking vote was to save Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa from censure. The alderperson Johnson’s floor leader was accused of bullying some fellow members.



• Every mayor loves a big jobs-creating public works project: Richard M. Daley had his Olympic bid Rahm Emanuel had his high-speed tunnel to O’Hare that Elon Musk was going to build. Johnson’s appears to be the Bears’ bid for a new lakefront domed stadium but jumping on board so soon when the level of public funding is so high — and still in doubt “seems like an unforced error” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.



• Johnson’s experience as a teacher plays a role: Johnson a former organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union owes his election in part to the support of that union and entered office with teachers’ support. And while he has remade the CPS board — and the board has shifted schools to a need-based funding formula he also disappointed parents by backing away from shifting to an all-elected school board right away opting instead to phase in elected members.

Sam Bankman-Fried the fallen crypto mogul who told The Times last month that his personal fortune had dwindled to $100000 won’t be spending the holidays behind bars. He and his defense team on Thursday negotiated a whopping $250 million bond deal that secured his release from federal custody.

The terms are highly restrictive. Mr. Bankman-Fried 30 had to turn over his passport and will remain under house arrest at the California home of his parents the Stanford Law School professors Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried. He’s been fitted with a bracelet that monitors his movements must undergo a mental health evaluation and will have to get government or court approval for any expenses above $1000.

The bail deal was negotiated before Mr. Bankman-Fried boarded a plane on Wednesday night back to the U.S. If he misses a court date or flees his parents would be liable for that quarter-billion-dollar bond hit.

Lewis Foundation gives $5M grant to Barack Obama Foundation — Business,"The Reginald F. Lewis Foundation (RFLF) one of the oldest African American and Asian private foundations in the world is pleased to announce a milestone $5 million grant to the Barack Obama Foundation (https://www.obama.org) to support their mission to inspire empower and connect the next generation of leaders.

The Reginald F. Lewis Foundation’s grant will go toward supporting the Obama Foundation’s general operations and impact work including support for the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago and other national and global programs like the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance which addresses persistent opportunity gaps boys and young men of color face in society and the workforce and the Girls Opportunity Alliance an international initiative that seeks to empower adolescent girls around the world through education enabling them to achieve their full potential and transform their families communities and countries.

“It is an honor to contribute to President Obama’s ongoing work to educate and empower young people to become leaders in their communities and around the world” said Loida Lewis Chair of The Reginald F. Lewis Foundation and widow to the late entrepreneur Reginald Lewis. “I know President Obama attended a speech Mr. Lewis gave at Harvard Law School while the President was there studying for his law degree. Both Mr. Lewis and the President show how education helps exceptional people break barriers and accomplish wonderful things and I know if he was still here Mr. Lewis would be proud to help President Obama carry his work and legacy forward.”

“We are incredibly grateful for the generous support from The Reginald F. Lewis Foundation. It’s through vital partnerships like this that we are able to build sustainable programming at the Obama Foundation centered around supporting boys and young men of color and girls all over the world through education” said Obama Foundation CEO Valerie Jarrett.

In partnership with the Obama Foundation a room at the future Obama Presidential Center will be named in memory of Mr. Lewis with the hope of continuing to preserve his ongoing legacy and inspire others for years to come. Mr. Lewis a pioneering financier entrepreneur and philanthropist has been selected by President Obama as an honoree alongside other influential figures “on whose shoulders we stand” and whose significant contributions to society advanced justice and equality in America.

The Reginald F. Lewis Foundation and the Obama Foundation are excited to continue working together in the pursuit of education cultural enrichment and positive change.

How insurance company supplanted Heinz as Steelers' stadium sponsor (and angered NFL fans),"The times they are a-changing...

2022 represented a rebirth of sorts for the Steelers. They have a new man under center a youthful bunch in the defense and fairly lowered expectations at least compared to their AFC North foes. They also have a different stadium name.

For 20 years the place where icons like James Harrison Troy Polamalu and Hines Ward called home was known as Heinz Field. Named after the famous condiment brand it was a moniker that just rolled off the tongue. And regardless of how one feels about Heinz's toppings (this writer for example can't stand ketchup) it seemed to suit the franchise well. So much so in fact that Pittsburgh made the playoffs in 14 of its 21 seasons prior to the latest name change to Acrisure Stadium.

DeCOURCY: Timing of Franco Harris' arrival in Pittsburgh was 'Immaculate' but he's left us too soon

That doesn't look to be the case this year. In the laundry list of issues that have popped up in Pittsburgh's season the name of its stadium likely doesn't rank first. But it hasn't helped matters particularly among a raucous fanbase anchored to many of its traditions.

So just what is Acrisure? The Sporting News gives you the skinny on the multi-billion dollar company and its (unpopular) foray into the sporting world.

What is Acrisure?

Based out of Grand Rapids Michigan Acrisure is one of the more prominent financial technology and insurance companies in the United States.

The company was founded in 2005 by Greg Williams and Ricky Norris a firm established to snatch up smaller insurance companies in its native Midwest.

Acrisure has seen stable growth over the past decade or so cementing its status as one of the most prominent insurance companies in the world. It offers tech for a number of different industries including asset management real estate and cyber services.

The company has made serious waves in recent years blossoming from a $28 million business to one that closed a $725 million Preferred Equity campaign earlier this year and received a valuation of $31 billion.

With all the capital its acquired over the years it was little surprise that Acrisure made the jump into the sporting landscape. Per Axios the company will shell more than $150 million over the course of its 15-year deal with Pittsburgh.

Williams a self-described Steeler fan vowed to “invest in the Pittsburgh community.”

It will take a long time for folks to get acclimated to the old digs with a new name. Commentators have mistaken the new title for its more famous past one. So too have fans many of whom have done that in an act of resistance from ownership's unpopular decision.

But with a 15-year deal on the cards Steelers fans — and NFL viewers as a whole — better get used to Acrisure.

Fallout of name change from Heinz Field to Acrisure Stadium

The name change left many Pittsburgh supporters who liked the Heinz Field name upset. Some players even weighed in including legendary Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.

I can't believe it it doesn't seem right or real! Home will always be Heinz Field! I will never forget the last game and all the amazing fans at FOREVER HEINZ! -- Ben.#ForeverHeinz

People even started a Change.org petition to have the stadium name reverted back.

Many wondered why Heinz didn't renew its sponsorship with the Steelers and keep its name in place. The company explained shortly after the new stadium deal was done that it all boiled down to one thing: money.

MORE: Steelers fans personalities react to stadium name change

The Kraft Heinz Company released a statement addressing their naming rights deal with the Steelers. They explained that they couldn't justify paying as much for the rights as Acrisure was willing to shell out.

While we worked diligently with the Steelers for several months around a new naming rights deal they found a new partner willing to pay significantly more than we could justify.

That said Heinz — a Pittsburgh company — isn't ending its sponsorship of the Steelers entirely. They are going to be a ""significant long-term partner"" for the organization and outlined some work that the company will do for the Pittsburgh community.

While our name will no longer be on the stadium Heinz will remain a significant long-term sponsor of the Steelers and we’re excited to announce the details of our new partnership in the days ahead. Kraft Heinz is committed to its ongoing support of the Steelers and the Pittsburgh community in a city that is our co-headquarters. In addition to our partnership with the Steelers we look forward to our continued support of organizations such as the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and Grow Pittsburgh as well as sponsorship of events like Picklesburgh among others.

So Heinz will still have a significant presence in Pittsburgh. It may just be a bit muted compared to when they had the stadium naming rights.

That being said there are still restaurants open on Christmas Day if you want to go out and about with family or just get a quick meal.

Perkins

Perkins in Twin Falls is open for Christmas. They are pretty much open all the time. However they do have reduced hours.

Black Bear Diner

They have reduced hours on Christmas but you can still go on in there and get a good meal.

Jasmine Thai Cuisine

This restaurant will be open 11 am to 9 pm their regular business hours. This is located in Downtown Twin Falls where Prasai's used to be.

Denny's

Denny's is open 24-7. They never take a day off. So if you are craving a Grand Slam Christmas morning you can get yourself one.

IHOP

The International House of Pancakes is also open 24-7. They will be open all day on Christmas during their normal business hours.

Shari's

There seems to be a diner theme. Shari's is open on Christmas Day. I hear they have some really great coffee along with some delicious food.

Jack In The Box

Sometimes you just have to hit a drive thru on Christmas Day. Not everyone celebrates Christmas with big home cooked meals. A drive thru for lunch or dinner at Jack In The Box is a great option.

Carl's Jr

Carl's Jr is also open for Christmas. I do not judge anyone that wants to hit a drive thru on Christmas.

Kroger Holiday Hours,"Kroger supermarkets are all across the United States. So it makes sense that when you're looking for some last-minute Christmas items or you're wanting to get your grocery shopping done before you have to head back to work you'll be wanting to stop at a Kroger.

After all the stores are known for having everything you need from food to home goods to even a pharmacy. But since Christmas is a federal holiday and it just so happens to fall on a Sunday in 2022 there are a lot of stores that are closed.

Is Kroger open on Christmas Day 2022?

Kroger will not be open on December 25 2022. It's actually the only holiday where all locations close their doors (so Kroger will be open on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day).

That means you'll have to check out other grocery stores that will be open on Christmas Day this year such as Safeway and ACME.

The anti-monopoly movement is having a moment. Gone are the days of associating evil market dominance with Standard Oil or Carnegie Steel Bill Gates’ petulance during deposition or how it feels to desperately mortgage Marvin Gardens because you landed at the hotel on Park Place.

As now-Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair Lina Khan asserted five years ago in her seminal work “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox” our government’s outdated enforcement standards “fail[ed] to register” monopolistic harm. Since then millions more Americans have been awakened to the sinister power of monopolies in our economy – and the exciting political opportunities to rein them in.

Last week legions of new anti-monopolists were born. They have enormous potential to change the game: shrewd social media skills undying loyalty and encyclopedic knowledge. They’re Taylor Swift’s superfans – and they just might be the reason that the government breaks up Ticketmaster.

The Swifties – as Swift’s stans are affectionately nicknamed – experienced the destructive power of the live event and ticketing monopoly firsthand. Hoping to procure pre-sale tickets to their favorite pop star’s upcoming tour millions of fans waited in endless e-queues only to be hit with sky-high ticket prices and exorbitant fees – if they were able to snag a ticket at all.

“Ticket prices may fluctuate upon demand at any time” read an ominous warning on the Ticketmaster website. And they did: Due to their “dynamic pricing” system which vaults ticket costs to a maximum market rate fans reported buying tickets for thousands upon thousands of dollars not including hefty fees and prices spiked even higher on the secondary resale market. On StubHub for example ticket listings reached upwards of $95000.

Finally Ticketmaster threw in the towel and canceled subsequent presale windows. Their site crashed thousands of times. It was absolute mayhem – and fans had no other option but to endure it the kind of undignified customer experience caused only by an unchecked monopoly.

Ultimately the Swifties got results.

Hours after Taylor Swift released a statement apologizing to the fans for the bungled presale and chastising Ticketmaster for incapably handling demand the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it has launched an investigation of Live Nation Entertainment’s abuse of market power. While their work wasn’t prompted by Swift reported David McCabe and Ben Sisario in the New York Times Swifties’ wave of discontent was overwhelming enough to warrant the Department’s public disclosure. Immediately the company bragging about a record-smashing 2022 (“benefitting” from “fee bearing tickets”) saw its stock plummet.

How did we get here? When it comes to antitrust issues the American government has essentially been asleep at the wheel allowing Ticketmaster’s monopoly to crush its competition for over a decade.

As Chokepoint Capitalism author Cory Doctorow explained to More Perfect Union Ticketmaster’s dominant control of the live show ticketing market had a natural customer in Live Nation’s concert promoting business which managed an impressive portfolio of major artists and live music venues.

In 2010 the two entities merged into Live Nation Entertainment to suppress their rivalry – a process waved through by the Obama administration’s consolidation-friendly Department of Justice. The company was subject to a relatively weak consent decree which asked the merged companies to not use their live venue dominance to expand their ticketing capacity. But it’s been easy to intimidate their naysayers and flout guidelines ever since.

Put simply the merger created a monster subordinating all parties in the live event life cycle from ticket acquisition to performance.

“Ticketmaster bullies venues into not working with their competitors” concluded Doctorow. “They bully smaller artists by denying them management. They bully big artists by controlling their ticket prices and letting their fans down. And they bully their customers into paying exorbitant prices for tickets not only by enabling resellers but by collecting massive fees on every ticket those resellers sell.”

Even Swift an aspiring billionaire and private jet power-user has no choice but to bend the knee to the ticketing monopoly often an exclusive partner at her massive preferred venues.

Greg Maffei chairman of the monopoly’s parent group – and head of Liberty Media a media conglomerate with Republican ties – blamed the service’s lag time on Taylor’s popularity. “Ticketmaster will twist any situation to protect its market power over live events” noted the American Economic Liberties Project. (It’s time to mention that Maffei took home $47 million from Liberty Media in 2021 and is personally worth hundreds of millions like Swift herself.)

Soaring ticket prices are not entirely the artist’s fault for their popularity. Even as Taylor Swift’s music is of the money-printing monocultural variety – incentivizing “dynamic pricing” to the highest degree – she’s still a worker exploited by and beholden to an overarching system. As Live Nation and Ticketmaster can force artists to work with them and make a killing on their sale and resale fees less popular or well resourced artists are uniquely harmed by the business model without other streams of income.

“Corporations are extracting the maximum capital from artists’ labor and they’re not sharing it anymore” said Doctorow.

Ticketmaster’s unsustainable market dominance has long been understood. Well before the Taylor Swift fiasco a coalition of research organizations and artists collectives launched the Break Up Ticketmaster campaign – asking the DOJ to “investigate and unwind” the live events monopoly. The campaign quickly gained ground generating tens of thousands of signatures on an advocacy letter.

Pro-breakup legislators also harnessed the news cycle calling on the Department of Justice to investigate the abusive ticketing monopoly.

“Consumers deserve better than this anti-hero behavior” tweeted Senator Richard Blumenthal punning off a song from Swift’s latest album Midnights.

And on MSNBC Senate Antitrust Committee chair Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) promised a Senate hearing on Ticketmaster’s market power and insufficient consent decree in the coming year. She expressed political interest in “put[ting] the Taylor Swift fans right on antitrust” as their ticketing experience was “a story of a monopoly gone wild.” Her bills with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Mike Lee (R-UT) aim to facilitate antitrust enforcement with new filing funding and state empowerment rules.

State lawmakers too seized the opportunity to criticize consolidation. After all Swifties are spread across the country and party lines. The Attorney General of Tennessee – home to the “angriest Swifties” – opened an investigation into Ticketmaster’s misconduct. And in New York state Senator Mike Gianaris called attention to his 21st Century Anti-Trust Act which would “hold [Ticketmaster] accountable for manipulating the ticket market to bleed concert-goers.”

For his part President Biden recently directed his administration to “reduce or eliminate” junk fees like Ticketmasters’ infamous extra charges which sometimes total up to 78 percent of the cost of a ticket. And he’s appointed a passel of pioneering antitrust enforcers – like New Brandeisian icon and FTC chair Lina Khan DOJ Antitrust lead Jonathan Kanter and former economic advisor Tim Wu – who are dedicated to bucking Robert Bork’s inert “consumer welfare standard” overhauling the state’s merger guidelines and appropriately disciplining monopolistic harm in the contemporary economy. Biden also signed a robust competition-oriented executive order in his first months in the Oval Office.

The President’s paradigm shift comes not a moment too soon. Monopolies aren’t just disfiguring our economy or our political processes. They are capable of stripping everything for parts – even our arts and culture cornerstones of democratic society that should be unequivocally protected from the incursions of greedy corporations.

Swifties understand this. And they experience the villainy of monopolies across the board – through the high price of a tight seat on a plane home from college in the improbability of a solid career in journalism in their skyrocketing monthly rent or in the marginalization of their small e-commerce business.

So present day monopolists steel yourselves and remember: When you provoke a superfan they’ll come for you.

JPL’s cutting-edge instrument which will provide insights into the lunar water cycle and composition of the Moon’s surface has been incorporated into the small satellite.

Lunar Trailblazer NASA’s mission to understand lunar water and the Moon’s water cycle led by Caltech in Pasadena California is one step closer to launching next year. Earlier this month the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California delivered a key science instrument to Lockheed Martin Space in Colorado and the teams integrated it with the small satellite or SmallSat.

The instrument called the High-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper (HVM3) is one of two on Lunar Trailblazer. HVM3 will detect and map water on the Moon’s surface to determine its abundance location form and how it changes over time. This information will provide data on the lunar water cycle and help inform future human missions as to where supplies of water may be found and extracted as a resource.

“The calibration and integration of HVM3 is a major milestone because after three years of hard work the team delivered our key science instrument. This is a very exciting time” said Walton Williamson systems engineer at JPL and the HVM3 instrument manager.

The other instrument the Lunar Thermal Mapper infrared multispectral imager is being developed by the University of Oxford in the U.K. and is scheduled for delivery and integration in early 2023.

Exquisite Sensitivity

Selected under NASA’s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program in 2019 Lunar Trailblazer measures only 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) wide with its solar panels fully deployed but this a compact spacecraft with far-reaching goals.

While past observations have confirmed that the Moon has water on its surface little is known about its distribution or form. HVM3 an imaging spectrometer will fill this knowledge gap by mapping the spectral fingerprints – or wavelengths of reflected sunlight – of the different forms of water over the lunar landscape to make high-resolution maps.

For instance water molecules could be locked inside lunar rock and regolith – broken rock and dust – and they may settle for short periods as frost in cold shadows. As the Sun moves across the sky during the lunar day the shadows move too cycling these water molecules into the Moon’s exosphere and transporting them to other cold places where they can settle once more as a frost. The most likely locations to hold water ice in significant quantities are permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles which are key targets for science and exploration.

To differentiate between these different forms of water how they move and where they are located HVM3 has two key features that set it apart from other spectrometers. The first is its ability to detect a wide range of infrared wavelengths that are readily absorbed by different forms of water. The second is its sensitivity to those wavelengths: HVM3 is designed to be sensitive to low illumination levels which will be critical to revealing water that may be found in the Moon’s darkest craters.

“Measuring the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar surface will be the most challenging part of the mission” said David R. Thompson senior research scientist at JPL and HVM3 instrument scientist. “To observe any ice on the floors of those craters that haven’t seen sunlight for eons we’ll be using light scattered off neighboring solar-illuminated crater walls.”

Thompson likens this to a bank shot in basketball when a player makes a shot that bounces from the backboard into the basket. Solar photons – the quantum particles of light – bounce or scatter off the sunlit slopes of the crater and are redirected into the permanently shadowed crater bottoms. This light can be over a thousand times dimmer than direct solar illumination requiring exquisite instrument sensitivity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9uZXctdXMtbWFyaW5lLWNvcnBzLWhlYXZ5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcmVhY2hlcy1mdWxsLXJhdGUtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAV9odHRwczovL2RlZmVuY2UtYmxvZy5jb20vbmV3LXVzLW1hcmluZS1jb3Jwcy1oZWF2eS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLXJlYWNoZXMtZnVsbC1yYXRlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24vP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New US Marine Corps’ heavy helicopter reaches full-rate production,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='defence-blog.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /new-us-marine-corps-heavy-helicopter-reaches-full-rate-production/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227392E60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9uZXctdXMtbWFyaW5lLWNvcnBzLWhlYXZ5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcmVhY2hlcy1mdWxsLXJhdGUtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAV9odHRwczovL2RlZmVuY2UtYmxvZy5jb20vbmV3LXVzLW1hcmluZS1jb3Jwcy1oZWF2eS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLXJlYWNoZXMtZnVsbC1yYXRlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24vP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vd2h5LXRvcC1ndW4tbWF2ZXJpY2stZGlkbnQtdXNlLWYyMi1maWdodGVyLWpldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why They Didn't Use F-22s In Top Gun: Maverick,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vd2h5LXRvcC1ndW4tbWF2ZXJpY2stZGlkbnQtdXNlLWYyMi1maWdodGVyLWpldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtNzI1NzYz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eleven F-35 fighters grounded after US crash - Israel News,"Israel grounded 11 of its F-35A stealth fighters on Sunday after an F-35B US fighter crashed earlier this month in Texas.

The F-35 is reportedly one of the IDF’s key components to its stealth attacks against enemy advanced weapons in a variety of countries.

An IDF statement said that the grounding decision was made after an initial review was taken of the Israeli F-35 aircraft and revealed potentially similar malfunctions as what had occurred in the US fighter’s crash.

At the same time the IDF and Lockheed Martin who manufactures the F-35 pointed out that it is not certain the Israeli F-35A has the same problem.

Rather they emphasized that the grounding which only applies to 11 aircraft out of a much larger fleet of F-35s and other planes was taken as a precaution. IAF 'Adir' F-35 fighter jets seen escorting US B-52 bombers on November 10 2022 (credit: IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT)

There are a number of differences between the F-35A and B including that the B-version can land vertically like a helicopter and hover like a drone whereas the A-version lands like any standard aircraft.

Incident in Texas

During the incident in Texas the aircraft started landing according to standard procedures but after a malfunction it smashed into the Fort Worth runway.

Seconds before it would have been too late the pilot successfully activated his ejection seat and he was able to parachute to safety.

This has been only one of a series of incidents with different versions of the F-35 aircraft including one in July when both the US and Israel halted training flights for the plane.

At that time the problem was the ejection seat – which earlier this month functioned properly and saved the pilot’s life.

The July decision was made by IAF chief Maj.-Gen. Tomer Bar and the entire fleet was evaluated with two planes examined per day by IAF teams who were given equipment by Lockheed Martin.

Each plane found to have working ejection seats was quickly returned to flight.

“The examinations must be done in a strict and thorough manner in order to return the fleet to full competence while maintaining a high safety standard” Bar said in July.

“The examinations must be done in a strict and thorough manner in order to return the fleet to full competence while maintaining a high safety standard.” Tomer Bar

At the time the US Air Force grounded the jets due to a faulty cartridge-actuated device inside its ejection seat that would prevent the pilot from being able to safely blast out of the aircraft during an emergency.

As of July Israel had 33 of the advanced jets in two squadrons the 116th Lions of the South Squadron and the 140th Golden Eagle Squadron based at Nevatim Airbase. The IAF also had a third squadron used for training.

The jets have an extremely low radar signature allowing them to operate undetected deep inside enemy territory. Since becoming operational in 2018 the F-35 squadrons have carried out missions both over the Gaza Strip and reportedly in Syria as part of Israel’s “war between the wars” campaign.

Ok that is my attempt at some humor.

Let’s take a look at yet another one of Lockheed Martin’s offerings: the X-44 Manta.

No Not the Sea Creature But Rather a Warbird

In this case “MANTA” does not refer to the majestic sea animal (otherwise it’d be the name of a submersible instead of an aircraft right?) but is yet another acronym (Lord knows we military types love our alphabet soup) this one standing for Multi-Axis No-Tail Aircraft (by contrast the aforementioned big fish certainly does have a tail).

For some strange reason there are no references to the X-44 on the official Lockheed Martin website so I’m having to wing it (yes I went there) and dig up other sources of information on the MANTA project.

X-44 Manta – What We Know

The Air Force’s—and NASA’s—motivation behind the X-44 Manta project starting in 1999 was to test the feasibility of full yaw pitch and roll authority without tailplanes (horizontal or vertical) with attitude control relying purely on 3D thrust vectoring.

As explained in an official NASA document titled American X-Vehicles: An Inventory X-1 to X-50 “Thrust vectoring—the ability to turn the jet exhaust—allows an aircraft to create forces with its engines similar to the forces created by aerodynamic surfaces such as flaps rudders and stabilators. The result would be a structurally simple light airframe with increased fuel vol­ume and better ‘stealth’ characteristics since there would be no movable aerodynamic control surfaces.”

In layman’s terms thrust vectoring would grant the kind of maneuverability that would overwhelm enemy fighter planes meaning the pilot could change the angle of thrust to control altitude advantageously thus allowing the airplane to change directions in a more aggressive manner.

Another advantage stemming from the lack of a tail section would have been low observability flight—perhaps even stealthier than the Raptor. The X-44’s aircraft design was derived from the F-22 Raptor and featured a stretched delta wing without tail surfaces. Conceptually the plane would have been 62-feet long with side-by-side Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines generating 35000 pounds (15 875 kg) of thrust. It was estimated that the airplane could achieve speeds of up to 1500 miles per hour (2414 kph) with a 49000-foot (14935 m) ceiling.

Moreover the design would have conferred the advantages of lower drag and more efficiency with better stealth capabilities including internal weapons bays (with potential for a full payload of Sidewinders AMRAAMs “smart bombs” and a 20mm internal cannon). Last but not least the overall configuration would have enabled the MANTA to have greater fuel capacity to extend range.

X-44 Manta – What Might Have Been

Alas the X-44 Manta never got off the ground (yes I went there again) i.e. it never made it past the design concept stage but as my 1945 colleague Brent M. Eastwood noted “its short life influenced later stealth designs that may be taken up by the U.S. NGAD (Next Generation Air Dominance) 6th-generation fighter.”

Yes that’s correct; as hot and intense as the 5th Generation fighter race between the U.S China and Russia may be discussions about the 6th Generation is already making the rounds. Regarding

NGAD to quote another one of my 1945 colleagues this time Senior Editor Peter Suciu:

“It will be far more than just a more advanced fighter – and instead will be a “family of systems” that would include autonomous capabilities stealth a new spectrum of weapons thermal management of the aircraft signature and improved propulsion with supercruise ability. Each of the programs is being developed with maximum connectivity advanced sensors and open architecture while taking advantage of computer-aided design. There are notable differences however as the Navy’s F/A-XX would not rely primarily on speed or stealth as much as previous-generation jet fighters and instead would rely on advanced weaponry to overwhelm or suppress an enemy air defenses. In addition the Air Force has been more focused on adaptive-cycle jet engine technology.”

Stay tuned folks.

A Samsung washer recall applies to more than 660000 washing machines that could short-circuit and overheat posing a fire hazard.

CHICAGO -- Samsung recalled more than 660000 washing machines warning customers that the machine could short-circuit and overheat posing a fire hazard.

The company received 51 reports of ""smoking melting overheating or fire involving the washers."" Ten of these reports resulted in property damage and three customers reported injuries from smoke inhalation.

Several models of Samsung's top-load washers with super speed wash are affected: the WA49B WA50B WA51A WA52A WA54A and WA55A. The machines were sold in white black champagne and ivory colors and the Consumer Product Safety Commission published the range of serial numbers for the 14 models recalled.

The 663500 washing machines were sold at bigbox retailers such as Best Buy Costco The Home Depot and Lowe's from June 2021 through December 2022 costing between $900 and $1500.

A software update can fix the fire hazard. ""Consumers should immediately check whether their washer's software has been updated to prevent the hazard; and if not consumers should immediately stop using the washer until the software is updated"" the CPSC said.

All wi-fi equipped washers should automatically download the free software repair when connected to the internet Samsung said. Those who don't have internet can get a free dongle from Samsung to plug in and download the free software repair.

NEOM

Malcolm Aw said he pulled out of a Neom contract because of alleged Saudi human rights abuses.

The CEO of Solar Water told BI that he had planned to build solar desalination plants.

Human rights campaigners say tribe members are being forcibly evicted to make way for the megacity.

A green energy founder pulled out of a $100 million Neom contract after he realized that the Saudis were bulldozing villages to make way for the megacity.

Malcolm Aw the CEO and founder of Solar Water told Business Insider that he initially got involved with Neom to help realize its ambitions as a pioneering green energy ""eco-city.""

Neom is the centerpiece of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 project to diversify the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels and transform it into a luxury tourism destination and innovation hub.

However Aw said he was so appalled at reports of human rights abuses that he canceled the Neom contract in 2022 despite having already built some of his desalination plants there.

""They just they bulldoze their way right through villages and everything which is just unbelievable"" said Aw.

Aw spoke to BI after BBC News reported that an exiled Saudi colonel said Saudi Arabia authorized the use of lethal force to clear the way for its Neom desert megacity.

Col Rabih Alenezi said he was ordered to evict people living on the land to make way for a part of the project called The Line . The area was mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe.

The BBC said it was not able to independently verify Alenezi's comments about lethal force.

However satellite images analyzed by the BBC showed three villages including schools and hospitals were destroyed to make way for Neom.

One of the villagers Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti was later reportedly killed by Saudi authorities said the UN.

""What it tried to do is turn the whole province into Dubai or Qatar or something but in doing so they are clearing the people who have been there for years out of the area"" said Aw.

""These people could be such a contribution to this whole development. You know the villages have all been removed.""







Aw who is a descendant of Tiger Balm founder Aw Boon Haw told BI that he had initially been drawn to work on the Neom project because of its commitment to green energy and ecology.

Aw's company uses solar energy for desalination while most desalination plants burn fossil fuels and have been found to pollute oceans. Neom had offered Aw's company Solar Water $100m for exclusive rights to use his technology.

Neom's planners say they want to be an""eco-city"" with the signature project ""The Line"" — a vertical mirrored skyscraper cutting through the desert — running on 100% renewable energy and 95% of the land preserved for nature. They claim to be committed to ""respecting existing communities and cultural heritage within our region.""

But Aw believes the promises are not being fulfilled and planners are performing a U-turn on their original vision for the city.

""What they're doing is not ethical and what they're doing is they're creating an exclusivity to house wealthy people in a wealthy touristic area. But that wasn't the original idea. The idea was to develop a green scenario"" he said.

""The whole idea we came in is to make the place green and for the people the local people the indigenous who have been there for ages for yonks to be able to share into development"" said Aw. ""But then they change course. Suddenly they are totally different from what we expect to do and in doing so they have done a lot of damage.""

Neom declined to comment on Aw's claims. The Saudi embassy in the UK did not respond to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia has been trying to quell public criticism about its Vision 2030 plans .

Last year BI reported that the crackdown extended to those criticizing the evictions on social media with Fatima al-Shawarbi sentenced to 30 years in prison for speaking out.

The project has been beset by problems in recent months with costs spiraling to an estimated $1 trillion and key projects delayed or cut back. In April Bloomberg reported that Saudi officials were reducing the number of people expected to be living in Neom from around one million to 300000 by 2030. The report also said the length of The Line could be cut from around 100 miles to one mile.

Aw urged planners to stand by their original ethical and ecological vision.

""You know we have the technology to solve the [green energy] problem that people are complaining about today. Absolutely. Absolutely. But there's just not the vision or the ethical commitment"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM4OTIvdmVyaXpvbi10bW9iaWxlLWF0dC11bmxpbWl0ZWQtcGxhbi1mcmVlLXBob25lLW9mZmVycy1maW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile's “unlimited” plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist,"Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile will pay a combined $10.22 million to a group of states to settle claims that the carriers lied to customers about their “unlimited” plans and “free” phone offers. The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

When my sister and I launched an online beauty products business in San Antonio in 2019 we knew we would be forced to hand over a slice of every sale to a third party. That’s because Wall Street banks and global credit card networks charge merchants a percentage of the transaction to process payments. And as an online business – unlike bricks-and-mortar stores where at least some purchases are paid for in cash – all of our sales are paid for by card.What we didn’t know was how much these “swipe” fees would skyrocket. Nationwide credit and debit card swipe fees soared 25% last year alone to a record $138 billion and have more than doubled over the past decade.We currently pay 2.6% of the purchase amount plus 30 cents per transaction when customers use a credit card. When we sell a $40 holiday gift set for example that means the banks and card networks take $1.34 off the top rather than us getting the full amount.These fees add up quickly. And like most small retailers our extremely narrow profit margins allow little margin for error before we end up losing money – and are potentially out of business.We have not increased prices since starting our business. Not after swipe fees rose last year and not after Visa and Mastercard hiked them by $1.2 billion this spring despite being warned by Congress that doing so would “add to inflationary pressure.”We’ve kept prices the same because we care about our customers and know the challenges they face amid today’s rampant inflation. We’ve haggled with suppliers cut costs and spent less on marketing. But the one cost we can’t control is swipe fees. Banks refuse to negotiate. And since swipe fees are a percentage of the transaction whatever we do to control other costs they still take their cut. Against that pressure we can’t hold off forever.That’s why we welcomed introduction of the Credit Card Competition Act by Congressmen Lance Gooden of Texas and Peter Welch of Vermont.Currently Visa and Mastercard – which control 80% of the market – centrally price-fix the swipe fees charged by all banks that issue their cards rather than the banks competing to give merchants the best deal. And they block transactions from being processed by other networks that offer lower fees and better security.Under the legislation the nation’s largest banks would be required to enable credit cards they issue to be processed over at least two unaffiliated networks – Visa or Mastercard plus an independent network like NYCE Star or Shazam or even American Express or Discover. Merchants would then decide which to use forcing networks to compete over fees service and security.Competition would save merchants $11 billion a year with most of the savings passed on to consumers. And the Federal Reserve says independent networks have one-fifth the fraud of Visa and Mastercard’s networks further benefiting consumers. The bill applies only to financial institutions with $100 billion in assets so community banks and virtually all credit unions are exempt. Credit card rewards would be protected since those are determined by banks that issue cards not the networks that process transactions. And network routing is a back-office process so consumers would keep their current cards.Soaring credit card swipe fees are unsustainable and we aren’t the only retailers affected: We proudly joined scores of small business owners who traveled to Washington recently to explain this issue to members of Congress.Swipe fees are most merchants’ highest operating cost after labor – far too much to absorb – and drive up consumer prices by about $900 a year for the average Texas family according to the Merchants Payments Coalition. It’s time for Congress to pass the Credit Card Competition Act.Toni Lee Jimenez is co-founder of Chica Beauty an online seller of beauty products based in San Antonio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am95b25saW5lLmNvbS9tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWhlYWx0aC1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aXZlLWVuZ2FnZXMtcG9saWN5LXN0YWtlaG9sZGVycy10by1pbXByb3ZlLXByaW1hcnktaGVhbHRoY2FyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard Health Collaborative engages policy stakeholders to improve primary healthcare,"Mastercard Higher Education Health Collaborative of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has engaged policy-level stakeholders in Ghana’s health sector to share ideas on ways to empower the next generation of healthcare workers.

Principal Investigator on the project Prof. Ellis Owusu-Dabo says the meeting sets the stage to improve universal healthcare coverage.

“This we intend to do by creating employment empowering the next generation of healthcare workers through the various ecosystems we will create and through entrepreneurship.

“We seek to do this by coming up with programmes that will help the average Ghanaian health worker to be empowered through skills competencies and knowledge and bring health to the doorstep of the average Ghanaian” he said.

The objectives of the Higher Education Collaborative in Health are to Build and strengthen the capacity of healthcare students and professionals to meet the growing demand for Primary Health Care (PHC) in the health sector; Enable students to acquire advanced skills in Africa across a broad range of disciplines critical for sustainable health sector growth and transformation; Optimize entrepreneurial ecosystems in and through universities in Africa to launch and scale health start-ups to create jobs; Develop a dynamic sustainable long-term network of leading African universities alumni government agencies health care start-ups and private sector partners working together to create dignified and fulfilling jobs across health ecosystems.

The project will further develop a dynamic sustainable long-term network of leading African universities alumni and government agencies healthcare start-ups and private sector partners working together to create dignified and fulfilling jobs across health ecosystems in the next ten years.

KNUST is one of the eight partners of the Higher Education Collaborative in Health with the aim to contribute to all three pillars of the health strategy: Health Employment Health Entrepreneurship and Health Ecosystems.

Pillar Coordinator Health Entrepreneurship Prof. Wilberforce Owusu-Ansah stressed the need to create entrepreneurial opportunities in the health sector.

“Some people look at entrepreneurship from business start-ups but we want to look at from setting up your own business and being entrepreneurial wherever you find yourself” he said.

The stakeholders were happy with the insight from the meeting.

Deputy Director of policy planning Monitoring and Evaluation at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital Ms. Bernice Ofosu was impressed with the presentations and asked the project team to consider rolling out courses targeting tertiary health facilities.

She also called for courses in medical tourism to meet the growing demand.

“Generally the programme has been great. Even though Ghana is focusing on primary healthcare tertiary healthcare is also very important when it comes to a continuum of care. So they should consider courses that can enhance leadership and change culture when it comes to tertiary–level facilities” she said.

“Ghana is considering medical tourism. There can be courses in services packaging for not only Ghanaians but people in the sub-region” she added.

Prof. Owusu-Dabo hinted at continuous engagement with the stakeholders to ensure the success of the project.

“We seek to collaborate with these institutions who will be part of the panel of interviewers to help implement the ideals of the Collaborative” he said.

It’s a hot dry Doha morning my tent is quickly heating up but it’s tolerable.

I open the tent flap for the air to flow and to get a nice view of the Doha skyline across the bay. I’m getting myself together after a few hours of sleep.

French Montana held an impromptu concert last night an extra treat for the Moroccans in attendance (as this was before their World Cup magic began.)

Packing all my luggage into my two bags I carefully organize all that I have. This could be my last time seeing these bags for a while.

Placing essential items into my backpack snacks my Hayya card (your lifeline out here in Qatar) wallet and a carefully folded jersey of Wales Qatar and USA.

I put on my Welsh Bucket Hat as if a soldier’s helmet it’s time for battle. And by battle I mean checkout of my tent village attend three matches in one day and make my flight back to the States by 4am.

Should be easy of course it will not be. Yes 4am is the flight at Doha International Airport from mid-November through late December there’s no such thing as an unusual hour of operation.

My itinerary of the day if you noted the jerseys I packed a Wales Qatar and USA shirt. Matches of the day Wales vs Iran Qatar vs Senegal and USA vs England.

Quite a day and I’m eager to see some great football (I know……it’s called soccer) and hoping for good results.

First up Wales vs. Iran.

Wales vs Iran

For anyone who knows me Wales is my heart. I’m American but as we know being American we’re obsessed with our heritage.

I don’t have German Italian or Irish claim. My last name is Pugh as this is my Welsh-rights I l claim for my ticket in the Red Wall (the Welsh fan base).

I’ve followed the Welsh Football Association for quite some years now and it’s been a roller coaster of emotions.

From qualifying for the Euros 2016 beating Belgium in the 2016 quarter-finals to getting World Cup 2018 dreams smashed by Ireland. I am here for it all.

To begin the day’s journey I meet some Welsh friends I’ve made at the Free Zone Fan Village this past week and we take the metro to Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.

Easy to know where to go FOLLOW THE BUCKET HATS or listen for singing of the Welsh campaign’s anthem Yma o Hyd! Arriving at the stadium immediately I realize we may be the home team on paper but the Iranians who turned up for their relatively short flight have flipped the script.

I’m in awe of the excitement all around the singing from the Welsh and equally the chants from the Iranians in Farsi. I stop a moment longer to gander at an Iranian lady she’s sporting messages all over herself.

Evident this is in protest of what’s going on back home. Surreal stuff to get a close up look at that.

As I enter the Stadium I take in every moment. It’s a fresh feeling having the first match of the day. Not as intense as a night match but just as important nonetheless.

I get settled with my seat in the Red Wall sporting my early 1990 Christmas Tree Welsh Throwback shirt. I make small chat with the fans next to me explain my American accent and make other banter.

As far as the match goes a bit more action would’ve been welcomed. Wales held Iran 0-0 for a while and then floodgates opened after keeper Wayne Hennessey got a bit eager and came out of the box for a red card defense play.

Just when you thought it would be 0-0 in the last minute of stoppage time Iran broke them. And then added salt to the wound for a second one.

The whistle blows heartache watching Bale and company give their reluctant thanks to the Red Wall. They know deep down the chances of an early return to Cardiff looks very likely.

I take in the last moments of the ambiance. It’s all memories win or lose. I also realize this is my last time in the Red Wall for a while (until a return to Cardiff one day) I gather myself….time for Match 2!

Qatar vs Senegal

Outside the Ahmad Bin Ali stadium I meet with my friend Ben from Sydney and we get a cab to the stadium to see Qatar take on Senegal.

Rushing to Al Thumama we make it just in time for action. I adore this stadium modeled after the traditional gahfiya hat it is the perfect venue to see the host country play.

Heaps of Qatari fans in traditional wear wave their maroon and white flags. The Senegalese are spread throughout the stadium and as anyone knows they are dancing the full 90 minutes and more. With my Budweiser Zero I find myself content as ever.

I sport the white Qatar away shirt with a dash of desert attributes to get into the spirit. I’m neutral about the outcome so I just hope to see some good action.

Senegal goes up 1-0 before half from a Boulaye Dia goal and you feel the Qataris are slowly losing faith in their team for this tournament. Can they truly be the first host nation to not advance past the group stage? I think so…

After Senegal doubles the lead Qatar finally get in their first goal of the tournament by Mohammed Muntari and the fans erupt! Time to wave those maroon and white flags again!

At the end of the match it’s a final of 3-1 and Senegal is grooving to the beat of the drums as their next match will be their ticket into the knockouts. I give my clapping respects to both Senegal and Qatar and slowly exit the stadium.

England vs USA

And now it’s time to focus on the main event tonight England vs USA. Distant cousins across the Atlantic.

The Crown vs. the rambunctious Colonists if we’re still sentimental over 1776 of course. I’ve been itching quite a while to see this venue we’re at. In the most beautiful of all Qatar’s stadiums Al Bayt Stadium.

I’ve always wanted to stay in a Bedouin tent why not watch a soccer match in one. It’s the same venue that hosted the opening match of Qatar vs. Ecuador if needing reference.

Representing the Qatari and Arab hospitality the Bedouin tents mean much more than what meets the eye.

This tent stadium is very north of Doha. Mixed in factors of traffic it can be almost a 45 minute to hour drive. The recommended route is by bus provided by FIFA for the fans. On the bus we’re mostly Americans mixed in with a few quiet English.

Under the lights it’s 10pm here at Al Bayt Stadium everyone knows the whole world is watching. I’ve never experienced any intense feeling like this.

Americans pack one side of the stadium while the English pack the other side. I’m in awe to see a plethora of talent on the pitch particularly the English. The Three Lions are basically just an All Star team of the English Premier League (not all of course).

It’s an interesting moment when you finally see footballers in person rather than on the television.

By the time one is reading this I won’t have to oversell the match as we all know it ended 0-0. Still feeling like a victory USA coming with a point against England is something to be proud of.

Again as the final whistle blows I take in the last moments I have of the 2022 World Cup. Then I make my way to the buses it’s time to go home.

I leave Doha a mix of feelings exhausted drained satisfied accomplished but yet I feel like there’s more to explore and experience.

Despite most of my matches not including many goals or top highlights of the tournament I don’t regret a thing. Every second of this tournament is part of the experience and no matter the outcome it’s all for the memories and the love of the sport.

Thank you Qatar for the memories.

Szymon Marciniak the Polish referee who officiated the FIFA World Cup final between Argentina and France has confessed that he made a mistake in the World Cup final match. There has been a huge outcry among French fans protesting against the referee’s decisions after Argentina’s win in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Marciniak 41 said that although he did not make any ‘big mistake’ in the game there are some decisions that he could have made differently. He said that he interrupted a french counter-attack after the bad tacket by Macros Acuna. Marciniak said he was afraid that the fouled player wanted to unwind and he read it wrong as nothing happened. She said that he could have given an advantage in that situation.Marciniak is the first Polish referee to officiate in a FIFA World Cup final. He came as the replacement after the English referee Anthoney Taylor was barred from officiating the match over concerns of bias. Many football fans have lauded Marciniak for doing an excellent job in such a big match. But he is also facing great criticism from the french fans.The French fans and media are criticizing him for allowing the extra time goal of Messey as Argentina players broke the FIFA rule when three extra players entered the ground. However Marciniak has fought back against the claims. He showed a screenshot of seven french players standing on the pitch. The French fans are signing a petition for replaying the final match.The match officiating by Marciniak has been largely applauded. The minor mistake that he discussed might not have affected the outcomes of the match. The petition of the French players is going to have little outcome as there is not much base to their claims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvZGF0aW5nLWFwcHMtbmV3LXVzZS1zdGRzLTIwMjIxMjI0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A new use for dating apps: Chasing STDs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvZGF0aW5nLWFwcHMtbmV3LXVzZS1zdGRzLTIwMjIxMjI0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212237D5C00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

“At that time we had injury problems with the back four and it was very painful. Now we are in a different moment we have options at the back not only quantity but quality also. As a team we have improved a lot have kept four clean sheets and to keep a fifth one we will have to be at the top of our game not only at set-pieces but especially in that area.

“Every game is difficult but this one especially so. We have extra motivation because of that defeat that feels like yesterday.”

Gary Rowett Millwall Manager:

“They [Watford] are a very good side with a really big experienced manager in Slaven Bilić who is a great guy.

“You can see the influence he’s had on that team – they have started to be very consistent.

“They have got some excellent players the likes of João Pedro Ismaïla Sarr and Keinan Davis – it almost seems silly some of those players are in the Championship but that’s where they are.

“Their recent form shows they are a Premier League side with parachute money trying to find their way to the top end of the Championship.”"

A first in itself the famous fast food chain McDonald's has unveiled an automated store in Texas. The facility allows ordering food without using a mobile app or a kiosk. Customers will get their orders on the conveyor belt without human contact. The restaurant is designed to be a 'grab and go' facility with no seats and table arrangements to dine inside the restaurant.Compared to other McDonald's this specific store is smaller in size and the primary purpose of the restaurant is to increase accuracy and order speed. The customers can order their food before reaching the restaurant without wasting time waiting and ordering. The Company said it is developing new ways to serve customers faster and more efficiently.The Company said that the food is still prepared by human staff at the restaurant but the human contact with the customers is ended by the new method. Keith Vanecek the restaurant's franchisee said that the new approach allows our restaurant team to concentrate more on order speed making the experiences more efficient and enjoyable for the customers and staff members.However the Company has faced much criticism because of making the process automated as it will affect people's jobs. The minimum pay in Texas is among the lowest in the US at $7.25 an hour. And cutting employment in such a state worries the people who are already apprehensive of robots and automation replacing human labour.Many people are against the idea and share their views and experience on social media. A user said on social media that it would lead to the cutting of jobs of people working in restaurants. Another user said he is already talking with Siri and Google and now he has to talk to another robot.McDonald's says the concept will make the customer experience more seamless.McDonald's has more than 40000 restaurants in the world.McDonald's net worth is about $195.7 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9maXJzdC1ldmVyLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1zZXJ2ZWQtcm9ib3RzLXRleGFzLTE3NjkxMTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Welcome to the First Ever McDonald's Where You're Served by Robots—In Texas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/first-ever-mcdonalds-served-robots-texas-1769116 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9maXJzdC1ldmVyLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1zZXJ2ZWQtcm9ib3RzLXRleGFzLTE3NjkxMTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21jZG9uYWxkcy11bnZlaWxzLWZpcnN0LWF1dG9tYXRlZC1sb2NhdGlvbi1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtd29ycmllZC13aWxsLWN1dC1taWxsaW9ucy1qb2Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's unveils first automated location social media worried it will cut 'millions' of jobs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21jZG9uYWxkcy11bnZlaWxzLWZpcnN0LWF1dG9tYXRlZC1sb2NhdGlvbi1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtd29ycmllZC13aWxsLWN1dC1taWxsaW9ucy1qb2Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227393460>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

SANTA FE — Santa Fe will soon be getting a new physician-owned multispecialty practice that will deliver high-quality care to Northern New Mexico.

The Nexus Health practice will have a full range of medical and surgical specialties directed by well-respected doctors who have made a commitment to put patients first in the new independent model of care. Nexus Health is owned and directed by medical providers who practice and live in Santa Fe & Northern New Mexico.

Nexus Health will start by providing Medical Oncology Orthopedics Infusion Services and Lab operations but will continue to add specialties over the next two years including:

Urology Gynecology Primary Care Hospitalist Medicine and Radiation Oncology (2023)

Radiology Breast Surgery Gastroenterology Cardiology Pulmonology Physical Therapy Nephrology Neurosurgery Gynecologic Oncology and visiting specialties such as bone marrow transplant and liver transplant (2024)

“We have made a commitment to being physician-led and physician-owned” Dr. Scott Herbert said President of Nexus Health. “Too much of today’s healthcare is practiced in high-cost low-efficiency settings. Our community deserves choice and it deserves better and more affordable care. We are a group of doctors who care about our patients and our community.”

Nexus Health is announcing the construction of a new $116 million building with funding provided by McKesson to construct the 90000 square foot facility on the south side of Santa Fe which will house all the specialties in one convenient location. The main campus is scheduled to open in mid 2024. While the Nexus Health network will be entirely physician-owned McKesson will provide support to maintain the facility with state-of-the-art equipment and systems.

“Our engagement with McKesson one of the top health care operations in the U.S. will mean that we will have the best facilities the best systems and the best opportunities for doctors that health care can provide today” Dr. Kathryn Chan said oncologist at Nexus Health. “McKesson is committed to our practice being physician-owned and operated and that is why we chose to work with them. Our patients will see the benefits.”

New Mexico Cancer Care Associates (NMCCA) which has operated a medical oncology practice in Santa Fe for more than thirty years will join Nexus Health at the beginning of the year.

Nexus Oncology opens Jan. 3 2023 at its new location at 2085 South Pacheco Street in Santa Fe. Current patients of NMCCA will have a seamless transition to the new network and oncology services will be uninterrupted. The oncology practice will operate at the Pacheco Street location until the new building on Santa Fe’s south side is complete.

Well-known and well-respected NMCCA providers transferring to Nexus Health include Dr. Kathryn Chan Dr. Fei Gu Dr. Scott Herbert Dr. Clifton “Kip” Layman Dr. Karen LoRusso Dr. David Snyder and nurse practitioners Sara White and Ryan Commiskey.

Nexus Health also includes highly regarded and well-established orthopedic surgeons Dr. John Garcia Dr. Luke Bulthuis Dr. Markus E. Garard and nurse practitioner Margaret Gavin. They have been practicing at the Presbyterian Santa Fe Medical Center since March 2023.

Other doctors joining Nexus Health will be announced as their specialties launch.

“As doctors we were really frustrated with the high physician turnover in the community and the lack of collaboration and team-based care” Dr. John Garcia said an orthopedic surgeon at Nexus Health. “We’ve all been living the same frustrating healthcare story for so long that we’ve simply forgotten to ask ‘Why are things this way?’ But we don’t have to accept the status quo; we can create a lasting health care model for the communities of northern New Mexico. Healthcare can be more convenient. Care can be coordinated rather than disparate and divided which can also make it more affordable.”

In addition patients of Nexus Health will be able to go to either hospital in Santa Fe as Nexus Health physicians will maintain privileges at both hospitals in Santa Fe a big advantage for patients.

Costs are another advantage for Nexus Health patients. Nexus will not be tied to any hospital system so costs will be lower which could result in lower premiums lower co-pays and lower costs overall for the patients.

“I joined Nexus Health because of their vision their dedication to patients and their dedication to the community” Dr. Kip Layman said. “I am honored to be a part of something bringing positive change to Santa Fe and I’m excited to serve northern New Mexico with Nexus Health for years to come.”

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

In Case You Missed It: Some of our best stories of the year

The BoiseDev team is off for the holiday break. (We’ll keep an eye out for any major breaking stories.) While our employees enjoy some downtime we bring you a few stories you might have missed this year. A note that some stories may have new updates since the original date of publication. Have something we should know? Email us.

Facebook’s parent company Meta announced this week it’s bringing a new data center to town and with it came a slew of questions.

Two years after Governor Brad Little signed legislation giving a tax break for data centers Meta announced to great fanfare its plans to bring a facility to Kuna and bring 1200 jobs and water infrastructure with it. But how will this project impact industrial growth east of Kuna? What will Meta’s promised water project look like?

[Kuna hopes to ‘do it right’ use urban renewal to keep residents close to home]

Here’s what we know (and don’t know) so far.

Water water water

There are still a lot of unanswered questions about Meta’s promise to “add more water than we consume” to Boise’s watershed.

Aaron Scheff the administrator for Idaho Department of Environmental’s Boise regional office told BoiseDev on Thursday the department has not been approached by Meta requesting information or applying for a permit related to any water quality project in connection to the Kuna data center.

When asked about the details of their plans to add water to the Boise watershed Meta spokesperson Melanie Roe directed BoiseDev to a blog post on Facebook’s website stating the companies goal to be “water positive” by 2030. The post said Facebook evaluates water risk for its projects and works on water quality improving irrigation systems and “shores up water resources at the basin level.”

[Some Boise wells are drying up amid rapid development. What’s going on?]

The page listed several water restoration projects Meta is currently working on but did not offer any details about its plans in Kuna. The company touts a partnership with the Colorado River Indian Tribes to help restore water to Lake Mead in Arizona work to facilitate groundwater recharge in New Mexico’s Upper Rio Grande Valley and a wetlands treatment project in Richland Texas. Another project includes a partnership with Eagle Mountain City in Utah to use water from the data center to water city parks.

Environmental impacts

Data centers to support large tech companies are sprouting up all over the country where they rely on hefty amounts of water to keep the rows and rows of servers cool. According to Time magazine a Google data center in Mesa Arizona is guaranteed for 1 million gallons of water per day for cooling and could use up to 4 million gallons if the project “hits milestones.”

Roe said Facebook discloses the amount of water used in each of its data centers annually and will do so once the Kuna project is complete but she did not provide an estimate for how much water the Idaho project would use. Water usage amounts for Meta’s data centers in 2020 ranged from 9.2 million gallons per year at a facility in New Albany Ohio to 170.39 million gallons per year at a center called the “East Coast Leased Data Center Facility.”

Rendering of a proposed data center for Meta Platforms Inc. in Kuna Idaho

Of this water Meta says 17% of it is recycled from other sources 1% is pumped from the ground and the rest is provided by local utilities.

To power the facility Meta filed an application in December with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for Idaho Power to provide the juice for the new data center. All customers requiring more than 20 megawatts are required to go through this approval process. The application by Idaho Power used the name Brisbie LLC a shell company owned by Foxtrot Acquisition Corp of Deleware which is in turn tracks to a company that shares an address with Meta in Menlo Park CA.

According to a release from Idaho Power Meta plans to construct new renewable energy sources to 100% power the data center’s operations. The exact specifications of what the company plans to build have not been determined yet but Idaho Power spokesperson Jordan Rodriguez told BoiseDev “most likely” the project will be powered by a combination of solar and wind but specifics aren’t nailed down yet.

Industrial park could get a boost from urban renewal

Meta’s data center will be constructed at the intersection of Cole and Kuna Mora Road on the far eastern edge of Kuna’s area of impact in a private industrial park owned by Boise-based firm Gardner Company.

Part of Meta’s project will be a $50 million sewer plant constructed by the company and turned over to the City of Kuna to operate. Kuna Economic Development Director Morgan Treasure told BoiseDev the plant will be built over Meta’s capacity needs so it can expand in the future to bring more tenants into the far-flung industrial park. This sewer plant will not serve residential customers closer to Kuna’s downtown.

To pay for further expansions to the sewer plant and other infrastructure the City of Kuna is in the process of creating an urban renewal district that encompasses Gardner’s 325-acre industrial park and a few parcels owned by other property owners. This would allow the additional tax revenue from projects in the otherwise undeveloped area to be used to pay for the infrastructure improvements necessary to grow the park.

In December according to Ada Co. property transfer records Gardner Co. sold several parcels near the corner of Kuna Mora Rd. and Cole Rd. to Brisbie LLC which after BoiseDev asked Meta confirmed was the site of the data center

Kuna City Council approved the feasibility study for the urban renewal district last week before the project was announced. It is now set to begin working on the economic analysis required to greenlight a new urban renewal area.

Gardner Company Executive Vice President David Wali told BoiseDev the area already has the “backbone” for an industrial area with rail tracks and a handful of other industrial manufacturers. He said Meta’s investment in the sewer plant will help kickstart his industrial park with heavier industry and bring more employment opportunities while also not adding stress on the road infrastructure because of how undeveloped the area is.

“There will be a slight increase in traffic for the construction period but after that a data center doesn’t use that much in the way of human capital” Wali said. “The other industrial users will be grow out there but they won’t be an Amazon where you have a huge number of people occupying a huge number of square feet of space packing boxes. When you talk about places doing production you have a lot of ground but very little people.”

Ada County Highway District spokesperson Shandy Lam said it is too early to say if the data center will require transportation improvements. The first step will be for Meta to complete a traffic study and then ACHD will make a recommendation to the Kuna City Council on what should be required for the project to move forward.

Were there cash incentives?

Aside from the tax break from the Idaho legislature Matt Borud with the Department of Commerce said Meta did not receive any other incentives from the state to open the data center.

The tax break allows companies to skip paying sales tax on server equipment or construction materials for a data center as long as it employs at least 30 people in Idaho after starting up that are “at or above” the average wage in the county it operates in and make a capital investment of at least $250 million.

Meta’s data center is expected to support 1200 jobs at the peak of construction. Construction workers are hard to find in a tight labor market. The shortage of workers is a factor in rising construction costs for homes.

On an ongoing basis 100 people will work at the facility once it is open and operational.

Roe said the finished data center will employ “technical operations (staff) electricians air conditioning and heating specialists logistics staff security culinary and more” but did not provide any more specifics on how many staff members in what fields will be employed.

She also declined to share what wages Meta will pay but she said the company will pay “competitive” salaries.

Leaders touted the new jobs that Meta would provide during a news conference Wednesday. Data from the Boise Valley Economic Partnership shows it would not be on the list of the area’s 30 largest employers. It would employ about one-quarter as many people as a recently announced Scheels sporting goods store planned for Meridian.

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see 5 Biggest Metaverse Companies in the World.

If you have been in the internet in the past year and of course you have been since you're reading this article you will have heard of the metaverse. Considered to be ""the next big thing by many"" one of the biggest companies in the world at the time and perhaps the most influential social media company in the world Facebook rebranded itself to Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as the company announced it would focus on developing the metaverse something which has piqued the interest of many other companies. However Meta Platforms Inc. (META) has seen its stock tank since.

So what exactly is the metaverse? The answer to that question is not straightforward. After all if someone asked you to define the internet in its infancy or the airline industry after the Wright Brothers operated the first airplane you would never imagine it to be where it is now. The truth is the metaverse itself is a vague term as many companies claim that it is too early to define because the metaverse is in the process of being built and what it will ultimately turn out to be cannot be accurately estimated right now.

Biggest metaverse companies in the world

There is a lot of hype surrounding the metaverse mainly because of the marketing surrounding this new ""universe"" where it seems that the current definition of the metaverse is basically using new technology to change how we interact with the internet. A large part of this is developing virtual worlds which makes use of virtual reality and the next big thing in technology augmented reality. However it is not necessary to have this gear to access such virtual worlds which can be done through gaming consoles PCs and even mobile phones. According to Tech Target the metaverse "" will be a persistent immersive shared digital environment where people can interact with each other and transact with businesses. It will blend the physical and virtual worlds allowing people to engage in an online 3D space or the spatial web almost as if their experience were real life.""

Of course it's not just Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) which is working on the metaverse. Many other companies have jumped on the bandwagon and see a treasure trove of opportunities. We will discuss the impact of these companies on the metaverse. Right now many companies are envisioning a part of the metaverse being the ability to create digital goods as well as the opportunity to trade them. This will be similar to NFTs which haven't really taken off so far but with technology improving maybe this will work out well. Many also claim that inter-platform compatibility will be utilized with products from one platform being used in other platforms but the technology to enable that does not yet exist.

Story continues

Cryptocurrency is also expected to be a major part of the metaverse with many transactions expected to take place using cryptocurrency. However it will be interesting to see how this is navigated after the massive shocks that the cryptocurrency has experienced in 2021 with its star currency in Bitcoin dropping by nearly 80% after massive drops and scandals rocked the community in just the past year. There are many other challenges facing the 12 biggest metaverse companies in the world as well including limited participation driven by a form of sickness experienced by users in immersive experiences and expensive equipment required to properly enjoy virtual worlds and experience them the way they were meant to be experienced. But perhaps the biggest challenge is convincing potential users that this is the way to go. A poll conducted in early 2022 by Axios and Momentive found that most people were ambivalent about the potential of the metaverse with many not even aware of the concept. Also more respondents were ""scared"" rather than excited about the new technology.

In addition there are some issues regarding governance and regulation of the metaverse with potential for bullying and harassment quite high as is true for most new technologies. Harassment seems to be increasing on social media and the internet in general and in the metaverse which will be more immersive and likely more anonymous such concerns will only be heightened. According to the Federal Trade Commission there is sexual and violently explicit material in virtual worlds which can be accessed by minors which raised the potential of grooming and online abuse of minors as well. There are privacy concerns as well especially due to Meta Platforms Inc. already having many privacy failures in the past. Data collection is a significant part of the operations of social media companies and there is a level of uncertainty on how data will be collected in the metaverse while user's data rights and ownerships are uncertain as well.

While it's too early to wonder what exactly the impact will be on society and culture due to the metaverse the first question to consider is whether it will even be influential enough to have a major impact. Already there are discussions on the metaverse failing with Meta Platform's stock value plummeting since its rebranding and in November its CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing layoffs of over 11000 people. Many people consider that the glimpses offered to the public so far of the metaverse are off-putting especially to the gaming audience. It has also failed to sell to people the idea of the metaverse so far with ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding the entire project which is why it is unlikely that the metaverse will be an immediate success and might need some rebranding.

However despite the aforementioned challenges there are many major companies in the metaverse industry which believe in its potential. We also recently published an article that features the best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds. So without further ado let's take a look at the biggest companies in an industry which could be the next big thing or the biggest flop in a while starting with number 12:

12. Decentraland

Decentraland is a 3D virtual platform where plots of land can be bought as NFTs. Major companies including Samsung and PwC have appeared in Decentraland while others have bought properties in the platform. Sotheby's held its first metaverse auction in Decentraland as well.

11. Epic Games

Epic Games is known to most gamers in the world thanks to its famous game titles such as the Infinity Blade series Gears of War and F0rtnite. It has also developed Unreal Engine which is a game engine. Epic Games committed over $1 billion in 2021 to cement the company's commitment to the metaverse and has received investment from other major companies to continue supporting its foray into the metaverse.

10. Animoca Brands

The Hong Kong game software company purchased a majority stake in Pixelynx which is a music metaverse platform.

9. Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)

Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) is a video game producer which has used the term ""metaverse"" significantly in its marketing. Among the most successful metaverse companies in the world Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) has 47 million daily users globally and 9.5 million developers who create games and worlds in the metaverse for users to fully immerse themselves in.

8. Adidas

A German sports apparel company does not seem to have much in common with the metaverse but here we are. The biggest sports manufacturer in Europe and the second-largest in the world Adidas has produced virtual gear and claims that it is the ""first-ever collection of digital apparel from the three stripes designed for new realities. This digital gear can be used in the metaverse.

7. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)

Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) is a videogame software development company which is why it is no surprise that it is one of the 12 biggest metaverse companies in the world. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) offers monthly sessions which allow you to engage with experts from the company to build and develop skills that are required to succeed in the metaverse.

6. Binance

The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world it makes sense that Binance would throw its hat in the metaverse which could signal a high potential upside for the company if the metaverse justifies the fervor surrounding it. According to Binance NFTs are the gateway to the metaverse and such NFTs are available for purchase on Binance.

Just throw money at any old influencer and who cares what sticks. These days media companies need to show they’re effective at showing an ROI on advertising spend especially for social media.

Social media may be a disruptive technology but it has done little to benefit mankind except to create a generation of superficial narcissists with eight-second attention spans. More concerning are marketers in big corporations throwing money at this behavior under the guise of buying “influence.” Consequently social media firms have become fat and lax Twitter being a great example of what easy money does to large companies.

Mr. Musk’s takeover of Twitter provided the perfect catalyst for advertisers to start questioning what ROI their ad spend has been getting. Outrage aside the corresponding revenue decline is part of a much bigger picture – the global slowing of advertising spend.

Advertising Spend Slows

Ad market growth is expected to slow down significantly in 2023.

Facebook’s corporate parent has agreed to pay $725 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the world’s largest social media platform allowed millions of its users’ personal information to be fed to Cambridge Analytica a firm that supported Donald Trump’s victorious presidential campaign in 2016.

(For insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology business and policy subscribe to our tech newsletter Today’s Cache.)

Terms of the settlement reached by Meta Platforms the holding company for Facebook and Instagram were disclosed in court documents filed late Thursday. It will still need to be approved by a judge in a San Francisco federal court hearing set for March.

The case sprang from 2018 revelations that Cambridge Analytica a firm with ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million users of the platform. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign that culminated in Trump’s election as the 45th president.

Uproar over the revelations led to a contrite Zuckerberg being grilled by U.S. lawmakers during a high-profile congressional hearing and spurred calls for people to delete their Facebook accounts. Even though Facebook’s growth has stalled as more people connect and entertain themselves on rival services such as TikTok the social network still boasts about 2 billion users worldwide including nearly 200 million in the U.S. and Canada.

The lawsuit which had been seeking to be certified as a class action representing Facebook users had asserted the privacy breach proved Facebook is a “data broker and surveillance firm” as well as a social network.

The two sides reached a temporary settlement agreement in August just a few weeks before a Sept. 20 deadline for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his long-time chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg to submit to depositions.

The company based in Menlo Park California said in statement Friday it pursued a settlement because it was in the best interest of its community and shareholders.

“Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy program"" said spokesperson Dina El-Kassaby Luce. “We look forward to continuing to build services people love and trust with privacy at the forefront.”"

A unit of Metropolitan Life Insurance has taken ownership of Galleria Dallas and the Westin Galleria Hotel. The mall’s previous owner was UBS Realty Investors which held ownership since 2002. UBS also bought the hotel in 2005 according to The Dallas Morning News.

MetLife Investment Management held $315 million in loans against Galleria Dallas dating back to 2014 and county records show that UBS Realty agreed to relinquish ownership of the mall and hotel.

“Galleria Dallas and Westin Galleria Hotel are high-quality assets well-positioned in the Dallas market” said Dave Franecki a spokesperson for MetLife per The Dallas Morning News.

“While we cannot comment on the specifics of this transaction MetLife Investment Management has a proven track record in institutional real estate and a dedicated team in the Dallas area” he continued.

The transaction does not include the Galleria’s adjoining office buildings which are under separate ownership.

UBS a Connecticut-based division of the Swiss bank UBS AG acquired the 1.9 million-square-foot mall in 2002 for around $300 million and spent $95 million to buy the Westin Hotel three years later.

Back then occupancy rates sat at 95%. They are now below 90% according to Dallas-based retail real estate firm Weitzman.

While Galleria Dallas has been a flagship mall property in Texas over the years known for having the largest indoor Christmas tree in the nation its value has since declined as the retail environment looks considerably different than it did decades ago. The mall and hotel were recently valued for property taxes at just over $200 million.

The new owners are working with Fort Worth-based Trademark Property Co. on a potential redevelopment plan to add apartments more hotel rooms and offices. Still they might have their work cut out for them dealing with the City of Dallas’ notorious permitting process.

As previously reported in The Dallas Express builders and contractors have voiced frustration for years over the City’s backlogged and onerous permitting process which has significantly slowed development and pushed residential and commercial rents up as a result.

“Galleria Dallas is a premier destination for shopping dining and entertainment at one of the best locations in the U.S.” Trademark CEO Terry Montesi said in a statement. “We look forward to working with MetLife Investment Management on this landmark asset.”

The redevelopment plan considered by Trademark would tear down some parts of the mall for new construction according to the Dallas Morning News.

Steve Lieberman CEO of Dallas-based The Retail Connection said that malls are flourishing nowadays if they are in the right market and with the proper support of consumers around them.

“But they are the exception” he said adding that the shopping experiences consumers have come to expect are continuing to evolve and require a “reconfiguration for these large mall properties.”

“We will end up with better shopping environments” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL3Nwb3J0L2FyY2hpdmVzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvMjAwMzc5MTMwMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawrence leads Jaguars to victory over sagging Jets,"Lawrence leads Jaguars to victory over sagging Jets

AP EAST RUTHERFORD New Jersey





Trevor Lawrence was in a celebratory mood decked out in an ugly Christmas sweater while acknowledging it was not exactly the prettiest performance he and his Jacksonville Jaguars have had during their playoff surge.

It was plenty good enough though.

The Jaguars’ 19-3 victory on Thursday over an embarrassed Zach Wilson and the slumping New York Jets on a rainy windy night has them in control of their post-season destiny.

“It’s just a big win” Lawrence said. “It shows this team is growing. We don’t have to have 40 points to win. We don’t have to have all these yards. Whatever it takes to win we’re able to do. To be able to adjust was really good for us.”

Lawrence finished 20 of 31 for 229 yards and ran for 51 yards including a leaping touchdown on seven carries for the Jaguars (7-8) who moved within a half game of skidding Tennessee in the American Football Conference South. Jacksonville would win the division title with victories in their final two games — including the season finale against the Titans.

“We understand the task in front of us” Lawrence said. “Every game is a must-win for us. That’s how we’re treating it. We understand it and we love it.”

The second matchup between last year’s first two draft picks — Lawrence at No. 1 and Wilson at No. 2 — was not even close.

While Lawrence sliced through the Jets’ normally strong defense Wilson could not get anything going and was booed frequently — all the way to the bench.

Chris Streveler elevated from the practice squad before the game replaced Wilson late in the third quarter.

Wilson went nine of 18 for 92 yards with an interception and a dismal 41.9 rating for the Jets (7-8) whose playoff hopes took a devastating hit with their fourth straight loss. That is the worst skid under second-year coach Robert Saleh.

It came in the Jets’ regular-season home finale — in front a national audience on Amazon Prime Video.

“It’s not about playoffs right now” Saleh said.

“It’s about about getting off this mat and trying to freakin’ find a way to put together a football game” he said.

Wilson who returned from a three-game benching on Sunday in place of an injured Mike White could not make any plays and his offensive line gave him little protection.

“I just felt like I didn’t have any rhythm out there” Wilson said.

“When our number was called in the passing game we made enough plays” Lawrence said. “Obviously it was a little sloppy. There’s going to be a lot of stuff to correct. The elements played a little bit of a factor. At the end of the day we made the plays we needed to make.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9mb290YmFsbC9naWFudHMvZ2lhbnRzLWdyYWhhbS1nYW5vLW5mbC1raWNrZXJzLWlvdjFocnFk0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2RheS5jb20vYW1wL3Nwb3J0cy9mb290YmFsbC9naWFudHMvZ2lhbnRzLWdyYWhhbS1nYW5vLW5mbC1raWNrZXJzLWlvdjFocnFk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For NFL kickers there's no place like dome,"In the Giants’ critical 20-12 win at Washington last Sunday night Graham Gano delivered a pair of 50-yard field goals. Afterward he disclosed that during warmups he wouldn’t have been able to connect on the second kick because of the conditions. But the wind changed during the game making the second try not only possible but successful.

Such is life for NFL kickers who already have difficult jobs before factoring in having to deal with swirling winds freezing rain snow and sleet.

Giants special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey said “the hardest thing” is to weigh the kicker’s true level of confidence even amid perfect conditions and certainly in dicey weather circumstances.

Why? “Because the kicker is going to always tell you ‘I can make it’ ” McGaughey said. “You have to be realistic in the moment and you got to be smart. Look at the situation. Where are we in the game? What’s the score? Knowing that OK if I miss this kick [what is] the field position? You got to be smart in how you do it and we trust Graham. Graham knows. He knows his range and he knows the situations as they come up.”

The situation Saturday afternoon in Minneapolis should be a most favorable one.

The Vikings play at U.S. Bank Stadium a dome that opened in 2016. So while the weather outside is 11-degree frigid the temperature-controlled dome should allow for perfect conditions.

In other words there will be no need for Gano to channel his inner Lawrence Tynes and kick on the frozen tundra. No Saturday’s wintry elements in Minneapolis will stay out of the way of Giants vs. Vikings. In fact Brian Daboll said he might be willing to try a longer-than-usual field goal because of the pristine conditions.

The dome is home. And that is a gift especially for Gano long snapper Casey Kreiter and holder Jamie Gillan (who also is the punter).

They all seem to be versions of perfectionists.

“When it’s windy you’ve got to adjust” Gillan said. “When you’re inside you have to adjust too. It is nice being inside it’s going to be great because we don’t have that wind factor. There’s still a lot of moving parts.”

An example: Because Gillan is a lefty Harrison Eisen a 28-year-old equipment room assistant who has been around the Giants his entire life and travels with the team is tasked with having the JUGS machine ready for Giants returners who almost exclusively catch punts from right-footed punters.

Not surprisingly there is an all-for-one one-for-all feeling among the specialists. There also are quirks.

“I think all specialists have their own little weirdness that we all recognize with each other” Kreiter said. “I’ve always said no one kicker’s the same as another. And Graham has his quirks.”

One in particular manifests itself on game days when Gano carries a bag onto the field.

“It’s all full of shoes” Kreiter said. “He’ll find the one that fits but you never know. You never know which one it’s going to be. If anyone has time watch Graham during the game and count how many time he changes his shoes. I’d like to get a number on it. And that’s not atypical. I’ve had a lot of kickers that do that.”

Kreiter laughed. “I’m really good pals with Casey and Graham” he said. “You have to have a good relationship with your guys for sure.”

As the long snapper Kreiter said rain and humidity affect him and his job more than snow does.

“When it gets colder the ball’s a little slicker it doesn’t want to spin off your hands as easy” he said. “When you talk about field goals my job is really to control the laces and make sure the laces are out where Jamie catches it. So when the ball isn’t spinning as well you’ve got to adjust for it.”

Gano has made 88.9% of his field goals (24 of 27) this season placing him 10th among qualifying kickers. In his first year with the Giants 2020 he made 31 of 32 attempts. Last season he made 29 of 33.

Asked about the “perfect hold” Gillam said “Everybody’s different. Graham likes his holds his own unique way so we just have to practice them on the JUGS machine. Everybody’s different.”

Yes but the specialists have to work together and in concert. “Yep” Gillam said. “That’s why we spend a lot of time together.”

All in the name of the perfect snap hold and kick.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtqZXRzLmNvbS9waG90b3MvZ2FsbGVyeS10b3AtY2VsZWJyaXR5LXBob3Rvcy1mcm9tLWpldHMtdnMtamFndWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gallery | Top Celebrity Photos From Jets vs. Jaguars,

Litt said in a presentation to investors that the real estate — which he values more than its $1.7 billion market cap — can be sold or spun off and leased back to Six Flags which runs 27 theme and water parks in North America.

Litt said in a press release there are numerous real-estate and private equity firms that would be interested in the real estate.

This isn’t the first time Litt waged a campaign to overhaul companies including hospitality giant MGM Resorts retail investor Taubman Centers developer Forest City Realty Trust Saks Fifth Avenue parent Hudson’s Bay Co. and casino real-estate owner Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc.

In 2016 MGM Resorts created MGM Growth Properties a REIT that owned several casino resorts. This year MGM Growth Properties was sold for $17.2 billion to VICI Properties according to the release.

The move could double Six Flags’ share price over the next 18 months according to Litt.

L&B isn’t the only or even the biggest activist shareholder at Six Flags according to the Journal. The company’s largest shareholder is H Partners Management —which has a seat on the board — recently agreed with Six Flags to increase its common stock stake in the amusement park operator to 19.9%.

The pandemic took its toll on the amusement park giant which temporarily closed its parks for up to a year. Six Flags’ CEO Selim Bassoul who took the reins at the company in late 2021 increased prices and removed discounts believing consumers would be willing to pay more for amusement parks after having limited entertainment options since March 2020.

But the company’s shares are down more than 50% this year and reported revenue in the period ending Oct. 2 dropped 21% from the prior year according to WSJ. Attendance had also declined 33 percent to about 8 million visitors with the price hikes and removal of free perks attributed to the falloff.

The global economy is expected to grow at a slow pace of approximately 1.6% in 2023 as financial conditions worsen the winter antagonizes China’s COVID policy and Europe’s natural gas problems persist. 2022 has been the worst year for the S&P 500 in more than ten years as rising interest rates some important corporate earnings misses and growing concerns about global growth weighed heavily on the stock market. Seasonal investing means that an investment is profitable more than half of the time. Investors become increasingly confident in a seasonal investment as the frequency of profitable trades rises.

Seasonal stocks are defined by surging demand during different times of the year. For example a company focused on designing and manufacturing snowsuits is probably not as active during the summer months but may enjoy surges in the winter and holiday season. Similarly air conditioning companies benefit primarily in the summer. Moreover companies that experience peak demand during tourism months are also considered seasonal stocks like hotels and resorts.

Some of the best seasonal stocks to invest in include The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H).

“Other top contributors included Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) BOK Financial and Webster Financial.

“The Toro Company (NYSE:TTC) contributed favorably to performance during the quarter. The Company benefited from pricing actions it took earlier in the year offsetting rising input cost inflation. An important proof-point we consider when evaluating the competitive advantage of any business is whether margins can be maintained (or expanded) especially during periods of inflation. In addition Toro continues to see robust demand for its professional and residential products. The Company has a backlog in its professional segment that is at its highest level since the year began whereas residential products grew +7% on strong year and 2-year comparisons and despite many “home” categories across big-box retailers witnessing declines. The Toro Corporation has an illustrious history stretching back to its founding in 1914. Many of us first encountered The Toro Company in the rite of passage when our parents finally relented in allowing us to cut the grass for the first time when we were barely taller than the lawn mower handle. From the Company’s humble beginning building tractor engines for the Bull Tractor Company in Bloomington Milwaukee the Company has methodically grown into the diversified conglomerate of today that possesses industry leading brand awareness market share technological prowess and profitability. We are always enamored with a company’s beginnings so herewith is the short story of The Toro Corporation’s storied history.

“Mattel (24% 1.40%; 16% 0.96%) the global toy and media company was a strong contributor in the fourth quarter and for the year. Despite store closures in Asia causing -20% regional revenues during the third quarter Mattel’s consolidated sales still grew 8% due to its strong North American recovery. Barbie sales remain impressive as they have been for years American Girl is finally returning to growth and Fisher Price is also recovering. The company is successfully passing through inflated costs with higher pricing and without losing volume. Despite the impressive results the stock trades too low at less than 14x forward earnings and that is before Mattel begins to monetize its massive non-earning asset Intellectual Property portfolio. Our appraisal of the value grew by more than 30% this year.”

Here is what Baron Fund has to say about DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and although it was a successful investment we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened! We sold even though we considered Ed Stack Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO a terrific retailer a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores the foundation of Dick’s business from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.” Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new large format stores with attached outdoor student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick‘s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”

The U.S. Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen has called upon the U.S. and its allies to strengthen supply chain resilience in response to ‘unfair trade practices’ from China with a particular focus on developing stronger supply chains for key components such as semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries.

As a result of COVID-19 the geopolitical crisis in Ukraine and increased reliance on China businesses are searching for ways to stabilize the global supply chain and avoid further economic complications. The pandemic also resulted in the eye-opening realization that many countries no longer have the capacity or expertise to manufacture their own goods; making the U.S. and many other parts of the world heavily reliant on a country that promotes corrupt trade and labor practices. While globalized specialization has historically led to more stabilized supply chains and deeper production capabilities now is the time to rethink the model for the most critical products components and raw material created by nations with guiding principles that do not align with the West’s.

Supply chain redesign is critical – a sentiment which is reinforced by Yellen’s call to action. Practices such as friend-shoring (limiting supply chain networks to allies and friendly countries) can stabilize global supply chains through increased insulation from external geopolitical and economic threats.

Replacing the Dependency on China

An enormous amount of goods are manufactured in China from electronics and fast fashion to cleaning products and home appliances. In 2021 the United States imported a whopping $541.53 billion worth of goods from China making the U.S. one of China’s biggest trading partners. However the various supply issues experienced during the pandemic from toilet paper to critical technologies highlighted just how heavily the world relies on China for everyday items. With this immensely powerful global position China’s monopoly on the market is not only an issue during critical times but also informs massive areas of weakness – for both commercial business and national government security - when it comes to managing risk within our supply chain systems.

The U.S. government is increasingly prioritizing the enforcement of regulations and policies that encourage domestic investments to drive growth. On December 21 2021 President Biden passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). This regulatory act targets forced labor within the global supply chain by preventing trade between the United States and providers in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) – a region accused of criminal workplace practices such as torture forced labor and genocide.

To further decrease reliance on China countries can prioritize friend-shoring to redefine their position in the global supply chain. These alliances will allow countries that have lost their positioning in the global economy to utilize their unique offerings while also giving them a newfound competitive advantage. Additionally because the supply chain runs very deep it is difficult to monitor every aspect of the production journey. The line between cheap products and ethical consumerism is often blurred. The shift to friend-shoring will refocus the contribution of other countries into the supply chain and decrease economic risk.

Economic restructuring

The supply chain disruptions experienced in recent years have led more businesses to explore onshoring operations giving them more control over how and where their products are produced. Likewise the Biden administration recently finalized a rule that increases domestic content requirements for Federal government procurements governed by the Buy American Act (BAA). This change is intended to align Federal procurement policy with the Biden Administration's recently published strategy to improve supply chain resiliency in critical sectors such as information and communications technology (ICT) clean energy defense public health agriculture and transportation. Similarly friend-shoring offers countries the opportunity to not only re-establish their position in the global supply chain but also strengthen relationships with nations that maintain shared values.

With friend-shoring companies are encouraged to move their operations within allied territories. When businesses maintain close relationships with trade partners they can not only closely monitor operations but also help utilize offerings specific to their region. In her speech Yellen emphasized the importance of the relationship between the U.S. and South Korea-- which have long maintained a strong economic and political alliance. With a strong global reliance on exports from China such as batteries and semiconductors the U.S. and South Korea can work together to strengthen the supply chain through tactics that seek to combat economic displacements such as increased prices. By deploying friend-shoring operations countries can better regulate supply chains and monitor economic restructuring from a more friendly standpoint.

Strategic partnership with allies

Beyond strictly economic factors friend–shoring also promotes consumer relationships and deepens strategic partnerships. According to a 2021 Label Insight Food Revolution Study 94% of customers consider how transparent brands are about themselves. Transparency can be achieved through implementing allied partnerships within the supply chain that will ultimately improve customer experience.

When deploying friend-shoring operations businesses are able to closely regulate manufacturing processes and monitor production creating more security. As stricter regulations on supply chain standards are being enforced within the U.S. consumers are given a greater piece of mind when purchasing goods produced domestically. With a growing emphasis on ethics within the workplace consumers are prioritizing the purchase of goods from brands that promote an ethical environment.

Furthermore friend–shoring allows countries to grow alongside their larger counterparts and maintain more control over regional resources. Even if countries were to replicate a specific material it is likely that the costs of production would be even higher than the industry is worth. For example the United States can utilize its advancements in manufacturing technology with natural resources from allied nations to create high-demand products under more ethical conditions. It is no secret that countries that do not have access to advancing technology are likely to fall behind socially and economically. Because many smaller countries do not have the technological advances and funding required to manufacture goods friend–shoring offers the potential for these countries to work with larger countries that can capitalize off their unique offerings. This creates a two-way benefit for both under-developed countries and world leaders such as the U.S. to deepen their relationships.

Friend-shoring for a Transparent Supply Chain

Although it will be difficult to completely eradicate reliance on China friend–shoring is a strategic approach when reevaluating supply chains. As tensions continue to rise globally it is important for companies to properly evaluate and remain transparent as to where and how their products are manufactured.

Transparency will strengthen not only business relationships but help promote customer relationships as well. Countries can work together to strengthen their economic standing and promote ethical practices within the global supply chain.",,,,,,,,,

Chip-maker Micron Technology has announced that it will be cutting 10 percent of its workforce in early 2023. As per reports the announcement for Micron Layoffs comes after a mismatch in supply and demand over the past few years.

As per the CNBC Report nearly 50000 employees are likely to be impacted by Micron Layoffs. At present Micron has around 48000 employees.

Micron Technology has stated that the company is facing an extremely ""severe imbalance between supply and demand in both DRAM and NAND in the last 13 years"". Hence for its Fiscal Q1 Report for 2023 the company plans to reducing 10 percent of the workforce.

DRAM refers to the kind of chip which must be powered on to hold data. NAND refers to the chip which saves data when the power is removed. Both the chips are an integral unit of Micron.

“The industry is experiencing the most severe imbalance between supply and demand in both DRAM and NAND in the last 13 years. Micron is exercising supply discipline by making significant cuts to our capital expenditures and wafer starts while maintaining our competitive position” stated Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra

During the fiscal report the company also stated that it will make significant cuts to its capital expenditure and also work towards cutting its costs and operating expenditures.

Micron will cut staff by about 10 percent through voluntary departures and layoffs. The company has further said that employee bonuses will be suspended and executive salaries will be reduced for the remainder for the 2023 fiscal year till August.

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Contract chipmaker Hua Hong Semiconductor has long played second fiddle to China’s national champion Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp in their home base of Shanghai but US restrictions on advanced technology and Beijing’s yearning for chip self-sufficiency have thrust it into the spotlight.

Already listed in Hong Kong China’s second-largest chip foundry received regulatory approval last month for a $2.5bn secondary listing in Shanghai on the tech-centric Star Market. Most of the funds to be raised are intended for upgrading and expanding its production facilities.

Hua Hong’s lack of cutting-edge technology has proved a boon rather than a handicap of late. During its third-quarter earnings call in November the company said it had been barely affected by the actions of the US as the chips it produces are several generations older than the latest microprocessors.

Industry experts said China had to re-evaluate its domestic semiconductor supply chain after Washington imposed curbs on the development of high-performance chips. Hua Hong’s focus on older chips could make it Beijing’s new favourite with the benefits of policy support and funding to follow.

“Our years of pushing for localising advanced chip production had almost reached a dead end” said a Shanghai-based government official who did not wish to be named. “The vulnerability of the localised semiconductor supply chain has been exposed by the latest restrictions on us accessing crucial US equipment.”

Washington introduced a series of sweeping restrictions in October which have barred US companies from exporting technology for producing chips with features smaller than 14 nanometres or 16nm in some cases. This made it much harder for leading producer SMIC to catch up with the advanced factories or “fabs” of competitors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Hua Hong told the Financial Times it had “always been in full compliance on rules and regulations with respect to export control” and would continue to try to attract investors domestically and globally because of the large capital expenditure required for capacity expansion.

Compared with SMIC Hua Hong has adopted a different strategy of optimising its manufacturing techniques for the mature “nodes” or generations of its less-miniaturised chips in order to maximise the performance and reliability of its products. They have found wide use in the Internet of Things 5G telecoms equipment and electric vehicle markets.

“Just try to squeeze the most juice out of the mature nodes” said Douglas Fuller an expert in China’s semiconductor industry at Copenhagen Business School. “That’s a sustainable path now when we count all the subsidies and the rate of return to society.”

Hua Hong’s older processes also provide an opportunity for less advanced Chinese chip equipment makers to test and improve their products by supplying its production lines and replacing foreign tools that may become restricted.

“For Chinese equipment manufacturers replacing imported equipment on Hua Hong’s mature process lines is more easily achieved” said William Li a Taiwan-based analyst at research firm Counterpoint.

Hua Hong has also acted to localise its suppliers in areas such as equipment and materials according to three people familiar with the matter. In addition it is giving domestic customers higher priority.

In 2022 the chipmaker cut orders several times from foreign customers in order to prioritise domestic companies as its production capacity became overstretched according to four Hua Hong employees who did not wish to be named.

Hua Hong’s products for original equipment manufacturers are increasingly competing with Germany’s Infineon and Texas Instruments of the US.

“Many Chinese customers have replaced imported modules with homegrown ones since geopolitical tensions escalated” said an executive from a power module company in the southern hub of Shenzhen. “So we are partnering with Hua Hong to pick up as many orders as possible.”

The executive who preferred to remain anonymous said Chinese manufacturers such as Hua Hong and SMIC were more co-operative and “more willing to come down in price” for the struggling chip market.

According to the Shanghai government official one way to encourage core industry players to concentrate on basic chips was to accelerate the process for Hua Hong’s secondary listing. Almost 70 per cent of funds raised will be invested in its only 12-inch (300mm) wafer fab in the eastern city of Wuxi according to its prospectus.

A government adviser working with fabs across China who did not wish to be named said Hua Hong had been underrated in the past by industrial policymakers. It was seen as taking a less proactive role in research and development.

When the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund restructured its investment portfolio in 2021 it chose to divest Hua Hong shares. However it returned in June with a $232mn investment.

Strong demand in its home market meant Hua Hong’s third-quarter results stood out among its foundry peers. Quarterly revenues grew 40 per cent year on year to $630mn while net profits doubled to $104mn compared with the same period a year earlier.

Analysts at Jefferies investment bank said the growth in capacity at the Wuxi fab would increase Hua Hong’s momentum earning it more orders from local chip design houses.

“Hua Hong will be a strong force driving the domestic chip supply chain’s growth” said the government adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvdG9tY291Z2hsaW4vMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9kaWdpdGFsLXN0b3JhZ2UtYW5kLW1lbW9yeS1wcm9qZWN0aW9ucy1mb3ItMjAyMy1wYXJ0LTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Storage And Memory Projections For 2023 Part 2,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2022/12/24/digital-storage-and-memory-projections-for-2023-part-2/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvdG9tY291Z2hsaW4vMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9kaWdpdGFsLXN0b3JhZ2UtYW5kLW1lbW9yeS1wcm9qZWN0aW9ucy1mb3ItMjAyMy1wYXJ0LTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A screenshot of an internal build of Windows Notepad has appeared online

The screenshot reveals a version of the app with tabs

Notepad will be the latest app after File Explorer to receive tabs on Windows 11

Earlier this year Microsoft finally added tabs to the File Explorer on Windows 11 after feedback from Insiders who were requesting it for years. The feature allows users to open multiple folders and directories under one window just like how a web browser lets users open multiple web pages under one window.

Now that the File Explorer has tabs it looks like Microsoft is eager to add the feature to another built-in Windows 11 app. A screenshot of an internal version of Notepad has been posted online revealing a new tabs interface within the app.

The screenshot was spotted in a now deleted tweet by a Microsoft employee which mentioned the tabs feature as being new. The screenshot shows a version of Notepad with a confidential warning along the top which reads ""Don't discuss features or take screenshots.""

Just like tabs in File Explorer (and most other apps with tabs) the tabs themselves appear along the top of the app and allow the user to open multiple .txt files in the same window. Assuming the feature is on track to ship at some point it's likely this new version of Notepad will be announced in the next handful of weeks for Windows Insiders in preview.

Hopefully this means this new Notepad app will roll out officially in the coming months possibly alongside an upcoming Windows 11 Moment update. The inclusion of tabs in Notepad will be a nice addition for Notepad power users. The question now remains what app will Microsoft add tabs to next?"

Qualification is solely based on a company’s revenues. The 2022 edition is the 68th in its history.

Take a Look Back: 2022 Year in Review

There is always turnover in the Fortune 500 based on the rising and falling fortunes of America’s biggest companies. This is particularly true in recent years when fortunes are made and lost more dramatically thanks to a variety of market factors.

Typically membership on the list is an imprimatur of quality and status but it can also simply reflect current market trends. Moderna for example was a company with no products or revenue to speak of until the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic at which time it catapulted into the big leagues with billions of dollars of revenue. Coinbase Global only went public in 2021 and rose to prominence on the back of the cryptocurrency surge but whether or not it continues to rise up the Fortune 500 or drop off it will likely depend on whether the current “crypto winter” passes.

The surge in oil prices has helped boost the revenue of countless energy companies in 2022 some of which now find their names on the Fortune 500 for the first time. Here’s a look at the financial highlights of the 30 companies that are new to the Fortune 500 in 2022 including their ranking revenues profits assets market value and number of employees.

Sam Bankman-Fried the fallen crypto mogul who told The Times last month that his personal fortune had dwindled to $100000 won’t be spending the holidays behind bars. He and his defense team on Thursday negotiated a whopping $250 million bond deal that secured his release from federal custody.

The terms are highly restrictive. Mr. Bankman-Fried 30 had to turn over his passport and will remain under house arrest at the California home of his parents the Stanford Law School professors Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried. He’s been fitted with a bracelet that monitors his movements must undergo a mental health evaluation and will have to get government or court approval for any expenses above $1000.

The bail deal was negotiated before Mr. Bankman-Fried boarded a plane on Wednesday night back to the U.S. If he misses a court date or flees his parents would be liable for that quarter-billion-dollar bond hit.

The legal case against him is moving swiftly. Mr. Bankman-Fried’s next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 3. in Manhattan before U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1jcmFzaC1mZWQtaW5mbGF0aW9uLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1yYXRlLWhpa2VzLXBvbGljeS1wdXQtMjAyMi0xMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Fed Blew It on Inflation and Won't Save Stocks From Crashing,"The Fed blew it on inflation stocks are going to have to suffer as a result.

High inflation and a hawkish Federal Reserve have sparked turmoil in markets this year and while some are confident stocks will rise again once the Fed pulls back on its rate hikes many experts have warned that investors should not be waiting for the central bank to ride to the rescue.

That's because the Fed is trying to pull off a difficult balancing act between lowering inflation and preventing a recession raising interest rates a whopping 425 basis-points this year alone. Higher rates can lower inflation but hiking too far risks overtightening the economy into a recession – and hiking too little risks stagflation a scenario where inflation becomes entrenched alongside anemic economic growth.

Rates are now at their highest level since the 2008 and the Fed isn't done hiking. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has reiterated his committement to bringing inflation down with tighter monetary policy.

With stagflation too big a risk the central bank may have no choice but to press forward – and it won't backtrack to buoy a sinking market in 2023 according to these top voices in the market.

Mohamed El Erian Allianz chief economic advisor

Mohamed El-Erian Mohamed El-Erian

The Fed has no choice but to keep its monetary policy restrictive as out-of-control inflation poses the greater danger according to Mohamed El-Erian.

El-Erian has been a loud critic of the Fed's response to inflation this year slamming central bankers for saying inflation was ""transitory"" in 2021. This year prices climbed to a 41-year-high prompting the Fed to issue a stream of aggressive 75-basis-point rate hikes that now makes a recession ""uncomfortably possible"" El-Erian said.

That's the cost of the Fed being late to the game and the central bank can't back away from its monetary tightening now El-Erian warned. That would risk a rebound in inflation and lead to inflation expectations getting entrenched in the economy — a ""stagflation morass that would be much worse in every respect.""

Nouriel Roubini Stern School of Business economics professor

Roubini who earned the nickname ""Dr. Doom"" for his grim economic predictions warned that stocks could fall 25% next year in a severe recession — and the Fed could be powerless to prevent it.

""The mother of all stagflationary debt crises can be postponed not avoided"" Roubini said in an op-ed for Project Syndicate this month sounding off on the dangers of a stagflationary debt crisis — a financial collapse that combines 1970s-style stagflation and the 2008 debt crisis.

He noted the Fed was still struggling to rein in inflation and the past decade of ultra-low interest rates have fueled insane amounts of borrowing from ""zombie"" households and banks. That could mean debt and inflation troubles as interest rates continue to rise.

""With central banks forced to increase interest rates in an effort to restore price stability zombies are experiencing sharp increases in their debt-servicing costs ... Simply bailing out private and public agents with loose macro policies would pour more gasoline on the inflationary fire"" Roubini said predicting the Fed wouldn't have the policy tools to prevent a financial disaster from striking.

""Once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle — which is what will happen when central banks abandon the fight in the face of the looming economic and financial crash — nominal and real borrowing costs will surge"" he added.

Brendan McDermid/Reuters

Strategists at the world's largest money manager warned of a recession unlike any other and central banks aren't going to loosen monetary policy just to keep stocks afloat.

""Central bankers won't ride to the rescue when growth slows in this new regime contrary to what investors have come to expect. They are deliberately causing recessions by overtightening policy to try to rein in inflation. That makes recession foretold"" strategists said in recent report.

""We don't think equities are fully priced for recession"" the BlackRock strategists wrote. ""Corporate earnings expectations have yet to fully reflect even a modest recession.""

Savita Subramanian Bank of America chief stock strategist

While investors are hoping for the Fed to pivot to more dovish monetary policy it's unlikely given the persistent nature of inflation according to Bank of America's chief stock strategist Savita Subramanian.

""I don't think that's going to happen. I think we're going to fail to see the Fed bail us out the market reacts badly and then we get a normal recovery which is what I think we need"" Subramanian said in a recent interview with Bloomberg.

Other market commentators have warned that stock rallies riding on the hopes of a Fed pivot have proven to be fleeting this year and are preventing the market from fully capitulating. Bank of America predicted a recession would ravage stocks in early 2023 causing the market to plunge 24%.

""I would get ready for a very volatile January. I think that the higher the market goes in December the worse it's going to be in January"" Subramanian added urging investors to dip out of equities in the short-term.

The Fed won't pull out of its inflation fight to boost stocks until 2024 even when a recession spawns mid-next year according to Morgan Stanley.

""The Fed's concerns about inflation stickiness trump concerns about slowing growth and weakening labor markets and the Fed waits for evidence of a sustained inflation decline"" strategists at the bank said in a recent note.

That wouldn't be unprecedented as the Fed has refused to bail out stocks before. Former-Fed Chair Paul Volcker whom Powell is often compared to refused to cut interest rates in the early 1980s despite a harsh recession in order to see a slowdown in core inflation.

In the interim there could be major headwinds ahead for the market. Mike Wilson Morgan Stanley's top stock strategist warned an earnings recession would hit the market early next year causing the S&P 500 to drop 20%."

Overall it is intended to provide a fast reliable way to detect trend direction and confirm trend strength using statistical measures of price movements.

The algorithm was adapted from Marcus Schmidberger's (2018) article ""High Frequency Trading with the MSCI World ETF"". It demeans the price time series using the long-term average and then normalizes it with the long-term standard deviation. The resulting time series is then compared to specified thresholds to determine the trend direction.



HOW TO USE

The indicator surface is colored green if the price is trending upwards and red if the price is trending downwards. If the indicator outline is the opposite color of the indicator surface it indicates that the price is moving against the trend and the current trend may be losing strength.

If the 'Use threshold' setting is enabled the indicator will be colored blue if its value is within the range defined by the upper and lower thresholds. This indicates that the price is trending sideways or that the current trend is losing strength.





SETTNGS



Length - the length of the long-term average used to calculate the price filter. Recommended range 20 - 200. The sensitivity of the indicator increases as the value becomes smaller allowing it to detect smaller price moves and swings earlier.



Threshold- the threshold value used to detect trend direction.



Use threshold - a boolean (true/false) input that determines whether to use the threshold value for confirmation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vbnVjbGVhci1mdXNpb24tdGVjaG5vbG9neS1jb3VsZC1iZS1hLTQwLXRyaWxsaW9uLW1hcmtldC_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldGZ0cmVuZHMuY29tL251Y2xlYXItZnVzaW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktY291bGQtYmUtYS00MC10cmlsbGlvbi1tYXJrZXQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nuclear Fusion Technology Could Be A $40 Trillion Market,"Scientists at the Energy Department’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California announced the first-ever demonstration of fusion “ignition.” This means that more energy was generated from fusion than was needed to operate the high-powered lasers that triggered the reaction. More than 2 megajoules (MJ) of laser light were directed onto a tiny gold-plated capsule resulting in the production of a little over 3 MJ of energy the equivalent of three sticks of dynamite.

This important milestone is the culmination of decades’ worth of research and lots of trial and error and it makes good on the hope that humanity will one day enjoy 100% clean and plentiful energy.

Unlike conventional nuclear fission which produces highly radioactive waste and carries the risk of nuclear proliferation nuclear fusion has no emissions or risk of cataclysmic disaster. That should please activists who support renewable non-carbon-emitting energy sources such as wind and solar and yet oppose nuclear power.

75th Anniversary Of Another Great American Invention The Transistor

I think it’s only fitting that this breakthrough occurred not just in the U.S. the most innovative country on earth but also on the 75th anniversary of the invention of the transistor.

Like fusion energy the transistor’s importance can’t be overstated. Invented in December 1947 in New Jersey’s storied Bell Labs—also the birthplace of the photovoltaic cell fiber optic cable communications satellite UNIX operating system and C programming language—the transistor made the 20th century possible. Everything we use and enjoy today from our iPhones to our Teslas wouldn’t exist without the seminal American invention.

In 2021 the electric vehicle maker unveiled its proprietary application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for artificial intelligence (AI) training. The ASIC chip believe it or not boasts an unbelievable 50 billion transistors.

Private Investment In Fusion Technology Has Been Increasing

Getting your electricity from a commercial fusion reactor is still years if not decades away but that hasn’t stopped money from flowing into the sector. This year private investment is estimated to top $1 billion following the record $2.6 billion that went into fusion research in 2021 according to BloombergNEF.

At the moment there aren’t any publicly traded fusion companies. However Bloomberg has a Global Nuclear Theme Peers index that tracks listed companies with exposure to the industry estimated by Bloomberg to one day achieve a jaw-dropping $40 trillion valuation. Some of the more recognizable names include Rolls-Royce Toshiba Hitachi and General Electric.

For the five-year period the index of 64 “nuclear” stocks has advanced approximately 100% compared to the MSCI World Index up 38% over the same period.

The number of private firms involved in R&D continues to grow raising the possibility that some will tap public markets in the coming years.

Among the largest is Commonwealth Fusion Systems or CFS which spun out of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center in 2018. The company raised $1.8 billion in December 2021 on top of the $250 million it had raised previously. Its investors include Bill Gates and Google along with oil companies venture capital firms and sovereign wealth funds. CFS claims to have the fastest lowest cost solution to commercial fusion energy and is in the process of building a prototype that is set to demonstrate net energy gain by 2025.

Another major player is TAE Technologies. Located in California the company has raised a total of $1.2 billion as of December 2022 from investors such as the late Paul Allen Goldman Sachs Google and the family office of Charles Schwab. TAE says it is developing a fusion reactor scheduled to be unveiled in the early 2030s that will generate electricity from a proton-boron reaction at an incredible temperature of 1 billion degrees.

Other contenders in the field include Washington State-based Helion Energy Canada’s General Fusion and the United Kingdom’s Tokamak Energy. In February 2022 Tokamak broke a longstanding record by generating 59 MJ of energy the highest sustained energy pulse ever.

As an investor I would keep an eye on this space!

Solar Accounted For 45% Of All New Energy Capacity Growth In The U.S.

In the meantime energy investors with an eye on the future still have renewable energy stocks to consider.

2022 has been a challenging year for the industry with much of it facing supply constraints. According to Wood Mackenzie total new solar installations in the U.S. were 18.6 gigawatts (GW) a 23% decrease from 2021.

Even so solar accounted for 45% of all new electricity-generation capacity added this year through the end of the third quarter. That’s greater than any other energy source. Wind was in second place representing a quarter of all new energy power followed by natural gas at 21% and coal at 10% its best year since 2013.

WoodMac expresses optimism in the next two years. Solar projects that were delayed this year due to supply issues may finally come online in 2023 and by 2024 the real effects of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) should be felt. The U.K.-based research firm forecasts 21% average annual growth from 2023 through 2027 so now may be an opportune time to start participating.

One of our favorite plays right now is Canadian Solar up more than 11% for the year. On Thursday of this week the Ontario-based company announced that it would begin mass-producing high efficiency solar modules in the first quarter of 2023. Canadian Solar shares were up more than 1% last week despite experiencing two down days on this week’s news of continued rate hikes into 2023.

The term sustainable investing has become a familiar part of the vocabulary for today’s institutional and retail investors. However it was not always so.Although the concept of sustainable investing has been around for more than 100 years it was during the first half of the 20th century that the philosophy behind it took a more concrete shape.In 1950 The Pioneer Group US became the first fund house to screen out the so-called “sin-stocks” – tobacco alcohol and gambling — from their portfolios.In the 1960’s against the backdrop of increasing focus on civil rights environmental social and anti-war protest movements the clamor for the investor community to act responsibly grew manifold.Towards the end of the 20th century there were more than 26 sustainable-focused funds with assets under management worth $1.9 billion.In recent years climate change and humanitarian crises have increasingly contributed to the philosophy of sustainable investing. According to a Bloomberg study  sustainable investing has now gone mainstream with an estimated $37.8 trillion in assets under management in FY2022.According to the same study global ESG assets are on track to exceed $53 trillion by FY2025.Today the sustainable investing landscape is beaming with investment options right from ESG-focused funds to Green Bonds . However what is lacking is clarity on how investors can get to know which option is right for them?Below we unpack different approaches to sustainable investing and some of the common sustainable investment options and their associated benefits and risks.By understanding these key characteristics investors can make informed decisions when it comes to allocating their assets in a way that supports their values and the planet.When it comes to sustainable investing there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Instead investors must tailor their strategies to fit their unique goals and values.However broadly there are three main categories under sustainable investing.The underlying principle is to avoid investments in certain stocks or industries through negative screening according to defined ethical guidelines.This approach involves investing in projects or companies that are actively working to bring about a positive social or environmental change.This involves integrating ESG factors into the fundamental framework of the investment philosophy to the extent that these factors are material to investment performance.While each of these approaches has its own merits the key to successful sustainable investing is to find the approach that best aligns with your own values and goals.A 2019 study conducted by Morgan Stanley Institute for Investing revealed that interest with respect to sustainable investing has reached new heights among retail investors.More than 85% respondents expressed interest in sustainable investing and 86% believed that companies embracing ESG practices may potentially be more profitable and may be better long-term investments.As more and more people become aware of the benefits of supporting initiatives that protect the environment and promote social responsibility investment options too will rise simultaneously.Today some of the common sustainable investments include Green Bonds which finance environmental projects; responsible funds which invest in companies with strong ESG practices.Each option has its own pros and cons. We have tried to explain the options available and individuals can select one or a combination of these which is best suited to their needs.ESG-focused Funds invest in companies that have a strong ESG framework in place. These kinds of companies are often referred to as ""sustainable"" or ""responsible"" businesses.While ESG-focused funds have only been around for a few years they have already gained significant popularity — thanks to their strong performance.The MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index has posted annualised returns of 5.5% since its inception in 2007 outperforming the MSCI World Index by nearly 50 basis points.Green Bonds are debt instruments that are issued in order to finance projects with environmental benefits. The proceeds from green bonds can be used to finance a wide range of initiatives — from energy efficiency upgrades to renewable energy projects.According to NN Investment Partners a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Euro Green Bond Index has performed when compared to an index of regular euro-denominated corporate and sovereign bonds (Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Euro Aggregate Index). Green bonds generated returns of 7.4% compared to 6.0% for regular bonds in 2019.In the last two decades many studies have shown that companies with strong ESG ratings tend to outperform their peers over the long-term.This is because they are better managed have less exposure to risks and enjoy higher levels of employee productivity and customer loyalty.Moreover sustainable investments are often less volatile than traditional investments providing greater stability for investors.As the benefits of sustainable investing become more widely recognised it's likely that more investments will flow into this burgeoning asset class in the years ahead.For the responsible investor sustainable investing is an important part of creating a brighter future for all.(The author is Chief Investment Officer ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited)(Disclaimer: Recommendations suggestions views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

ESG and climate investing were thrust into new spotlights in 2022.

Global regulators introduced proposals aiming to reduce greenwashing in the fund industry as well as stricter climate target disclosures against a backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine cost of living crises energy markets in turmoil pandemic fatigue rising interest rates political uncertainty and a series of climate-induced disasters.

As US-based finance company Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) puts it “the large-scale trends shaping the ESG-investing world are well known at this point” – climate change risk the road to net zero growing existential threat of biodiversity social inequalities regulation and controversy over what exactly ESG should be.

Interestingly MSCI says more investors voted against corporate climate strategies in the 2022 proxy season (between mid-April to mid-June) compared to 2021.

“We found that investors tended to vote against climate plans in 2022 where the company’s emissions trajectory was misaligned with global temperature targets” the firm states.

“The average proportion of votes against went from 3.1% in 2021 to 9.6% in 2022 indicating increasing uneasiness among some investors.”

MSCI’s analysis of the limited number of votes in 2022 (43 companies) suggests dissenting investors may have opposed corporate climate strategies that they felt were not ambitious enough.

In 2023 MSCI says it will be watching whether investor opposition to corporate climate strategies will continue to increase or whether more investors give companies the benefit of the doubt on their climate plans in challenging market conditions.

This week’s ethical investor – Emilie O’Neill Perennial Partners

How did ESG investments perform comparatively in 2022?

It was a tougher year for ESG funds who are traditionally underweight energy and resources however longer-term performance continued to hold up with ESG funds performing equal ifnot better than their mainstream counterparts over most asset classes.

Research from Goldman Sachs has highlighted the ESG vs. non-ESG equity flows since 2019 which is striking – three of those four years (including 2022 ytd) saw positive ESG flowsagainst outflows for non-ESG funds.

We know about one in every three equity investment dollars is now going into sustainable funds.

What are some ESG trends the investment community should be aware of in 2023?

For ESG funds there will be a greater focus on company outcomes and engagement activities that managers are having with their investments.

There is an increasing sophistication of the market and investors are wanting authentic next generation products that don’t just exclude the bad but actively seek companies that are helping to shape a better future. Investors want to see deep ESG analysis and linking ESG performance with fundamental performance.

For ESG themes we expect cyber security to remain salient – this was one trend which started to creep up the priority list last year and is in focus now with some of the high-profile cyber security incidences we have had in the last six months.

Perennial Partners have been engaging with companies on cyber security for some time now to ensure businesses understand cyber security management.

We want to understand who ultimately has responsibility for cyber resilience is there executive oversight what mechanisms to protect data are in place is it a pro-active defence

strategy or are they just putting out fires?

We want to make sure companies are at least meeting minimum regulatory guidelines and that they are only holding sensitive customer information that is required.

All of this allows us to then come up with an assessment on a company’s cyber security risk management – we encourage companies to invest more in the area and make sure there

are lines of defence in place.

In 2022 we saw a huge focus on the environmental factors of ESG particularly on GHG emissions disclosures and transparency emission reduction targets and credibility of those

commitments.

Going into 2023 we will see a continued focus on the transition to net zero as an investment theme but also increased scrutiny around companies’ transition plans –particularly holding management teams to account for progression against targets.

Under environmental analysis I expect more conversation on biodiversity nature-based solutions and a company’s impact on the land forests and marine systems.

Any last minute thoughts?

There was a study that came out recently which said 80% of millennials and Gen Z’s (in the US) believe investment firms should influence ESG considerations in their company holdings.

However as mentioned there is more focus on authenticity looking at the deep ESG analysis and shifting from a traditional ESG scoring approach which ranks companies on yes

or no responses towards a forward-looking approach of ESG assessment and engagement.

ESG is a great lens for understanding the culture of a business. We know that Millennials are prioritising social considerations with their employers – they care about work life balance

diversity in the organisation.

They are very “values” driven – much more so than the older generation.

A company able to meet the needs of their workforce is going to have greater engagement and less turnover than a business that isn’t investing in their workforce.

Social issues continue to be important to ESG analysis despite environmental issues taking majority of the headlines.

Investors should take a wholistic approach to understanding all material ESG risks and opportunities and not prioritise one factor over another.

Take a Look Back: 2022 Year in Review

There is always turnover in the Fortune 500 based on the rising and falling fortunes of America’s biggest companies. This is particularly true in recent years when fortunes are made and lost more dramatically thanks to a variety of market factors.

Typically membership on the list is an imprimatur of quality and status but it can also simply reflect current market trends. Moderna for example was a company with no products or revenue to speak of until the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic at which time it catapulted into the big leagues with billions of dollars of revenue. Coinbase Global only went public in 2021 and rose to prominence on the back of the cryptocurrency surge but whether or not it continues to rise up the Fortune 500 or drop off it will likely depend on whether the current “crypto winter” passes.

The surge in oil prices has helped boost the revenue of countless energy companies in 2022 some of which now find their names on the Fortune 500 for the first time. Here’s a look at the financial highlights of the 30 companies that are new to the Fortune 500 in 2022 including their ranking revenues profits assets market value and number of employees.

His prediction for runaway inflation in May 2020 was very early in the economic cycle before almost anyone else saw it coming and it was accurate. In that call he just looked at monetary policy money printing and government spending and saw the inevitable future outcome.[1]

His recent prediction that white collar workers in the tech and information industries were overstaffed and that it would lead to layoffs has begun dramatically across most of silicon valley and start ups in most industries.[2]

He now believes that index funds as a sub-asset class are in a bubble of their own and due for a crash as investors are overexposed to the S&P 500 index with little regard for the fundamental valuations of individual companies that make up the index. He believes stock indexes specifically will crash as equities as an asset class are unloaded in mass as the current recession deepens and inflationary pressures overwhelm consumers and businesses.

He sees the blind buying and holding of stock market indexes as a new bubble forming as it has no fundamental parameters which is what creates bubbles.[3]

Michael Burry was also eventually proven right about his extreme bearishness on Tesla stock and Cathie Wood’s ARKK ETF. However he was way too early with his long put options on these two bets and he likely lost money.

Burry tends to always be right just too early in his position timing. Burry was even too early with his big short on the housing market but still had a great exit and made a fortune. So it can be valuable to see his fundamental forecasts for markets for an idea of what has a high probability of playing out over the next few years.

What is Michael Burry predicting will happen?

Michael Burry is predicting that inflation will continue to increase. He remains a contrarian versus the expectation of a deflationary environment predicted by most financial “experts” and central banks.

“What interest rates are doing exchange rates globally central banks seem reactionary and in CYA mode.” – Michael Burry

“In 1978-79 rising velocity trumped falling money supply to drive inflation higher and higher.” Burry explains “The velocity of money is increasing faster than the decline in money supply in the economy.” This is his signal for higher inflation continuing.

Burry isn’t impressed with big rallies during bear markets as he knows it’s normal historically.

“Dead cat bounces are the most epic. 12 of the top 20 Nasdaq 1-day rallies happened during the 78% drop from 2000’s top. 9 of the top 20 S&P 500 1-day rallies happened during the 86% drop from the 1929 top.” – Michael Burry

“After 2000 the Nasdaq had 16 bear market rallies >10% averaging 22.7% before bottoming down 78%. After 1929 the Dow had 10 bear market rallies >10% averaging 22.8% before bottoming down 89%.” – Michael J. Burry

Burry is not impressed with huge rallies in the stock market during bad fundamental conditions in the economy. This enables him to hold short positions long-term when he is right.

On September 30th 2022 Michael Burry tweeted: “13.48% of stocks closed above their 200 day moving average yesterday. Bottom in 2009 was 1.2%. Bottom in 2020 was 2.8%. Currently at December 2007 levels.”

38.43% of stocks closed above their 200-day moving average Friday December 22 2022. So price action has a long way down to go before Burry likely believes the market has made a long-term bottom that will hold. [4]

In May Burry predicted that the S&P 500 could fall to 1862 points over the following few years based on the crashes of past years. [5] Which is an incredibly bearish stance he has taken based on market fundamentals inflationary pressure government spending along with national debt and monetary policy.

Michael Burry housing market predictions 2023

Michael Burry warnings about inflation soaring even higher in a second round also flags mounting pressure on the housing market.

In June 2022 Burry quoted from a recent blog post that highlighted the latest US inflation figure of 8.6% for May 2022 that was at a 41-year high and said that high inflation has wiped out demand for mortgage-backed securities.[6]

The blog post Burry read and quoted also cited other factors for the housing market that he did not mention. We can assume Burry respected the real estate professional that wrote the post and assume he agreed on many of these points.

In this blog post it noted that the surprise from inflation raised the 30-year fixed rate mortgages to 6% double its level at the beginning of 2022. The speed of this sudden jump in mortgage rates is among the five most-painful moments of the bloggers 44 year career in the mortgage industry comparable to the 1970s dotcom bust and 2008 financial crises.

The writer also said the stock market would be “down a hell of a lot more” if investors completely understood the fallout from the housing market that would eventually lead it grinding to a halt. The blogger blamed the Ukraine invasion and the huge move up in energy prices as pushing the inflationary pressures into the housing market with such fast interest rate hikes by the Fed.

Burry forecasts that the economic pain is just beginning and many of his forecasts will effect the ability of the Fed to lower interest rates due to sticky inflation. High interest rates increase the cost of house payments dramatically and kill demand for more expensive homes eventually causing home owners to lower prices if they want to sell them.

What is Michael Burry currently invested in?

60% of Burry’s portfolio now contains real asset companies this is a shift from his previous big investments in companies that were more digital platforms or information based. This could be his way to hedge against inflation with companies holding assets with infrastructures and that provide real world services.

In times of inflation the worse place to stay is holding currency long-term as it’s purchasing power is eroded. Burry’s inflation projections has led him to take positions in his portfolio in the third quarter of 2022 instead of continuing to hold high short positions or just stay in cash with few investments for months.

Michael Burry portfolio allocation 2022 Q3:

Michael Burry’s portfolio is now over 50% in prison stocks with GEO and CXW. This alone says a lot about how he sees the economy. Does he believe people will need to steal to eat or get into crime due to hyperinflation? Are prison stocks the best investment in 2022? He has put his money where his beliefs are whatever has lead him to believe that prison stocks are currently the best investment for capital now.

“Inflation appears in spikes. When the spike is resolving it won’t be because of Biden or Powell. It will be because that is the essence the nature of inflation. It resolves fools people and then comes back.” – Michael Burry"

NFLX,Netflix,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzQ4Mzk4My9uZXRmbGl4LWJlc3Qtc2hvd3MtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 great shows from 2022 to stream on Netflix,"There’s more streaming competition than ever but even still Netflix remains on top when it comes to both breadth and scale. Put simply there is a lot to watch on Netflix to the point that even seemingly big-name series and films can get buried by the algorithm that’s trying to show you the latest in reality TV. So to help you out we’ve curated 10 excellent new titles that run the gamut from zombie thrillers to stop-motion family movies to an incredible whodunit.

With Cabinet of Curiosities Guillermo del Toro (The Shape of Water Pan’s Labyrinth) has curated a terrifying anthology of hour-long episodes from some of the most exciting folks working in horror. There’s a fun romp about killer rats from Cube director Vincenzo Natali a very trippy sci-fi story from Mandy director Panos Cosmatos and even a short about the horrors of beauty products directed by Ana Lily Amirpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night). This being a del Toro-helmed collection there are of course also a few Lovecraft adaptations. What’s most impressive about the anthology though is how it’s both incredibly consistent (there isn’t a miss amongst the eight episodes) and extremely varied showing just how many different ways there are to approach a scary story.

Love Death & Robots is a collection of animated science fiction shorts that can get both pretty weird and pretty gruesome and the third season from this year is arguably the best yet. It includes a terrifying story about sailing alien seas from David Fincher an unsettling piece about a siren tracking a deaf soldier from Alberto Mielgo and my favorite a Moebius-inspired fever dream called “The Very Pulse of the Machine” from director Emily Dean. And in an age of hour-long prestige dramas it’s refreshing to binge a series where everything is less than 20 minutes long — and manages to pack a lot into those short runtimes.

The charming first season of Russian Doll is a tough act to follow. It put a new spin on the Groundhog Day formula in which Nadia (Natasha Lyonne) died on her 40th birthday repeatedly until she teamed up with another looper named Alan (Charlie Barnett) to figure things out. Season 2 picks up a few years later and ditches the loop for a time travel story where riding the MTA can literally take you back in time. It takes a little longer to get going but once things click the second season is every bit as compelling as the first without forcing you to hear “sweet birthday baby” every 15 minutes.

I thought I was sick of zombie shows until I watched All of Us Are Dead. The Korean series breathes some new life into the genre by mixing undead horror with classic high school drama. The show follows a group of students trying to survive an outbreak while trapped in their school amidst their flesh-eating peers. This means that in the middle of all the heart-pounding escapes and tragic deaths there’s still blossoming teenage romance discord among the jocks and nerds and even some humor to cut the tension. It’s a combo that works really well and turns All of Us Are Dead into the kind of show that’s hard not to binge — you just have to see what happens next.

Netflix made a big bet when it scooped up the sequels to Knives Out and at least initially it seems to have paid off. Glass Onion is the kind of sequel that just makes everything bigger from the ensemble cast to the mystery itself. It once again sees Daniel Craig pick up his questionable Southern accent as the detective Benoit Blanc and this time he’s invited to a murder mystery party hosted by a tech billionaire played by Edward Norton. Of course the fake murder party eventually turns deadly and watching the pieces fall into place as Blanc solves the mystery is very satisfying. Just as importantly it’s a lot of fun with some hilarious writing and ongoing jokes that really pay off by the end.

The House might look like a cute and fuzzy stop-motion movie but it’s something much darker. The film is split into three stories each of which tells a different tale about a specific house and the people (and animals) who lived in it over the years. You start out with its creation before settling into a renovation decades later and eventually shifting into a future apparently decimated by climate change. It’s not exactly horror — don’t expect any spooky monsters or jump scares — but there’s an unsettling tone lurking beneath the surface of The House which makes its cuddly aesthetic all the more disarming.

It’s a good year for del Toro on Netflix. In addition to his horror anthology he also helmed a stop-motion musical adaptation of Pinocchio. It is as you’d expect nothing like the Disney classic. Instead this version of Pinocchio is kind of like a family-friendly version of Pan’s Labyrinth a combination of childlike wonder heartbreaking drama and the sinister backdrop of rising fascism. (It’s not subtle — Mussolini even makes an appearance.) It also just looks incredible with a world that looks like it was carved from wood by a master craftsman including a completely unique take on the titular character.

It’s not very often that director Henry Selick releases a new movie — the last was Coraline in 2009 — and his latest already feels like an instant classic. For Wendell & Wild he teamed up with Jordan Peele (Nope) for another dark stop-motion tale this time about a young girl with special powers who makes a deal with a pair of demon brothers. It’s a story about trauma and loss (familiar subject matter for Selick) that also takes a stab at the prison industrial complex. So there’s something for everyone.

Netflix had a surprisingly good year for original anime releases and the most memorable might be Thermae Romae Novae a goofy time-travel story about an ancient Roman architect who is obsessed with bathing. In each episode the architect Lucius finds himself stumped by a design problem but then is mysteriously transported to modern-day Japan where he’s inspired by our futuristic bathing technology and uses it to create something new in the past. It’s both extremely silly and heartwarming and there’s even an educational aspect: each episode ends with author Mari Yamazaki who wrote the original comic the show is based on visiting a Japanese hot spring or public bath to learn more about the history and culture of bathing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzLXR2L2E0MDIxODM3Ni93ZWRuZXNkYXktbmV0ZmxpeC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUtY2FzdC1uZXdzLXNwb2lsZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Wednesday' on Netflix Release Date Cast News and Spoilers,"Gomez and Morticia Addams’s demon spawn—sorry daughter—is finally getting the spotlight she deserves. Wednesday Addams the death-obsessed teen whose idea of a lazy summer Friday involves electrocuting her brother is headed to Netflix later this year with You actress Jenna Ortega in the lead role. Judging by the new teaser Netflix is going all-in on the macabre delights of everyone’s favorite goth. That’s no surprise given that Tim Burton is attached to direct; based on his previous work we have a good idea of the show’s grim-meets-kooky aesthetic.

Wednesday billed by Netflix as “a sleuthing supernaturally infused mystery” will follow the Addams’s only daughter as she attends the boarding school Nevermore Academy where she juggles her newfound psychic powers and a supernatural murder mystery connected to her own family. Ahead everything we know about Wednesday’s solo treatment.

When will the show come out?

Wednesday premiered later than expected on November 23. (Yes the date did fall on a Wednesday.)

Who’s in the cast?

Apart from Ortega in the lead role there was a stunning group of actors surrounding her.

Catherine Zeta-Jones will appear throughout the series as Morticia the Addams family matriarch and Wednesday’s mother.

Victor Dorobantu will play Thing the severed hand and servant seen in the teaser trailer.

George Burcea will play Lurch the towering family manservant.

Isaac Ordonez will play Gomez and Morticia’s son Pugsley.

Luis Guzmán will guest star as Gomez the Addams family patriarch and Wednesday’s father.

Other actors with as-yet-unannounced roles include Gwendoline Christie Jamie McShane Emma Myers Percy Hynes White Moosa Mostafa Thora Birch Hunter Doohan Riki Lindhome Joy Sunday Georgie Farmer and Naomi Ogawa.

Christina Ricci who played Wednesday in the early ’90s films The Addams Family and Addams Family Values will also appear the role of Marilyn Thornhill an original character and not from any older manifestation of the Addams Family story

MATTHIAS CLAMER/NETFLIX Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams.

What is Wednesday based on?

Like the films TV series and theatrical adaptations before it Wednesday is based partly on the New Yorker cartoons first introduced by Charles Addams in 1938 further popularized in the 1960s by the sitcom adaptation The Addams Family. Based on the latter’s success the family’s misadventures quickly became a franchise: A cartoon series arrived in the 1970s followed by The Addams Family live-action movie in 1991 for which a sequel Addams Family Values landed in 1993. Both live-action and animated versions of the family continued the legacy and then a 2010 Broadway musical The Addams Family Musical arrived to lackluster critical reception. Finally two animated films were released in 2019 and 2021. This large canon serves as the backbone of Wednesday.

Can I see a trailer?

Netflix unveiled a teaser trailer in August giving us our first look at Ortega as the dark pigtailed icon. After being expelled from school (again) her parents enroll her in the eerie Nevermore Academy where a new adventure awaits.

In a new clip unveiled during Tudum Wednesday finds Thing the famous severed human hand in her dormitory. She knows it was sent to watch over her by her parents but she convinces it to do to her bidding instead.

The first full trailer was shared in October 2022 at the show's New York Comic Con panel revealing Christina Ricci's role in the show at Marilyn Thornhill a member of Nevermore academy on the administrative side:

Will there be more than one season?

No word yet from Netflix but given the buzz around Wednesday’s launch there’s a solid chance it’ll be a hit—and in that case expect season 2 news forthcoming.

Have the actors noticed the fan response?

After Wednesday's release fans were already clamoring for more episodes. it seemed like the show had something for everyone. But one of the most notable topics that kept coming up online was the chemistry between Wednesday and her roommate Enid played by Emma Myers. Enid is the happy-go-lucky side of the pair loving bright colors and cheerfulness in stark contrast to Wednesday's macabre aesthetic. And yet they work so well together.

A lot of people began campaigning for the pair to be more than friends and the couple name “Wenclair” started trending on TikTok.

At a press event Pride asked Ortega about the sapphic connotations of her and Myers relationship and she responded “In a perfect world we would have been a thing.”

Myers added “I always say ‘And they were roommates!”’

The actress was referencing an old Vine that has become a meme about how queer relationships throughout history have been retold as strictly platonic. Myers said that even before the show came out she and Ortega would joke about “and they were roommates” during filming so they noticed the vibe too.

“Jenna and I would say that all the time to each other. And that’s all that needs to be said — I think that gets the message across"" she told Elite Daily.

Ortega was also asked why she think Wednesday Addams has become a queer icon she replied “I think because she’s a badass. She’s cool she’s got a nice sense of style but she’s somebody who embraces her differences and isn’t out to please anybody. I feel like that’s a really really powerful thing to see. I feel like people want to see powerful women with powerful women.”

There's a plot point Jenna Ortega has been fighting.

On the subject of romantic plot points Ortega apparently didn't think her character would be swooning over boys no matter what her sexuality is. In an interview with ETalk she said that she fought against the dreaded love triangle ever show targeted at teens seems to have. In Wednesday the triangle is with Tyler (Hunter Doohan) and Xavier (Percy Hynes White) who both fall for the morose supernatural teen.

“I told them very early on that I didn’t want her to be in the middle of a love triangle” she said. “I’ve always been against the love triangle idea.”

She added “As far as the boys went I had to accept it – but honestly I’m going to fight this love triangle thing so hard. Because I don’t think Wednesday would ever be in a love triangle...I talked to the writers about this and they said ‘don’t worry don’t worry it’s not gonna be that.’ I think there’s an opportunity there for a really sweet platonic relationship because I don’t think it’s shown enough men and women having safe platonic relationships that don’t become romantic.”

She continued “Almost sibling-like relationships I think that would be really wonderful to see between her and Xavier. Honestly I think boys are probably the last thing on Wednesday’s mind.”

Jenna Ortega choreographed her own viral dance.

In a classic school dance scene Wednesday rocks out with her date on the dance floor and her moves were so compelling they went viral. On TikTok everyone was doing Ortega's moves and it turns out she actually came up with them herself. In an interview on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon Ortega said “Initially they wanted a flash mob but I thought no there's no way Wednesday would be cool with dancing and encouraging a bunch of people.”

Director Tim Burton tasked her with the choreography she added.

“He was like ‘I know you've got it. You've been working on it. I'm not even worried about it. I trust you.’ And I said “Oh yeah you know it's all so good.’”

She said her inspiration for the choreo came from artists Siouxsie Sioux Lene Lovich and Nina Hagen and Denis Levant.

“I had not gone over it at all” she continued. “Oh my God. I was kicking myself. I felt like such a fool. I'm not a dancer. I don't do any of that. I have no experience in that field. I didn't sleep for two days.”

Ortega also said she was told her dance would be big on TikTok before it was even released. Prophecy fulfilled.

There was also a bit of controversy over the dance when Ortega mentioned having COVID-19 during filming. Clearly she was not isolated in that scene because a dance is basically a super spreader event. Creator Miles Millar told The Hollywood Reporter that Ortega's comments were miscontrued.

“We had extremely stringent COVID protocols that were enforced all the way through the dance” Millar explained. “Jenna tested negative the day before and only when a positive test came back and as soon as it did she was escorted off the set and went into quarantine for I think 10 days.”

He added that “there was no compromising of that in any decision to keep filming and film Jenna ill or sick it was never a discussion... it was one of those things that basically was sort of blown out of proportion in terms of a story.”

The Padma Shree awardee and CEO of the country's first billion-dollar IT product company said the country lacks a culture of its own R&D and pointed out that merely having manufacturing facilities of global tech product companies like Apple will not bring ""high income jobs"" for people at large in India.

""A corporate mandate to spend one or two per cent on R&D is needed for India like the two per cent CSR (corporate social responsibility) mandate. It is a high potential investment"" Vembu stated in a brief interview with PTI.

He was in the city recently to deliver his lecture on 'Transforming the Indian Economy' organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Swadeshi Research Institute.

The government has expanded the scope of CSR to R&D but the country currently does not have any dedicated research mandate for corporates.

Asked about India's success in receiving Apple's investment to manufacture in India Vembu compared the situation with Mexico where there are factories for US companies but they don't have much value addition.

""We (India) have to know what is a long-term model for us"" he asked.

""We need those factories but we also need the R&D to 'own the technologies' because we need to have high income jobs to come here (India). Then the income will spread through the economy. Mere factories without intellectual properties will have limited benefit on the economy"" Vembu said.

Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had earlier announced Apple's iPhone is now getting made in India and its biggest plant is being set up at Hosur near Bengaluru. Some 60000 people will work in a single factory.

Emphasizing building a culture of research Vembu said ""There are large multiplier effects from R&D jobs. We need these jobs here."" India must focus on design development and manufacturing for the world Vembu said.

He built his billion-dollar product company purely on research by Indians engaging rural talent and resource.

Vembu said the company will begin R&D work on India-made computer-aided design software for engineering and other sectors which are now dominated by the US or other global majors."

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

Morant is expected the debut wearing the Ja 1 sneakers on Christmas Day against the Golden State Warriors.

The sneaker follows the low-cut model Nike has used with recent signature athletes. As always Nike's primary goal with basketball sneakers is prioritizing the comfort level for performance.

Ja Morant unveiled the Nike Ja 1 sneaker and became the 23rd player with a signature shoe in NBA history.

“His authentic personality deep love for his community and family and joy for the game make him very special — on and off the court” said Nike VP of Global Men’s Basketball Scott Munson. “We are thrilled to add Morant to our signature roster and can’t wait for everyone to learn more about his first shoe the Nike Ja 1.”

Just as players compete on the hardwood sneaker companies battle for consumers.

Historically Christmas Day has spawned some of the greatest basketball shoes of all time. That is why Memphis Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant is using the opportunity to make his mark on sneaker history.

Morant is debuting his first signature Nike shoe against the Golden State Warriors later today. Earlier this week Morant casually unveiled his official Nike logo. The ""JA"" logo contains his first name above a chevron representing his family mantra:

“As a kid whenever I wondered if I was good enough my parents would say: ‘You're beneath no one.’ And that's how I want everyone to feel when they wear the Ja 1 - that they're beneath no one.”.

Nike using Christmas Day as a springboard for the first signature shoe of the league's most acrobatic point guard is perfect timing. Below is everything we know about Morant's unreleased shoes.

Ahead of today's marquee game Nick DePaula of ESPN tweeted an image of Morant's first signature shoe. Nike has not yet released tech specs but the performance basketball shoe is low-cut and sure to be lightweight.

The Nike Ja 1 is launching in the summer of 2023 with a retail price of $110 in adult sizes. Three colorways are releasing this summer ""Phantom"" ""Cobalt Bliss"" and ""Game Royal.""

Morant signed with Nike before the Grizzlies selected him with the second overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. Since then the budding superstar has shown an affinity for classic models from the signature lines of Kobe Bryant Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.

The fun between Morant and Nike is just getting started and we cannot wait to see what the two partners create in the future. Stay locked into FanNationKicks.com for all your sneaker news.

It strained their budgets reduced their spending power and clobbered their 401(k) balances. Despite a recent burst of positive news—moderating gas prices and a slowing pace of inflation—many believe the economy will be in worse shape in 2023 than it is now.

Whatever the next 12 months bring there are some simple steps you can take now to prepare your finances for any further economic uncertainty.

Move cash to banking accounts that yield more in interest and charge less in fees. Cancel unused memberships and negotiate charges on those you keep. Review 401(k) contributions and allocations.

It might pay to act with urgency. Some financial benefits that could make a difference expire on New Year’s Eve. Here are six money moves to consider making before breaking out the bubbly:

Earn more on your savings

Keeping your cash in a typical savings account right now is only marginally better than stuffing it under a mattress. The average annual interest rate on savings accounts at all banks is 0.268% according to the financial site DepositAccounts.com meaning $1000 in savings will yield barely enough to buy a slice of pizza.

Some of the lowest rates are at the biggest institutions. Customers of the five largest U.S. banks could have earned $42 billion more on their balances in the third quarter just by moving their cash to higher yielding accounts at other banks by one estimate. Some online-only accounts for example pay rates around 4% and can be linked to an existing account for easy transfers.

The payoff involved in moving your cash away from the biggest banks is currently greater than at any point in the last decade according to Ken Tumin the founder of DepositAccounts which is owned by the financial-services marketplace LendingTree.

True optimizers might appreciate MaxMyInterest a service that in exchange for a 0.08% annual fee on their holdings monitors which banks offer the highest interest rates and allows customers to reallocate their cash accordingly on a regular basis.

For those willing to sacrifice some liquidity one of the best risk-free returns right now comes from inflation-adjusted I Bonds which currently pay out 6.89% but must be held for at least a year. Americans can buy up to $10000 of these U.S. government-backed savings bonds each calendar year so those who want to max out their purchases should do so before January says Mr. Tumin. The interest rate on these bonds is based on a calculation tied to the consumer-price index one reason they became popular this year as inflation surged.

After I Bonds Mr. Tumin suggests considering certificates of deposit or Treasury securities some of which offer higher rates than those of the top online savings accounts; for instance a six-month T-bill purchased Thursday would yield about 4.66% on an annualized basis. That said temporarily tying up your money could mean missing out on better yields soon if the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates.

Finding a home for your cash that pays higher yields won’t make you rich but it can give you some protection from inflation says Gary Zimmerman the CEO of MaxMyInterest. Even some of the best options have still been outpaced by inflation recently. “The real return on cash may be negative but it would be even more negative if you’re complacent about where you keep your cash"" he says.

Switch your bank accounts

Banking changed dramatically over the last two decades but chances are the institution you bank with hasn’t. Americans stick with the same primary checking and savings accounts for about 17 years on average according to a Bankrate survey. That is longer than the average marriage.

It is worth regularly shopping around to make sure you’re still getting the best deal says Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com particularly if you are paying any ATM or monthly maintenance fees. It is now easy to find a bank that offers those services free he said and the benefits could outweigh the inconvenience of switching institutions.

For example customers who typically carry a low balance in their checking account may benefit from choosing accounts with an extended overdraft grace period. One institution Citizens Financial Group added a feature to some of its checking accounts that gives customers who overdraft until 10 p.m. the following business day to cover the negative balance to avoid fees.

A customer who has more than $250000 which is the maximum amount per depositor that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. may also benefit from switching to a brokerage that can offer more insurance coverage by partnering with multiple FDIC-regulated banks. One brokerage giant Fidelity Investments allows customers to hold up to $3 million in insured deposits in its cash management account through partnerships with 26 banks.

Many new financial-technology companies offer even more specialized features bundled with checking accounts. LiliApp Inc. an online-only bank for gig-economy workers and entrepreneurs includes a tax-write-off tracker with its checking account. Majority a digital bank for migrants offers unlimited international transfers as part of its monthly subscription fee.

Cancel your subscriptions

This time of year many Americans sign up for gym memberships as part of a resolution to lose a few pounds. It is also a good time to cancel unused memberships to shed a few bucks from your budget.

The average American spends more than $200 a month on subscription fees and underestimates the cost by roughly $130 according to a study by C+R Research earlier this year. Roughly three quarters of consumers say it is easy to forget about recurring charges and 42% admitted that they were still paying for a subscription they had forgotten about.

The monthly costs associated with streaming services subscription boxes gym memberships and mobile apps have all crept higher over the past year according to data from Rocket Money which operates a personal finance app that tracks spending. Subscription spending among Rocket Money members increased an average of 8.5% this year compared with 2021. Once you authorize a company to take recurring payments from your account they can change the price without asking permission making it easy to lose track of exactly how much you are spending.

This is a good moment to take stock in the recurring payments you may have forgotten said Yahya Mokhtarzad chief revenue officer at Rocket Money. “This year more than recent years it is important to not just take stock of your finances but to really cut unneeded expenses and brace for what could be a tough 2023"" he said.

Renegotiate your bills

For all the recurring bills you cannot cancel pick up the phone and negotiate.

Cable companies and wireless providers may be willing to lower your bill since it costs more to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one said Ted Rossman a consumer-spending analyst at Bankrate.

Don’t be afraid to ask the company for your old rate back or to match a competitor’s price he said. There is often an unadvertised retention discount to keep customers from canceling. You can also request any deals and discounts being offered to new customers even if you’re a longtime subscriber he said.

If you’re asking for a lower rate with a service provider such as your wireless company be aware that you may be offered a promotional rate that increases significantly after an initial period expires said Sophie Raseman head of financial solutions at Brightside a company that provides financial guidance to workers. Set a reminder to cancel or downgrade then she said.

Another way to cut costs is to ask that certain fees be removed from your statement. These charges include line items on your phone internet or cable bill and may appear as “other fees.""

If your first attempt to negotiate isn’t successful call again on a different day as you may have more success with a different customer-service representative said Bruce McClary senior vice president at National Foundation for Credit Counseling.

Check your 401(k)

The standard advice for retirement plans is to let them run on autopilot and to resist the temptation to check your account and make changes when markets are down.

But at least once a year it pays to log into your accounts and review your savings rate investment mix and the types of tax-advantaged accounts you use. The S&P 500 stock index is down 19.3% this year through Friday and U.S. intermediate-term bond funds are down 12.4%; investors should rebalance if their asset allocation has strayed from their long-term targets.

The Internal Revenue Service recently raised the annual 401(k) contribution limit $2000 to $22500 for 2023 the largest increase ever in terms of dollars and percentage according to benefits provider Milliman. For those 50 or older the 2023 limit rises to $30000.

“You should avoid checking too often based on what the market did that day but you need to check in periodically to make sure your choices are still aligned with your long-term retirement goals"" said Mike Shamrell a vice president at Fidelity Investments.

As inflation strains budgets some Americans have had to make temporary reductions in 401(k) savings. The good news: The impact of doing so—even for a few years—isn’t as big as you might think provided you have a plan to catch up later.

For those able to save more the higher contribution limits create an “unprecedented opportunity"" said Ed Slott a certified public accountant and IRA specialist in Rockville Centre N.Y.

More investors with money in workplace retirement plans now have the option of choosing between a traditional 401(k) where contributions are deducted and withdrawals are taxed and a Roth 401(k) where contributions are taxed and distributions can be tax-free. Workers can also divide their 401(k) contributions between the two.

Using some of each could pay off down the road. One advantage to putting some money into a Roth is that retirees can pull money out tax-free in years when dipping into a regular 401(k) would push them into a higher bracket.

Don’t wait until it is too late

It doesn’t pay to procrastinate. A number of important financial benefits that could improve the position of your household in 2023 expire on New Year’s Eve.

Make your financial gifts: Families can give gifts of up to $16000 to an unlimited number of people without triggering estate or gift tax. That amount known as the annual exclusion jumps to $17000 for 2023.

A special rule lets donors use five years worth of annual exclusion gifts at once to superfund 529 college savings plans which let parents grandparents and others invest money to be used for a beneficiary’s qualified education expenses. That works out to $80000 per beneficiary account for 2022.

“Paying for education is a really efficient way to transfer wealth"" says Elisa Shevlin Rizzo a chief fiduciary officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management in New York.

A separate rule lets individuals pay anyone’s qualified education expenses and medical bills without estate or gift tax consequences if they make payments directly to the school or medical provider.

Donors who give away more than $16000 to anyone must report the gifts on a federal gift tax return Form 709. Any excess amount counts toward the amount you can give during your lifetime or at death and be exempt from federal estate and gift taxes. That exemption is $12.06 million per person for 2022 and rises to $12.9 million for 2023.

Use your healthcare accounts: Many workers have bigger balances than usual in their workplace healthcare flexible-spending accounts which allow employees to set aside pretax money from their paychecks to pay for medical expenses because of special Covid-related FSA carry-over rules. Now they are facing a Dec. 31 deadline to use their money or forfeit it. Check your FSA balance and your plan’s spend down rules now.

Take your losses: This year’s painful selloff brings an opportunity for investors to harvest losses in their brokerage accounts. Taxpayers who sell investments including crypto at a loss through Dec. 31 can offset gains on winners and up to $3000 of ordinary income on their 2022 tax return. Unused losses carry over to future years.

Make your required withdrawals: In most cases taxpayers 72 and older must take annual required minimum distributions or RMDs from traditional individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s by Dec. 31 or face a penalty of 50% of the amount they should have withdrawn. One exception: Those who turned 72 this year can wait until April 1 2023 to take their first RMD. Inherited IRAs both traditional and Roth have RMDs too with special rules for IRAs inherited in 2020 or later. A bill passed by Congress Friday raises the RMD age to 73 in 2023 and 75 in 2033 and reduces the penalty for missed RMDs.

In a decision Saturday Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson who was appointed by then-Republican Gov. Jan Brewer found that the court did not find clear and convincing evidence of the widespread misconduct that Lake had alleged had affected the result of the 2022 general election.

Lake who lost to Hobbs by just over 17000 votes was among the most vocal 2022 Republicans promoting former President Donald Trump’s election lies which she made the centerpiece of her campaign. While most of the other election deniers around the country conceded after losing their races in November Lake has not. Instead she asked the judge to either declare her the winner or order a revote in Maricopa County.

Lawyers for Lake focused on problems with ballot printers at some polling places in Maricopa County home to more than 60% of Arizona’s voters. The defective printers produced ballots that were too light to be read by the on-site tabulators at polling places. Lines backed up in some areas amid the confusion.

Kari Lake's team will have until 5 p.m. on Dec. 26 to file a response and any motion for sanctions will need to be submitted by 8 a.m. that morning.

County officials say everyone had a chance to vote and all ballots were counted since ballots affected by the printers were taken to more sophisticated counters at the elections department headquarters. They are in the process of investigating the root cause of the printer problems.

Lake’s attorneys also claimed the chain of custody for ballots was broken at an off-site facility where a contractor scans mail ballots to prepare them for processing. They claim workers at the facility put their own mail ballots into the pile rather than sending their ballots through normal channels and also that paperwork documenting the transfer of ballots was missing. The county disputes the claim.

Lake faced extremely long odds in her challenge needing to prove not only that misconduct occurred but also that it was intended to deny her victory and did in fact result in the wrong woman being declared the winner.

Her attorneys pointed to a witness who examined ballots on behalf of her campaign and discovered 14 ballots that had 19-inch images of the ballot printed on 20-inch paper meaning the ballots wouldn’t be read by a tabulator. The witness insisted someone changed those printer configurations a claim disputed by elections officials.

County officials say the ballot images were slightly smaller as a result of a shrink-to-fit feature being selected on a printer by a tech employee who was looking for solutions to Election Day issues. They say about 1200 ballots were affected by turning on the feature and that those ballots were duplicated so that they could be read by a tabulator. Ultimately these ballots were counted officials said.

A person who takes public-opinion polls testified on behalf of Lake claiming technical problems at polling places had disenfranchised enough voters that it would have changed the outcome of the race in Lake’s favor. But an expert who was called to testify by election officials said there was no evidence to back up the pollster’s claim that 25000 to 40000 people who would normally have voted actually didn’t cast ballots as a result of Election Day problems.

Thompson had previously dismissed eight of the 10 claims Lake raised in her lawsuit. Among those were Lake’s allegation that Hobbs in her capacity as secretary of state and Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer engaged in censorship by flagging social media posts with election misinformation for possible removal by Twitter. He also dismissed her claims of discrimination against Republicans and that mail-in voting procedures are illegal.

Hobbs takes office as governor on Jan. 2.

Her campaign released the following statement:

""Last month Arizonans made their voices heard at the ballot box. They chose sanity over chaos and commonsense bipartisan results over division. The voters of Arizona – not the conspiracy-riddled dark corners of the Internet – are the ones who choose our leaders. We’re pleased that the courts have upheld the will of the voters and Governor-Elect Hobbs is continuing the work of preparing to take office as Arizona’s next governor.""

Earlier on Friday another judge dismissed Republican Abraham Hamadeh’s challenge of results in his race against Democrat Kris Mayes for Arizona attorney general. The court concluded that Hamadeh who finished 511 votes behind Mayes and hasn’t conceded the race didn’t prove the errors in vote counting that he had alleged.

A court hearing is scheduled Thursday to present results of recounts in the races for attorney general state superintendent and for a state legislative seat.

Day 2 of the trial:

Lawyers for Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake were back in court on Dec. 22 after her campaign filed a lawsuit challenging the results of the midterm election.

Lake's team called the director of the Big Data Poll Richard Baris to the witness stand who claims between 25 and 40000 voters were disenfranchised on Election Day because of issues at polling locations.

Baris said 813 people across Arizona were polled and people who said they planned on voting never completed an exit interview.

Witness for the defense included a Political Science professor Dr. Kenneth Mayer. Dr. Mayer criticized Baris’ assumption and says after analyzing the data he found no evidence any voter was prevented from voting.

""He is making the assumption that every one of those people who didn’t respond to his poll tried to vote or didn’t vote because they were disenfranchised. He is essentially taking the non-response rate"" said Dr. Mayer.

Election officials also took the stand acknowledging there were issues with the printers on Election Day adding that three locations also had ""shrink to fit"" issues meaning that the printing on the 20-inch ballots were too small and therefore rejected.

Election officials say all affected voters had the option of placing their ballots in what was labeled ‘Box 3.' They were then tabulated by a bipartisan panel. They say no one was prevented from voting.

Day 1 of the trial:

Day one of the two-day election trial in Maricopa County was held on Dec. 21.

After a judge dismissed eight of Kari Lake's counts her team had to prove there were intentional chain of custody issues and intentional printer issues that impacted the outcome of the election.

Lake's team brought up an expert that said he has proof ballots were intentionally printed incorrectly but the county responded saying every vote was still counted.

Lake did not talk outside of court but inside her team claimed a printing issue on Election Day was intentional and disenfranchised voters.

On the stand Lake's team called Clay Parikh with Northrop Grumman cybersecurity.

During a ballot inspection on Dec. 20 of 15 ballots Parikh claimed he saw proof the ballots were actually 19-inch documents printed on 20-inch paper.



When asked how many of those contained 19-inch ballot image on 20-inch paper Parikh replied ""14.""

Maricopa County Elections Director Scott Jarrett said there is no 19-inch document.

""That ballot does not exist. The only ballot that exists is a 20-inch ballot.""

Parikh says it happened and it was deliberate.

When asked is there any way in his opinion for a 19-inch ballot to be projected on a 20-inch ballot by accident Parikh said ""No sir."" Then he was asked ""Why not?""

""Because the settings and the configurations and the procedures that are used cannot allow that"" replied Parikh.

Jarrett responded ""Again you're asking me to speculate about things that I have no knowledge of occurring. So I don't know if it could have been a deliberate act or not. I don't believe that that occurred.""

Whether it was deliberate matters but they need more.

In this trial Lake's team must prove someone interfered in the election purposely and succeeded in changing the vote.

During the cross county attorneys pointed out even if the ballots were 19-inches deliberate or not every vote was still counted.

An attorney asked ""Are duplicated ballots tabulated? Maricopa County General Election 2022?""

Parikh responded ""If they're duplicated correctly and they're configured correctly yes they should be.""

There were multiple hiccups for Lake's team. They attempted to call a witness but never added him to the witness list so he could not be called. Exhibits were listed but never attached.

It boasts unparalleled levels of performance out of the box that can go even further with DLSS 3 providing you can fit in your case and stomach its eye watering price tag. This latter point plays a large role in undermining the importance of team green’s flagship with the announcement of the company’s much more pivotal pixel pushers hopefully just over the horizon.

To be perfectly clear the RTX 4090 will remain the best graphics card money can buy for the foreseeable future with its closest competition (the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX) looking for a fight with the RTX 4080 instead. However there are fewer people that will buy let alone can afford such a costly GPU versus a prospective RTX 4070 4060 and 4050.

You need only take a look at any Steam Hardware Survey to see just how popular Nvidia’s mainstream offerings are and conversely how little prevalence 90 and 80 class graphics cards are among the user base. The GeForce GTX 1060 despite being six and a half years old remains the most popular pixel pusher on Valve’s platform with the RTX 2060 GTX 1650 RTX 3060 and 1050 Ti making up the rest of the top five GPUs.

There are a couple of reasons why 60 and 50 class graphics cards are so dominant among Steam users with an obvious one being price. The most expensive GPU out of that bunch cost $329 when it first launched and can be had for even less now. Looking at this data it’s pretty clear that while PC gamers strive to boost fps as high as possible the majority of them simply aren’t willing to break the bank for a higher frame rate.

Resolution understandably plays a big part in these purchase decisions too. The GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 to an extent are powerful enough for 4K gaming but the user base simply isn’t there yet. The prevalence of 1080p screens is undeniable with a whopping 65.08% market share among Steam users at the time of writing compared to the 13.42% enjoyed by 1440p and woefully small 2.33% adoption rate of 2160p.

Given that it makes more sense to upgrade your graphics card before bumping up the resolution of your gaming monitor it’ll likely take some time before the reign of 1080p comes to an end. Even 1440p hasn’t had its day in the sun like its HD counterpart. On the surface this could perhaps shift people away from waiting for this generation’s 50/60 class GPUs but they’ll likely be 4K performance powerhouses themselves armed with Nvidia DLSS 3.

Current rumours suggest that RTX 4060 performance will mirror the RTX 3070 which will be great if it launches for a competitive price. That said Nvidia’s next-gen (or perhaps current gen now) upscaling tech on its side increases its value versus its predecessors while diminishing the appeal of the more expensive GeForce graphics cards.

As hardware enthusiasts it’s easy to sometimes get caught up in the admittedly amazing things happening at the bleeding edge of technology. This has at least in my case warped how I view my own setup and created a completely misplaced fear of missing out on the latest and greatest technology like the GeForce RTX 4090.

Ultimately it’s not the most powerful GPUs that have come to define each generation of graphics card be it from Nvidia or AMD. In fact it’s the value oriented 50 and 60 class offerings that prove the most influential among PC builders and gamers alike making them the most important graphics cards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hbWQtZ3B1cy1oYXZlLXRoaXMtb25lLXVuc3VuZy1hZHZhbnRhZ2Utb3Zlci1udmlkaWEv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL2FtZC1ncHVzLWhhdmUtdGhpcy1vbmUtdW5zdW5nLWFkdmFudGFnZS1vdmVyLW52aWRpYS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD graphics cards have this one unsung advantage over Nvidia,"AMD graphics cards have gotten a lot of the limelight recently especially as the new RX 7900 XTX undercuts Nvidia’s RTX 4080 in performance. But as AMD has continued to refine its GPU performance another big area of improvement has been bubbling under the surface — AMD Software.

It’s been AMD Software Radeon Software Adrenalin and various other names in the past but regardless of the name AMD has continued to iterate and improve the software experience for its GPUs. And the version we have now is a big reason why AMD can go up against the best graphics cards.

Everything all in one place

The biggest perk of AMD Software is that all of your settings are in a single spot. That doesn’t seem like a big deal until you actually want to leverage the many software features available to Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.

Get your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!

Nvidia has a much different approach. You can see your games and some quick account settings in the GeForce Experience app. Your critical game and display settings though are only available in the drab Nvidia Control Panel. On top of that Nvidia’s features like Freestyle filters and Ansel are available in GeForce Experience but not in the desktop app. You can only find those in the overlay.

I’ve used Nvidia GPUs exclusively for close to a decade and I never used features like FreeStyle and Ansel in day-to-day use simply because I couldn’t be bothered to track down where to find them. I actively avoided GeForce Experience on my personal machine — the app would constantly kick me out and I’d have to sign back in to do something as simple as check for a driver update. The situation is even more convoluted now with Nvidia Broadcast. I had three Nvidia apps running on my PC at all times.

You don’t need to bounce through multiple apps and overlays to find features with AMD’s software.

AMD Software has everything in one spot both in the desktop app and in the overlay. On the desktop I can tune game settings and check for graphics drivers and in a game I can customize my picture settings while I’m playing rather than applying custom color settings in a dated app and hoping they stick (I’m looking at you Nvidia Control Panel). Or I can do it all on desktop or all in-game and that flexibility is great.

Overall AMD and Nvidia have very similar software features available. There are a few exceptions like Nvidia’s AI-enhanced camera features available through Broadcast but AMD and Nvidia allow you to easily optimize your game settings record and stream gameplay capture highlights and configure advanced graphics and display settings. The difference is that you don’t need to bounce through multiple apps and overlays to find those features with AMD’s software.

A smoother more robust experience

AMD Software has a few features that make it even more helpful than GeForce Experience too. For nerds like me something as small as the option to reset your shader cache can make a world of difference. A big plus for AMD Software though is the built-in GPU overclocking utility.

You’re not getting an advanced overclocking program but most GPUs don’t call for advanced overclocking in the first place. You can quickly boost your clock speed or memory speed with a slider and AMD includes a few one-click overclocking profiles as well. There’s even a built-in stress test to verify your overclock is stable. Nvidia supports one-click overclocking too but only through MSI Afterburner. It’s among the best GPU overclocking software but it’s yet another utility you need to add onto the Nvidia stack to get all of the features AMD has in a single app.

You have a lot of options with this utility too. The one-click settings are great but you can manually tune your GPU as well and even tie specific overclocking profiles to games. In Destiny 2 I noticed the Overclock VRAM profile helped smooth out my frame rate a lot so I have it applied only when I play that game. And every time I load up a game AMD Software shows a small overlay with what I have enabled so I don’t need to bounce back to the software to double-check.

Beyond overclocking AMD builds out its software with several quality-of-life features. There’s a snappy built-in browser for example so you can quickly look something up if you need to. There’s a search bar so you can find a setting without digging through menus. And once you have your settings configured how you want you can export them as a profile and import them later in case you’re switching machines or need to do a clean install.

You don’t need to sign in to AMD Software either. GeForce Experience requires an Nvidia account and you have to sign on to use any of its features. I’m not a privacy fanatic where a sign-on screen will send me into a frenzy but it’s annoying to constantly sign back into my Nvidia account just to use the features of a graphics card I paid for (especially when Nvidia’s social sign-on process is prone to fail).

Built-in overclocking a web browser the lack of a sign-on screen and various small extras like a search bar help AMD Software feel like a smoother more robust tool compared to GeForce Experience. That’s even before we bring in features like the AMD Link streaming utility which looks like a huge plus now that Nvidia is discontinuing its GameStream service.

Not without problems

AMD Software isn’t perfect though and it’s important to call out its flaws. For starters it’s prone to bugs. On several occasions settings menus simply wouldn’t display or the software would hang on a tab for a while. Restarting the app always resolved the issue but these bugs still pop up from time to time.

In addition the recommendations to tune your game settings are lacking. Nvidia includes a one-click optimization feature in GeForce Experience that will automatically tune your settings based on your hardware. It’s not perfect but it provides a good starting point to tune your performance. AMD Software provides highly general suggestions like “decrease image quality” and “reduce display resolution” which are far less helpful.

My biggest issue is the overlay. Over and over the overlay would slow my entire screen down to around 15 frames per second (including my game) and slowly bring up my settings. AMD Software is robust but the byproduct of doing so much is that it causes your machine to slow to a crawl when you cram so many features into a game overlay.

I’ve found that using Alt + Tab is the best way to go if I need to adjust settings (AMD Software is very friendly on that front). Otherwise I’ve mainly used the hotkeys to do things like save a recording or take a screenshot. On the plus side you can customize your hotkeys and it would be interesting to get everything set up through something like an Elgato Stream Deck in the future.

An unsung hero

There’s plenty to talk about on the performance front between AMD and Nvidia and ultimately that’s what matters most when choosing a GPU. AMD Software doesn’t always get the attention it should though. It’s packed full of features that unlock so much more for your graphics card outside of just playing games.

Nvidia has these features as well and in some cases Nvidia goes further. Admittedly I’ve missed the smooth background blur and auto-framing provided by Nvidia Broadcast as well as the ray tracing filter available through FreeStyle.

Still I’ve enjoyed how much AMD Software has to offer and how much I’ve experimented with it. Saving GIFs instantly from my games tuning overclocking settings on a per-title basis tweaking color settings to get my games looking just right … the list goes on. AMD and Nvidia both have their pros and cons but I’ve undoubtedly used AMD Software far more than I ever used GeForce Experience.

I wanted to find out how to make the most of the hardware especially the dual encoders – Nvidia having included two encoder chips this time around.

Some background on presets

It is often said “Good Fast Cheap – Pick Two” and it fits post production pretty well. Encoding has a similar relationship between quality speed and file size.

For example if you fix the file size by fixing the bitrate as is common you can have higher quality by taking longer to make the encode. If you fix the quality (using say the constant quality slider in Handbrake) you can get the file size a bit smaller by taking longer with the encode. The way you go about this is by choosing a different preset – seen here for the x264 encoder in Handbrake for example.

A preset is defined as follows:

A preset is a collection of options that will provide a certain encoding speed to compression ratio. A slower preset will provide better compression (compression is quality per filesize). This means that for example if you target a certain file size or constant bit rate you will achieve better quality with a slower preset. Similarly for constant quality encoding you will simply save bitrate by choosing a slower preset (source).

The real question though is whether taking that extra time is worth it to you. Some people will just choose the slowest preset knowing they want the highest quality and are prepared to wait for it. Personally I would always like to know if it’s worth doing something slower – what if you’re waiting an extra 10 minutes every day for a 0.01% improvement that no-one will ever see? Well it turns out it’s exactly like that – not only for software encoders like x264 but also for the new RTX 4000 series which I’ll get to later.

A while back I came across some great research from Jan Ozer called “Choosing an x264 preset” which clearly shows that you gain almost nothing by using anything slower than the “faster” preset in terms of quality yet cost yourself a good bit of time if you do.

The Nvidia hardware encoder (NVENC) also has presets – officially called P1 (fastest) through P7 (slowest) which according to Nvidia “determine for example GOP structure B frames look-ahead encoding and so on” – stuff most of us don’t have time to understand but it’s the same deal – spending a bit more time to get a bit more quality or a smaller file.

And it turns out the export time is massively different across these presets. I ran some tests on the RTX 4080 exporting a 5 minute DNxHR UHD 25fps clip to all three output options (H.264 H.265 and AV1) across all 7 presets. For H.265 and AV1 the fastest preset was around 6 times faster than the slowest one going from around 50 FPS to around 300 FPS. To put that into some context if you have a 30 minute timeline the “Very Slow” preset will take over 15 minutes and the “Very Fast” preset will take 2.5 minutes. That kind of time adds up if you’re doing this every day. To get this export speed the input codec does have to be ProRes or DNxHR (or equivalent mezzanine codec) with effects already cached/rendered – otherwise the encoder is not fed fast enough.

The dual encoders

There’s also a reason why the encoding speed jumps up sharply for the two fastest presets – it is here that the dual encoders come into play. Apparently under certain conditions the new cards can split a video into two halves and pass each half to each encoder and then recombine them. In order to use the dual encoders on the new RTX 4000 series you need the following to be true:

Resolution is UHD or above

Preset is “Faster (P2)” or “Very Fast (P1)”

Tuning is set as “High Quality” (this is the default anyway)

Export codec is AV1 or H.265

I was also only able to achieve this in Davinci Resolve (not Premiere Pro or Shutter Encoder for example). It’s interesting that the H.265 encode is now overall faster than H.264 – I think it is time to start using it if you’re not already.

But what about quality?

Of course the big question is what is the tradeoff in quality for these speeds? While you can and should use your eyes to see if an export is at the quality you require for more subtle differences it’s best to use something like PSNR or VMAF to assess the visual quality.

VMAF is an “Emmy-winning perceptual video quality assessment algorithm developed by Netflix”. And you can use it for free within FFmpeg – I followed this guide (again by Jan Ozer). The really good thing about VMAF is that it’s a score out of 100 which makes it quite easy to understand and according to Netflix a score of over 85 is good.

While there is a small drop-off in quality across the presets it really is very small – less than half a VMAF point & not visible to the naked eye. Really with any score over 90 I find it hard to see any artifacting at all. A much bigger difference is seen by using H.265 instead of H.264 (and AV1 is even better). Of course the actual numbers will depend on the source material but I did a few other tests and got similar results.

While speed of encode doesn’t affect the quality that much the bitrate/filesize does. You can see here a 1080p test file encoded to H.265 at bitrates from 10Mbps down to 1Mbps – the quality varies little across the presets but a lot across the bitrates. To my eye I was very happy with the encodes above 6Mbps.

Given most people are not short of drive space or internet speed upping the bitrate is definitely the way to push the quality up whilst keeping the benefit of getting the encode done quickly with the fastest presets.

Premiere Pro

In Premiere Pro there are more limited options but you still can speed up your exports by some judicious tweaking of settings. Presets are not available in H.264 and AV1 is not available at all yet (aside from using 3rd party plugin Voukoder) but if you choose HVEC (H.265) as the format and you dial down in the Video settings you see five options listed as “Quality” – why there are five and not seven I have no idea (my guess is trying to keep it simpler by leaving off the outer two). You also need to make sure you have chosen one pass hardware encoding which uses the Nvidia NVENC encoder.

Again there are substantial time savings to be made here though sadly none of them seemed to access the dual encoders. But I saw about a 67% speed increase going from the default “Good” to the “Lower” setting – and this time the drop off in quality was completely negligible (only 0.1 VMAF points across all the presets). And getting to 167 FPS is pretty impressive even if not quite the 300 FPS of Davinci Resolve.

Shutter Encoder

Shutter Encoder is a popular free encoding tool so I thought I’d give it a look too. It’s very useful and better than Handbrake in lots of ways (e.g. keeps timecode intact). It’s a front end for FFmpeg and by default it’s using the CPU encoders like x264. This is great if you have an older graphics card or you are after the best possible quality. You can force it to use NVENC if you want to for much faster speeds – in my tests getting a 10x speed increase by changing from the default settings to NVENC “veryfast”. It performed similarly to Premiere with 183 FPS and again didn’t seem to be able to use the dual encoders.

I did find the software encoders gave 1 or 2 more VMAF points for the same material in general so again it depends if you are trying to squeeze out the last bit of quality and don’t mind spending the time doing that.

Conclusions

The Nvidia hardware encoder (NVENC) has been of a very high quality for many generations – close enough to the quality of software encoders to make it worthwhile and much much faster. In this RTX 4000 series it is even better and the inclusion of dual encoders is quite exciting. Being able to access them in Davinci Resolve is fantastic bringing encoding speeds up to an impressive 300 FPS by using the fastest presets. And those speeds involve very little drop off in quality plus you could make up for that anyway by bumping up the bitrate a little to no real disadvantage.

I also think it’s time to ditch H.264 for H.265. Hardware on the receiving end is now easily able to play it back and it’s now quicker to make as well as better quality. H.264 is coming on 20 years old now and H.265 can now be seen as the “safe” choice against AV1 if that makes you feel better.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvbnZpZGlhLXJ0eC00MDkwLWlzLXlldC1hbm90aGVyLWJlYXN0LXNsYXllZC1pbi10aGUtd2l0Y2hlci0zLW5leHQtZ2VuLXVwZGF0ZS1hdC04a9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia RTX 4090 is yet another beast slayed in The Witcher 3 Next Gen Update at 8K,"Our 8K test system PC built by Stormforce Gaming Motherboard: Asus PRIME Z-790P LGA 1700

We've been getting tantalizingly close to the reality of playable 8K PC gaming thanks to powerful GPUs like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti (which I got to play Marvel's Spider-Man in native 8K something I once thought impossible without massive graphical compromises).

Now that Nvidia has released its latest high-end GPU the RTX 4090 which promises to be even more powerful – we're edging ever closer to 8K gaming.

Of course I was keen to get hold of one to see just how good it could be when pumping out graphics at 7680 x 4320 and the kind folks at Stormforce Gaming put together the latest iteration of TechRadar's super-powerful 8K gaming PC.

At its heart is that essential RTX 4090 GPU featuring 24GB of GDDR6X memory with a 384-bit interface and 21Gbps memory speed. While on paper that matches the RTX 3090 Ti it's the leap from last-gen Ampere architecture to Lovelace plus higher clock speeds that will make the RTX 4090 a much more competent card at 8K resolutions.

The fact that the RTX 4090 can also use DLSS 3 the latest version of Nvidia's upscaling tech is also exciting. It should make running games at 8K more achievable and I'm looking forward to seeing how the new frame-generation feature works.

In the past DLSS has made a huge difference when playing at the ultra-high resolution of 8K allowing the RTX 3090 Ti and the 3090 and Titan RTX before it to hit playable frame rates.

With the RTX 4090 and DLSS 3 I'm really looking forward to seeing just how well our new 8K rig runs. If you're in the UK you can order the same high-end setup from Stormforce Gaming.

Returning to The Witcher 3

The arrival of our new 8K PC coincided nicely with the release of The Witcher 3 Next Gen update.

This free update to what we consider one of the best PC games ever made includes a huge range of new and improved features and graphical effects. These include ray-traced global illumination and ray-traced reflections and shadows (which are exclusive to the PC version).

There are also improvements to character models boosted vegetation improved environmental lighting and effects and a range of popular mods to make the game look and play better than ever.

A new Ultra+ graphical setting has been added to PC and perhaps most exciting of all The Witcher 3 is now one of the first games to support DLSS 3.

So despite the base game now being a good few years old I was excited to see how well it can run at 8K with the most powerful GPU money can buy right now and new graphics settings.

One thing to note is that when this new The Witcher 3 update launched there were complaints about poor performance and bugs. I installed the update that the games devs (CD Projekt Red) released after launch which they claim fixes those issues.

8K dreams crushed

As soon as I loaded The Witcher 3 I set the graphics to the highest preset – RT Ultra. This adds not only global ray tracing but also ray-traced reflections shadows and ambient occlusion as well.

As you may expect this is pretty punishing and with Anti-Aliasing turned to 'Off' to disable DLSS our RTX 4090-powered 8K machine managed just 39 frames per second (fps). While that's still above the minimum 30fps I consider playable the game felt incredibly choppy.

I was riding around the countryside and a swamp fighting various monsters and while it looked fantastic the choppy gameplay meant I couldn't fully enjoy the game.

Turning DLSS on and to 'Auto' actually dropped frame rates to an average of 29fps. This may be due to the added stress of adding traditional Anti-Aliasing as well as DLSS. It's interesting that the two options are combined in The Witcher 3.

Testing the game with DLSS set to 'Quality' dropped the frame rate further to 21.2fps on average with lows of 17.7fps. This is understandable as the Quality setting focuses on image quality over performance.

Switching to 'Balanced' made the frame rate climb again but to just 26.2fps on average. Going to 'Performance' got us back to 29.9fps.

Finally DLSS 'Ultra Performance' boosted the average frame rate to 46fps. The visual impact wasn't too bad though there was noticeable noise around shafts of light coming through tree branches. However the higher frame rate made for a much more enjoyable experience.

However The Witcher 3 was still a long way from the 60fps at 8K milestone. With all DLSS options tried was I out of luck? Not exactly...

DLSS 3 Frame Generation to the rescue?

There's an exclusive feature for DLSS 3 and RTX 4000 series GPUs like the RTX 4090 that I hadn't tried yet: Frame Generation.

This new tool uses artificial intelligence to create additional frames and slot them in between 'real' frames from the game the idea being to boost frame rates by increasing the number of frames being shown again with minimal impact on overall graphical fidelity.

I was keen to turn the feature on to see how well it worked. It actually seemed to make things worse.

Frame rates plummeted and when I moved the camera the graphics became blurred. I could only stand it for a few seconds before turning it off. I'm willing to put this down to a bug that will be ironed out later but Frame Generation made the game unplayable.

Sacrificing ray tracing

My only options now were to start reducing graphical settings - not something you want to do with the world's most powerful gaming graphics card.

First I dropped the preset from RT Ultra to RT. This kept the ray tracing global lighting effects on but turned off the more intensive shadows and reflections. I kept most other settings at either 'Ultra' or the new 'Ultra+' settings.

With DLSS still on Ultra Performance but Frame Generation turned off I managed to get 53.3fps on average. Tantalizingly close to 60fps though with drops to 47.4fps it still felt too juddery to enjoy. While I could live without the ray-traced shadows the lack of water reflections stung. In the swamp area the water no longer reflected the glorious sunset as I killed various monsters through the evening.

Finally I dropped the preset to 'Ultra'. This would have been the highest setting for The Witcher 3 when it first launched and means no ray tracing at all.

Image 1 of 2 Ray tracing: on (Image credit: CD Projekt Red / Future) Ray tracing: off (Image credit: CD Projekt Red / Future)

The impact on visuals was apparent immediately with the shadows cast by trees and foliage now less realistic and water effects pretty basic. With ray tracing on and water effects set to Ultra+ when I was running around in ankle-deep swamp water and fighting off Drowners the water rippled with every movement affecting the reflected sunlight. It was a stunning effect that made the game feel really immersive. With ray tracing turned off and water effects dropped to 'Ultra' (as well as every other Ultra+ setting) the game felt a lot flatter - and it definitely reminded me that I was playing a game that originally came out in 2015.

Image 1 of 2 Ray tracing: on (Image credit: CD Projekt Red / Future) Ray tracing: off (Image credit: CD Projekt Red / Future)

However frame rates finally hit 59.8 on average – as near as dammit to 60fps. But were the compromises I had to make worth it? No.

Stick with 4K

The loss of ray tracing really stung – especially with the more subtle effects. Because of this and due to The Witcher 3 getting improved textures that top out at 4K it's clear that 4K is the way to go.

Once I set it to 4K the RTX 4090 Could easily handle the game with all graphical bells and whistles turned to the max and that all-important ray tracing present and correct.

It seems like The Witcher 3 Next Gen update on PC still has some performance issues especially with DLSS 3 Frame Generation and hopefully a few more patches could get it running better at 8K. Until then I'll be spending my time with Geralt Ciri and the others in 4K instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1yZWZyZXNoZXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA1MC13aXRoLWdhMTA3LWdwdS1sb3dlcnMtcG93ZXItY29uc3VtcHRpb24tYnktMTV3L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1yZWZyZXNoZXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA1MC13aXRoLWdhMTA3LWdwdS1sb3dlcnMtcG93ZXItY29uc3VtcHRpb24tYnktMTV3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Refreshes GeForce RTX 3050 With GA107 GPU Lowers Power Consumption By 15W,"NVIDIA AIB partners have finally started offering the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card with the GA107 GPU resulting in 15W less power consumption.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Gets Ampere GA107 GPU Same Performance At 15W Lower Power

A year ago NVIDIA introduced the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card which featured the GA106 GPU for $249 US. The graphics card was meant to offer entry-level RTX performance in a 130W package but it looks like it was originally intended to use the GA107 GPU which at the time was shipping to notebooks and NVIDIA had to reuse GA106 silicon for the time being.

Now a year later NVIDIA's AIBs are introducing the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card with the GA107 GPU. NVIDIA's GA107 GPU has a smaller core than the GA106 which offers 3840 CUDA cores. There will be no reason to replace the PCB as both versions are identical pin layouts allowing for both to be compatible.

MSI has released its new GeForce RTX 3050 VENTUS 2X XS 8G OC which is expected to offer 2560 CUDA cores. The graphics card will be capable of overclocking with the boost clock anticipated to be 1807 MHz. Memory speeds are expected to be 14 Gbps and utilize the 8GB GDDR6 memory onboard and a 128-bit memory bus. The total power consumption level will be 115W 15W less than the GA106 variant.

Display outputs on the new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 VENTUS 2X XS 8G OC graphics card will have a single DisplayPort 1.4a port one HDMI port that is expected to support 4K resolutions at 120 Hz with the 2.1 specifications and a single DL-DVI-D connector which is interesting that they are adding an older display connector onto the GPU. DL-DVI-D cables are seen with LCD connections and only provide a digital output.

NVIDIA won't be launching an RTX 4050 any time soon since they are still focused on the RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 series for the majority of early 2023. The successor to the RTX 3050 might appear by mid of 2023 but we will have to see so for users who want to wait the RTX 3050 is a decent entry-level option for now and can be found at decent prices too.

Peter Sebetic a lifelong Kenosha resident bought the business located at 2929 Roosevelt Road in September and has spent several months working on extensive renovations to the building. That includes work on the roof plumbing and a complete remodeling of the interior.

“People eat with their eyes I want to provide a nice clean place for people” Sebetic said.

Work is expected to be completed in late January with Sebetic saying he hopes to open on his doors Feb. 1 with reduced times and hours. After the winter Sebetic plans to expand the operation hours and add car hops.

Sebetic has known the previous owner Ken Anderson much of his life. He’s been in the restaurant business for over a decade in one form or another. When Anderson closed his doors last February he jumped at the chance to run his own business.

“It sat vacant for a very long time I approached him about selling the business to me” Sebetic said. “I wanted to be an entrepreneur I wanted to be an owner and operator of a restaurant.”

The remodeled restaurant will be an “old-school diner” Sebetic said offering a retro experience with affordable and high quality food. It’s something he felt was lacking.

“It brings a diner experience back to Kenosha it brings the legacy of Andy’s back” Sebetic said. “I want to get this back to being a staple of the community.”

The retro diner will be a family-friendly location Sebetic said and emphasized that it would be a local restaurant run by a Kenosha family as it had been with the previous family.

“I want to provide a good experience to people and their families” Sebetic said.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

So regardless of your faith when a close family member passes away around the holidays it makes a painful blow even more difficult to accept.

The Old Dominion men's basketball family suffered a pair of devastating blows in mid-December as two of the four assistant coaches lost close relatives just four days apart.

Jamal Robinson and Kieran Donohue grew up just miles away from each other in New York City and have known each other for decades. They both played Catholic league basketball in the Big Apple and attended the University of Virginia.



They have been close with ODU head coach Jeff Jones for three decades.

What are the odds they would lose a brother and a father within days of each other?

On Saturday Dec. 10 an hour before ODU's home game with Gardner-Webb Kieran learned that his older brother Tim had died.

He sat alone in his office before the Monarchs dispatched Gardner-Webb 44-43.



""I knew I could get through the game"" he said. ""And I knew what my brother would have wanted me to do.



""It was an ugly game but I'm so glad we won.""



Afterwards the loss hit him like a ton of bricks. He spoke to the players briefly to a few staff members and left without saying good bye to Jones and without telling anyone the loss he'd just suffered.





Tim Donohue



Tim Donohue was a healthy guy who had been sick for a few days with flu-like symptoms. That morning he called his wife Susan and said he didn't feel well and asked her to come to take him to an urgent care center.

Before she got home he collapsed and died. His sons Brendan and Kevin ages 17 and 14 respectively performed CPR on their dad until an ambulance arrived. Despite their heroic efforts their father was already gone.

""They were brave young men"" Kieran said.

Four days later at Flushing Hospital in Queens New York Jamal Robinson and family members gathered around his father James Robinson as doctors turned off the respirator that was keeping him alive.

James Robinson was a former basketball star at Denison College in Ohio and was a giant of a man who was robustly healthy well into retirement.

But four years ago he was diagnosed with dementia.

Some dementia patients are blessedly clueless that they have a cruel disease that robs you of your memories and your ability to think and eventually takes your life.







Jamal and James Robinson



""But he knew what was happening to him"" Jamal said. ""That made it so hard.""

Jamal is also a giant of a man. He played 13 years professionally including one with the NBA's Miami Heat.

Tears filled his eyes as I talked to him about his father at Chartway Arena last week.

""He was just amazing"" Jamal said. ""He was so strong.

""When I was younger I felt like I didn't like him because he wasn't letting me do all of the things I wanted to do.""

When he got older Jamal said ""I grabbed him and just told him 'thank you.' because now I understood why he was being that way. He didn't want me in the streets doing bad things with my friends.

""He was such a role model. Even with this disease he was such a role model. He held my mom's hand. The way he held onto my mother's hand"" he said stopping for a minute when speaking of Maria Robinson.

""He was all about my mom.""

When I asked him how he's doing Jamal replied: ""Not good."" He's been sick. The shock and grief of losing a family member lowers your resistance. He said he's happy to be with family in New York.





Kieran has processed his brother's death differently. He's been a workaholic around the office in practice and in games. On Thursday he said good bye to his wife Erika and daughters Molly and Nora as they departed to Connecticut to be with family.

Then he spent several hours doing yard work and housework and got in his car to drive to Belmont North Carolina to be with his parents Kevin and Joan Donohue and his brother's family.

We spoke for nearly two hours as he drove and an odd thing happened. Kieran handles travel arrangements for the basketball team and always knows where he's going. But he got lost and drove to Newport News before having to circle back south.

""I never get lost"" he said. ""Ever.""

Mental lapses like that are typical of grief especially the first time you lose a close family member.

""Everybody grieves in their own way"" Jones said. ""Kieran was going to stay busy and take care of everybody. That's who he is.

""Jamal is grieving in his own way. There's no right or wrong way to grieve. It's different with everybody. All we can do is be there for them and support them in any way we can.""

They're not the only Monarchs who've been recently touched by death. Guard Tre Brown the transfer from Drexel whose eligibility for this season is caught up in the NCAA appeal process recently lost his stepfather in a car accident in Washington state.

Tre was in Norfolk more than 3000 miles away from family in the Pacific Northwest when he got the call about his stepfather. As he was walking back from a study hall to his dormitory room he called Jones.

""He was completely torn up"" Jones said.





Tre Brown

""I live right down the street so I got in my car and found him on 43rd Street meandering around sobbing on the corner of one of the side streets.""



Jones paused for a second before adding: ""We are family and we have to take care of each other.""

After Kieran left Chartway Arena immediately after the Gardner-Webb game Jones learned his long-time friend was distraught but not why. So he drove to Kieran's house pulled into the driveway and called him.

""I knew something was going on"" Jones said. ""But I didn't realize Tim had died.""

Jones who lost his father a year and a half ago is dealing with additional potential losses. A four-year starter at point guard for UVA Jones said one of his former teammates had a stroke over the summer. Last week his teammate and close friend went into hospice care.

Then during exam week he flew to see another friend whose wife is in a coma.

""They don't know what happened but she's been in a coma the last 60 days"" Jones said. ""Everywhere you look we're taking hits.""

Kieran and Jamal knew of each other in New York and met at UVA. They are part of a select group of former New York Catholic school players who have been close with Jones since he coached at UVA.

Former UVA and ODU assistant coach Dennis Wolff also a former Catholic school player from New York recruited Jamal to Charlottesville and introduced Kieran to Jones and helped him land a job on the Virginia staff.

""Dennis has been awesome to both of us since this happened"" Kieran said.





Kieran Donohue



So have the players who hugged both Kieran and Jamal after ODU's stirring 78-77 victory over George Mason Wednesday afternoon a win that allowed the Monarchs to end their non-conference schedule with a four-game winning streak.

I watched Kieran and Jamal throughout much of the game and at times the pain was apparent with both of them. But they both love coaching. And winning.

""It was good to be back on the court"" Kieran said. ""It was a release for both of us I think and such a fun thing to be a part of such a great victory.

Later he added: ""One thing my brother's friends made abundantly clear to me is that they knew how proud he was of me.""

Their father was a college basketball referee and they grew up watching their dad ref games all over the city.

Jamal saw his dad go toe to toe with the best on the New York City playgrounds.

""He is literally the guy who put a ball in my hand"" Jamal said. ""I have him to thank for my entire career.""

Jones had told Jamal shortly after his father died that he could remain with his family and miss the George Mason game.

He came back to Norfolk anyway.



""I just needed to get away for a little while"" he said. ""And I felt so much positive energy from the guys here.

""Coach Jones has been great. He knows my family. He knew my father. He talked with me about his family's experience with his father who was also on a respirator.""

His favorite memory of his father was likely his first NBA game. ""It was something he had always dreamed about"" Jamal said. ""I didn't play much but when he embraced me after the game it meant so much.

""He didn't care about the game. It was just such a great moment for him to see his son in an NBA uniform.""

Jamal and Kieran haven't said a lot to each other. Mostly they've exchanged knowing nods. They don't need to speak. They know the pain they share.

""He made it clear to me and me to him that we're here for each other"" Kieran said.

""This sucks. it really sucks"" Kieran said. ""This has been a hard two weeks.





Kieran Donohue during ODU's victory over George Mason

""My brother was such a good guy. He was a people person and well-liked. People felt comfortable talking to him because he was genuine and he was caring.

""He would have been so good in this situation. He wouldn't sit around feeling sorry for himself so I'm not going to do that. He would do everything he can to help the family. I'm making a choice to do what he would have done.""

Those who know Kieran know he's a man of many words but he's also eloquent. His eulogy to his brother was 1101 words and a heartfelt beautiful tribute. It's attached below.

He choked up when I asked about the eulogy. ""That was my way of saying goodbye of telling my story of Tim that I think a lot of people could appreciate or relate to not the least of which is my parents.""

A few lines from the eulogy were especially touching.

Timmy D was my older brother.

He was my idol

He was my hero.

I wanted to be just like him.

He believed in me.

He had faith in me.

He had such confidence in me.

He was so proud of me that it inspired me.

He taught me how to be my own man.

He encouraged me to chase my dream.

I wouldn't be where I am without him.

I am so thankful that he was my brother.

KIERAN DONAHUE'S FULL EULOGY OF HIS BROTHER



On behalf of Susan Brendan and Kevin and on behalf of the Donohue and Tomberlin families I want to thank everyone for their tremendous outpouring of support and attendance here today to help us mourn the passing of and celebrate the life of Tim.



We would also like to take this opportunity to extend a special thank you to Katy and staff at McLean Funeral Home and Father Paul and Chrissy from here at Queen of the Apostles for all of your support patience and guidance during this week. We are forever grateful.







Timothy Kevin Donohue was born on October 15th 1971 in Bronxville New York fulfilling a young couple's dream becoming the first child of Joan and Kevin Donohue. They lived in an apartment on University Avenue in the Bronx and for a time they were joined by cousin Maura from California. At age 3 Joan and Kevin fulfilled another dream and the Donohues moved in to a big house in the suburbs 58 Bronxville Road a house that Joan and Kevin would make a glorious home in for the next 48 years. At age 4 Tim became a big brother when I was born.



Tim attended our local parish school Saint Joseph's in Bronxville for kindergarten through 8th grade where he was an altar boy a cub scout and played basketball. In those years he also started playing for the famed Riverside Church Hawks club basketball team where he was fortunate to be teammates with some truly outstanding players including a few who went on to play in the NBA.



From the day after school ended to the day before school started back up magical summers were spent down the shore at the beach house on D Street and Island Avenue in Seaside Park with the Lavelle side of the family. Never before have 2 dudes spent so much time in the ocean and still not be able to surf but somehow and very regrettably for both of us neither Tim nor I were ever good at that. Nevertheless those summers were truly amazing.



He attended Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains NY where he played basketball and was on what I believe was Stepinac's first ever lacrosse team. There was all the typical high school stuff - high school sports young love some really bad fashion choices some even worse haircuts and what was very typical if you went to high school in Westchester in the 80's and 90's more than a few nights spent on North Avenue.



Tim then moved south to Durham and lived for a year with his aunt and uncle Big Hugh and Mary Donohue and cousin Catherine. He worked at the 4 Corners while the big fella – his uncle - worked his magic as only he could to help fulfill a dream and the other big fella – the big man upstairs – worked his magic as only he does to answer a prayer and one of Tim's dreams came true and he enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It's safe to say that Tim got quite an education there at Carolina. He loved Chapel Hill so much that he graciously extended his undergraduate stay a few years and almost pulled off the rare feat of staying in college forever.

After graduating I repeat after graduating he returned to New York for a few years to start his corporate career before the light blue pull of the Tar Heel state was too much and he returned to Carolina eventually settling here in Lowell. He called Lowell home for over 20 years worked for Kimbrell's for over 17 years and it is here in Lowell where he met his wife Susan.



Another dream was fulfilled and together Tim and Susan were raising the greatest joys of their lives

their sons

17 year-old Brendan and 14 year-old Kevin.





On December 10 2022 at the far too young age of 51 Timothy Kevin Donohue quite unexpectedly passed away.

May he rest in peace.





Timmy D was my older brother.

He was my idol.

He was my hero.

I wanted to be just like him.

He was fun.

He was popular.

I'm not sure if cool is the right word but he was something

he had something

that thing that other people enjoyed being around.



I followed him around wherever I could

or more accurately wherever he let me.

I was his shadow but he never let me stay in his shadow.

He didn't hide anything from me.

He showed me both paths … he let me take a good look…

He knew what was best for me when sometimes I didn't or worse when sometimes I was too arrogant to admit it.

And sometimes he nudged gently sometimes he pushed harder but he made sure I walked my path.





He believed in me.

He had faith in me.

He had such confidence in me.

He was so proud of me that it inspired me.

He taught me how to be my own man.

He encouraged me to chase my dream.

I wouldn't be where I am in so many aspects of my life without him.



I am so thankful that he was my brother.



I am so proud of him





To borrow a line from Timmy D's very good friend John Fichthorn who said at Tim and Susan's wedding



While some people collect items and others collect wealth Timmy D collected friends.



Timmy D had a big heart and a fun-loving spirit

He had a generous disposition and he had kindness in spades

He had a slightly crooked smile and he wore it often

He had a really big heart

His loyalty knew no end.



He was a friend. A really really good friend.

He was a good dude.

He was a damn fine man.

He was a loving son.

He was an amazing brother.

I think he was an excellent husband.

I know he was a tremendous father.





Tim was a man who easily found the good in all people and things and nothing made him happier or prouder than his boys Brendan and Kevin.



His love for you two had no end

It has no end

It just now has new ways of being shared with you.



Like his father before him Tim did what he could all that he could for his sons.



He was a man born to be a father.



He was a son raised to be a great husband.



He was a brother to only one yet a brother to many.



He will be irreplaceable and forever loved.

After reaching out to dozens of schools the all-state and all-region sprinter fell in love with Ferrum College.

“I spent the whole fall of my senior year through December just reaching out to schools” Hamm said in a recent phone interview. “And I went to my first visit at Ferrum and I just fell in love immediately. The team was so welcoming the coaches just truly understood me on a level that my high school coach understood me. I just fell in love right there.”

Hamm’s good friend fellow PCHS senior at the time Kevin Nester was in a similar predicament looking for a school where he could play tennis. Hamm told Nester the 2021 Piedmont District singles champion to get in touch with the coaches at Ferrum.

“I just wanted the opportunity play the sport that I fell in love with in high school at the college level” Nester said. “I had some offers from different schools some in the ODAC some in other conferences but really ultimately what happened with me going to Ferrum was Michael. He got me in touch with Coach (Rod) Baker at Ferrum and I had a meeting with him (Baker) and he actually called me that night and I had a visit the next day. So everything just kind of worked out.”

“I was just nervous meeting people at the moment and Kevin was like ‘I don’t have anywhere to go’ and I was just like ‘Well come with me. I know you you know me it’ll make it a lot easier for both of us’” Hamm added.

Two years later Nester and Hamm are in their second year as roommates at Ferrum and have only strengthened their friendship through working through college and collegiate athletics together.

As a freshman last spring Nester finished runner-up in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference Rookie of the Year award voting and was the winningest player on Ferrum’s men’s tennis team. This fall he and his doubles partner won an invitational tournament at Mary Baldwin College.

Hamm broke a Ferrum indoor track record in the 400-meter-dash and medaled in both the 400 at the ODAC Indoor Track championship and the 200-meter-dash at the ODAC Outdoor Track championship earning All-Conference honors in both.

Both former Cougars found a lot of success early in their college careers. It wasn’t an easy transition from high school to college but they found having each other made the move easier especially when they were going through slumps or tough times mentally.

The two will often do workouts with each other to push one another and let their friend know they’re not alone.

“The biggest thing for me and I’ve told Michael this a thousand times was me and him rooming together” Nester said. “Even though we played two different sports we’re basically teammates to each other. We push each other to do workouts with each other to be better.

“That’s how we were in high school. We wanted to be the best that we could and that translated to us being roommates and being athletes at Ferrum too.”

“Just keeping each other positive letting each other know we’re here for each other” Hamm said.

Both athletes have taken a bit of Patrick County with them to Ferrum but they’re also still very much attached to their hometown. They continue to follow Cougars athletics closely and still keep up with their old coaches and teammates.

Last spring Nester would often go to PCHS tennis practices on his days off and Cougars coach Andrew Terry would let him do some student-coaching.

“It allows you to build bonds with the team that’s still there so that they know you’re there for them” Nester said. “Because you’ve been there before and just to let them see that they can do it they can see a positive influence.”

Hamm and Nester have big goals for the rest of their college careers. Hamm said he wants to keep breaking records but more than anything he wants to win a conference championship.

Both athletes said they have finite goals but they also want to continue to represent Patrick County in a positive way.

“We don’t really see that many athletes go represent at the next level from Patrick County and I just want to represent my high school well” Hamm said.

“I think me and Mike have built really really strong legacies for ourselves here but we can do a lot with triple that amount of time left” Nester said. “I think it’s big to represent where you’re from… Even the ones that do don’t get the credit that they deserve so just to be able to have your name out there and show we’re a small school but we can do that.”

Both athletes had a message for young athletes in Patrick County who would like to emulate their careers and their friendships in the future.

“The biggest message I would have is that no matter what you think... if you think that people aren’t watching there’s going to be people that are watching and you can get your name out there no matter what sport it is” Nester said. “But especially track and tennis those are really good opportunities. Even as small as Patrick County is I think me and Michael are a really good examples of that.”

“Just let them know that no matter who you are or what you do athletically you can achieve any dream you have” Hamm added. “You’ve just got to really push it because it’s hard to get your name out in that area but if you put all your time and effort in it’ll pay off.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2V0aGFuLWRvd25zLXJlZ2dpZS1ncmltZXMtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWRlYy0xOS1va2xhaG9tYS1zb29uZXJzLWZvb3RiYWxsLWNoZWV6LWl0LWJvd2wtMjAxMzM5Nzk3L9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2V0aGFuLWRvd25zLXJlZ2dpZS1ncmltZXMtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWRlYy0xOS1va2xhaG9tYS1zb29uZXJzLWZvb3RiYWxsLWNoZWV6LWl0LWJvd2wtMjAxMzM5Nzk3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,D-linemen Ethan Downs Reggie Grimes preview matchup with Florida State's O-line,"NORMAN Okla. — The Sooners' defensive line will have quite the challenge ahead of them facing the Florida State offensive line and the entire offensive unit as a whole. Clearly they'll have to be up to the task.



This week D-linemen Ethan Downs and Reggie Grimes talked about just that. OUInsider.com brings you the discussion.

(Follow all things Sooners -- take five seconds to sign up for our FREE Sooners newsletter now!)

Downs:

How things change on the defensive line without the guys that have opted out and/or transferred: “Yeah both. More rotations because guys get winded. But yeah younger guys started stepping in that role since we’ve had some guys opt out to the draft. And it’s awesome to have that growth. Even right now that late in the season to see that maturity finally hit peak when it needs to in our last game yeah it’s really nice.”

If there are any specific young guys he thinks might make an impression: “Yeah Gracen Halton. He’s a beast. He’s super fast super strong. And man he's just got a motor that never stops. He’s a huge energy ball. I mean if you talk to him a little bit he's all about it. R Mason R Mason Thomas he is the fastest D-end we’ve got the most athletic D-end we’ve got. He can bend super flexible. He’s smart with the game. Both of our young guys especially them two are top tier been on the radar for a lot of people.”

If he got his living situation figured out: “I did. I did. I actually moved in very near Barry Switzer right next to him. Yeah it’s awesome.”

If he’s told Switzer he’s coming over: “I need to. That house is amazing. Yeah it's kind of behind off hidden behind the campus. And it’s really cool.”

What it would do for them to end the season on a high note: “I’d say it’d set us up great for Team 129. Not looking too far ahead though. We’ve got to control today and what we can do today. So our ultimate goal is to win that game and to prove everybody wrong and to give motivation inspiration to Sooner fans and people all around the world who count out somebody who's gone through the rough of it and overcome the adversity when everybody's bet against them. And persevered and really really been at their best when they needed to. So that’s what it means for us. [It’s] more than just a win more than just being 7-6 because it looks a lot better than 6-7. But [it’s] really meeting one of our team goals one of the last ones coming out with a bang and sending out the seniors here with a win.”

On the rallying cry that people are counting them out: “Yeah. We love it too. We’re feeding off of it. Not that we needed a fire or not that we needed any fuel to grow a fire but it definitely contributed to how hard we’re working. And we’ve got something to prove. We’ve got something to prove to a lot of people. And we’re fired up to do that.”

What the biggest challenge is facing Florida State: “Their quarterback [Jordan Travis] is super talented. Their O-line has a lot of accolades for how well they're doing this year. And it’ll probably be the most one of the most talented offenses we've seen all year. And just watching the film man that quarterback he can see a lot does a lot. He’s got a lot of praise. People are saying a lot of praise about him. So it’ll be a good challenge for us to be more disciplined to be at our peak performance and all-out. But as hard as it's going to be as hard as practices are right now we’ve got to learn to have fun with it. It’s definitely way too hard to not have fun.”

If the unexpected is a fun part of the bowl experience: ""I would say the fun is with each other. You know when we're doing stuff playing at our best and straining across the field in practice that’s when the fun comes in. When we put everything on the line the gas tank is running out in practice and we’re making plays on low fuel that’s when the fun starts happening.”

Grimes:

What he sees out of Florida State: “Fundamentally they’re great. Technique-wise they’re great. And then they play really really hard.”

What discipline looks like for them offensively and what he means by that: “Just the little things. So like are they taking the right steps? Are they taking false steps? How like they run their routes how they block you how they don't block you some of their schemes some of their concepts stuff like that.”

How he enjoys hosting recruits: “I love it. I mean honestly it’s time to connect with another group of guys that you want to come here. And I'm like well I had a player [that] committed here so it's a chance to connect with some of the guys who are gonna be in your locker room next year. I had [another key player] a few weeks ago a kid from my area. So you’ve got guys who you're reconnecting with as far as that's concerned. But man I love it.”

If he enjoys being a spokesman for the program: “Yeah absolutely. I mean again I haven’t [shied away from the truth]. Like I'll tell them how it is. I have nothing to hide from anyone. You know what I mean? If we want you here that they're putting you with me that means we want you here. So I take you out have a good time and kind of show you why Oklahoma is Oklahoma why we are the way that we are.”"

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Contract chipmaker Hua Hong Semiconductor has long played second fiddle to China’s national champion Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp in their home base of Shanghai but US restrictions on advanced technology and Beijing’s yearning for chip self-sufficiency have thrust it into the spotlight.

Already listed in Hong Kong China’s second-largest chip foundry received regulatory approval last month for a $2.5bn secondary listing in Shanghai on the tech-centric Star Market. Most of the funds to be raised are intended for upgrading and expanding its production facilities.

Hua Hong’s lack of cutting-edge technology has proved a boon rather than a handicap of late. During its third-quarter earnings call in November the company said it had been barely affected by the actions of the US as the chips it produces are several generations older than the latest microprocessors.

Industry experts said China had to re-evaluate its domestic semiconductor supply chain after Washington imposed curbs on the development of high-performance chips. Hua Hong’s focus on older chips could make it Beijing’s new favourite with the benefits of policy support and funding to follow.

“Our years of pushing for localising advanced chip production had almost reached a dead end” said a Shanghai-based government official who did not wish to be named. “The vulnerability of the localised semiconductor supply chain has been exposed by the latest restrictions on us accessing crucial US equipment.”

Washington introduced a series of sweeping restrictions in October which have barred US companies from exporting technology for producing chips with features smaller than 14 nanometres or 16nm in some cases. This made it much harder for leading producer SMIC to catch up with the advanced factories or “fabs” of competitors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Hua Hong told the Financial Times it had “always been in full compliance on rules and regulations with respect to export control” and would continue to try to attract investors domestically and globally because of the large capital expenditure required for capacity expansion.

Compared with SMIC Hua Hong has adopted a different strategy of optimising its manufacturing techniques for the mature “nodes” or generations of its less-miniaturised chips in order to maximise the performance and reliability of its products. They have found wide use in the Internet of Things 5G telecoms equipment and electric vehicle markets.

“Just try to squeeze the most juice out of the mature nodes” said Douglas Fuller an expert in China’s semiconductor industry at Copenhagen Business School. “That’s a sustainable path now when we count all the subsidies and the rate of return to society.”

Hua Hong’s older processes also provide an opportunity for less advanced Chinese chip equipment makers to test and improve their products by supplying its production lines and replacing foreign tools that may become restricted.

“For Chinese equipment manufacturers replacing imported equipment on Hua Hong’s mature process lines is more easily achieved” said William Li a Taiwan-based analyst at research firm Counterpoint.

Hua Hong has also acted to localise its suppliers in areas such as equipment and materials according to three people familiar with the matter. In addition it is giving domestic customers higher priority.

In 2022 the chipmaker cut orders several times from foreign customers in order to prioritise domestic companies as its production capacity became overstretched according to four Hua Hong employees who did not wish to be named.

Hua Hong’s products for original equipment manufacturers are increasingly competing with Germany’s Infineon and Texas Instruments of the US.

“Many Chinese customers have replaced imported modules with homegrown ones since geopolitical tensions escalated” said an executive from a power module company in the southern hub of Shenzhen. “So we are partnering with Hua Hong to pick up as many orders as possible.”

The executive who preferred to remain anonymous said Chinese manufacturers such as Hua Hong and SMIC were more co-operative and “more willing to come down in price” for the struggling chip market.

According to the Shanghai government official one way to encourage core industry players to concentrate on basic chips was to accelerate the process for Hua Hong’s secondary listing. Almost 70 per cent of funds raised will be invested in its only 12-inch (300mm) wafer fab in the eastern city of Wuxi according to its prospectus.

A government adviser working with fabs across China who did not wish to be named said Hua Hong had been underrated in the past by industrial policymakers. It was seen as taking a less proactive role in research and development.

When the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund restructured its investment portfolio in 2021 it chose to divest Hua Hong shares. However it returned in June with a $232mn investment.

Strong demand in its home market meant Hua Hong’s third-quarter results stood out among its foundry peers. Quarterly revenues grew 40 per cent year on year to $630mn while net profits doubled to $104mn compared with the same period a year earlier.

Analysts at Jefferies investment bank said the growth in capacity at the Wuxi fab would increase Hua Hong’s momentum earning it more orders from local chip design houses.

“Hua Hong will be a strong force driving the domestic chip supply chain’s growth” said the government adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2gtdHJlbmRzL2FydGljbGUvMzIwNDQ3MS9qYXBhbi1sYXdtYWtlci1zYXlzLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItZ2lhbnQtdHNtYy1jb25zaWRlcmluZy1zZWNvbmQtcGxhbnQtY291bnRyedIBgwFodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2gtdHJlbmRzL2FydGljbGUvMzIwNDQ3MS9qYXBhbi1sYXdtYWtlci1zYXlzLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItZ2lhbnQtdHNtYy1jb25zaWRlcmluZy1zZWNvbmQtcGxhbnQtY291bnRyeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japan lawmaker says TSMC is mulling second chip plant in the country,"“I believe TSMC is looking into further investments in Japan. We need to create an environment that would make them think they want to do advanced projects with us” Seki told Reuters in an interview.

Yoshihiro Seki secretary general of a ruling party lawmakers’ group on chip industry strategy also urged that Japan’s government which has pledged to provide up to 476 billion yen (US$3.6 billion) in subsidies for the first TSMC plant provide a favourable environment for investment.

A senior Japanese lawmaker said on Friday that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC)  the world’s largest contract chip maker is considering building a second plant in Japan in addition to an US$8.6 billion dollar facility now under construction.

TSMC said in an emailed statement that it did not rule out any possibility for Japan but there were no concrete plans at the moment.

The Taiwanese company is building a chip plant in southern Japan  with Sony Group Corp and auto parts maker Denso Corp each taking a minority stake. Production is due to start in late 2024.

TSMC is also investing US$40 billion in a US chip-making plant in Arizona  and according to the Financial Times the company is in advanced talks with suppliers about possibly setting up its first European plant in a move to diversify its production base and address global demand for semiconductors.

Seki’s group within Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party is advocating for the country to strengthen its semiconductor industry which has fallen to less than a 10 per cent share of the global market by revenue from more than half in the late 1980s.

“Technological innovation is fierce in the semiconductor industry” Seki said.

“We cannot be successful unless the public and private sectors act as one unified body.”

In a policy speech in October Prime Minister Fumio Kishida positioned semiconductors as pivotal to Japan’s economic security and pledged to funnel public and private investments into the industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbW9kZXJuZGlwbG9tYWN5LmV1LzIwMjIvMTIvMjUvdGhlLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItaW5kdXN0cnktYW5kLWl0cy1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Semiconductor Industry and its future,"Since the Covid19 outbreak and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war many industrialised and developing nations have understood the significance of supply chains and the risks they provide. This has been seen in the situations of numerous items such as food and oil whose supply was affected by the Russia-Ukraine war; it is now especially evident in the case of semiconductors.

Every nation whether developed or developing requires semiconductors since they are utilised in every electronic device and in a range of areas including medical healthcare defence renewable energy initiatives and a number of upcoming projects such as quantum computing. The leaders in the semiconductors race on the worldwide market are the United States whose 2020 market share was valued at over $200 billion. The United States has been a pioneer in the export of semiconductors commanding about 50 percent of the worldwide market. Semiconductors are one of the top export goods of the United States. Additionally the United States invests more than one-fifth of their sales on research and development placing them second only to the pharmaceutical business. China is another nation that is emerging as a major participant in the semiconductor race since it has been making rapid progress in this arena. China’s semiconductor industry has been growing since 2015 when it accounted for only 3.8% of the global supply race. However in the last 5 years China’s semiconductor industry has grown from a mere $!3billion in 2015 to an annual growth rate of $40 billion market industry and China now stands 1% behind Europe and Japan in the semiconductor race as China’s semiconductor industry accounts for 9% today and the Europe’s and Japan’s annual percentage growth rates are 2% and 3% respectively. China has already eclipsed Taiwan in the semiconductor business during the previous two years. If China’s semiconductor industry continues to develop at the same rate its annual sales might reach $114 billion by 2024 placing it just behind the United States and South Korea.

India’s future with Semiconductors

India’s current semiconductor facilities are the Gallium Arsenide Enabling Technology Centre (GAETEC) and the Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL) but all this could change as India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has addressed at the Indian Mobile Congress which helped in highlighting India’s scope and ambitions with the future technology which India t is developing. The government has begun to recognise the importance of semiconductors and how a domestic semiconductor industry could enable India to reduce its dependence on the giants of the Semiconductor industry and increase the ‘Atmanhirbar Plan’ of India. The Prime Minister of India aspires to make India a leader in cutting-edge technology and semiconductors are a key component in achieving this objective. The United States has long sought to isolate its essential technology supply chains from China; India can provide an assist in this endeavour. In this cooperation India is projected to contribute a total of $20 billion which may help India become a superpower and compete with nations like China and European markets in the chip race. Many countries not just the United States are adopting a “China Plus One” strategy to reduce their reliance on China and shift their markets to “like-minded countries” such as India. Many private companies such as Tata and Adana have also pledged multi-million dollar investments in this project which can help India’s semiconductor industry grow at a projected rate of $64 billion by 2026 representing a 19% annual growth rate. As India has been relatively weak in this sector as India’s imports of semiconductors inputs reached $21 billion in 2019 and that figure has been rising rapidly each year the recent semiconductor manufacturing incentives offered by the government of India will also help the Indian economy as many American companies will expand their capacities in India and this will help in building the right supply chains worldwide and this will also help industries in India. This will also contribute to the growth of the Indian economy.

Conclusion

While all of this is true and will help India in the long run and increase its presence on the global market India must not forget that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. India must also keep in mind that chip manufacturing requires a great deal of raw materials and that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. The India-United States cooperation cannot be viewed as restrictive to any particular field and with the rapidly changing geopolitical situation it is important to remember that China which is a producer of electronics is also a consumer and that one must observe how the semiconductor and high-end chip industries continue and how demand develops.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZWFzdGFzaWFmb3J1bS5vcmcvMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9iZWlqaW5nLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tYW5kLXRoZS1hcnQtb2YtY2hpcC13YXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beijing Washington and the art of chip war,"Former US president Donald Trump ramped up the trade war with China. Trump’s policy was quickly labelled a failed attempt to get ahead in the race for technology supremacy — especially in semiconductors — since it was divorced from economic reality. Yet the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a shortage of semiconductors which escalated the chip war and technological decoupling. This divergence — and the tension accompanying it — has only grown.

The US–China chip war did not begin with Trump. Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech in 2015 where he pointed out that the global governance system was reaching a turning point in history. His speech signalled Beijing’s intention to engage more with international affairs through projects like the Belt and Road Initiative. In 2021 Xi stepped up his rhetoric remarking on several occasions that ‘the east is rising while the west is declining’.

Washington’s intervention in the global semiconductor market has become more antagonistic under the Biden administration. According to a White House report in June 2021 US chipmakers are highly dependent on sales to China for continued profit growth and domestic research and development (R&D) investment. Despite this interdependence Biden’s policy change on 7 October 2022 strictly curtailed cross-national semiconductor industry talent flows to China.

Both US and Chinese reports raise concerns about the other’s relative abilities in key technologies and make the case for greater state support to help boost national standing. For example in a September 2022 report the congressionally-mandated National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) warns that in microelectronics ‘98 per cent of the chips the Pentagon needs are now built assembled or packaged in the PRC’s shadow’.

Equal but opposite sounds were made by the Institute of International and Strategic Studies (IISS) in a report that warns US–China decoupling may harm both economies with China paying a higher price than the United States. It went on to say the decoupling could bottleneck China’s efforts to develop chip manufacturing artificial intelligence and Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

For the United States this interplay between national security and techno-nationalism has led to Washington blocking China from purchasing high-end chips used in advanced AI calculations and supercomputing. The US restrictions aim to hinder Beijing from achieving its goal of meeting 70 per cent of its semiconductor demand with domestic production by 2030. These restrictions could indeed undermine China’s ambition to transform the country into a technological powerhouse.

Yet Biden’s restrictions may not cripple China’s silicon R&D ambitions. Instead these restrictions will likely accelerate the rise of techno-nationalism in China and its self-sufficiency drive in the semiconductor industry. China’s chip self-reliance is boosted by the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund and the 14th Five-Year Plan released in 2021.

While US policy strives to slow China’s technological rise the semiconductor shortage has caused automotive and consumer electronics manufacturers to lament the unavailability of generic products above 10 nanometres (nm). Chips with mature processes — including 28 nm 40 nm and others that China produces — have higher market demand than more advanced ones (the larger the nanometre number the lower the technical threshold). In response Chinese foundries are expanding mature process technologies of 28 nm and above.

Some speculate as to whether China will retaliate. Whether Joe Biden Ron DeSantis or even Donald Trump is in the White House after 2024 US policy that focusses on undermining China’s advance to the frontier of semiconductor technology faces two challenges.

First Washington is motivating massive strategic investment and mobilisation of resources within China. In the end this could accelerate rather than slow any move towards the technology frontier. China has been heading towards civil–military integration and developing dual-use technologies. The US restrictions may motivate China to set higher security levels for its military chip technology R&D thereby boosting the military–industrial complex.

Second restrictions are instigating Chinese founders to invest in meeting the global market where it is now at 28 nm and above. With a worldwide chip glut and the Biden administration’s sanctions Chinese industrialists see an opportunity for domestic firms to return to more steady-state market valuations.

( SKC Co.)

SKC Co. a chemical materials unit of SK Group said Sunday it will present a range of key products including a semiconductor glass substrate battery-grade copper foil and bioplastics at an upcoming US tech exhibition next week.

The glass substrate considered a ""game changer"" in semiconductor packaging will be unveiled to the public for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show due to take place in Las Vegas from Jan. 5-8 SKC said.

SKC is investing up to $600 million to build a glass substrate production facility in the US state of Georgia.

A glass substrate refers to a thin layer of glass on which chips can be mounted together to build the brains of the advanced computing system. It takes up less space compared with plastic or silicon-based substrates allowing the chipsets to significantly improve performance and energy efficiency.

SKC's US subsidiary Absolics Inc. aims to become the first in the industry to mass produce the key material.

Copper foil a key anode component in lithium-ion battery cells used in electric vehicles will be on display. The foil-making unit SK Nexilis touts the technology will produce copper foil 4 micrometers thick -- about one-thirtieth the thickness of a human hair -- 1.4 meters wide and 77 kilometers in length: the world's thinnest widest and longest according to SKC.

Silicon anode material an emerging EV battery component that enhances mileage and battery recharging speeds will be exhibited at this year's show. SKC has invested in British battery materials maker Nexeon for collaboration in silicon anodes.

SKC will also join a ""food truck"" event to be hosted by an SK affiliate which will serve alternative foods such as plant-based milk and alternative meat on plastic plates with cutlery made from SKC's biodegradable polymer. (Yonhap)"

By early Saturday the crisis was over and the request was lifted.

""No one lost heat on that really cold day"" said Brendan Conway a spokesman for We Energies. ""All of our customers kept their service up the whole time.""

But the drama played out through the frigid evening Friday and early-morning hours Saturday as temperatures plunged to below-zero wind chills.

""We say we're hardy in Wisconsin but you should always be ready for extreme weather conditions"" said Tom Content executive director of Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin the statewide consumer advocate for residential and business utility customers.

He said it ""may be important to do a deep dive analysis"" on the events that led to the request for customers to cut back their natural gas usage.

Problems began Friday when We Energies' largest natural gas provider Guardian pipeline a subsidiary of Oklahoma-based ONEOK had an equipment failure.

""Guardian experienced two valve malfunctions at its Sycamore compressor station in DeKalb County Illinois which resulted in reduced capacity on our system"" Brad Borror of ONEOK said in an email statement.

""Our crews are focused on resolving the issue and restoring capacity in a timely manner. One valve has been restored to service and we continue working on the second"" he added.

Guardian reduced the amount of fuel it sends by 30%. Conway said leading to a 25% reduction in natural gas supplies across We Energies' system that serves 1.1 million natural gas customers.

We Energies kicked in emergency procedures including reaching out to other natural gas providers.

The company has large businesses and industrial customers who are on a so-called curtailable rate meaning they were able to reduce their load.

Conway said the company also began ""reaching out to our largest business customers and asking them to reduce"" their usage.

""But as we looked in the evening as large business customers did come down we still had a gap between where we were and what we needed to be as we looked at the forecast"" Conway said. ""Natural gas usage was high. It was hard to get other natural gas into the system.""

At 6:15 p.m. Friday the company requested that customers reduce natural gas usage. By 11 p.m. the company issued a statement that the system had ""stabilized.""

Finally at 6:21 a.m. Saturday the company said in a statement that it had lifted the request for customers to reduce natural gas use.

""The good news is all of those efforts together worked"" Conway said. ""The system stabilized.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3Mvd2UtZW5lcmdpZXMtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWxpZnRlZNIBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3Mvd2UtZW5lcmdpZXMtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWxpZnRlZC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We Energies: Natural gas restrictions lifted after pipeline problem,"We Energies on Saturday Dec. 24 said customers no longer have to reduce their natural gas use after a pipeline experienced an equipment failure on Friday.

According to a news release the amount of natural gas being delivered into Wisconsin is back to levels that should meet all customers’ needs. Therefore We Energies no longer needs customers to reduce their natural gas use.

""The fear was customers could lose their heat"" said Alison Trouy We Energies spokesperson ""so We Energies made an unprecedented plea Friday night: For people to lower their thermostats to reduce natural gas use.""

One of We Energies' natural gas suppliers experienced a significant equipment failure with its interstate pipeline network in DeKalb County Illinois. Two valves malfunctioned one of which was fixed Friday night. The natural gas supplier ONEOK said crews were working on the second valve Friday night.

""We’ve got analysts experts in this who have been monitoring the demand and the supply levels all night long"" said Trouy. ""Once we got to the point where there were no issues – it’s a little bit warmer today it’s a holiday – so there isn’t as much natural gas use.""

We Energies

We Energies said the problem reduced the amount of fuel committed to the state by 30%. The utility asked people to turn down the thermostat to 60 to 62 degrees to prevent problems. In a news release the utility said the move would allow customers to stay safe warm and help avoid a significant natural gas outage.

The impacted pipeline was one of multiple sources We Energies uses to receive natural gas. On a typical day an issue like what happened would not require customers to reduce their usage. However with the extreme cold We Energies said it was unable to receive additional natural gas from its other pipeline suppliers.

We Energies took numerous steps to reduce demand for natural gas the release said including drawing from its liquefied natural gas and propane storage facilities and reducing natural gas to business customers who have agreed to special billing in these types of events.",,,,,,,,,

Bank of Israel governor Amir Yaron and Supervisor of Banks Yair Avidan said in a statement that following the completion of the review and inspection process the central bank chief is ready to issue a banking license and control permit for the new lender called Esh Bank Israel Ltd.

The approval is the second license in three years that the Bank of Israel has approved the establishment of a new bank in an effort to boost competition in the highly concentrated banking sector dominated by five banks.

Esh will be digital will have no physical branches and will focus on banking services for households and small businesses including providing credit receiving and managing deposits and current accounts and providing advanced payment services. Former head of the Israel Securities Authority Prof. Shmuel Hauser will serve as the chairman of the new digital bank.

Zuk a former engineer at Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies set up the competing Santa Clara California-based Palo Alto Networks in 2005. Other members of the founding group of entrepreneurs of the digital bank initiative include businessman Yuval Aloni and Kobi Malkin a former CEO of Bank Massad who will serve as CEO of Esh.

“We see great importance in the entry of banks and additional new players into the banking system in Israel so that they contribute to increasing competition and innovation in the financial system” stated Yaron. “It is evident that the group of entrepreneurs is diverse and brings with it strengths in various fields including entrepreneurs with international technological and business experience.”

Passing the initial regulatory hurdle and the receipt of the control permit will allow the group of entrepreneurs establishing the digital bank to move forward with the mechanical operational and regulatory preparations required for the start of the bank’s operations. This will include testing phases of the new technology completing the recruitment of the management team and hiring additional bank staff. The establishment process is expected to take about a one-and-a-half years the central bank said.

“We have a long way to go” said Hauser. “The uniqueness of our bank is the synergy between technology and banking.”

Hauser announced that the “groundbreaking” Israeli technology will allow for extraordinary operational efficiency that will be rolled out directly to customers.

“This will be reflected in attractive interest rates banking services without commissions without subscription fees and without preconditions such as salary transfer” he remarked.

The new bank will be supervised by the Bank of Israel’s supervisor of banks to ensure its stability and to safeguard its depositors’ funds similar to the oversight of other banks in Israel. Like every other bank in Israel the new lender will have access to all of the Bank of Israel’s monetary instruments.

Esh follows in the heels of the first fully digital bank One Zero Digital Bank Ltd. set up by tech entrepreneur Amnon Shashua the nation’s first new bank in more than 40 years. Last year the lender received final regulatory approval after being granted a banking license from the Bank of Israel in 2019 in a bid to inject competition into the sector. Shashua is also the founder of autonomous driving systems company Mobileye (an Intel subsidiary).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTEyLTI1L3BhbG8tYWx0by1zLXp1ay1nZXRzLWdvLWFoZWFkLXRvLWZvdW5kLW5ldy1pc3JhZWxpLWRpZ2l0YWwtYmFua9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palo Alto's Zuk Gets Go-Ahead to Found New Israeli Digital Bank,"Why did this happen?

The new digital bank which will be called Esh will offer current accounts to private business and corporate customers and the self-employed. The bank will provide deposit accounts loans payments and credit cards. According to the business plan presented to the Supervisor of Banks Esh will set up a bank without physical branches based on innovative technology that it is developing itself focusing on the provision of banking services.

The consortium led by Zuk is required by the Bank of Israel to hold at least $50 million in equity. Other members of the founding group include former Israel securities Authority chairman Shmuel Hauser businessman Yuval Aloni and Kobi Malkin the former CEO of Bank Massad and Bank Otsar Hahayal who will serve as Esh's CEO.

Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron today gave the representatives of the new digital bank a conditional license to establish a bank and the permits to control it. The Governor also granted a holding permit in the bank to Prof. Shmuel Hauser who is expected to serve as the new bank's chairman. Receipt of the control permits and the conditional bank license awarded by the Governor and Supervisor of Banks Yair Avidan will allow the owners to move forward and complete the technical operational and regulatory preparations required to start the bank's operations. This will include completing the development and testing stages of the new technology completing the recruitment of the management team and the additional manpower required to establish the bank and build policies procedures and processes in its main areas of activity. The establishment period of the bank will last about 18 months and the process will be carried out in consultation with the licensing committee.

The Bank of Israel said that awarding the conditional license and permits was undertaken after a comprehensive and in-depth process carried out by the Supervisor of Banks over the last two years after examining the business plan submitted. This process included a fit and proper check investigating the honesty integrity and financial strength of the entrepreneurs and supporting them in the required regulatory preparation.

The new bank will be overseen by the Bank of Israel's Supervisor of Banks to ensure its stability and to safeguard depositors' money similar to the supervision of other banks in Israel. The new bank like any other bank in Israel will have access to all the liquidity tools of the Bank of Israel (monetary loans and monetary deposits). The new bank will also be able to manage an account at the Bank of Israel and connect to the various payment systems thus being able to provide all the retail services that banks provide to their customers.

""We will completely change the cost structure""

Businessman Yuval Aloni one of the founders of the new bank said ""Esh's first product will be current accounts. However our long-term plan is to build a variety of products including competitively priced loans. We built the bank in such a way that completely changes the cost structure and the money saved will be transparently passed on to customers. I can personally guarantee that there will be no account management fees we will not request the transfer of the existing account or the salary and that the following products will also include payments options and issuing international credit cards for households and businesses.

Last year the bank began raising funds from Israeli institutional bodies and according to market estimates they tried to raise funds at a valuation of about NIS 2 billion. Since then there have been falls in global capital markets inflation has soared and interest rates in Israel and around the world have risen causing many investors to tighten their belts and tighten the conditions for investments. Despite this the bank estimates that the full amount will be raised although probably at a lower amount than was initially planned but complying with requirements for obtaining a license.

Updated 25 Dec 2022

Water is a fundamental human right and access to clean and safe drinking water can change the lives of human beings for the better. However in this era of global water scarcity and stress getting clean drinking water at all is considered a blessing for most people especially in Pakistan.

Pakistan once had plentiful water resources but over the decades the numbers have dwindled. What remains in terms of freshwater for human use is also often contaminated. The impact of human activities like agriculture and industrial output has deeply compromised availability of clean and safe drinking water for everyday use in most communities across the country especially those that are underserved. Consuming water that is laced with contaminants keeps these underserved communities grappling with waterborne diseases which significantly reduces the quality of life.

The alarmingly high number of contaminated drinking water sources highlights the urgent need for testing and verifying of all drinking water sources followed by effective mitigation measures.

Lack of clean and safe drinking water affects children’s health

Historically in the day-to-day lives of people there are not many who choose to consider the issue at hand. According to UNICEF an estimated 70 percent of households still drink bacterially contaminated water. Life’s struggles keep most from trying to find permanent solutions on a larger scale. Boiling water is the most basic safety measure many end up adopting.

Access to safe and clean water is a priority for women

Still there are some within certain communities who have decided to do more than just hoping the problem resolves on its own. These people who deserve the title of ‘homegrown heroes’ are humble warriors in the quest for having their communities drink safe and clean water. Where many feared multiple challenges they saw an opportunity. Through their work in their communities and activism for the rights of community members they remained resilient and forthright. They stayed at the forefront of the struggle; when the project to access safe and clean water in their communities was initiated by PepsiCo Pakistan and WaterAid these people were ready to adapt change and champion the cause.

This is the heartwarming story of the heroes who never gave up on their commitment to get safe and clean water for their communities. Their dedication is especially for the children of their areas who suffer the most when it comes to water-borne diseases.

In their stories we find what happens when opportunity meets preparation.

Homegrown heroes in communities across Islamabad Karachi Lahore and Okara on a quest for safe and clean drinking water have found support

A partnership for the people for their future: Tangible social impact

The importance of water in every aspect of life is undeniable. The precious resource is critical to human dignity health and economic opportunity. As one of the world’s largest food and beverage companies PepsiCo has committed to putting sustainability at the heart of their business under their PepsiCo Positive or ‘pep+’ agenda. One of the most important causes they are focusing on when it comes to sustainability is water.

Whether it is water usage in agriculture clean water provision in communities they work in and with or sustainable water use and replenishment in the industry PepsiCo has made a global pledge to become ‘net water positive’ by 2030. Since 2006 the PepsiCo Foundation the philanthropic arm of the company has helped more than 68 million people across the world to gain access to safe water through distribution purification and conservation programs far surpassing the company’s original target to help 25 million people by 2025. Their aim to replenish more water than they use in their operations makes the company one of the most water-efficient food and beverage manufacturers. The same commitment to sustainable water usage is reflected in PepsiCo’s Pakistan business operations.

As a localised solution in the spirit of the global pledge to provide safe and equitable access to clean water PepsiCo Pakistan formed an alliance with WaterAid with the aim to provide ‘Access to Safe Water’ in underserved urban communities in Pak Colony Karachi Humak Islamabad and in Sultanke and Gulberg in Lahore. The funding for this ambitious project was provided by PepsiCo Foundation the philanthropic arm of the business.

The PepsiCo-WaterAid partnership in Pakistan focuses on providing safe water access in underserved communities and the schools within them to further ensure children are refreshed and hydrated to learn uninterrupted by diseases. In this regard PepsiCo Pakistan installed four community water filtration plants in Humak Islamabad and another one in Islamabad Model College for Girls Humak. One plant was installed in the local government dispensary in Humak while a seventh plant was rehabilitated and handed over to the community in Saidpur Village Islamabad. In Lahore four plants were rehabilitated and handed over to the relevant authorities and communities for their future operation and maintenance whereas on the other side of the country a mega plant in Pak Colony Karachi is operational and being managed by the community.

A rural extension of the program was initiated in early 2022 in Dipalpur district Okara in Punjab. The communities where this project is being implemented in its various forms were selected after thorough scouting community linkages through local partners field research and surveys.

The program design for these water filtration plants was rooted deep in community involvement and sensitisation for ultimate ownership by the people these plants served. For all management roles the community worked together to choose members from within the community who were made responsible for the operational tasks of the water supply schemes and empowered to maintain the system that is now running in a robust manner.

For all land electrical support and water required for these systems a partnership with Capital Development Authority in Islamabad was achieved through the resilience of the PepsiCo and WaterAid team members actively involved in this effort. All physical and technical infrastructure for these schemes was put in place with the support of local implementation partners who served as links to the community.

Over the course of its implementation the project has evolved significantly. With community insights and continuous needs assessment the project now includes community empowerment gender equity and dignity inclusion and health rights of children. An integral part of the program has been community sensitisation on hygiene water safety and water conservation.

However none of this would have been possible without homegrown heroes leading the charge for change in habits consumption and implementation of the project and this is where we meet some of them.

MEET DR. HUMERA SALEEM – A WOMAN ON A NOBLE MISSION IN SMALL SUBURBAN TOWN HUMAK IN ISLAMABAD

Dr. Humera Saleem is a genial woman who exudes confidence calm and resilience. A conscientious leader in her community Dr. Humera’s very presence brightens up any room she is in. She is the kind of person who has faced many struggles in life but they have only made her a more caring person who is sensitive to the needs of others.

Dr. Humera Saleem has worked on several initiatives for the betterment of her community especially for women and children

As a trained homeopathic doctor she is also a social activist who advocates for holistic healthcare solutions one of which is use of clean water use. In the small town of Humak Islamabad she trains local women on infant care does physiotherapy and heads her own women empowerment NGO named Anjuman Falah-e-Khawateen apart from being a champion of the cause of safe water for all. Her door is always open for members of her community who seek out her advice on matters of healthcare and their lives and by patiently engaging with all Dr. Humera remains a natural leader and beacon of hope for her community. Her decades old work within her community has made one thing very clear for her: while change may be tough it is needed to break age-old patterns and do better for future generations.

Therefore with her experience she was the right candidate to head the Women Water Users Committee that was formed with the consensus of the local community when a water filtration plant was set up in her area by PepsiCo and WaterAid built by a local implementing partner named MOJAZ Foundation.

Before the water filtration plant was set up in her area she would treat patients of all ages who suffered the effects of unsanitary water all the time. As a homeopathic doctor she could see that the polluted water was the cause of much of the health woes of the residents of her area. From diarrhea to hepatitis there was not an ailment they did not have to deal with. And children specifically were suffering the most.

With empathy and compassion Dr. Humera shaped her vision to change the circumstances of the people around her. When PepsiCo and WaterAid started installing water filtration plants in the area they included community leaders to ensure community awareness integration and ownership of the program. They found their greatest ally in Dr. Humera who used her status as a community leader to bring people on the same page. Together they came to a consensus about how the project would function in their community. This proved to be the perfect mix that had eluded the community in the past.

This is when change felt tangible and inevitable.

REASONS TO HOPE

The people of Humak had struggled with schemes to improve their circumstances that didn’t take off in the past. There had been several plans by various entities to alleviate water woes in the community but none had succeeded in creating a smart model that would survive on its own. However Dr. Humera persevered.

“When we had our first meeting people would not believe this (the water plant) would be installed” Dr. Humera says acknowledging the major trust deficit that existed within her community.

“They thought we would also pitch the project and disappear. But we called them for weekly meetings and we briefed them that your participation for the project is essential. Because once our agreement is over […] the water filtration plant will need to be handled by you (the community). Then we formed a committee of all women and I was the chairman of the committee.”

Dr. Humera knew the only way forward would be through unity among the community. The plant now benefits around 2000 people daily and has the capacity of filtering 2000 liters of water per hour.

According to her plan the committee will transparently collect funds from within the community to manage the operations to become self-sufficient in the years to come. This ingenious way of thinking and uniting the community has highlighted the fact that due to hard work and dedication of women like Dr. Humera and the women in her committee the future of their communities can become brighter and more prosperous.

WHY WOMEN ARE LEADING THE CHARGE ON SAFE WATER ACCESS

Through PepsiCo’s ‘Access to Safe Water’ program there is an overwhelming majority of women spearheading the charge for safe water availability in their communities. This is because as men work in places away from their homes it is the women who are the keepers of the community. They run their homes and are centered around their children’s wellbeing and other household chores that keep life running.

Understanding the local dynamics and this routine Dr. Humera knew she had to empower the women of the community to step out and help her build a plan where all women could run the water facility expand the community’s access to such a safe resource and take home enough water to run everyday operations smoothly.

The Women Water Users Committee is united for positive changes in their community

While talking about the inception of the project Dr. Humera candidly shared how she mobilised women of her locality to achieve this seemingly impossible task.

“We organized all women members on one platform” she proudly states. What became even more critical was the task of getting all women together under one platform spreading awareness about use and importance of filtered water and sharing the knowledge of how contaminated water impacts health.

Dr. Humera added “We explained to the community how we can keep disease at bay with use of safe and clean water and showed them how to safely transport water from the plant.”

The women of Humak have united to ensure the ‘Access to Safe Water’ program is run equitably for all in their community prioritizing children’s water needs

Dr. Humera’s efforts indicated the power of teamwork and unwavering unity. As for inclusion women along with men get equitable access to the clean water supply and their concerns are heard with compassion by community leaders who truly understand them. The women leaders hope their efforts would get all children of the community to lead safe and healthy lives keeping deadly diseases at bay.

Seeing how the women’s united front was creating a better life for the entire community the men were convinced of the worth of this work and the value of the women’s resilience and participation in it. A side-effect of change that was most welcome to all!

UNITY THROUGH DIVERSITY: HOW ONE INITIATIVE BECAME AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INCLUSION

Sufyan Saleem the son of Dr. Humera was born deaf and mute. Throughout his life he has faced many challenges. An artist at heart who loves to paint Sufyan’s world without sound is rich with his creative flair. But Sufyan went through many struggles in his life because society does not know how to deal with people who are “different”.

A naturally hardworking individual he was financially exploited by employers on many occasions but being the son of a path-breaking mother Sufyan remained resilient and broke free from such commitments. When he saw his mother giving her all to a voluntary project that would change the lives of people of their community he decided to help her and their community.

Sufyan’s inclusion in the monitoring of the newly installed water filtration plant showed the members of his community that someone who is “different” can still be a productive member of the society. Sufyan’s commitment to ensuring the water filtration operates smoothly made him into a homegrown hero in the eyes of his community members. He is especially dedicated to ensuring children of his community have access to clean and safe drinking water.

Supporting his mother in running the water filtration plant in their community has become a high point for Sufyan Saleem

His presence as a volunteer is a win for inclusion and equity in a community where otherwise children and people who are differently abled may have been overlooked. Now Sufyan’s presence serves as a reminder for all that every member of a community is valuable when it comes to inspiring change.

THE FUTURE OF PAKISTAN’S CHILDREN IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO THE WATER QUALITY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

Children in Pakistan face many challenges in their young lives and one of the most important ones is surviving while consuming water that may be contaminated. In underserved communities water is still the cause of dozens of different ailments that can severely deteriorate the quality of life and in worst cases can also prove to be life-threatening.

According to UNICEF 53000 Pakistani children under the age of five die annually from diarrhea due to poor water and sanitation. Children suffering from repeated episodes of diarrhea are likely to fall behind in school or drop out altogether. Furthermore it can also cause stunting that currently affects almost 44 percent of children in Pakistan.

This incredibly high number of contaminated drinking water sources highlights the urgent need for testing and verifying of all drinking water sources followed by effective mitigation measures. This was at the root of the project by PepsiCo and WaterAid when it was initiated in the communities.

AIMING FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE: Meet the young students and skilled teachers at Islamabad Model College for Girls Humak

Keeping the needs of the children at the forefront of the project one of the most critical installations of a water filtration plant by PepsiCo and WaterAid in Humak was at the Islamabad Model College for Girls.

During a field assessment by WaterAid the administration of Islamabad Model College for Girls reported to the social mobilisers of WaterAid that there was no proper source of clean and safe water on the campus. Girls attending school were at high risk of getting dehydrated or drinking poor quality water from potentially contaminated sources both of which would affect their health in different ways.

The young students had to bring bottled water from home which finished soon leaving them thirsty before the plant was installed

The principal Ms. Asiya Khan mentioned that children had to bring their own bottled water which would soon finish. She realised it wasn’t a practical solution in the long run. With the installation of the water filtration plant in their college premises that supplies clean and safe water to the school there is a marked improvement in the health of the children and there is no need to purchase water anymore.

Ms. Asiya Khan the principal of Islamabad Model College for Girls ensures the water filtration plant installed on campus runs efficiently and benefits all associated with the institution

“The water coming from the community [before] was not safe so they advised us not to use that but it wasn’t possible for us” reports Ms. Asiya. She says that all the children in her school needed safe water to drink and the plant’s installation resolved the issue. She added “With the help of this project the impact is that at least the water that the teachers and students are drinking now is safe after coming from the filtration plant. The family that lives in the school the maid who lives here…they can also use that water for domestic purposes whereas before they had to purchase water or go to other water plants.”

14-year-old Arzish Tahir who attends the ninth grade in Islamabad Model College for Girls also had an impact story to report.

She said that her friends often fell sick due to consumption of contaminated water. Falling sick meant missing school and falling behind in their studies. Some even had to drop out. While what Arzish reported was anecdotal there are several national and international level research projects and policy briefs that state the importance of clean and safe drinking water and mention that access to WASH facilities on campuses may help children stay in school.

Keeping these on-ground facts at the forefront of the installation of this plant the institution’s community now has their own water filtration plant and access to safe water that directly serves more than 700 students in Arzish’s school while also accommodating 60 students from a nearby public school.

Ms. Asiya went one step further to create awareness. She is involving parents through information sessions in the quarterly parent teacher meetings. The school also created a sense of responsibility and sensitization amongst the students as they now have a WASH club. Enthusiastic students serve as members and involve their fellow students in the movement for learning more about best practices in hygiene and the need for clean and safe water.

Considering how this empowers young students the community is hopeful that the future of these children will be bright. With their health being made the priority through clean and safe drinking water there is no stopping these change-makers of tomorrow!

TEACHERS GOING THE EXTRA MILE FOR THEIR STUDENTS

Farhat Aziz is her students’ mentor. As a teacher of social sciences at the Islamabad Model College for Girls Farhat Aziz has been a part of the institution for 16 years. Her presence at the place is reassuring for the hundreds of girls studying at the institution. A kind and attentive educator Farhat understands the needs of her students and can easily pinpoint the reasons which stops the local children from attending school. One of these reasons is access to clean water and WASH facilities in her community.

Ms. Farhat Aziz stepped up to ensure her students will get uninterrupted access to safe water on campus via dispensers attached to the water filtration plant

When PepsiCo and WaterAid first introduced their water filtration plant model to the administration of the school Ms. Asiya the principal of the institution nominated Ms. Farhat and another one of her colleagues Ms. Noureen to get trained in running the plant’s management system since the school had no male employees who could take up the task.

For someone who already advocated for children’s access to safe water and WASH facilities Ms. Farhat seemed right for the job. She explains how she was assigned the task that broke gender stereotypes. “Madam Noureen and I were selected for training (of the plant’s management system) as the school had no male employees. We learned as much as we could according to our capability and handled the operations of the plant.”

Ms. Asiya Ms. Noureen and Ms. Farhat with their students happy about the availability of clean and safe drinking water on their campus

While Ms. Farhat is humble the truth is that it was a complex task that she and Ms. Noureen have carried out with aplomb and resilience. The presence of the filtration plant has helped with the health of the students and attendance rates of children improved because they were not falling sick or getting dehydrated.

“Now this facility provides us with clean and fresh water on the daily” Ms. Farhat added. “Students and teachers both benefit from it.”

For a teacher who loves her students this is a victory worth celebrating.

COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP AND DIGITAL DATA MANAGEMENT: HOW SAFE WATER UPLIFTED AND MODERNIZED A COMMUNITY

With the help of PepsiCo Pakistan and WaterAid the easy-to-manage and self-sustaining water filtration plants installed in four areas of Humak are running on an advanced tech-based system.

Innovative technology of remote telemonitoring through Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system has been introduced as an added layer of functionality to ensure smooth operations of the plants. The monitoring is done by the community and local government stakeholders via a control room.

Technology has simplified complex operations so local community members are empowered to run the filtration plants on their own

The technology provides multiple solutions to the community operators. Through SCADA the quality of the water can be monitored and determined remotely without involving physical tests. The long and cumbersome exercise of testing the water and waiting for results has now been simplified and streamlined. Operational adjustments were also made possible through the control relays with the click of a button.

The local community leaders are now at ease as their plant keeps running smoothly and they are on top of the information in case the system requires their attention.

BIG IMPACT IN A SMALL TOWN: HOW HUMAK IS THRIVING

In Humak there are four community water filtration plants one in an educational institution and another in the Humak dispensary which is run by the local government. These plants have changed the way the people of Humak live and the experience has been entirely transformative for these communities in their own words.

PepsiCo and WaterAid have driven this people-centric program to prioritize the uplifting of entire communities and the impact is visible in the way people consume this precious resource now how they value it and how they have taken ownership of the program.

Clean water can transform everything for people by fueling health prosperity and collective optimism and it is all visible in the community where the water filtration plants are operational. Children women and the elderly all benefit from a better healthier and wholesome life and the consensus is that this gift will keep bringing people closer together for change.

IN RURAL PUNJAB A WORLD-CLASS OPPORTUNITY FOR UPLIFTING QUALITY OF LIFE

A few hundred kilometers away from Islamabad Tehsil Dipalpur in Okara Punjab is a rural farming community. This is also known as the “potato growing belt” one of the places from where PepsiCo Pakistan sources sustainably grown potatoes for Lay’s from its partner farmers. Most of the population is involved in farming practices and agricultural work from farm to markets. Being at the heart of Punjab’s most fertile land however still does not mean access to clean and safe drinking water for all the residents of the area.

PepsiCo and WaterAid started ‘Access to Safe Water’ program for rural communities in the area in early 2022. The overall objective of this project was to ensure provision of safe drinking water and support hygiene behavior change for farmers and their families in 12 villages and 10 schools of Tehsil Dipalpur Okara. For some of the hardest working people of the land this proved to be a boon. The rural extension of the program is also funded by the PepsiCo Foundation and being implemented by a local partner Doaba Foundation with technical support from WaterAid Pakistan.

UPLIFTING COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS THROUGH PEOPLE-CENTRIC INTERVENTIONS

For the community’s needs community based reverse osmosis (RO) water filtration units were installed in seven villages of district Okara while one plant was installed in the office of Deputy Commissioner Okara where approximately 3000 people visit daily and need a clean drinking water source. A total of seven community level water schemes are now providing safe water to 23300 individuals including men women children and people with disabilities. In addition five small-scale RO units are providing safe water to 4940 school children.

To ensure ownership and future sustainability of WASH services provided under the project the team formed and trained 12 WASH committees with 15 members in each committee. These committee members were trained on safe drinking water water conservation hand washing with soap at critical times construction and use of household latrines and avoiding open defecation. Maintaining personal hygiene and running the operations and management of water supply schemes was also an important part of the training.

Under school WASH activities 10 WASH Club with 120 members (boys & girls) were formed and given training and awareness on hygiene behavior change. The female social mobilisers working in the field also discovered a need to include instructions about menstrual hygiene for young girls based on needs analysis done with the support of female teachers at the schools in program area.

MAKING GIRLS’ SCHOOLS SAFE HAVENS FOR STUDENTS

A critical aspect of this program was to support health and hygiene of young girl students of educational institutions of the area. To ensure the management of menstrual health and hygiene with safety privacy and dignity social mobilisers and female teachers formulated a strategy so that girls do not have to drop out from school. Availability of safe and clean water in functional toilets plays a key role in this regard along with good WASH practices.

Therefore the rural ‘Access to Safe Water’ program in Okara district supported two elementary girls’ schools in the project area for upgrading two existing toilets into ‘Inclusive Girls Friendly Toilets’. This included provision of a side cupboard for storing sanitary pads/materials a ramp for ensuring access of people with disability provision of a privacy wall and a hand washing station. These toilets are benefitting 464 schoolgirls.

CLEANLINESS THE ORDER OF THE DAY

Promoting hygiene behavior change is one of the key elements of the project as has been recognized by all community leaders like Dr. Humera. They realise that access to clean water cannot work without sensitization to good hygiene practices by all so the project staff and village-level WASH committees mobilised local communities in 12 villages in Okara District to construct and use household latrines hence restoring dignity and health to the lives of the residents of the area.

An additional innovation was added to the mix to ensure all the good work being done in the area would have a lasting impact on the community: a two-month-long extensive FM radio campaign was broadcasted on a local FM radio channel FM 105.4 which targeted 30000 listeners with different sensitization messages about safe water consumption hygiene practices and healthy attitude towards communal resources.

With the community engaged there is no limit to the benefits that can be driven by the residents of these villages from these interventions.

The Other Side of the Country: Empowering Communities with Clean Water in Karachi’s Pak Colony

Karachi is home to millions of residents. As a megacity that keeps expanding the city needs critical amounts of natural resources and water is where the true challenge lies. As a scarce resource water has become a commodity and access to it is difficult for many communities that are underserved. One such community is Pak Colony.

The community is a densely populated and ethnically diverse. Like others in Karachi Pak Colony’s residents are hardworking individuals who struggle each day to earn an honest living. Their focus ideally should be on their work and on the education and wellbeing of their children. However lack of water means people including children often had to walk or travel daily to get water from source points far away from their homes to fulfill their daily needs. For children of the community this practice often forced them to miss school. With no guarantee of the quality of water they were bringing home many health issues created by water-borne diseases ran rampant amongst the community residents disproportionately affecting children.

Identifying the need of the area PepsiCo Pakistan joined forces with WaterAid and installed a mega water filtration plant at Pak Colony. Pakistan Council for Research in Water Resources was selected as implementation partners while local government was key stakeholder.

The facility has high capacity and can filter 50000 gallons of water every day. It is providing safe drinking water to over 100000 residents of the area including three educational institutions that have been linked to it. The filtration plant has become an integral part of the community and has brought together a diverse population.

The project brought people from various backgrounds together and they now have easy access to different water dispensing points serving filtered water via the filtration plant. These have been established in central locations which give residents easy and quick access to filtered water to the residents. With no need to travel far to get water the people of Pak Colony including the children can get on with living full lives.

UNINTERRUPTED LEARNING FOR FUTURE LEADERS: HOW STUDENTS AT PAK COLONY’S SCHOOLS NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HYDRATION AS THEY LEARN

Three educational institutions in Pak Colony Karachi have been linked with the water filtration plant in the community. These schools are KMC Boys & Girls Secondary School Yasin Zubairi Government Boys Secondary School Hasrat Mohani Campus and Government Girls College.

The children enrolled in these institutions can access clean drinking water easily through the water dispensers installed on campus. Prior to this the teachers at the school went out of their way to jointly buy water for the students. Students also brought their own water as water availability wasn’t guaranteed. They had to ration their water supply to ensure they had sufficient water left in their bottles to survive the infamous Karachi heat.

Now children have plenty of clean and safe water to drink and their teachers no longer worry about students dropping out or getting sick hence focusing on their one mission in life: to seek knowledge and achieve their dreams.

Access to safe water in Yasin Zuberi Secondary School for boys and girls has enriched the lives of young students

For Pak Colony the installation of the water plant has provided security surety and support to the residents who no longer struggle to access clean water. Due to the project that works and delivers on its promise community members are now inspired enough to step up and do their part in being agents of change.

WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS: COMMITTED TO PEOPLE’S PROSPERITY

Children are the future of the planet and empowered with clean water they are ready to do good

The empathy of empowered children and their spirit to share their resources is truly inspiring

Keeping a sharp focus on water distribution sanitation and hygiene practices PepsiCo has set a new global target to provide safe water to 100 million people by 2030. PepsiCo Pakistan aims to do their part in achieving this ambitious global goal in Pakistan. The ‘Access to Safe Water’ program is a part of this initiative and they are taking it forward methodically to ensure long-term success.

When PepsiCo and WaterAid came together to support local communities with their water-related issues they knew their approach must be entirely people-centric that offers radical solutions to make this a successful project that would last. PepsiCo is dedicated to ensuring that the ‘Access to Safe Water’ program empowers a network of homegrown change-makers ready to take on the future.

Beyond these project sites PepsiCo Pakistan plans to expand the program to scale up the impact with the same approach in partnership with WaterAid. The company will continue with a focus on other locations in Karachi beyond Pak Colony since the water challenge the city faces is enormous. Through stakeholders and community leaders they will continue to serve marginalized communities. Secondly they have also pledged to continue to sustain the earlier interventions in Karachi so that they do not become redundant. The project within Karachi will be extended to more locations within the mega city.

The water filtration plants have been constructed with the communities in mind

‘In With and For Pakistan’

It is always intriguing to chronicle how global companies find ways to engage in community uplift work that provides actual relief. Through the stories of resilient communities stepping up to own the change the work that PepsiCo Pakistan is doing sheds a light on how businesses are not run in isolation. Communities matter beyond the metrics and numbers. For PepsiCo Pakistan their work is inextricably linked with the history development and prosperity of the country. They have had a six-decade long commitment to ensuring they empower communities they work with and in and tangible results can be seen in areas where they have initiated programs like ‘Access to Safe Water’.

What makes this different from any other development project?

The drive and the passion for change and the belief that through united effort across stakeholders work that uplifts people and the planet is possible. By supporting homegrown heroes PepsiCo and WaterAid are empowering change-makers who can take on the task of uplifting their communities from within.

With winds of change already spreading across the current program sites PepsiCo further aims to expand the program into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The plan is to install water filtration schemes in Peshawar and Quetta.

WaterAid Country Director Arif Jabbar Khan is hopeful about the future of these targeted interventions and says “In partnership with PepsiCo WaterAid delivers programs that are designed with owned and maintained by the local communities. Such an approach has helped thousands of families in poor communities and children studying in public schools not only have access to clean drinking water but they also know how to run and maintain these systems”.

Empowered communities are multiplying the impact of the installed water filtration plants through hygiene awareness activities that involve children

These communities and their homegrown heroes are proving that there is no challenge too big for a group of people united to make change happen especially if they have partners like PepsiCo Pakistan and WaterAid to match their stride.

The campaign was meant to neutralise Coca-Cola’s Rs 10 crore sponsorship of the 1997 Cricket World Cup.

Former PepsiCo India Chairman Priya Mohan Sinha Suman to his friends passed away on Wednesday. He often said he loved three things all of which were in Kolkata. An early morning walk past the gothic monument at Prinsep Ghat a ride in a country boat on the Hooghly and a walk down Park Street the city’s happening hotspot brimming with restaurants bars and books. “These are my roots. This is what I want to do when I settle in Calcutta after retirement” he told me. He loved Calcutta and refused to call it Kolkata.

And then almost instantly he asked me at his expansive Gurgaon home: “Which club do you belong to?” I thought I would first say Manchester United as PepsiCo had once sponsored the club. But within seconds I changed tack and replied: “East Bengal.”

That was Sinha very earthy and one of the most respected CEOs of his time. He never lacked the human touch. Whenever Sinha bought gifts for his friends or business associates it reflected their individual interests. It could be a golf kit a cricket bat or a clock mounted in a case with blue crystals and so on.

Sinha knew the importance of the CEO’s chair at Pepsico India and he also knew about life without the chair. He had purged a lot of inefficiency at Pepsi and normalised what many felt was a grandiose corporate culture that had problems fitting with the Indian psyche. No wonder the big guys of the exceptionally high-profile PepsiCo remember him as a remarkably low-profile Chairman.

Sinha nephew of firebrand opposition leader Jayprakash Narayan believed in taking the bull by the horns. He loved hard work and leadership by example. Both stayed with him throughout his working life.

As a Director with Hindustan Unilever he was posted in Delhi for nearly a decade and knew the intricacies of babucracy as well as the influencers. Sinha took over from former PepsiCo President Ramesh Vangal and pushed the head office to give him a purse of $1 billion. He called it his war chest and started expanding aggressively. By the time he called it a day PepsiCo had 44 plants in India including ones owned by franchisees.

It was Sinha who offered interest-free loans to bottlers to expand. He even bought over some of PepsiCo’s partners and big bottlers. When Sinha was trying to acquire local drinks maker Duke’s to get its plant outside Mumbai Sinha worked overtime and held around 27 meetings with the owners the Pandole family. The deal was eventually sealed for Rs 46 crore in 1994.

Some of his moves drew flak. One was when he hawked a tomato processing unit in Punjab to Hindustan Lever. Many felt PepsiCo’s real strength was soft drinks not developing agriculture in India. Sinha took criticism on the chin like he did when he pushed PepsiCo India to export seaweed and rice. He told his critics that he had introduced contract farming in India which had improved tomato and potato yields.

Then there was the big fight with Coca-Cola. The Atlanta-based bosses of Coca-Cola launched the drink in Agra in 1993 and posed for photographs with the majestic Taj Mahal in the background. PepsiCo executives lined soda fountains all the way from Delhi to the launch site. In another instance Sinha once pushed his company to destroy 250 ml bottles worth Rs 60 crore when an insider informed him that Coca-Cola would sell 300 ml bottles at the same price.

Sinha felt the heat when Coca-Cola picked up all the brands from Ramesh Chauhan and gained instant market share. He said once: “I fight two brands Coca-Cola and Thums Up. Coca-Cola only fights Pepsi.”

One of the high points in Sinha’s career was when he spent around Rs 10 crore on a guerrilla marketing campaign that said Nothing Official About It. The campaign was meant to neutralise Coca-Cola’s Rs 10 crore sponsorship of the 1997 Cricket World Cup. The campaign captured the imagination of the people and also got a lot of press and helped PepsiCo gradually narrow the market share gap with Coca-Cola.

This was followed by Yeh Dil Maange More a campaign that stole the thunder from Coca-Cola. When a Major of the Indian Army used the line after a victory on one of the peaks at Kargil Sinha was over the moon.

Peter Thompson former President PepsiCo wrote a lovely memo when Sinha called it a day after nine and a half years. “The mark of a strong leader is to chart a winning course build a great organisation and deliver outstanding results. Suman has accomplished all of that and more.”

Thompson was possibly referring to the time when Sinha took charge. MPs probably egged on by domestic businessmen would ask dozens of questions in Parliament about PepsiCo agitations filled the streets in big cities and in the hinterland where farmers felt the big bad wolf would eat them up. The powerful Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) called PepsiCo a traitor that should be chased away like Coca-Cola and IBM.

Sinha led PepsiCo India for nine-and-a-half years.

Sinha remained unfazed. As a nephew of Jaiprakash Narayan Sinha understood India’s political underbelly. He made India PepsiCo’s second-largest market outside the US.

Seasoned communicator Deepak Jolly remembers some of Sinha’s bold decisions.

In 1990 during Jolly’s stint at Unilever ULFA threatened to kill the key executives at the Doom Dooma tea estate in Assam if the ransom wasn’t paid. An estate manager of Tata Tea had already been gunned down over an unpaid ransom. Sinha led the rescue operation of 139 people as HLL refused to pay the ransom.

“He was able to leverage his strong relations with the government the air force and the Assam Chief Secretary and managed a most difficult rescue operation with a plane landing on the Doom Dooma airstrip which hadn’t been used in years. Before the deadline for the ransom expired 139 staff members and their families were flown out of danger to Calcutta” said Jolly.

When injured soldiers returned from the Kargil War FICCI decided to raise money to help them start alternative careers. Sinha organised a large event with actors singers and other Bollywood artistes. “The entire Pepsi marketing team worked with him. There was no Pepsi branding. The PM the President and the Chiefs of the Army Air Force and the Navy were among the 25000 people that attended the event. It was organised in five days flat.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jb20ubXQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMi0xMi0yNC9mb29kL1BlcHNpQ28tYnJhbmRzLW5vdy1hdmFpbGFibGUtaW4tbmV3LXN0cmlraW5nLXJlZmlsbGFibGUtZ2xhc3MtYm90dGxlLTY3MzYyNDg0MjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PepsiCo brands now available in new striking refillable glass bottle,"Simonds Farsons Cisk plc proud partners of PepsiCo Inc and bottlers of the Pepsi-Cola portfolio for the local market since 1978 have just launched a new refillable single-serve bespoke glass bottle for flagship brands Pepsi-Cola and Pepsi Max 7up and 7up Free and Mirinda.

This launch closely follows the global release of the new bottle design and is the first design update since 1996. The etched twisted bottom of the bottle allows for a visible and tactile brand experience and the bold swirl and elevated profile of the bottle reflects the brand's youthful spirit and appeals to younger consumers.

This new glass bottle design complements a similar new design for the PET 1.5 and 0.5 litre bottle range launched on the local market just last year.

""The PepsiCo portfolio in Malta has gone from strength to strength over the years and we are confident that the latest investment in this striking and bold new glass bottle will serve to further enhance our clients' and consumers' overall brand experience"" said Ms Susan Weenink Camilleri Head of Sales & Marketing. ""We are also proud to endorse and participate in PepsiCo's recently announced global goals regarding Sustainable Packaging Vision.""

This month PepsiCo announced a new global goal to double the percentage of all beverage servings it sells delivered through reusable models from 10% to 20% by building out refillable plastic and glass offerings amongst others. By working with partners and franchisors this updated packaging goal will help PepsiCo meet its target of reducing virgin plastic per serving by 50% by 2030 and to become net zero by 2040.

Advertisment

The Director-General of Niue's Ministry of Social Services Gaylene Tasmania stated in a statement that the expired dosages were used in vaccines on May 24.

She said that 51 persons got the booster dosages which had expired under refrigerated storage settings.

Last year the HMNZS Wellington Patrol Vessel provided immunizations on behalf of the Ministry of Health NZ to Tokelau Niue and remote areas of the Cook Islands.

Advertisment

The Ministry of Health in New Zealand said that there was no danger of injury to anyone who got the outdated vaccination.

""We alerted the 51 victims and their families as soon as we became aware of the misreading of expiration dates"" Tasmania added.

There were 48 16â17-year-olds and three adults among the 51 persons.

Advertisment

Tasmania said that they were collaborating closely with the Ministry of Health of New Zealand and the Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC) of New Zealand on incident management and clinical advice.

IMAC medical experts said that revaccinating healthy 16â17-year-old recipients was not typically suggested since the vaccination was most likely still viable she added.

According to research protection was nevertheless offered as a booster.

She said that this looked to be a one-time occurrence during their immunisation programme.

A representative for New Zealand's Ministry of Health said that they were awaiting clinical input on whether the vaccination remained efficacious and delivered a consistent degree of protection.

""An additional dosage is sometimes needed"" they said.

It's unclear when the expired vaccinations were brought to Niue but the most recent shipment of vaccines 180 adult doses and 300 paediatric doses arrived on March 22.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Spomer Classics a car and automotive memorabilia museum has been a Worthington Minnesota must-see since owner Marv Spomer first opened its doors. But now after two decades the museum is closing.

Marv Spomer's first two neon signs that started his life's collection are the Strato Streak V8 and Fireball V8. Tim Middagh/The Globe

“It isn’t going to be easy” Spomer said standing in the back room of the former car dealership-turned-museum. The back room is filled with classic cars. Most of the time Spomer has had 18 to 20 cars on display including a 1957 Venetian orange Corvette and the sleek red ’66 Pontiac that Robert Kennedy rode in — and signed — during his participation in Worthington's King Turkey Day parade.

It’s all part of the history part of the collection that Spomer has spent more than half of his life building. While his love of the automobile has been lifelong the collection he credits to his wife Jeanine an antiques lover who encouraged Spomer to ride along when she went to auctions.

Together they built Spomer Classics. Since its opening car enthusiasts history lovers and the mildly curious have made their way to the Worthington museum.

The museum has hosted many large groups who took one of Spomer’s two-hour tours while he walks them around the brightly lit interior. People come from nearby; they travel across state lines and in some cases from out of the country.

“Two weeks ago we had two people in from South Africa” Spomer said. “That’s the biggest thing is we’re gonna miss the people because we’ve gotten to talk to people from all over the world.”

While many people come in to view the cars Spomer says they’re really a secondary attraction.

“We have people come in here all the time (who say) ‘Oh we gotta see the cars’ but pretty soon all they’re looking at is the neon signs.” he said walking along a line of sleek looking automobiles in the back showroom. “The signs and the clocks and the memorabilia that’s what they’re really here to see. They just don’t understand that ’til they come in.”

His very first neon signs — a Pontiac and a Fireball V8 — came from an auction in Scotland South Dakota. There’s a Coca-Cola sign from the gas station Spomer’s father used to run where Spomer first got into the car business by pumping gas.

Towering above one of the cars near the back is an 11-foot-long rotating sign from 1953 that was found in a grove of trees in Decorah Iowa. Spomer cleaned it out himself as he does with most of the signs he’s collected. The restoration is all part of the process and Spomer jokes that he can never be without some project whether that’s a car a sign or figuring out how to find space for a massive rotating sign.

“That rotator it actually came off the Phillips 66 sign in Worthington” Spomer said adding that a friend from his coffee group gave it to him after hearing about his new sign. “It was totally shot. It took me six months to get it all working again.”

He points out other signs and says a friend told him about it or a contact tracked him down and offered to sell it to him or someone somewhere said they had a sign and a story.

Spomer it seems collects both.

“There’s a lot of research that goes into this” he said “The stuff we find we try to find the history that goes with it.”

In a room packed so full of lights and signs that it’s hard to find the walls Spomer’s own tales about how he acquired pieces of memorabilia mingles with the item’s history. Interspersed with talks of the auctions and antique stores he’s collected from is a vast assortment of automotive trivia and historical tidbits connected to the various items that make up Spomer’s collection.

Neon signs he explained took off in the United States in the 1920s and first showed up at a Packard car dealership in Los Angeles. They were a huge hit at the 1926 National Auto Show at Madison Square Garden in New York and the subsequent neon wave spread throughout the world of advertising.

While that spread is on full technicolor display inside Spomer Classics the neon signs are only a portion of the collection. Porcelain and tin lit-up milk glass Spomer possesses what is one of the largest collections of automotive signs in the country — and more than a couple pieces are one-of-a-kind.

“I've got quite a few signs that are over 100 years old” he said “and we have broadened out from automotive to gas and oil ... And naturally we’ve collected a lot of local stuff — Worthington stuff — that will be going into the historical building downtown.”

Spomer will be giving — or returning in some cases — several pieces from his collection to people the memorabilia holds significant value for. In large part though most of the memorabilia will be sold.

Since deciding to sell Spomer said he’s had visits from some of the top auctioneer companies in the country and that’s where a majority of the signs will be headed. The first grouping will include 30 signs split between two auctions in North Carolina. The first will take place in February with additional auctions yet to be determined.

“It’s gonna take time but it’ll be interesting to watch” Spomer said. “So many of these things are so unique.”

Spomer will keep some of the signs along with a handful of cars that he’s not looking to part with. And even though he’s closing the museum he doesn’t plan to quit his restoration hobby any time soon. He encourages anyone still interested in a tour to give him a call at 507-360-9557.

While some of the cars have been sold and a few could go to auction Spomer has yet to decide where the others will end up.

“It’s been a wonderful journey” he said. “For the simple fact of all the wonderful people we’ve met doing this. It warms your heart seeing the expression of their faces when you light this place up. We’ve always said we’re about restoring cars and signs and memories and some days the memories really hit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2NoaWNhZ28vbmV3cy9sb3R0by1sdWNreS1kYXktbG90dG8td2lubmVycy_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvY2hpY2Fnby9uZXdzL2xvdHRvLWx1Y2t5LWRheS1sb3R0by13aW5uZXJzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Illinois residents win in Lotto Lucky Day Lotto drawings,"CHICAGO (CBS) – Four people in Illinois have more to celebrate this Christmas.

The Little Rock School District's second new high school building in a decade is in the planning stages in regard to its academic programming and physical attributes.

The new West High School building is scheduled to open for the 2025-26 school year on land with a small lake that is to the immediate east of Pinnacle View Middle School 5619 Ranch Drive in the northwest part of the district.

The new high school building is one of the projects being funded with the proceeds from a Nov. 2 2021 voter-approved 12.4-mill property tax rate extension.

Other district projects similarly funded are the construction -- now underway -- of the new Dr. Marian G. Lacey Academy for kindergarten-through-eighth grades on Geyer Springs Road and the replacement of decades-old portable classrooms with permanent classrooms at the historic Central High.

Preliminary plans for West High call for a three-story building with an arena and performing arts space to serve some 1200 students Kevin Yarberry the district's director of maintenance and operations said recently. Lewis Architects Engineers are the designers.

The district-owned land includes a pond that is roughly the size of a football stadium. Some in the district have looked at the pond and see an opportunity for a wetlands study program or for ""aqua lab/marine technology"" as it is labeled on preliminary building plans.

Others who responded to an initial survey about the school warned that the pond could be a danger and subject the district to liability should there be accidents.

Yarberry said with a laugh that he is not currently in the aqua-lab camp.

""Do I think it would be valuable space for a field house or additional practice field or soccer field? Yes I do"" he said.

""That's where I see the value right now without understanding what the curriculum looks like. I'm not sure how the pond would relate.""

Plans are not yet firm but the new school building is to be a traditional high school that may incorporate the elements of the already existing West High School of Innovation. West High School of Innovation opened in the 2019-20 school year under the direction of the Arkansas Board of Education. That was at a time when the Little Rock district operated under state control.

The School of Innovation offers flexible scheduling with on-site and online instruction that is centered on project-based learning. The school also has two fledgling ""career academies"" -- one focused on animal and plant systems and advanced professional studies and the other an academy of digital marketing design and logistics.

The new high school building is also to house ""career academies"" which are being established in high schools throughout Pulaski County to provide students with opportunities to learn core academics in the context of particular occupations. Some schools are expected to have wall-to-wall academies meaning that all students will be enrolled in them. Pocket academies are another option in which students don't have to be part of a career academy but choose that option.

The selection of career academies and whether they will be wall-to-wall or pocket academies are among the decisions to be made for the new high school building.

About 82% of 511 responders to an initial district survey about the new school building indicated a preference for academy themes focused on business and finance architecture and design and medical and biotechnology Shay Loring the district's director of secondary education said. Slightly less popular were academies on urban agriculture digital design and medical systems and technology.

Within each academy there are multiple career ""pathways."" Students would choose an academy then choose a more specific career pathway within the academy and then take at least three courses within the pathway in the time they are in 10th through 12th grades.

Each pathway offers opportunities for students to shadow in different career fields take tours and serve as job interns Shameka Montgomery the district's director of career and technical education said.

Ninth-graders take a freshman seminar course that introduces them to the academies and pathways.

The West High School of Innovation for grades nine through 12 is now housed in what was a multistory office building that served as the headquarters for a long-gone company that published materials on handcrafts.

With the construction of new school space the original office building could become home to ninth-graders Yarberry said.

""It's a logical option to house freshmen in the original building"" Yarberry said.

The spaces for freshmen and for the older students could be separated by some shared common areas such as the school cafeteria.

Loring the district's director of secondary schools has said that 74% of the respondents to an initial parent survey about the school plans indicated a preference for giving freshman some separation from older students in the high school.

Melissa Gude the Little Rock district's chief academic officer highlighted some of the often mentioned preferences expressed by those who responded to the survey:

• Plenty of options for Advanced Placement and pre-Advanced Placement courses as well as languages such as Spanish Chinese French and Arabic.

• Art programs and art spaces comparable to athletic spaces.

• Unrivaled sports facilities.

• Personal finance training.

• Ample parking.

• Space for the school to expand or grow.

• A wide variety of safety features including cameras security staff safe rooms controlled entries and a filled-in pond.

• Use of natural light native plants walking trails rooftop gardens.

""Lots of these are being considered"" Gude said about the preferences identified in the first October/November survey particularly the separate space for ninth-graders.

A second survey is available to community members that asks about the academies and the school mascot. Those interested in that survey can access it using the QR code provided on the district's website under the ""Latest District News"" link to "" West High School community update.""

Yarberry said he anticipates that there will be decisions made about the West building and a guaranteed maximum price for it established by spring. The district has used $85 million as an estimated cost for the project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL2JyZWFraW5nLWdlb3JnZS1jb2hlbi1kZWFkLWVuZ2xhbmQtMjg4MDMwOTTSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9icmVha2luZy1nZW9yZ2UtY29oZW4tZGVhZC1lbmdsYW5kLTI4ODAzMDk0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George Cohen dead: Legendary England 1966 World Cup winner dies aged 83,"Kensington native George Cohen spent his entire playing career with Fulham and lifted the World Cup with England at Wembley Stadium in 1966 winning 37 caps in total

George Cohen who lifted the World Cup with England in 1966 has sadly died at the age of 83 his former club Fulham have announced.

""Everyone at Fulham Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of our greatest ever players – and gentlemen – George Cohen MBE"" a statement from the Cottagers read.

Cohen who was born in Kensington in 1939 spent his entire playing career with Fulham racking up 459 appearances between 1956 and 1969 and scoring six league goals. The pinnacle of his career - and remarkably his only major honour - came in 1966 when he started against West Germany in the World Cup final at Wembley Stadium.

Gary Lineker paid tribute to the England hero writing on Twitter : ""Sorry to hear that George Cohen has died. Another of the heroes of the ‘66 World Cup winning team leaves us. He’ll always have footballing immortality. RIP George.""

Having played every minute of the tournament for the Three Lions Cohen helped England to a 4-2 victory to clinch their first World Cup triumph. The right-back formed part of a formidable defence alongside Jack Charlton captain Bobby Moore and Ray Wilson.

Cohen earned a total of 37 caps for England between 1964 and 1967 and he served as Sir Alf Ramsey's vice-captain for the showdown with West Germany. After hanging up his boots in 1969 Cohen served as a youth coach at Fulham and worked with England's under-23s while he also spent time as manager of non-league side Tonbridge.

He was awarded an MBE in 2000 and a statue of Cohen was unveiled at Craven Cottage 16 years later as a tribute to Fulham's iconic former player and the 50th anniversary of England's World Cup triumph. Cohen attended the ceremony and was also made an honorary freeman of Hammersmith and Fulham.

""This is a richly deserved honour for a sporting hero who is Fulham through and through"" councillor Stephen Cowan said at the time. ""It not only marks his achievements on the football field but also his ambassadorial role and his tireless campaigning for research into cancer and dementia especially to help his fellow players.""

Astonishingly Cohen's nephew Ben was part of the England squad which won the Rugby World Cup in 2003 after defeating Australia in the final. The elder Cohen's sad death means that two members of the England starting XI which beat West Germany are still alive - and five members of the squad in total.

Fulham's touching obituary for their legendary former player concludes: ""All of our thoughts are with Daphne his beloved wife of more than 60 years sons Anthony and Andrew his grandchildren and extended family as well as George’s many many friends.""",,,,,,,,,

Washington: U.S. consumer spending barely rose in November while annual inflation increased at its slowest pace in 13 months but demand is probably not cooling fast enough to discourage the Federal Reserve from driving interest rates to higher levels next year.Slowing economic activity heading into 2023 amid rising borrowing costs was also flagged by other data from the Commerce Department on Friday showing a modest gain in orders for locally manufactured capital goods last month. The U.S. central bank is trying to slow demand for everything from housing to labor as it fights to bring inflation back to its 2% target.""The economy is moving in the right direction from the Fed's perspective but not quickly enough"" said Gus Faucher chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.Consumer spending which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity edged up 0.1% after surging 0.9% in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.2%.Some of the moderation in spending reflected a shift in demand from goods to services. Slowing price increases for some goods also lowered the dollar amount of consumer spending.Spending on long-lasting manufactured goods dropped 2.3% led by decreases in purchases of motor vehicles. There were additional drags to spending from household furnishings and other equipment as well as recreational goods and vehicles.Outlays on services increased 0.7% lifted by housing and utilities as well as financial services and insurance. They offset decreases in air transportation services.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.1% last month after climbing 0.4% in October. Food prices increased 0.3% the smallest gain since December 2021. Prices for energy goods and services dropped 1.5%. Services prices which can be sticky rose 0.4% reflecting housing inflation.In the 12 months through November the PCE price index increased 5.5%. That was the smallest annual gain since October 2021 and followed a 6.1% advance in October.Excluding the volatile food and energy components the PCE price index gained 0.2% after increasing 0.3% in October. The so-called core PCE price index climbed 4.7% on a year-on-year basis in November also the smallest rise since October 2021 after increasing 5.0% in October.The Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for monetary policy. President Joe Biden welcomed the cooling inflation which has been evident in other price measures but warned of bumps ahead.""There will be more ups and downs in the year ahead but we are making progress building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out and I'm optimistic for the year ahead"" Biden said in a statement.Consumer prices rose less than expected for a second straight month in November. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations also moderated in December strengthening views that price pressures peaked several months ago.Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.SOLID WAGE GAINS""Inflation continues to slow down which is good news for the Fed's most important objective but unfortunately for the market it is happening at the same time as consumers are reducing their spending"" said Chris Zaccarelli chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte North Carolina.The Fed last week hiked its policy rate by 50 basis points to a 4.25%-4.50% range the highest since late 2007. Fed officials expect the rate to rise to between 5.00% and 5.25% next year a level that could be sustained for a while.When adjusted for inflation consumer spending was flat last month after rising 0.5% in October.Nevertheless consumer spending is on track to provide another boost to economic growth this quarter because of October's solid increase and subsiding inflation. The economy grew at a 3.2% annualized rate last quarter after contracting in the first half of the year. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are as high as a 3.7% pace.Consumer spending is being supported by solid wage gains thanks to a tight labor market as well as savings accumulated during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.Personal income rose 0.4% last month with wages gaining 0.5%. But higher borrowing costs fast-depleting savings and diminishing household wealth could stifle consumer spending and tip the economy into recession next year.Though the saving rate climbed to 2.4% from 2.2% in October it remains near record lows.Economists are cautiously optimistic that the Fed would probably not need to raise its policy rate much higher than currently projected which would result in only a mild recession. Much depends on the labor market.""If inflation continues to moderate albeit slowly and the Fed doesn't push policy rates much above 5% the economy should skirt by with just a shallow downturn"" said Sal Guatieri a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.A second report from the Commerce Department showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans rose 0.2% in November. These so-called core capital goods orders increased 0.3% in October. The data is not adjusted for inflation.Slowing price increases a strong dollar and the shift in spending from goods to services likely contributed to the moderation in orders. Shipments of core capital goods dipped 0.1% after increasing 1.4% in October.Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement. Equipment spending remains on track to again support the economy this quarter.A third report from the Commerce Department showed new home sales increased for a second straight month in November likely as Americans took advantage of a retreat in mortgage rates and incentives from desperate builders. The overall housing market however remains depressed.""We see limited upside for new home sales in the months ahead but the incentives offered by homebuilders and the recent decline in mortgage rates may keep a floor under sales"" said Nancy Vanden Houten lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYWZyby5jb20vZnJhdWRzdGVycy1zdGVhbC1lYnQtY2FzaC1iZW5lZml0cy1mcm9tLWJhbHRpbW9yZS1yZXNpZGVudHMtb2ZmaWNpYWxzLXNheS10aGV5LXdvbnQtcmVwbGFjZS1zdG9sZW4tZnVuZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fraudsters steal EBT cash benefits from Baltimore residents officials say they won't replace stolen funds,"By Megan Sayles

A 26-year-old woman from Baltimore is the latest victim of fraudsters who hacked her electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cash benefits. While checking her balance on an app she saw that someone had withdrawn $676 from her EBT account at a PNC Bank in Florida.

The woman spoke to the AFRO under the condition of anonymity but revealed her identity to the editorial department.

When she reached out to Baltimore City Department of Social Services (BCDSS) she was told that they could not replace any of the funds that had been stolen. Instead she was instructed to file a police report.

“I couldn’t even get my daughter anything for Christmas so I had to borrow stuff from people” she said.

While this is her first encounter with someone hacking her EBT card she’s seen others make social media posts urging people to check their accounts because their money had been stolen.

In one Baltimore resident Yvette M. Brooks warned that people are posing as social services’ employees and sending texts and calling to ask for EBT card information and pin numbers. She told people not to respond to the requests because benefits are being stolen.

In May the Maryland Department of Human Services (DHS) issued a statement warning Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA) and Temporary Disability Program (TDAP) recipients to take extra precautions to safeguard their benefits.

“As of Nov. 2 there were 1413 incidents of EBT card fraud reported in Maryland since Jan. 1 (SNAP Temporary Cash Assistance and Temporary Disability Assistance Program). As of Nov. 2 the total federal SNAP dollars reported as a loss in Maryland since January 2022 totalled approximately $696000” according to information shared with the AFRO by DHS spokeswoman Kathleen A. Morris.

In addition she said “Our outreach material on this issue includes instructions on how to check Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and Point of Sale (PoS) devices to ensure that they have not been tampered with before using them and encourages EBT card holders to change their PINs periodically and report fraud incidents immediately upon discovery.”

It recommended that people change their pins frequently use strong passwords examine card slots and use only USDA-approved payment processors.

In the statement DHS said the state is unable to replace any stolen benefits.

Parham Eftekhari executive vice president of the CyberRisk Alliance said most people do not know that their EBT benefits can be stolen or what to look out for. In turn fraudsters seek out people to exploit he said.

“Like many criminals cyber criminals often prey on the most vulnerable members of society. Individuals who rely on government EBT cards are at high risk of fraud because many do not have access to cyber hygiene or cybersecurity awareness and prevention training which is often delivered in corporate settings and academia” said Eftekhari.

According to Eftekhari criminals can steal EBT card information through skimmers devices placed on ATMs and other point-of-sale devices to steal card information and phishing scams fraudsters pretending to be government agencies and asking for card information.

He said it’s also possible for criminals to breach government systems to identify EBT recipients so they can use the data to steal funds or choose a phishing target.

To reduce the risk of their account being compromised people should refrain from giving their pin and account numbers over the phone regularly check their balance and use all security features that are offered by the benefits’ supplier like spending alerts according to Eftekhari.

“This is a trend that virtually every state and federal government is experiencing and will continue to grow. Users should be vigilant and reach out to the issuing agency to be sure they have activated all security features offered by the agency” said Eftekhari. “Simultaneously federal and state governments should build in security requirements such as only issuing cards with EMV offering multi-factor authentication and offering something similar to FDIC insurance to protect victims of digital fraud.”

“The midcaps and smallcaps have corrected more in this fall compared to the largecaps. The froth which was there in the midcaps and smallcaps is getting corrected. A lot of stock specific opportunities are going to be thrown up after this correction and it is a good time for a long-term investor to start looking at individual ideas and pick for 2023” saysDeputy Head Retail ResearchThere was a lot of leverage in the system and a lot of investors had become quite relaxed and lax about the valuations. I think this was warranted and it is clearing out the froth in the system. As per our estimates for FY24 Nifty on an aggregate is likely to earn about Rs 1000-990 per share. So at around 18900 19000. We were at the higher end of the valuation range. Now prices are becoming attractive. Around the 17500 level one should start looking at selective stocks.The midcaps and smallcaps have corrected more in this fall compared to the largecaps. The froth which was there in the midcaps and smallcaps is getting corrected. A lot of stock specific opportunities are going to be thrown up after this correction and it is a good time for a long-term investor to start looking at individual ideas and pick for 2023.Assuming that most of the viewers are retail investors and are looking for a higher-risk-higher-return kind of a pick I would say smallcap midcap stocks would be a preferred buy for retail investors.These 10 stocks are a mix of largecaps and smallcaps. If I were to pick one stock I will pick PNC Infrastructure Company. This has a current order book of about Rs 19000 crore which gives them revenue visibility of about almost 2.5 times their current earnings. They have recently monetised one of their HAM projects and there is a talk going on for the potential investors to monetise more of these assets.We know that 2024 is going to be the general election year. Usually before the election year the government would like to show some growth and that is where I am expecting a lot of allocation in the Union Budget towards the road construction sector. This company has its own in-house processes and is considered one of the best players in the road infrastructure road construction company. I think at this valuation it does make sense to gradually accumulate. We have about Rs 410 as our target for the year. It gives us a clear 30-40% upside from here.We were bullish on public sector banks one-and-a-half years two years back and from there they have already seen quite a bit of rerating. I think 2023 is going to be the year of stock picks. You cannot bet on a sector just like that. So we have chosen SBI as one of our picks because it is one of the largecaps and the valuations are still comparatively attractive compared to other private sector banks. We are still hoping that based on the earnings growth there is an opportunity to invest in SBI at sub-600 levels in this correction with the target of Rs 700 for a year.Yes I expect 2023 to be a year where the capital expenditure cycle will move in. The capacity utilisation has reached about 85-90% domestic economy is growing we are seeing first signs of credit growth lot of public and private sector banks are showing double digit credit growth and that will spill into the engineering construction capital goods companies and that is why we have chosen companies like Bharat Forge Larsen & Toubro and PNC Infra where the theme is that the balance sheet should be strong and have revenue visibility. The valuations are now coming into a range where one can safely accumulate with the margin of safety."

Path forward stalled by FEMA.,"Plans to rebuild a public gym and swimming pool destroyed by Hurricane Ida are on hold awaiting word from FEMA on how much money the federal agency will pay toward the work.

For years Recreation District 7 has been looking to consolidate its facilities now spread throughout the Chauvin area to a 55-acre site at 4373 Bayouside Drive it bought in 2015. Officials say that would cut travel time for maintenance and make a one-stop area for all its services.

The property at the intersection of Klondyke Road already has a walking track skate park pavilion and some playground equipment.

But other facilities — the Little Caillou Gym Smithridge Gym and Little Caillou Swimming Pool — were damaged by the Category 4 hurricane when it hit the area Aug. 29 2021. The Smithridge Gym was patched up and is usable but the other two are now under review by FEMA.

Recreation board members expect the gym and pool are total losses and if they are will replace them with the structures in the district's master plan. However until the board has FEMA's decision plans are on hold said Rec 7 Vice Chairman Jay Duplantis.

""Once we know what kind of commitment there is on the FEMA side we know what kind of commitment we need to kick in and that's all going to determine what we will be able to replace it with"" Duplantis said. ""In the grand scheme of things money is everything.""

""And that's such a I don't want to say a disappointment to me but it's really frustrating that when you go down there and our fire department is in the same situation"" he said. ""They've got a firehouse — Upper Little Caillou — looks like the day after the hurricane.""

A structure must sustain at least 50% of its value in damage for FEMA to declare it totaled. Once a structure is rebuilt FEMA can reimburse up to 90% of the cost if the process is approved. To avoid complications pre-approval is sought before committing to a rebuilding process. The number of steps involved can delay the recovery process.

The Bayouside Drive property has a master plan that includes five phases. Two phases have already been completed and the third includes a splash park and fishing pier. Phase 4 includes a footbal-soccer field as well as outdoor concession stands. Phase 5 includes the large recreation building with two basketball courts and a 10-lane competitive swimming pool.

The estimated cost of the 10-year plan was around $18 million Rec 7 Chairman Donald Tivet said and about $12 million of work remains. The project was stopped by the pandemic and is now further complicated by Ida's aftermath.

""The hurricane caught us off guard and really set us back on that part of it but in all honesty we're dead set on moving our facilities up to that location"" Duplantis said.

Tivet said each of the old facilities' properties was going to be returned to their former owners or sold to community groups and that's still the plan.

For example the Little Caillou Gym was given to the rec district to build the gyms so the buildings would be demolished and the land returned to St. Joseph Church. The Smithridge Gym will be kept open as long possible but weill eventually be demolished and the land returned to South Coast Corp. And the Little Caillou Swimming Pool will be filled in and new playground equipment added to the property.

More:Effort underway to merge 3 libraries in Terrebonne's bayou communities. Here's the plan.

Rec District 7 sold a corner of the property to the Terrebonne Parish Public Library for its planned South Regional Branch. Another portion is being used by the Little Caillou Fire Department as a temporary staging area until its stations are rebuilt.

The gyms act as community centers storm shelters and hubs for supplies after hurricanes.

By building a few miles north the structures are safer from hurricanes and more centrally located Duplantis said. He said the master plan didn't include baseball fields because the surrounding rec districts in Montegut and Bourg have those. Instead of duplicating Rec 7 members thought they could use the space for other uses. Duplantis is excited about the swimming pool.

""I'm going to go to my deathbed advocating for swimming"" he said. ""I'm not wavering on that one.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItZnVuZGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's who helped Elon Musk buy Twitter - The Washington Post,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItZnVuZGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223B2AAA0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The KMC intends to start swimming activities right from April 1 2023 when the swimming season kicks off in the city. ""The natural waterbody at Deshbandhu Park has been refurbished thoroughly and has been converted into a swimming pool of international standards. State competitions as well as national competitions can be hosted in this swimming pool. There are all sorts of modern facilities like filtration plant changing room arrangements for a continuous source of water etc required for an international standard pool"" a senior official of KMC's Parks and Gardens department said.

There are five pools in the waterbody that includes three for novices one for practice and one main pool for holding competitions. The main pool is 50 by 25 metres the three for novices are 15 by 10 metres and another 25 by 15 metres for practice. The depth is 2 metres.

The pools for the training will be maintained by the three swimming clubs but for managing the one for hosting competitions an expert agency needs to be selected.

The work for the development of the pool had begun a long time back under the initiative of former MLA and minister Sadhan Pande. However Pande fell ill and passed away after suffering from a prolonged illness in February this year. During the period of his illness the work had come to a standstill.

However with local councillor of ward 12 Minakshi Ganguly taking up the matter with the KMC the work for developing the pool has now been completed. The total cost involved has been to the tune of Rs 5 crore.

It is learnt that KMC had earlier written to the Sports Authority of India (SAI) to run the pool on a lease basis but the latter had informed that they too have a swimming infrastructure of international standards and hence cannot provide additional machinery for this pool.

""We will rope in an agency for running and maintenance of the pool and an EOI for the same will soon be floated"" the official added.",,,,,,

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

16 Biggest Utility Companies in the U.S.

16. PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL)

Market Capitalization as of December 23 2022: $21.7 billion

PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) is a Pennsylvania based electricity and gas provider. It serves customers in its home state and in Kentucky.

As is the case with oil companies PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) is also targeting renewable energy to expand its capacity.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A section of the $1.7 trillion spending bill passed Friday has been billed as a dramatic step toward shoring up retirement accounts of millions of U.S. workers. But the real windfall may go to a far more secure group: the financial services industry.

The retirement savings measure labeled Secure 2.0 would reset how people enroll in retirement plans — from requiring them to opt into plans to requiring them to opt out. The provision is designed to ensure greater participation.

It also allows workers to use their student loan payments as a substitute for their contributions to their retirement plans — meaning they can get matching retirement contributions from their employers by paying off that debt — increases the age for required distributions from plans and expands a tax-deductible saver's credit.

But as with so many far-reaching spending bills that get little public consideration provisions of the legislation also benefit corporate interests with a strong financial interest in the outcome.

“Some of these provisions are good and we want to help people who want to save — but this is a huge boon to the financial services industry"" says Monique Morrissey an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Some parts of the bill she says are “disguised as savings incentives.”

Daniel Halperin a Harvard law professor who specializes in tax policy and retirement savings said one of the most clear benefits to industry is the provision that gradually increases the age for mandatory distributions from 72 to 75. “The goal is to leave that money there for as long as possible” in order to collect administrative fees he said. “For people who have $5 to $7 to $10 million saved firms keep collecting fees. It's crazy to allow them to leave it there.”

Companies like BlackRock Funds Services Group​ Prudential Financial Pacific Life Insurance and business lobbying groups such as the Business Roundtable and American Council of Life Insurers are only some of the entities that lobbied lawmakers on Secure 2.0 Senate lobbying disclosures show.

Katherine DeBerry a representative from Prudential said the firm applauds the passage of Secure 2.0 stating that it ""will help ensure employees’ retirement savings last a lifetime.”

A representative from Blackrock declined to comment and Pacific Life the Business Roundtable and American Council of Life Insurers did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment. The disclosure forms require only minimal information about the outcome the lobbyists sought.

Retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) had been ushering Secure 2.0 through the massive spending bill known as an omnibus. Nearly half of the 92 provisions in Secure 2.0 come in full or part from Cardin-Portman legislation that was approved unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee in the summer.

“Senator Cardin is proud of his role producing a balanced package that is supported by business labor and consumer groups"" Cardin spokesperson Sue Walitsky said in a statement. “It protects and encourages retirement savings among the most vulnerable particularly lower-income individuals.”

Mollie Timmons a spokeswoman for Portman said the provisions of Secure 2.0 will “help part-time workers and help more small businesses offer retirement plans to their workers which is where most lower-income workers are employed.”

Both lawmakers' campaigns have received large contributions from firms tied to the retirement industry according to OpenSecrets — with Cardin receiving $329271 from the securities and investment industry from 2017 to 2022 and Portman receiving $515996 from the same industries in the same period.

There are good provisions in the legislation for average Americans experts say like the creation of employer emergency savings accounts alongside retirement accounts. The new accounts let workers create tax-protected rainy day funds. The legislation also expands the saver’s credit which provides a 50 percent tax credit on savings up to $2000 that will be deposited directly into a taxpayer’s IRA or retirement plan.

Morrissey and other retirement experts also say the provisions are a reminder of the need to shore up Social Security — the social program that benefits more than 70 million recipients — retirees disabled people and children. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in June says the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035.

For many Americans Social Security — financed by payroll taxes collected from workers and their employers — is their only means of retirement savings.

In the sweeping spending package passed Friday lawmakers authorized roughly half of the $1.4 billion spending increase proposed by the Biden administration for Social Security.

“Funding for the Social Security Administration has steadily eroded over the past decade while the number of people it serves has grown” said Nancy LeaMond AARP executive vice president. ""This has resulted in longer wait times overwhelmed field offices and disability processing times that have skyrocketed to an all-time high.

“More must be done"" she said.

In a Pew Research Center poll in January 57 percent of U.S. adults said that “taking steps to make the Social Security system financially sound” should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Securing Social Security got bipartisan support with 56% of Democrats and 58% of Republicans calling it a top priority.

Nancy Altman co-director of Social Security Works an advocacy group said Congress should be adequately funding Social Security if “the goal was to really help middle income families.”

Still the latest legislation is a small step meant to assist the millions of Americans who haven’t saved for retirement.

U.S. Census data show that roughly half of Americans are saving for their retirement. In 2020 58% of working-age baby boomers owned at least one type of retirement account followed by 56% of Gen X-ers 49% of millennials and 7.7% of Gen Z-ers.

Olivia Mitchell a Wharton economist who specializes in retirement savings says the results of Secure 2.0's passage may be felt most with workers at companies that match their employees' contributions.

She said research suggests that auto-enrollment can boost retirement plan coverage initially but participation may fall over time.

Mitchell studied the first state-based plan of its kind OregonSaves which auto-enrolled workers whose firms did not have retirement savings plans. She found that only 36% of workers had a positive balance after one year. Less than half of those in the plan were still contributing after a year.

Nonetheless she said “the fact remains that low-paid workers who change jobs often are a difficult target to reach via retirement saving plans.”

The term sustainable investing has become a familiar part of the vocabulary for today’s institutional and retail investors. However it was not always so.Although the concept of sustainable investing has been around for more than 100 years it was during the first half of the 20th century that the philosophy behind it took a more concrete shape.In 1950 The Pioneer Group US became the first fund house to screen out the so-called “sin-stocks” – tobacco alcohol and gambling — from their portfolios.In the 1960’s against the backdrop of increasing focus on civil rights environmental social and anti-war protest movements the clamor for the investor community to act responsibly grew manifold.Towards the end of the 20th century there were more than 26 sustainable-focused funds with assets under management worth $1.9 billion.In recent years climate change and humanitarian crises have increasingly contributed to the philosophy of sustainable investing. According to a Bloomberg study  sustainable investing has now gone mainstream with an estimated $37.8 trillion in assets under management in FY2022.According to the same study global ESG assets are on track to exceed $53 trillion by FY2025.Today the sustainable investing landscape is beaming with investment options right from ESG-focused funds to Green Bonds . However what is lacking is clarity on how investors can get to know which option is right for them?Below we unpack different approaches to sustainable investing and some of the common sustainable investment options and their associated benefits and risks.By understanding these key characteristics investors can make informed decisions when it comes to allocating their assets in a way that supports their values and the planet.When it comes to sustainable investing there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Instead investors must tailor their strategies to fit their unique goals and values.However broadly there are three main categories under sustainable investing.The underlying principle is to avoid investments in certain stocks or industries through negative screening according to defined ethical guidelines.This approach involves investing in projects or companies that are actively working to bring about a positive social or environmental change.This involves integrating ESG factors into the fundamental framework of the investment philosophy to the extent that these factors are material to investment performance.While each of these approaches has its own merits the key to successful sustainable investing is to find the approach that best aligns with your own values and goals.A 2019 study conducted by Morgan Stanley Institute for Investing revealed that interest with respect to sustainable investing has reached new heights among retail investors.More than 85% respondents expressed interest in sustainable investing and 86% believed that companies embracing ESG practices may potentially be more profitable and may be better long-term investments.As more and more people become aware of the benefits of supporting initiatives that protect the environment and promote social responsibility investment options too will rise simultaneously.Today some of the common sustainable investments include Green Bonds which finance environmental projects; responsible funds which invest in companies with strong ESG practices.Each option has its own pros and cons. We have tried to explain the options available and individuals can select one or a combination of these which is best suited to their needs.ESG-focused Funds invest in companies that have a strong ESG framework in place. These kinds of companies are often referred to as ""sustainable"" or ""responsible"" businesses.While ESG-focused funds have only been around for a few years they have already gained significant popularity — thanks to their strong performance.The MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index has posted annualised returns of 5.5% since its inception in 2007 outperforming the MSCI World Index by nearly 50 basis points.Green Bonds are debt instruments that are issued in order to finance projects with environmental benefits. The proceeds from green bonds can be used to finance a wide range of initiatives — from energy efficiency upgrades to renewable energy projects.According to NN Investment Partners a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Euro Green Bond Index has performed when compared to an index of regular euro-denominated corporate and sovereign bonds (Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Euro Aggregate Index). Green bonds generated returns of 7.4% compared to 6.0% for regular bonds in 2019.In the last two decades many studies have shown that companies with strong ESG ratings tend to outperform their peers over the long-term.This is because they are better managed have less exposure to risks and enjoy higher levels of employee productivity and customer loyalty.Moreover sustainable investments are often less volatile than traditional investments providing greater stability for investors.As the benefits of sustainable investing become more widely recognised it's likely that more investments will flow into this burgeoning asset class in the years ahead.For the responsible investor sustainable investing is an important part of creating a brighter future for all.(The author is Chief Investment Officer ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited)(Disclaimer: Recommendations suggestions views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

NEW DELHI: The government has forced into retirement 10 senior telecom department officials some with doubtful integrity as part of zero tolerance towards corruption . The move follows similar measures taken over the past few years where nearly 400 officers with a dubious track record were removed from government.Communications and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw approved the forced retirement for 10 senior DoT (Department of Telecom) officials including a joint secretary according to an official source.This is the first time DoT employees have been given forced retirement under Section 56(J) under Pension Rule 48 of CCS (Pension) Rules 1972.“The telecom minister has approved forced retirement for 10 senior DoT officials for doubtful integrity and the government’s zero tolerance for corruption. Out of 10 nine officials were working at director level and one as joint secretary” the source said.The move comes a day before the ‘Good Governance Day’ celebrated by the government every year.In September a senior BSNL official who was caught napping in Vaishnaw’s meeting after the cabinet cleared a Rs 1.6 lakh-crore package for the public sector enterprise was given voluntary retirement from service.In railways Vaishnaw had approved forced retirement for about 40 officials for non-performance and doubtful integrity; among them was a secretary level officer and two special secretary level officers. Earlier this year the government had told Parliament that between July 2014 and June 2022 the provision had been invoked against 395 officials across government departments and ministries. This included 203 Group A officers and 192 from Group B.The revenue department was among the first to use the clause to compulsorily retire officials whose track record was not clean. Subsequently other departments including railways have used the provision to deal with deadwood.The Centre has maintained that the government has the absolute right to retire officials prematurely on the ground of lack of integrity and ineffectiveness in public interest.The provision can be used against group A and B officers who have turned 50 and had entered the service before 35 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Vjb25vbXkvcG9saWN5L2lzLXRoZS1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXN0cmF0ZWdpY2FsbHktbWFuZXV2ZXJpbmctdGhlLWliYy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjQ4NDE5OS5jbXPSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZWNvbm9teS9wb2xpY3kvaXMtdGhlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc3RyYXRlZ2ljYWxseS1tYW5ldXZlcmluZy10aGUtaWJjL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjQ4NDE5OS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the government strategically manoeuvring the IBC?,"

The time taken to resolve cases under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is gradually increasing. In 2017-18 the average time for resolution was 230 days. This has increased to 679 days for current financial year to September 2022. Moreover 64% of the insolvency cases are ongoing for over 270 days. As a result the perception is that the IBC is losing its sheen however the government seems to be no hurry to streamline the code. Responding to a question in the last parliament session it was clarified that currently there was no proposal under consideration to reduce procedural delays of IBC. Similarly the government ruled out any fast-track process to resolve real estate companies. Nevertheless the extended arms of government seem to be playing an active role in resolving stressed assets.The first whiff of possible government intervention arose when an ex-Governor of Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) Urjit Patel wrote of the same in 2020. However for the common man this came to fore in the Union Budget of 2021 when National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) commonly referred as Bad Bank was proposed. Strangely post the announcement of Bad Bank the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) benches have been staffed sub-optimally. Fewer judges have led to delays which in turn has resulted in banks losing interest in the IBC instead gravitating towards NARCL Additionally RBI in October '22 notified regulatory framework for Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs). The framework allows ARCs to settle dues with borrowers after the proposal is examined by an Independent Advisory Committee and Board of Directors. Interestingly the requirement of compliance with Section 29A of IBC is not stipulated for settling with the borrower. The Memorandum of Association of NARCL too allows settlement of dues of borrowers. One will have to wait to see whether some interesting settlements are on the horizon.One of the earliest interventions of the Centre for resolution was the creation of SWAMIH Investment Fund for providing last mile funding of affordable and middle-income stalled housing projects including those projects that had been declared as non-performing assets or are pending insolvency proceedings before the NCLT.The case of stressed power assets buttresses the argument. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy in 2018 had identified 34 stressed projects with a capacity of 38870MW. Currently 10 projects of 9230MW capacity are under liquidation. Consequently Jhabua Power Plant was recently taken over by NTPC in a joint venture with other secured lenders wherein Power Finance Corporation (PFC) was the largest lender. Similarly for Lanco Amarkantak a consortium of PFC REC SJVN and Damodar Valley Corporation may outbid a large conglomerate like Adani — a conglomerate that helped resolve five projects with a capacity of 7670MW.Also PFC and REC Board in August ’22 approved creation of a 50:50 Power Asset Management Company to take over operate maintain and construct stressed power projects. Outside of IBC too public sector companies are active in restructuring stressed power assets. For example Suzlon had two rounds of restructuring in the recent past the second of which was a refinancing of loans of SBI led consortium by REC and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited.Similarly Central Government in consultation with the financial sector regulators notifies financial service providers for the purpose of insolvency proceedings i.e. currently only by a reference of RBI. Though not an optimum solution nevertheless the invisible hand is at work to resolve NBFCs subjected to IBC i.e. DHFL has been successfully resolved whereas SREI and Reliance Capital are amidst insolvency. One of the bidders for SREI is NARCL.This brings us to another arm of government that may end up playing a role in future i.e. The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NBFID). Of the many functions of NBFID one is to take over or refinance existing loans extended by a lender for infrastructure projects. Another function is to acquire an undertaking or institution the principal object of which is the promotion or development of infrastructure financing for projects. The aforesaid reads like the object clause of SREI! As there is no bar on NBFID to take over or refinance existing stressed loans it may venture in this arena.Finally IBBI has recently allowed a juristic person like an Insolvency Professional Entity (IPE) to act as an insolvency professional (IP). Earlier only individuals could act as IPs. Thus it is theoretically possible for a subsidiary of a public sector enterprise to function as an IP; 49% stake with the public sector enterprise and 51% with other individual IPs.The question is whether central planning is back in vogue or we are amidst a synchronicity of coincidences?The authhor is INSOL Fellow and Restructuring Advisor",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdGVsZWNvbS90ZWxlY29tLW1pbmlzdGVyLXZhaXNobmF3LW91c3RzLTEwLXNlbmlvci1kb3Qtb2ZmaWNlcnMtd2l0aC1kb3VidGZ1bC1pbnRlZ3JpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTY0NzkzOTEuY21z0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS90ZWxlY29tL3RlbGVjb20tbWluaXN0ZXItdmFpc2huYXctb3VzdHMtMTAtc2VuaW9yLWRvdC1vZmZpY2Vycy13aXRoLWRvdWJ0ZnVsLWludGVncml0eS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTY0NzkzOTEuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telecom Minister Vaishnaw ousts 10 senior DoT officers with doubtful integrity,"

Church in Bulls Head a 9000-square-foot section of parking lot is generally inactive. Used for overflow parking and sometimes shared by several bordering schools as a port of retreat during fire drills and other emergency evacuations the space is appropriately obscure idle and undeveloped. But if a hotly debated approval process is green-lighted and a special zoning permit allowed the practically unused corner of land would be transformed into a lithium-ion battery storage facility which will accumulate electrical energy and take pressure off the local grid when it is overly stressed.

Residents school administrators and church parishioners are not taking the possible conversion lightly.

“We are proactively addressing this issue because we are not comfortable with the idea of these units -- which are not yet time-tested for fire safety and toxic emissions -- being located 100 feet from our school” noted Gina DeSantis president of Moore Catholic High School which has recently launched a campaign against the battery energy storage system (BESS) development.

DeSantis said she learned about the proposed project last month after a school security guard witnessed a woman taking pictures of the school campus.

‘WHAT I LEARNED WAS DISCONCERTING’

“She said her company was launching an energy installation project on church grounds. So I researched and called every person involved -- if it’s going to be installed next to my campus I want to know all of the details” DeSantis said. “I didn’t like that this was shrouded in secrecy and what I learned was disconcerting.”

According to information obtained by DeSantis from New Leaf Energy the company developing the project the proposed BESS facility would consist of six large-scale rechargeable lithium-ion battery systems manufactured by Tesla. The information also outlined that each can store up to 20 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity and the intent of the project is for Con Edison to store energy produced during periods of low demand (e.g. at night) and then draw power from the facility when demand peaks.

The proposed energy site would be located in a 9000-square-foot section of this parking lot. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma-Hammel)

“Between the charging and discharge cycles the stored energy would sit unprotected in a church parking lot -- not in an industrial location as required by applicable zoning” DeSantis noted in a Nov. 22 letter to Community Board 2 stating her opposition to the project.

“Although its proponents claim their project is not a threat to the community they tried to keep the neighborhood uninformed of their plans” the letter continued. “Now that the details of this project have come to light it is clear that there are numerous reasons why the application should be denied … the most important reason is the safety of the children who attend the six schools that encircle the proposed project.”

Bulls Head residents have rallied around DeSantis’ crusade to halt the endeavor. New Leaf Energy which was founded in July 2022 issued a statement to dispel their concerns.

SAFETY A ‘TOP PRIORITY’

“It is important that the community understands that the safety of local residents is our top priority for this project. This includes our neighbors in nearby schools and local businesses” noted Corina Solis project developer at New Leaf Energy. “We only work with reputable battery manufacturers who adhere to the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) code and requirements and are approved for use in New York City by the FDNY. The safety protocols involved in installing battery storage systems include third-party testing certification and FDNY review of the fire safety of the full battery system ventilation and exhaust fire alarm and detection fire suppression remote monitoring and communication ....”

Solis also noted that a dedicated technology management team within the FDNY reviews individual models of battery technologies before installation on the project even begins.

“The potential for fire is extremely low and the systems are designed and tested to fail safely” she said. “Residents can rest assured we’re working with retired and current members of the FDNY to ensure the highest level of project safety. There will be secure fencing surrounding the equipment as an additional safety measure. The system will be locked and monitored by remote and central monitoring and CCTV. The fencing will block the line of sight to the public.”

But members of the community said they are not satisfied with that response.

“They say it’s 99% safe but what about that one percent?” said Dennis Quirk who works closely with the Seton Foundation’s Bishop Patrick V. Ahern High School a private special education program for students ranging from 14 to 21 years of age that also borders the site. “This should be located on a commercial property somewhere that is not in close proximity to the children. That one percent is too much when you’re dealing with kids. The safety of our children is paramount.”

Other schools near the site include: New World Preparatory Charter School also on the Moore Catholic campus; PS 60 located at 55 Merrill Ave.; Children At Play Preschool 40 Merrill Ave.; Hellenic Classical Charter School 1641 Richmond Ave.

OUTCRY FROM PARISHIONERS

And parishioners of Our Lady of Pity said they are enraged by the church’s lack of communication regarding this matter.

“The pastor didn’t loop anyone in” one parishioner said requesting anonymity. “He brokered this deal and the parishioners and trustees were left in the dark. This is a residential area and we have all of these schools. Who needs this system to be installed here?”

Citing fire danger and air toxicity the parishioner also questioned what will happen if such systems eventually become obsolete.

“Are we stuck with these units then? Do they just sit idle and become an eyesore?”

A small group of Our Lady of Pity churchgoers has launched a grassroots initiative to combat the site handing out flyers and going door-to-door with informational sheets on the project.

“If it’s so safe then why is it a big secret?” one Bulls Head resident asked. “There is no transparency and that’s unacceptable.”

Residents parishioners and school administrators say the parking lot which borders Moore Catholic High School is an inappropriate location for such a facility. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma-Hammel)

The Advance/SILive called the rectory to inquire about parishioners’ concerns and the church declined to comment. When asked about the validity of the community’s apprehension New Leaf simply stressed the importance of the work.

“Blackouts during the hottest days of the summer have impacted this community for years and can be highly disruptive to everyday life and local business” Solis said. “Our battery storage project will improve the quality of life for residents by reducing or eliminating the frequency of brownouts and blackouts throughout the summer.”

The proposed project is not the only one of its kind in Staten Island. A lithium-ion battery storage unit is currently being built on Giffords Lane in Great Kills. Its developer NineDot Energy said it should be operational and ready to harvest energy by 2023. And according to Frank Morano chair of Community Board 3 an application seeking to install an identical BESS unit at 405 Arthur Kill Rd. adjacent to Holtermann’s Bakery was recently rejected.

“We do have major concerns about these units” Morano said. “We see on the news that litihium-ion batteries easily catch fire and we know that those particular fires are extremely hard to put out. Toxic chemicals are also at play. There are too many issues so our final decision was to deny recommendation.”

Paul Rogers and Nick Petrakis owners of Energy Safety Response Group who were hired by New Leaf to articulate the safety and compliance of this project said that many of the community’s concerns are misguided.

“Most of the fires that you see on the news are because of counterfeit consumer products” Rogers said. “These systems are an entirely different entity.”

SAFETY CHECKS

Rogers and Petrakis both retired NYC firefighters work with companies across the country doing safety checks to ensure that these battery storage sites are compliant. The pair noted that New York state and city codes for these systems are exceptionally strict.

“There are always hazards and risks associated with energy storage in general” Petrakis said. “But New York City is strict in its requirements. The number of safety measures these technologies must pass just to be installed is considerable.”

According to Rogers and Petrakis the equipment proposed for Bulls Head endured “full scale 9540A” testing in which an overcharge was simulated and normal system protections were removed to see how the BESS would fare.

“The 9540A test which measures the fire safety hazards within battery systems replicates the worst-case scenario” Rogers said indicating that the units were pushed to their limit and no fire was observed. “You can’t ever say that equipment is 100% infallible but the way this system survived this very rigorous test is strong proof of its safety.”

A spokesperson for the FDNY said the project is still under review.

“The stationary energy storage installation is the subject of a Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA) application” the spokesperson said. “The department will fully review the application and meet with the applicant before making a recommendation to the BSA.”

Con Edison which is the beneficiary of this citywide battery storage push said it has no role in choosing site locations.

“Energy storage has a huge role to play in New York’s renewable energy future” the utility company said in a statement. “Well-sited battery projects can strengthen the reliability of our electric delivery system while helping to maximize the use and value of renewables. Through our Clean Energy Commitment Con Edison has pledged to support the development of 1000 megawatts of energy storage in our service area by 2030 the vast majority of which will be owned by our customers. Aside from a handful of examples specific project locations are chosen by other parties not by Con Edison. Our focus is helping to nurture the battery storage market and providing incentives where appropriate.”

NEXT STEPS IN THE PROCESS

Concerns about this project were brought before Community Board 2 and a Land Use Public Hearing was scheduled for Jan. 3 to address the issue but has been postponed.

According to Councilman David M. Carr (R-Mid-Island) the project is currently going through a process of consideration with the BSA seeking a special permit for a Battery Energy Storage System.

“This entails a hearing before the relevant Community Board which in this case is Community Board 2” Carr explained. “The CB’s vote is advisory and not binding.”

Additionally Carr said there are reviews and sign-offs required by the New York City Department of Buildings and the New York City Fire Department. Finally there will be a hearing and vote on the project by the BSA itself.

“I believe that New Leaf which is the company that is the project developer should actually be doing additional community engagement including a presentation in Bulls Head about the project in addition to any appearance they make at the Community Board” Carr said. “Previously constructed energy storage facilities of this type have not been built in residential neighborhoods and I think it’s incumbent on New Leaf to explain why they believe this site -- which is adjacent to a residential community -- is appropriate. I have also reached out to the Fire Department which is only just beginning their review process. Given all this they have a steep burden of proof in making their case to residents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3NtYWxsLXBsYW5lLWNyYXNoZXMtaW50by1zdG9yYWdlLWZhY2lsaXR5LW5lYXItbGl2ZXJtb3JlLW11bmljaXBhbC1haXJwb3J0L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zYW5mcmFuY2lzY28vbmV3cy9zbWFsbC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaGVzLWludG8tc3RvcmFnZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1uZWFyLWxpdmVybW9yZS1tdW5pY2lwYWwtYWlycG9ydC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Small plane crashes into storage facility near Livermore Municipal Airport,"LIVERMORE -- Fire crews are at the scene of a small plane crash at a storage facility about a half a mile away from the Livermore Municipal Airport early Saturday evening fire officials said.

Since the company cannot print new chipsets Huawei had to rely on Qualcomm to launch phones which is likely to continue in 2023.

It’s expected that Huawei will continue to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset for all of the devices launching in 2023. This will lead us to flaghip devices that will enter first in the arena.

For example Huawei is preparing two flagship devices in the first quarter. First is the Huawei Mate X3 foldable phone and second is the Huawei P60 series.

As per the past report Huawei could use Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset on the Mate X3 and the chip configurations for the P60 series remain unknown. However it’s possible for the phone maker to arrange a Gen 2 model hand.

Other than these Huawei also has mid-range devices such as Nova 11 or probably Nova 20 series that will also require to use of Qualcomm chipset. Later on the home ground special the Huawei Enjoy series is also in the queue to present a new model.

Furthermore Huawei will close the year with the new Huawei Mate series flaghip which is also predicted to be powered by a Qualcomm chip. Meanwhile there are also some models that could launch in between these schedules in any category.

Usecase:

As compared to last year 2022 is filled with Qualcomm chipsets and Huawei has launched various smartphones including Huawei Mate 50 and Nova 10 series with the latest Snapdragon mobile processors. That’s not it the chipset powered the latest Huawei Pocket S flip-style foldable with cheap pricing.

The absence of Kirin has brought in new cooperation between Qualcomm and Huawei which will continue to expand throughout 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk3MDY5LWlwaG9uZS0xNC1wcm8tYWxtb3N0LXN1cHBvcnRlZC1yYXktdHJhY2luZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The iPhone 14 Pro almost supported ray tracing,"Why it matters: Ray tracing is still mostly exclusive to current-gen game consoles and recent mid to high-end PC graphics cards but it's starting to appear on mobile hardware as well. A recent report reveals that Apple's latest iPhone could have marked a grand debut for portable ray tracing but the company abandoned the plans at the last minute.

If you found the iPhone 14 Pro's graphics processing to be a rather tepid improvement from its predecessor a report this week from The Information may reveal why. Sources claim the premium phone's GPU nearly supported hardware-accelerated ray tracing before a hasty backtrack hobbled it.

Unfortunately Apple's engineers found a flaw late in the iPhone 14 Pro's development that caused its GPU to draw too much power. To shore up the device's battery life and thermals Apple had to hurriedly pivot the A16 Bionic chip's graphics processor to that of the previous generation A15 found in the iPhone 13.

The setback was allegedly a major one in Apple's hardware design history leading to a shakeup in the company's graphics processing team. The report mentions broader talent loss among Apple's hardware design teams.

Had the iPhone 14 Pro launched with ray tracing it could have gone toe-to-toe with Android phones featuring Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 platform which supports ray tracing and Unreal Engine 5. Flagship devices like the Xiaomi 13 series Moto X40 and Vivo X90 Pro+ are already on the market powered by Qualcomm's latest SoC while others from Asus OnePlus and Sony are on the way.

Imagination Technologies showcased an early attempt at mobile ray tracing last year with its PowerVR IMG-CXT. In June this year Arm announced the Immortalis G715 a mobile GPU supporting ray tracing and variable rate shading.

Apple's mishap seems to have put the iPhone 14 Pro behind the competition in GPU performance. Graphics processing benchmarks put the A16 Bionic behind the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and MediaTek's Dimensity 9200 - the first Immortalis G715 chip.

Once Apple manages to get ray tracing in its silicon it will likely come to both its mobile and desktop chips. The Apple Silicon version of Resident Evil Village currently lacks the graphical feature unlike the Windows PS5 and Xbox Series versions but the game menu simply grays it out in the settings instead of removing it entirely. The insignificant detail could be interpreted as hinting that upcoming Apple Silicon was meant to support ray tracing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpem1vY2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvcmVkbWktbm90ZS0xMi1wcm8tc3BlZWQtZWRpdGlvbi1sYXVuY2gtZGF0ZS1jb25maXJtZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition Launch Date Confirmed,"Redmi is getting ready to introduce the Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition a new smartphone in the Note 12 series. The device will be performance-focused as suggested by its moniker and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G 5G chipset. It is among the most powerful midrange chipsets available. The manufacturer has also made some further changes to the gadget. In a few days it will be launched. To learn more about the precise launch date keep reading.

The Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition smartphone’s launch date has been officially confirmed by Xiaomi on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo. The report also indicates that the phone would have an OLED display and be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G+ chipset. The smartphone will officially debut on December 27 2022 in the Chinese market. Nevertheless the post also contains the phrase “More surprise releasing in the event!” which implies that there may be other launches.

The Speed Edition of the device features a square highlighted area around the camera bump that contains the Redmi branding. The device was teased in the brand-new Green colour. The manufacturer has made an effort to give the gadget a brand-new look. It is possible to see the triple rear camera cutout and the frame’s flat corners. We do not foresee any other changes to smartphones beyond the CPU and display.

The Speed Edition smartphone is expected to include a 6.7-inch OLED display with support for 120Hz rapid refresh rate Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G+ processor up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of onboard storage MIUI 14 pre-installed based on Android 13 50-megapixel triple rear cameras and more. All of these however stand out as being based on rumours and expectations. More information will become available after the formal launch.

Behind the north end zone at Raymond James Stadium a replica pirate ship adorned with Tampa Bay Buccaneers colors and logos.

One person came to the mind of Missouri’s head coach as he stood on the field and looked at the ship. Mississippi State coach Mike Leach who died unexpectedly on Dec. 12 after a heart attack.

""I think multiple people said there’s only going to be one Mike Leach” Drinkwitz said after the game. “Just wanted to say thanks.""

Due to the bowl practice schedule Drinkwitz was unable to attend a memorial for Leach on Tuesday. Instead he opted to wear a shirt adorned with the late coach’s image during Missouri’s loss to Wake Forest in the Gasparilla Bowl.

According to Drinkwitz the white shirt which featured a photo of Leach on the front and the Air Raid offensive pioneer’s signature “Swing your sword” phrase on the back was pulled together at the last moment by Missouri equipment manager Mike Kurowski.

“Asked Mike to see if he could pull a miracle off and get that shirt made” Drinkwitz said. “He did and it was just a tribute to (Leach) how much he’s meant to the game of college football and how much respect I have for him as a football coach and as a person.”

Drinkwitz wasn’t the only coach to honor Leach during a bowl game on Friday. During Houston’s Independence Bowl matchup with Louisiana Cougar head coach Dana Holgorsen and some members of his staff wore black hooded sweatshirts with “State” printed across the front.

The shirt was a signature look for Leach during his time at Mississippi State. Houston defeated Louisiana 23-16 in the game.

In addition to his time at Mississippi State Leach also was a head coach at Texas Tech and Washington State.

Tom Brady and rest of Bucs squad gifted electric scooters by Mike Evans

How did Tom Brady's 57th career game-winning comeback happen?

James Connor had scored the first touchdown of the game with 10:53 to play on 22-yard carry however from there Brady and company scored 10 unanswered points in the fourth period to take the game into overtime.

In overtime Arizona was stopped on its first drive and Brady led an offensive series that was capitalized on with a 40-yard field goal by Ryan Succop to seal the win for Tampa Bay.

Despite the win the seven-time Super Bowl winner racked up his third consecutive game with at least two interceptions with a pair of his throws being caught by cornerback Marco Wilson.

Brady notched the 57th comeback of his glorious career after trailing in the 4th quarter or overtime increasing his own all-time NFL mark.

Buccaneers one win away from returning to the playoffs

Brady's difficult season could have a happy ending because with the victory they have maintained the leadership of the NFC South and have their destiny in their hands since if they beat the Carolina Panthers at Raymond James Stadium they would be crowned champions of their division to have a place in the next playoffs.

Arizona had to use its third starting quarterback in as many games Trace McSorley got his first opportunity to open a game in his fourth NFL season after spending his first three years on the Baltimore Ravens' bench.

McSorley got this opportunity after injuries to starter Kyler Murray in the Week 14 Monday Night Football loss to the New England Patriots and Colt McCoy in the Week 15 loss to the Denver Broncos.

What's next for the Buccaneers and the Cardinals?

SGPs offer two unique opportunities unavailable in other markets: They uniquely tell a story that we can create through props spreads and totals and they allow us to combine outcomes that are correlated through a particular game angle but will not be priced into the odds set by books.

The goal in this space is to hit on SGPs that either tell unique stories about games and/or uncover correlated outcomes available only in the SGP market.

The Story: Taysom Hill plays most of the game in the brutal Cleveland weather.

The weather will be as ugly as can be in Cleveland with a real feel of -10°F and most importantly sustained 30 m.p.h. winds that will gust up to 50 m.p.h.

These elements make it near-impossible to throw the ball even semi-downfield which will limit the passing games altogether. I expect both teams to tilt extremely heavy to the run which will mean fewer total plays because the rush attempts will keep the clock moving.

The Saints will be without wide receivers Jarvis Landry and Chris Olave and the team refuses to let Alvin Kamara work his magic in the passing game often (he ran the same number of routes as David Johnson last week). Simply put the team is lacking in receiving options.

Given these circumstances it would be thoroughly unsurprising to see the Saints turn to Taysom Hill — who played a season-high percentage of snaps at QB last week — for most of this game. In this event Dalton would not throw enough passes to come close to his already tanking props and Hill would carry the ball often against a Browns run defense that ranks last in EPA allowed per play and second-to-last in yards allowed per carry.

Caesars SGP build: +2500

Andy Dalton: Under 140.5 passing yards

Andy Dalton: Under 0.5 passing touchdowns

Taysom Hill: Over 34.5 rushing yards

Taysom Hill: Anytime touchdown



The Story: Burrow carves up the New England pass defense en route to victory.

While the Patriots defense ranks first in the NFL in EPA allowed over the full season that number is heavily buoyed by the fact that the team has faced a slew of backup quarterbacks. In games against starting QBs Belichick's defense drops to 19th in EPA allowed per play.

However the New England run defense has been strong throughout the entire season — they rank top-10 in rush EPA allowed and yards allowed per carry — and their efficiency defending the run has only improved over the second half of the campaign.

This should tilt the Bengals to the air though it's not as if they’ve needed the plus matchup to do so in the past.

The Bengals have passed the ball at one of the league's highest rates all year especially since their bye in Week 10.

While the prop market is pricing in a significant efficiency downturn look for Burrow and the Bengals to pile up passing volume to their elite duo of Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins and do so with success against a middling Patriots pass defense.

Joe Burrow: 325+ passing yards

The Story: Sam Darnold finds Moore for a deep touchdown en route to a big passing day.

The Detroit Lions defense has faced the second-most deep attempts all season. They have struggled on such attempts too allowing the NFL's fourth-most yards and third-most EPA from these plays.

D.J. Moore has seen the seventh-most deep targets in the league and has generated a 95.7 grade on those targets.

While Darnold has struggled in most areas he ranks second league-wide in raw PFF grade and fifth in yards per attempt on passes thrown 20 or more yards down the field.

Against a scheme that invites teams to throw deep look for Darnold to take some downfield shots with Moore. And if one or two hit that should be enough to cash this bet.

It boasts unparalleled levels of performance out of the box that can go even further with DLSS 3 providing you can fit in your case and stomach its eye watering price tag. This latter point plays a large role in undermining the importance of team green’s flagship with the announcement of the company’s much more pivotal pixel pushers hopefully just over the horizon.

To be perfectly clear the RTX 4090 will remain the best graphics card money can buy for the foreseeable future with its closest competition (the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX) looking for a fight with the RTX 4080 instead. However there are fewer people that will buy let alone can afford such a costly GPU versus a prospective RTX 4070 4060 and 4050.

You need only take a look at any Steam Hardware Survey to see just how popular Nvidia’s mainstream offerings are and conversely how little prevalence 90 and 80 class graphics cards are among the user base. The GeForce GTX 1060 despite being six and a half years old remains the most popular pixel pusher on Valve’s platform with the RTX 2060 GTX 1650 RTX 3060 and 1050 Ti making up the rest of the top five GPUs.

There are a couple of reasons why 60 and 50 class graphics cards are so dominant among Steam users with an obvious one being price. The most expensive GPU out of that bunch cost $329 when it first launched and can be had for even less now. Looking at this data it’s pretty clear that while PC gamers strive to boost fps as high as possible the majority of them simply aren’t willing to break the bank for a higher frame rate.

Resolution understandably plays a big part in these purchase decisions too. The GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 to an extent are powerful enough for 4K gaming but the user base simply isn’t there yet. The prevalence of 1080p screens is undeniable with a whopping 65.08% market share among Steam users at the time of writing compared to the 13.42% enjoyed by 1440p and woefully small 2.33% adoption rate of 2160p.

Given that it makes more sense to upgrade your graphics card before bumping up the resolution of your gaming monitor it’ll likely take some time before the reign of 1080p comes to an end. Even 1440p hasn’t had its day in the sun like its HD counterpart. On the surface this could perhaps shift people away from waiting for this generation’s 50/60 class GPUs but they’ll likely be 4K performance powerhouses themselves armed with Nvidia DLSS 3.

Current rumours suggest that RTX 4060 performance will mirror the RTX 3070 which will be great if it launches for a competitive price. That said Nvidia’s next-gen (or perhaps current gen now) upscaling tech on its side increases its value versus its predecessors while diminishing the appeal of the more expensive GeForce graphics cards.

As hardware enthusiasts it’s easy to sometimes get caught up in the admittedly amazing things happening at the bleeding edge of technology. This has at least in my case warped how I view my own setup and created a completely misplaced fear of missing out on the latest and greatest technology like the GeForce RTX 4090.

Ultimately it’s not the most powerful GPUs that have come to define each generation of graphics card be it from Nvidia or AMD. In fact it’s the value oriented 50 and 60 class offerings that prove the most influential among PC builders and gamers alike making them the most important graphics cards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1yZWZyZXNoZXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA1MC13aXRoLWdhMTA3LWdwdS1sb3dlcnMtcG93ZXItY29uc3VtcHRpb24tYnktMTV3L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1yZWZyZXNoZXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA1MC13aXRoLWdhMTA3LWdwdS1sb3dlcnMtcG93ZXItY29uc3VtcHRpb24tYnktMTV3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Refreshes GeForce RTX 3050 With GA107 GPU Lowers Power Consumption By 15W,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='wccftech.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /nvidia-refreshes-geforce-rtx-3050-with-ga107-gpu-lowers-power-consumption-by-15w/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224ED07F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1yZWZyZXNoZXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA1MC13aXRoLWdhMTA3LWdwdS1sb3dlcnMtcG93ZXItY29uc3VtcHRpb24tYnktMTV3L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1yZWZyZXNoZXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA1MC13aXRoLWdhMTA3LWdwdS1sb3dlcnMtcG93ZXItY29uc3VtcHRpb24tYnktMTV3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei96b3RhYy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MDcwLXRpLWFtcC10cmluaXR5LWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtc2VyaWVzLWxlYWtlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ZOTAC GeForce RTX 4070 Ti AMP & TRINITY graphics card series leaked,"GeForce RTX 4080 4070 Ti from ZOTAC

ZOTAC is launching three custom models based on RTX 4070 Ti SKU.

In case there was any doubt RTX 4070 Ti graphics card is coming we have yet another custom designs to show you. The AMP Extreme AIRO is this flagship model based on this NVIDIA SKU featuring updated Ice Storm 2.0 cooling solution with three fans. The company is also launching two Trinity cards which finally bring 2.5-slot designs to the ZOTAC RTX 40 series.

ZOTAC’s AMP model is a 3.5-slot design just as thick as the RTX 4080 model. It also comes with one 16-pin power connector and this particular model will be bundled with 3×8pin to 16-pin power adapter. This is important because some RTX 4070 Ti cards will ship with 2×8pin adapter.

Similarly the RTX 4070 Ti Trinity OC will also use this adapter but the card is visibly thinner (2.5-slot). The same thickness with applies to non-OC variant however this model comes with dual 8-pin adapter. The Trinity cards use the same cooling solution but you can quickly distinguish the OC model by gold fan stickers.

The RTX 4070 Ti features full AD104 GPU with 7680 CUDA cores. It is also equipped with 12GB of GDDR6X memory across a 192-bit interface. So while the core count increased by 25% compared to last-gen RTX 3070 Ti the memory bandwidth will actually be lower by 17%. Whether that is going to affect performance we should know soon enough as independent reviews are to be published as early as January 4th.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzI1OTUtbW9uaXRvcnMtZm9yLWhpZ2gtZW5kLWdwdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 5 Monitors for Nvidia RTX 4090 RTX 4080 AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX & 7900 XT GPUs,"If you're upgrading to one of the newly released flagship GPUs from AMD or Nvidia then you probably won't want to be playing games on some crappy old monitor. These new graphics cards are so powerful that to harness the full benefits of what they have to offer you'll need a high quality display which will not only unlock new capabilities with these GPUs but offer a fair bit of future proofing. So here are our top 5 monitor recommendations for people buying new GeForce or Radeon GPUs.

The first thing to do when deciding which monitors are the best for high-end GPU shoppers is to actually look at high-end GPU performance. We have detailed reviews over the GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 as well as the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT so for more extensive thoughts we definitely recommend checking those out if you haven't already.

If we look at the average performance these GPUs offer we can see some general trends. For example at 1440p all four new high-end graphics cards will offer over 144 FPS in a 16 game sample on average with the RTX 4090 pumping out a whopping 210 FPS often CPU limited. Standard 1440p 144Hz to 165Hz monitors are really getting maxed out with these new GPUs which makes newer displays more attractive when buying in this sort of class.

Of course 1440p performance does vary between what sort of gaming you're intending on doing and the GPU you'll be thinking of buying. But today's competitive titles such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare II and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Extraction (plus countless others) can easily be ran well in excess of 200 FPS at 1440p on these new GPUs using suitable quality settings which makes high refresh rate gaming a reality not just at 1080p but 1440p as well.

If you're more of a single player gamer that prefers maxed out visuals then naturally frame rates will typically be lower but even then very respectable frame rates are still achievable. Cyberpunk 2077 hits over 150 FPS at 1440p using High Quality settings on an RTX 4090 without any upscaling Dying Light 2 is also capable of 150 FPS or more on most of these new GPUs. Same with Assassin's Creed Valhalla which averages 180 FPS using Very High Quality settings at 1440p on an RX 7900 XTX. Of course ray tracing changes this to some degree though with DLSS you're still looking at over 100 FPS in many titles using an RTX 40 series GPU.

As for 4K gaming these new GPUs are a bit of a beast for that. The RTX 4090 averages 142 FPS at 4K across our 16 game sample while the RX 7900 XT and RTX 4080 both hit around 110 FPS on average. Those are big numbers for 4K gaming showing that this generation is truly capable of using the high refresh rate capabilities of modern 4K monitors.

In fact the performance on offer here is rather crazy for 4K competitive gaming often delivering over 150 FPS on average - and while we'd probably stick to 1440p over 4K for that sort of gameplay people that like to dabble in all sorts of games will be very pleased with performance even if you choose to go 4K. And of course there are many single player titles that can comfortably exceed 60 FPS on a new GPU with the RTX 4090 in particular offering a consistent high refresh experience.

This sets the baseline performance expectations. Over 200 FPS is possible at 1440p especially in competitive games while high refresh rate 4K is also a reality across a variety of titles. So what monitors pair best with that sort of processing power? Here's come our recommendations...

#5

Gigabyte M28U - 28"" 4K 144Hz

Coming in the fifth spot is the Gigabyte M28U which is a 28-inch 4K 144Hz IPS gaming monitor that offers a really solid experience across several performance areas. It's not the highest end monitor by today's standards as it doesn't deliver any meaningful HDR but if you're thinking of upgrading to a new GPU to access 4K gaming for the first time then this is a great starting point - and it offers a suitably high refresh rate to handle what new GPUs are capable of.

The M28U has very good response time performance with an average transition in our testing of 4ms at 144Hz. It also has very good performance across the refresh range so for those using adaptive sync variable refresh rates you don't need to tweak overdrive settings to get the best experience.

This IPS monitor delivers speed in the ideal range for the latest generation of IPS panels so there's no funny business going on here for motion performance and this is complemented with great backlight strobing that works alongside adaptive sync. We also get HDMI 2.1 support which is essential when buying a new 4K monitor and it offers reasonable (though not ideal) compatibility with game consoles if you also have them.

Gigabyte's monitor also offers solid color quality reproduction thanks to its IPS panel so viewing angles are excellent and it packs a wide color gamut - though not as wide as the best monitors of today. Factory calibration is above average there's a very good sRGB mode for everyday use and contrast is typical for an IPS panel. To top it all off Gigabyte includes a KVM switch and a height adjustable stand which are neat feature additions.

While we'd recommend the M28U for most people looking for a good affordable 4K gaming monitor of this size the reason why it doesn't feature higher in this list is due to its lack of HDR hardware. To get true HDR in a product with similar specs you'll have to fork out several hundred dollars more. There are some gamers that aren't that interested in HDR though in which case the M28U is a great buy.

The M28U is available pretty consistently for $530 these days which is a great price and makes it usually the most affordable 28-inch monitor that uses this Innolux panel. There are a few similar products out there such as the MSI MAG281URF and Samsung Odyssey G7 S28 but they're often more expensive so we'd just get the M28U.

#4

Gigabyte M27Q-X - 27"" 1440p 240Hz

The Gigabyte M27Q-X takes the fourth spot and this is the most affordable monitor in this list but it's such a compelling option if you want a new display for high-end 1440p gaming that we had to include it.

The M27Q-X offers a 240Hz refresh rate 27-inch panel size and IPS technology at a low price point of just $420 making it an excellent bang for buck option to pair with new GPUs that can consistently deliver over 200 FPS at this resolution.

The M27Q X isn't the overall best 240Hz monitor that we've tested that accolade would go to the Asus ROG Swift PG279QM. But the Asus option costs $750 while the Gigabyte is just $420 and for roughly half the price you get remarkably close to the best option in this particular category.

The bang for buck factor is off the charts here given that these sort of specs used to start at $650+ earlier this year - and even if you were buying a high-end GPU and have heaps of money to spend we still find it hard to justifying buying the PG279QM which simply isn't $300 better.

The M27Q X offers a fast response time experience on par with today's good quality IPS LCD panels. When you combine response speed with a high refresh rate you get great motion clarity making this monitor highly suitable to competitive multiplayer gaming but with the versatility of a decent resolution for other types of games as well.

The only downside is the lack of a single overdrive mode experience which its more expensive competitors can offer depending on the model. But with the latest GPUs often pumping out bulk frames at 1440p you can typically set the monitor to the settings best optimized for high refresh rates making this a non issue.

Gigabyte also provides good color quality including a nice wide color gamut decent uniformity great viewing angles and a respectable job of factory calibration as far as gaming monitors go. We always like when a monitor delivers a good balance of performance across all categories and that's what the M27Q X provides. Like the M28U we talked about before there's no meaningful HDR experience here perhaps making this more of a competitive focused monitor.

#3

Samsung Odyssey Neo G7 - 32"" 4K 165Hz

In the number 3 spot is the best standard desktop 4K HDR gaming monitor and the best option for most people that want an excellent 4K experience with their new GPU: the Samsung Odyssey Neo G7.

This display combines a 32-inch 4K 165Hz curved VA panel with a 1196 zone full array local dimming backlight to deliver excellent HDR performance with stunning bright highlights and plenty of contrast in dark scenes.

If you were considering 4K gaming on your new graphics card then this pick is an upgrade on the Gigabyte M28U offering true HDR and faster motion performance though naturally this comes at a higher price.

But for gamers that want the additional visual benefits of HDR and are willing to pay for it Samsung's Neo G7 is a great choice. It's also an LCD meaning we get a normal subpixel structure no risk of burn-in and plenty of SDR brightness which are all weaknesses of the alternate HDR technology choice: OLEDs. This gives the Neo G7 additional versatility and suitability as a desktop productivity monitor though its curve is still geared heavily towards gaming and content consumption.

When you factor in its normal 32-inch screen size we think the Neo G7 is a good choice for many people whereas todays gaming-suitable 4K OLED options are all pretty large. We were impressed with its response times it has good color quality and its VA panel delivers excellent native contrast that assists with the HDR experience as well. We wouldn't recommend the 240Hz model the Neo G8 due to pixel inversion issues but this is effectively a non-issue on the Neo G7 which performed well in our testing.

Something to consider about buying a Neo G7 is that you probably want to wait for a discount. While the MSRP is $1300 - quite a high price tag - we have seen it go on sale multiple times since launch bringing it down to $1100 or even $800 in the best cases. Obviously at $800 it's a fantastic deal but even $1100 is pretty reasonable considering what this monitor offers.

#2

Asus ROG Swift PG27AQN - 27"" 1440p 360Hz

The latest GPUs from AMD and Nvidia are so fast at 1440p for competitive gaming often CPU bottlenecked that it would be crazy not to recommend the highest refresh rate 1440p monitor on the market in the number 2 position. That's the Asus ROG Swift PG27AQN which is an excellent gaming monitor that finally delivers a super high refresh rate at a resolution that isn't 1080p.

The PG27AQN is a 27-inch 1440p 360Hz IPS gaming monitor that offers seriously excellent performance including class-leading response times for an IPS LCD (and any 1440p monitor) extremely good motion clarity and input lag thanks to its stunning 360Hz refresh rate.

At this resolution there is no better product for smoothness and clarity which is perfect for competitive gamers that want to eek out every last drop they can or just want an excellent experience that's highly enjoyable.

On top of offering outstanding motion performance the PG27AQN also comes with great factory calibration and decent color quality this IPS panel is pretty decent and doesn't have the drawbacks of the typical TN panels we often see for esports displays.

This also makes it well suited to other types of gaming including single player titles so for those that play both multiplayer and single player games there's a lot to like here. The main drawback is the absence of true HDR so buyers are sacrificing this for the extreme speeds of 360Hz.

While this is undoubtedly a great monitor we would only recommend it to high-end gamers that have powerful hardware. You'll need a fast system to access the refresh rate on offer but also because the PG27AQN is very expensive at $1050.

The Gigabyte M27Q X is a much better value product but the PG27AQN is the better display which is why it ended up in the number 2 position.

#1

Alienware AW3423DW - 34"" 1440p Ultrawide 175Hz OLED

The Alienware AW3423DW takes the number one spot offering the best experience for high-end GPU buyers and gamers that want the ultimate setup. Excellent HDR elite response times decent resolution immersive ultrawide format and a refresh rate suitable for today's flagship graphics cards.

This monitor is a little more suited to gamers that want the best single player experience and best graphics extravaganza as opposed to our #2 pick in the Asus PG27AQN but really you can have a great multiplayer experience on an OLED as well.

The 3440 x 1440 resolution is a bit more taxing than regular 1440p so performance typically sits in between 1440p and 4K but even 4K runs well on RTX 40 and RX 7000 GPUs so that won't be an issue.

The big selling point to this Alienware display is its use of QD-OLED technology. This means you get proper true HDR performance thanks to OLED's self-lit pixel structure that results in deep zero-level blacks.

This QD-OLED panel can hit up to 1000 nits of brightness for small elements and just looks great displaying HDR content. Combined with its extremely fast response times (inherent to OLED technology) and fast 175Hz refresh rate (or 165Hz if you get the DWF variant) there is no better monitor on the entire market for HDR gaming right now. The motion performance is insane and rivals many 240Hz LCDs for clarity.

Of course aside from HDR gaming it's also a very capable SDR gaming monitor as well and despite featuring OLED tech it doesn't have some of the drawbacks we've seen from other OLED displays.

In particular full screen brightness of 240 nits is usable in most rooms (though not amazing) and there's no annoying features like automatic brightness limiters enabled when using the SDR mode. Dell also mitigates the anxiety over OLED's tendency to burn-in with a 3-year burn-in warranty.

However there are some drawbacks which do restrict the capabilities of the AW3423DW to content consumption. The triangle-RGB pixel structure is not great for text clarity and the screen coating isn't ideal. But for gaming most of these factors are not a major consideration which still makes it an excellent product and is our top choice for buyers today.

Of note a new Alienware AW3423DWF (DWF model) recently launched and they're basically the same monitor with a few slight differences. The removal of the Nvidia G-Sync module in favor of a more traditional scaler drops the price of the DWF model by $200 from $1300 to $1100.

One Honorable Mention

While those 5 displays are our current top options for new high-end GPU buyers we do have an additional noteworthy mention to make. The LG C2 OLED is an excellent choice for people that want a 4K OLED panel for HDR gaming though its lower 120Hz refresh rate and massive screen size (at least 42 inches) don't make it as suitable to everyone's gaming setup. It's currently selling for less than $800.

We do think the LG is in many ways a better display than the Samsung Odyssey Neo G7 but somewhat behind the Alienware AW3423DW though it's more of a niche option and why it wasn't part of our top 5.

Once again AMD is ready to take on NVIDIA's latest video cards with powerful alternatives at a lower price. And once again AMD still lags behind when it comes to ray tracing. That's pretty much the story behind the Radeon RX 7900 XT and 7900 XTX two confusingly-named GPUs meant to be the pinnacle of AMD's new RDNA 3 graphics architecture. At $899 and $999 respectively these cards are certainly easier to stomach than NVIDIA's $1199 RTX 4080 and the monstrously expensive $1599 RTX 4090 (both of which actually sell for far more at most stores).

For the most part AMD’s new cards deliver solid 4K gaming performance especially with the help of the company’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling technology. It's just a shame that you'll have to live with slower ray tracing performance than the competition. (On the bright side they offer a major ray tracing upgrade over AMD's last batch of Radeon GPUs.)

AMD 80 100 AMD Radeon 7900 XTX AMD finally delivers a GPU that excels at 4K gaming though its ray tracing still lags behind NVIDIA. Pros Excellent 4K performance with FSR

Cool under load

Cheaper than comparable NVIDIA card Cons Ray tracing isn’t as fast as NVIDIA

Driver issues at launch $999 at AMD

AMD 78 100 AMD Radeon 7900 XT AMD’s high-end RDNA 3 GPU delivers solid performance though it’s betterl-suited for 1440p than of 4K and ray tracing can't match NVIDIA. Pros Solid 4k and excellent 1440p speeds

Cool under load

FSR is a huge help

Much cheaper than NVIDIA Cons Ray tracing isn’t as fast as NVIDIA

Driver issues at launch

Could be cheaper $849 at AMD

So what makes these cards so special? They're the first GPU's built on a chiplet-based design similar to AMD's latest CPUs. That should allow AMD to tweak its designs easily down the line making it simpler to scale RDNA 3 down to laptops and lower-end GPUs. The 7900 XTX and XT feature a 5nm compute die and a 6nm memory die connected by a 5.3 TB/s interconnect. Together that means they can reach up to 61 teraflops of computing power and utilize up to 24GB of GDDR6 RAM.

AMD also claims it beefed up ray tracing performance by 50 percent per compute unit compared to its previous RDNA 2 architecture. Its video engine has been upgraded with support for AV1 encoding and decoding at up to 8K/60fps. That format isn't widely adopted yet but it aims to deliver better video compression for 4K and 8K footage compared to existing codecs like H.264.

AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT

True to their names the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT aren't very different. The top-end XTX sports 96 compute units the same amount of ray accelerators and clock speeds between 2.3Ghz and 2.5GHz. The XT meanwhile offers 84 compute and ray tracing units and clocks between 2GHz and 2.4GHz. The higher end card comes equipped with 24GB of GDDR6 RAM compared to 20GB on the XT. (Notably they both offer more memory than the 16GB RTX 4080.)

Given their similarities though it's unclear why anyone would opt to save $100 for the 7900 XT. If you're willing to spend close to $1000 on a video card you might as well go full-tilt and grab as much memory and power as you can. It would have been nice to see something slightly cheaper from AMD even if it meant delivering a card that's a bit slower than the 7900 XT.

The reference GPUs we're reviewing look and feel like premium components as we've come to expect from AMD's flagship cards. Most importantly though they only take up two slots on your motherboard whereas the enormous RTX 4080 and 4090 take up three. The 7900 XT and XTX also rely on two 8-pin power connections so you won't need to string any new PSU cables or cram in a dongle like with NVIDIA's cards. The 7900 XTX requires an 850-watt power supply thanks to its starting power draw of 355W while the XT model can work with a 750W PSU. Both cards hovered around 66C under load which was right between what we saw on the RTX 4080 and 4090.

While I was eager to see how these new GPUs compared to NVIDIAs I had to go through several rounds of driver and motherboard BIOS updates on my Ryzen 9 7900X before both cards were stable enough to actually use. That's something I occasionally run into when testing cutting-edge hardware (NVIDIA's cards also required a BIOS update) but there were still issues with AMD's cards even after that. Halo Infinite for example refused to launch matches with either card. Sometimes my PC would completely shut down while testing Cyberpunk 2077 which required me to unplug my desktop and reset my BIOS before Windows would boot again.

I've been benching AMD and NVIDIA video cards on this PC equipped with a premium Corsair 1000W PSU for the past several months without any stability issues. So it was a surprise to see just how much havoc these GPUs could wreak. I haven't seen other reviews complaining of similar issues so I'll chalk up my experience to early drivers. AMD just released a new driver that resolves an issue of high power draw during video encoding so I'm hoping the company is also trying to address the bugs I'm seeing.

None 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme Port Royal (Ray Tracing) Cyberpunk Blender AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX 12969 14696/68fps 4K FSR RT: 57fps 2899 AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT 11688 13247/61fps 4K FSRT RT: 50fps 3516 NVIDIA RTX 4080 12879 17780/82fps 4K DLSS RT: 74fps 9310 NVIDIA RTX 4090 16464 25405/117.62 fps 4K DLSS RT: 135fps 12335 AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT 7713 9104/42.15fps N/A N/A

When the cards ran smoothly they proved to be fairly competitive with the RTX 4080. The 7900 XTX was on-par with the 4080 when it came to 3DMark's TimeSpy Extreme benchmark and Geekbench 5's Compute test. The 7900 XT scored 1000 points lower on TimeSpy Extreme which was 3000 points higher than last year's RTX 3080 Ti but it was bested by that NVIDIA card when it came to Geekbench. Hitman 3 also ran blazingly fast on both cards in 4K reaching 165fps and 180fps when I flipped on FSR upscaling. Much like NVIDIA's cards there's little reason to run any game in 4K without the help of advanced upscaling tech.

The performance gulf between AMD and NVIDIA appeared once I started dabbling with ray tracing. The 7900 XTX and XT scored well below the RTX 4080 in the 3DMark Port Royal benchmark (at least they managed to beat the 3080 Ti). I also only saw around 57fps in Cyberpunk 2077 on the Radeon 7900 XTX while playing in 4K with full ray tracing and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution technology. Without FSR that frame rate dipped to an unplayable 25fps. The slower 7900 XT only managed to hit 50fps in 4K with FSR and ray tracing enabled.

Devindra Hardawar/Engadget

Basically if you're eager to get a video card that reaches well above 60fps in 4K with ray tracing you'll have to look elsewhere. But if you can live with 1440p you'll find more to like: The 7900 XTX reached 130fps in Cyberpunk with ray tracing FSR and graphics settings maxed while the 7900 XT hit 114fps. That's almost enough to max out a 120Hz gaming monitor! Personally I still find 4K gaming to be overrated — 1440p still looks great and you may never notice the benefits of pushing more pixels. But I’ll admit that I've been spoiled by NVIDIA's DLSS3 upscaling technology which allowed me to hit 74fps in Cyberpunk while playing in 4K with ray tracing. That's as close to gaming heaven as I've ever been.

But there's one thing you'll find with these AMD GPUs that you won't with NVIDIA's: Reasonable street prices. Even after their launch you can still snag the 7900XT and XTX close to retail. Many RTX 4080 models meanwhile are inching towards $1500 at online retailers (assuming you can find them in stock at all). Spending close to $1000 on a video card is still hard to stomach but at least it makes more sense than going all the way to $1500.

The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT are a solid step forward for AMD especially when it comes to 4K gaming. But I'm hoping the company can get its driver situation in order and perhaps eke out better ray tracing performance in the process. Most gamers are still better off waiting for AMD and NVIDIA's next-gen mid-range cards which are sure to be launching soon. But if you're an avowed AMD fan you've finally got the high-end upgrade you've been waiting for."

Asked about the performance this fiscal he said ""Our target is in the range of about ₹2200 crore. So as of now we look confident that we will cross the ₹2000 crore mark given the demand is buoyant.""

Sales bookings were more than ₹1500 crore last financial year he informed.

Piramal Realty is developing around 12000 apartments covering 13 million square feet area in phases across four residential projects in Mulund Thane Mahalaxmi and Byculla in the MMR.

Sawhney said the company is focusing aggressively on delivery. It has already started handing over the first set of 1000 apartments to its customers totalling about 1 million square feet.

In the next two years Piramal Realty is targeting to deliver another 6000000 (6 million) square feet.

""We will be making an investment of more than ₹3500 crore in construction over the next two years"" Sawhney said.

In this 6 million square feet area about 4500-5000 apartments will get delivered.

Out of the 13 million square feet of planned development Piramal Realty has so far launched around 8-8.5 million square feet in these four projects. The remaining 4-5 million square feet will be launched over the next two years.

The total sales revenue potential in these four projects is estimated at around ₹20000 crore of which around 50 per cent has already been achieved he said.

Sawhney highlighted that the company has established itself in the premium luxury segment of the market with a lot of emphasis on green initiatives better use of space inside as well as outside the apartments and community living.

""I can say at least in MMR we hold a decent position overall now that people are continuing to invest in the brand and have bought into the promise very well"" he observed.

Sawhney noted that housing demand remains strong despite rise in interest rates on home loans.

He said the mortgage rate is not the only factor in the customers mind while buying properties. Disposable income job security and salary increments are some of the other factors.

""We feel that post COVID there is very strong sentiment of home buying which gives us the confidence that it will continue to drive the demand in the market"" he added.

To encash this demand Sawhney said the company is looking at adding more land banks for future developments.

It is exploring partnerships with land owners for joint development.

In 2015 Piramal Realty had raised USD 235 million at an entity level from private equity players Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs.",,,,,,,,,

You can skip our detailed analysis of the robotics industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics.

Robotics refers to the design manufacturing and utilization of robots for tasks (in hardware and software) that have traditionally been performed by humans.

A Robot Takeover

Automation has been one of the most noteworthy trends in the world with 31% businesses having fully automated at-least one business function as of 2020 according to McKinsey.

Additionally businesses that had no plans to automate operations were reduced to 16% in 2020 from 20% in 2018. Further according to the World Economic Forum more than half of the jobs in the workflow will be performed by robots and algorithms by 2025.

Conventional wisdom suggests that robot-takeover of jobs won’t bode well for human workers. However it has been argued that the reverse is true with robots reducing humanity’s physical and mental labor while creating new jobs in the process.

The World Economic Forum forecasts suggest that automation will create 97 million new jobs for humans by 2025.

Driving Factors

Robotics offers various advantages in the workflow including consistent product/service quality in manufacturing reduction in operating costs and lead times and higher production output and efficiency.

Another key driving factor is long-term adaptation to the aging human population. In 2020 the number of people who were 60 years or older outnumbered children that were less than 5 years of age.

Those aged 65 or above comprised 1 in 11 people in the world in 2019. Their population is projected to reach 1.5 billion in 2050 per the UN figures with every 1 in 6 people being 65 years or older.

Automation and robotics will play an important role to compensate for the availability of fewer people of working age in the coming decades.

In fact the future is being played out in Japan where people who are aged 65 years or older make up 29% of the country’s population as of 2021. This has led Japan to early-adopt robotics and automation to remain competitive with 631 robots for every 10000 humans in the workforce in the country.

The necessity of automation has also made Japan pretty much a superpower in robotics. The country is the largest manufacturer and exporter of industrial robots in 2022.

Robotics Industry Outlook

The global robotics market is projected to reach $215 billion in value by 2030 growing at a solid CAGR of 23% according to Market Research Future. The industrial automation market on the other hand is much bigger but largely overlaps with the robotics market.

Story continues

According to Precedence Research the automation industry was valued at $197 billion in 2021 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 8.59% to a market value of $413 billion by 2030.

Major players in the two sibling industries include Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) Boston Dynamics Fanuc Corporation (TOKYO:6954.T) Seiko Epson Corporation (TOKYO:6724.T) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM).

Some of the leading countries in robotics are Japan Singapore and the US. Below we list the 12 most advanced countries in robotics.

Most Advanced Countries in Robotics

Our Methodology

For our list of the most advanced countries in robotics we’ve ranked them based on their technology scene in robotics as well as their level of automation. We’ve used data from the International Federation of Robotics especially for the robot density in the manufacturing workforce.

Here are the 12 most advanced nations in robotics.

12. China

China like other East Asian countries is one of the most advanced countries in robotics. According to data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) the Chinese market added over 240000 new robot units in 2021 an increase of 44% as compared to the year 2020. The country had 187 robots working in the manufacturing sector for every 10000 humans in the same year.

This suggests that a significant number of factories in China have implemented automation technologies including industrial robots in their operations.

Automation in the country is covering for the labor shortage due to an aging population while also creating new jobs. For instance 18 professions were announced by the Chinese Ministry for Human Resources and Social Security. One of these included the ‘Robotics Engineering Technician’ a job for R&D in control algorithms and operating systems for robots.

Siasun Robot&Automation Co.Ltd. (SHENZHEN:300024.SZ) is one of the leading robotics companies in China.

11. The Netherlands

The Netherlands is located in Northwestern Europe. It is known for high levels of automation as well as numerous robotics companies. As of 2021 the country’s robot density in the manufacturing workflow is 224 robots for every 10000 human workers according to the International Federation of Robotics.

The Netherlands is one of the pioneers in the most advanced robotics systems to date and is producing leading research from institutes like Radboud University. The country is also implementing AI and robotics technology to modernize industries like Agriculture with its Wageningen UR being the top institute innovating in robotics for agriculture.

10. Denmark

Denmark is a European country in the Scandinavian region. It is one of the most developed countries in terms of science technology GDP per Capita and other indicators. As of 2021 Denmark has 234 robots in the manufacturing-sector workforce for every 10000 humans.

One of the key players in the Danish robotics industry is the Danish Technological Institute which conducts research and development in a wide range of areas related to robotics and automation including collaborative robots service robots and manufacturing automation.

The institute also works closely with industry partners and has a number of commercial projects in development.

Another important player in the Danish robotics industry is Universal Robots a leading manufacturer of collaborative robots (also known as cobots). Based in Odense Denmark the company has developed a range of cobots that are used in a variety of applications including assembly welding packaging and material handling.

9. Switzerland

Switzerland is ninth on the list of most advanced countries in robotics. There are 240 robots for every 10000 human workers in the manufacturing industry in the country as of 2021. It is also home to some of the most noteworthy robotics companies in the world like ANYbotics.

Some of the key players in the robotics industry in Switzerland include ABB which is a global leader in industrial robotics and automation and Swisslog which specializes in logistics automation solutions.

Switzerland is also home to a number of research institutions and universities that are actively involved in robotics research and development. These include the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich which has a well-recognized robotics program.

8. Sweden

Sweden is another one of the most advanced countries when it comes to robotics. As of 2021 there are 321 robots per 10000 humans in the manufacturing labor-force in the country.

Sweden has a number of research institutions and universities that are involved in automation R&D. These include the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm which has a renowned automation program and the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg which has a strong focus on automation and control systems.

Sweden made headlines for Eve a lab robot that is extensively used in automating research processes in the country.

Apart from its own robotics companies Sweden also benefits from the presence of American companies like Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) Cognex Corporation (NYSE:CGNX) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

7. United States

The United States is one of the most advanced western nations in robotics. Its robots to human workers ratio is lower than Germany’s at 274 robots per 10000 humans but the country makes up for it with advanced robotics technology.

Some of the top tech corporations in the US like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) are highly focused on robotics.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) primarily develops high-end GPUs which have been found to have many applications for robotics and machine learning. Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) on the other hand are two of the premier automation companies in the US with a global presence.

There has been a record adoption of industrial robots in the US in the past decade. In 2019 however the trend started slowing down and the decline continued well into 2020 with 8% fewer installations than the previous year. The slow down can largely be attributed to the pandemic and factory closures due to lockdowns.

6. Hong Kong SAR

Hong Kong has an advanced manufacturing and research infrastructure which the country has used to advance in robotics among many other fields. There are 304 robots in Hong Kong for every 10000 human workers as of 2021. Given its population the number of robots amounts to over 224000.

Insight Robotics and Rehab Robotics are two of the most prominent robotics startups in Hong Kong. The small nation also hosts Hanson Robotics the designer and manufacturer of Sophia the Robot.

Two years ago consumers were not as well versed on the delicate inner workings of inventories raw consumer costs or shipping as they are today. The unwavering news of supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks including the time everyone collectively rooted for a container ship stuck in the Suez Canal readily educated consumers on just how intertwined the supply chain is with everyday life.

It was a shock to some consumers when earlier this year large retailers announced oversupply issues. Though consumers rejoiced in the news that some of their favorite stores would soon be rolling out sales those who work directly with the supply chain and the economy could recognize the considerable loss those companies were experiencing.

Retailers and manufacturers over-ordered and over-produced because they were not monitoring the economic indicators that showed supply chain constraints and labor shortages were easing.

The oversupply issue was largely caused by a lack of real-time data in planning and forecasting processes leading business leaders to make a costly overcorrection.

In a recent Accenture report 99% of the 450 CFOs surveyed reported that they need real-time data to make better decisions but only 16% of those surveyed said they have real-time data available today.

With current economic uncertainty riddling consumer sentiment an ongoing negative geopolitical climate and a continuing health crisis business professionals are asking themselves what can we do in response to current economic conditions to navigate upcoming volatility?

Create contingency plan

One of the most important things supply chain professionals can do to support planning and forecasting is to monitor external economic indicators that can directly affect their business performance. There are a multitude of indicators such as gas and oil prices weather raw material costs and industrial production that can drastically change when how and where product meets the consumer.

Due to the years of uncertainty and disruption customer-centric management is an emerging trend in supply chain planning and forecasting. This means many organizations are looking more at their customer data and overall consumer trends to make strategic business decisions. But with the lowest consumer sentiment in decades it can be difficult for companies to know how consumer spending is going to change over the next few months especially when the upcoming holiday season is taken into account.

This is where contingency planning comes into play. Now more than ever supply chain professionals need to monitor external economic data including consumer sentiment and spending to better understand what possible economic scenarios could play out. With real-time data on hand business leaders can use the projections to create best and worst possible outcomes and then plan and forecast within that range to help ensure business success.

Right now business leaders are filled with “what-if'' questions. What if consumer spending follows consumer sentiment? What if oil and gas prices rise again? What if we have to lay people off to afford wages for our employees? By monitoring the specific economic indicators that affect their business leaders can use the data to create agile contingency plans that allow for real-time updates based on how the economy changes.

Monitoring the data for proactive planning

Staying up to date on real-time economic data can be a heavy lift without the right technology. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning make it easy for business leaders to not only track economic indicators but also quantify impact and seize opportunities based on market change.

Not only can business leaders use this technology to navigate economic slowdown and volatility like we are currently experiencing but during a stable market leaders can get ahead of competitors by making constant improvements to their forecast and can drive overall better decision making and improve risk management.

AI and machine learning help business leaders become proactive decision makers instead of reactive. Even when unprecedented events come along and immediately change the economic outlook say a global pandemic for example business leaders that utilize external economic data can recover quickly and use their planning and forecasting technology to navigate the uncertainty until the time comes when they’re able to be proactive again.

Market volatility and economic uncertainty are guaranteed. As the economy ebbs and flows through various consumer trends and new business models so too will interest rates disposable income industrial production and more. By utilizing external economic data as indicators for planning and forecasting business leaders can navigate market changes and make more strategic business decisions using a mix of their company’s historic internal data and real-time economic data.",,,,,,,,,

“For those that don’t know in January a lot of things will be marked down to 49 cents to like less than $2” she says in the video.

The video shows her running through different categories of items such as slippers holiday-themed beauty items and other merchandise that she predicts will be available for serious markdowns after the Christmas holiday.

The video was viewed over 5.1 million times with several Ross employees sharing their thoughts in the comments section.

“I worked at Ross for 5 years and certain items markdown to .49 cents because they’re returned” one commenter wrote. “Wash clothing before wearing!”

“I use to work at Ross and although this is true the employees can’t show you [where] all this stuff is because they don’t know as well it really is a treasure hunt!” another explained. “The best way to score is to find items with a RED ticket. Also go through all of clearance. If you go to Ross often and you see the same couple items you can ask to see if they were missed at markdown but please don’t do that if they’re busy!”

“The lower priced items will be holiday leftovers and clothes that have been returned/clearance ONLY!” a third added. “I’ve been working for ross for 3 years.”

In a follow-up video @orlandoqponqueen addressed some of these concerns saying that she worked for Ross for seven years and “knows the ins and outs” of the way stores are stocked and priced.

“I know this video may not get the same views as the other one but I just want you guys to please respect the workers” she said. “Let them work and don’t hover over them.”

The Daily Dot reached out to @orlandoqponqueen via Instagram direct message and to Ross via press contact form.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NhbmRzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy8yMDIyLzEyL3NhbS1yb3NzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sam Ross | News Sports Jobs,"Samuel B. Ross II passed peacefully from this life at the age of 79 on Dec. 22 2022 in Jupiter Florida surrounded by his wife and two sons. Sam was born in Parkersburg WV on Sept. 21 1943 to the late Byrl and Elinor Ross. He attended Parkersburg schools before transferring and graduating from the Kiski School in Saltsburg PA. He then attended The Ohio State University where he earned a B.S. degree and then on to the University of Washington where he earned an MBA with an emphasis in Finance.

Sam is survived by his wife Susan Storck Ross son Samuel B. “Tres” Ross III and his wife Melissa and their 4 children Braeden Owen Christian and Ivy Ross all of Vienna and son Spencer Brownell Ross and his husband Phil of New York City. He is also survived by his niece Elizabeth Monroe Schuler and her husband Mike and their children Tristan Trevor and Tasha and his former wife Brownell Cochran. Sam was pre-deceased by his sister Janis and his stepson Robin.

Sam was the visionary behind many companies all based proudly in West Virginia. He started his career by opening his first convenience store in 1972 in Parkersburg. Within 3 months of opening his company SBR became a licensee of the Southland Corporation commonly known as 7-Eleven. It didn’t take long until 7-Eleven became the dominant convenience food store chain in West Virginia and Maine with additional stores in Ohio Indiana and New Hampshire.

In 1987 SBR began diversifying when it acquired Woodcraft Supply Corp. which specialized in woodworking tools and again in 1989 when it purchased Simonton Building Products a vinyl window manufacturer that became tremendously successful under SBR’s leadership. But it didn’t stop there! The SBR family eventually also grew to include Hy-Lite Products Style-Mark Fypon and Dixie Pacific.

After selling SBR in 2006 Sam thought he might retire. He had carved out the Woodcraft company and thought he might enjoy spending his days woodworking and growing Woodcraft but as usual his quest for growth just continued. He became involved in the exploration and production sector of the oil and gas industry through Hall Drilling LLC with Mike Hall. He and his wife also pursued their love of horses by getting involved in the horse racing industry through a company called Breeze Easy another venture with Mike Hall. He even purchased the historic Blennerhassett Hotel in downtown Parkersburg to keep it alive for the benefit of the Parkersburg Community. He continued to operate and improve the hotel with his son Tres until it was sold in 2019.

Sam was truly one of a kind. He was not only an extremely successful businessman but he was willing to share his knowledge his passion and his success with all of his employees. It was not enough for him to win; he insisted that his employees and his customers win as well. In the early years of his business career Sam along with his management team at the time developed a standard of performance that they called “The SBR Way” which stated that the employee was the #1 resource to achieve success in any company. This standard was used to guide each of the SBR companies to achieve phenomenal success while maintaining a fun and caring atmosphere.

Sam was incredibly proud to live and work in West Virginia. He was committed to giving back to the communities that had enabled SBR to be so successful and insisted that a percentage of all net income generated from his companies be returned to the community in which they operated through charitable acts and contributions. In 2006 Sam and his family created the Ross Foundation which was designed to support charitable efforts in Wood Ritchie Doddridge Pleasants and Jackson Counties in WV and is led by his son Tres. One of the most exciting ventures so far is the creation of a children’s museum in Parkersburg named Discovery World on Market which is scheduled to open in the Spring of 2023.

Through the years Sam had received several honors and accolades for the many business achievements and charitable contributions he made to the communities in which he operated. This was difficult for him as Sam was always more focused on succeeding than he was receiving public recognition for those successes. Nevertheless he was tremendously honored by his induction into the West Virginia University Business Hall of Fame in 2006 and when he was selected to be a member of the World President’s Organization.

But beyond those who will remember his business success there was a man who will be deeply missed by his family. His son Tres will always treasure the times they had traveling the world together especially their cycling trips through Colorado and France always with wine in tow. His son Spencer will forever be thankful for all of the passions his father introduced him to especially cherishing their first Broadway show together at the age of 6. And throughout the 35 years they were married his loving wife Susan was honored to support all of his endeavors by his side. And Sam’s love for his dogs Connor Finn and especially the recently departed William (“Puppy”) knew no bounds.

An avid outdoorsman Sam was always happiest with a fishing pole in his hand fly fishing out west. He was a voracious reader always inquisitive and in search of more knowledge. And there were few things he loved more than pasta and a glass of fine wine a trait that his children will definitely continue.

Ask anyone who knew him and they will tell you that there will never be another Sam Ross. His legend will live forever through his example of a well lived life the generosity of his spirit and the mark he made on the hearts and values of thousands of people throughout the world. He will be truly missed.

A “Celebration of Life” ceremony will be held at a later date to be announced.

Time is officially running out to shop for Christmas gifts in stores and online for pickup and same-day delivery. The big picture: With Christmas Eve falling on a Saturday expect stores to be busier than last year. However the epic winter storm hitting swaths of the U.S. could affect store and mall hours.

There's been a resurgence of consumers shopping in stores this holiday season according to the National Retail Federation.

The shopping season also began earlier than in past years with retailers wanting to help consumers spread out their purchases as they deal with higher costs due to inflation.

Last-minute gifts and shopping

Yes but: The majority of stores will close early on Christmas Eve and will stay closed on Christmas like in past years.

70% of shoppers plan to shop the week after Christmas an NRF survey found.

Meanwhile a CouponBirds survey of 3150 Americans found close to one-third of couples said they would wait until Christmas Eve to shop for their partner's gift.

Christmas Eve same-day delivery

Major retailers will offer same-day delivery through Christmas Eve with on-demand companies including Instacart Shipt DoorDash Uber and Roadie.

Be smart: Place orders early in the day as availability will be limited.

Instacart told Axios that its platform will operate during normal business hours on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day but “the shopping experience will be dependent on local store openings/hours.”

Other projects around the city aim to bring new parks grocery options and on-demand transit to residents in the northwest Valley.

Here are some of the projects and plans to watch in Surprise in 2023:

The Village at Prasada: The project which celebrated some restaurant and retail openings in 2022 will see an influx of new restaurants and stores in 2023. The outdoor retail and entertainment center being developed by SimonCRE will total about 700000 square feet and bring in big-box retailers restaurants and family entertainment. On tap to open in 2023 at the Village at Prasada include: FatCats Five Below Floor & Décor HomeGoods Marshalls PetSmart Ross Sprouts TJ Maxx Total Wine and Ulta. The center is located near Waddell Road and Loop 303.

Prasada North: After the Village at Prasada was fully leased the developer SimonCRE announced plans for an additional 350000-square-foot project north of the Village which is near Waddell Road and Loop 303. The development which is under construction will include restaurants and shops. The developer is in the final stages of commitments with businesses interested in locating there.

The Fields at Countryside Park: The new park will officially open in January 2023 and will have grass fields and a new playground. The park is located at Greenway Road and Parkview Place and will have eight multi-sport fields.

“Microtransit” program: The city is in discussions with WeRide a company that provides on-demand rideshare to a localized area within the city at about the same cost as a bus ride officials said at a City Council work session in December. WeRide which has begun pilot programs in Goodyear and Avondale already uses a smartphone app for passengers to order a ride to locations in a designated area of the city. Surprise anticipates starting the pilot program in March according to city documents.

Fry’s grocery store and new traffic signal at Pat Tillman Boulevard and 163rd Avenue: A shopping center anchored by a Fry’s grocery store will open at Pat Tillman and 163rd Avenue which will also include a pharmacy drive-thru gas station and retail shops. A new traffic signal will also be coming to that intersection in spring 2023 to help accommodate traffic to the center.

“Over the last few years we have developed more destinations than any other cruise company and this new partnership will allow us to implement a capital-light investment framework to accelerate the development of strategic destinations around the world. “We selected iCON because of our shared strategic priorities – delivering the best experiences in the world responsibly – and our shared commitment to sustainability being a committed partner in each of the destinations we visit and exploring the very best locations around the world” Liberty commented.

If you’re a fan of cruises then you’ve definitely heard of the Royal Caribbean company which represents one of the biggest cruise ship operators in the world. While it has sailed all over the physical world it has finally embarked on a voyage into the Metaverse.

As per reports the company has confirmed its own NFT powered virtual experience called the ‘Wonderverse’.

Take a Dive into the Wonderverse

From all indications the Wonderverse will offer Royal Caribbean customers as much of a treat in the virtual world as in the physical. It features a Metaverse version of the company’s ships that users can explore using their avatars.

While on the ships customers can navigate four different areas and also participate in mini-competitions and activities. This will mirror the experiences that they would have on real-life cruise ships and this can now be enjoyed virtually.

In addition the Royal Caribbean company will also use this as an avenue to pass information to customers. Essentially incorporating an in-Metaverse billboard that displays information about upcoming voyages that they can sign up for. Needless to say this is one of the most ambitious uses of the Metaverse by a hospitality and tourism company seen so far.

“We’ve revolutionized cruise ship design and now we’re revolutionizing where cruise ships are experienced” said Michael Scheiner who is the Chief Marketing Officer of Celebrity Cruises’ a brand operated by the Royal Caribbean.

This comes months after the company launched a successful NFT drop.

The company operates several well-known brands in various global markets including North America the U.K. Germany Australia and Italy and has long relied on its strong brand presence in these markets to drive business and generate profits.

However the uneven reopening of cruise travel in the wake of COVID-19 in Asia and Australia in particular and the direct impact of the conflict in Ukraine on European countries have had a significant effect on the company’s results.

Carnival’s Strongest Suit Now Working Against Them

Carnival Corporation’s brand strategy has long been one where it operates several brands that are location specific. Think Costa Cruises and Italy AIDA and Germany P&O in the UK and Australia and so forth.

This strategy has long been one of the strong points of Carnival Corporation and propelled it to be to world’s largest cruise operator.

In Carnival Corporations’ fourth quarter earnings call CEO Josh Weinstein explained: “We believe that having the No. 1 or No. 2 brand in each of the largest cruise markets such as North America the U.K. Germany Australia Italy France and Spain is the foundation of our portfolio strategy and allows us to tailor our experiences and offerings to those specific source markets enabling us to generate stronger brand loyalty and gain greater penetration and profit.“

One of the main challenges facing Carnival Corporation has been the lagging reopening of specific markets particularly Australia Asia and the Baltics.

These markets have been extremely important and the main base for drawing in non-North American guests for the company in 2019.

The markets that are now lagging behind accounted for around 2 million people or one-third of its total non-North American guests and were particularly reliant on the company’s Costa and Princess brands representing 40% of Costa’s guests and 25% of Princess’ guests.

Costa Cruises in particular had been betting heavily on expanding its operations in China. For the Chinese market the cruise line developed several new cruise ships aimed solely at the Asian market. However these vessels are now either not sailing or being transferred to Carnival Cruise Line under the ‘Carnival Fun Italian Style‘ program.

With Australia currently in a similar position to North America a year ago and Japan further behind the recovery has been slower than expected leading to those changes in deployment and guest-sourcing approaches as Carnival anticipates ongoing impacts particularly in the first half of 2023.

In addition to the challenges posed by the slow reopening of these markets Carnival Corporation has also been affected by the conflict in Ukraine. This has weighed heavily on consumer confidence in regions served by the company’s Costa and AIDA brands leading to greater uncertainty and closer-in booking patterns.

What’s the Solution?

To help mitigate these impacts Carnival has made strategic deployment decisions focusing on solutions that reduce the friction of air travel lower overall costs and facilitate closer-in bookings.

This strategy aims to attract more new-to-cruise guests and position the company as a more attractive value proposition than land-based alternatives.

Due to the challenges mentioned above Carnival Corporation has taken steps to optimize its fleet and transform its business to position itself for long-term growth.

The company has disposed of 26 ships since the pandemic’s start while also introducing larger more efficient ships such as the Excel-class Carnival Celebration Mardi Gras Costa Toscana Costa Smeralda AIDAnova and AIDAcosma and Iona and Arvia for P&O Cruises.

On top of the 26 ships it has already disposed of Carnival is also planning to offload at least three smaller less efficient cruise ships in the near future. Some rumors even include selling off various parts of the business such as Seabourn Cruise Line.

The new ships have resulted in nearly a quarter of the company’s fleet consisting of new capacity with an 8-percentage-point increase in balcony cabins and a significant increase and variety of onboard experiences that generate additional revenues.

Having a fleet of ships that is fast becoming one of the youngest in the industry Carnival’s problems remain though. How to draw 2 million guests back to those ships and fill them up?

Bringing ships back to the Caribbean and North America will only work to a point especially since Carnival Cruise Line already has a large chunk of the market.

By contrast a company such as the Royal Caribbean Group does not have this problem at all focusing primarily on the US middle-class market with Royal Caribbean International and the premium North American and European market through Celebrity Cruises and Silverseas.

Whether the plans will work out for Weinstein and his nine cruise brands remains to be seen. One thing is certain investors are not seeing the recent numbers as positive. Carnival Corporation is suffering from extremely high debt and continues to post losses something it will need to address as soon as possible.",,,

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

The finding of 'reasonable' evidence to conclude that the U.S. ally had breached international law in its conduct of the war in Gaza was released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday.

It is the strongest statement that the Biden administration has made yet.

But the caveat that the U.S. was unable immediately to link specific U.S. weapons to individual strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.

The first-of-its-kind assessment which was compelled by President Joe Biden´s fellow Democrats in Congress comes after seven months of airstrikes ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35000 Palestinians mostly women and children.

Those were launched in response to Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 2023 that saw 1300 Israelis murdered.

While U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes the report said given Israel's 'significant reliance' on U.S.-made weapons it was 'reasonable to assess' that they had been used by Israel's security forces in instances 'inconsistent' with its obligations under international humanitarian law 'or with best practices for mitigating civilian harm.'

Israel's military has the experience technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians but 'the results on the ground including high levels of civilian casualties raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases' the report said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen the Maryland Democrat who led the push in Congress told reporters that even even though the administration had reached a general finding 'they´re ducking a determination on the hard cases politically inconvenient cases.'

Biden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s war against Hamas.

He has faced growing rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and the onset of famine caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the movement of food and aid into Gaza.

Tensions have been heightened further in recent weeks by Netanyahu´s pledge to expand the Israeli military´s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah despite Biden's adamant opposition.

Biden is in the closing months of a tough reelection campaign against Donald Trump. He faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need.

Rep. Michael McCaul the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the review was unnecessary 'and only contributes to politically motivated anti-Israel sentiment.'

'Now is the time to stand with our ally Israel and ensure they have the tools they need' he said in a statement.

The Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a shipment of 3500 bombs out of concern over Israel´s threatened offensive on Rafah a southern city crowded with more than a million Palestinians a senior administration official said.

The presidential directive agreed to in February obligated the Defense and State departments to conduct 'an assessment of any credible reports or allegations that such defense articles and as appropriate defense services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law including international humanitarian law.'

Nothing in the presidential directive would have triggered any cutoff of arms if the administration had more definitively ruled that Israel´s conduct had violated international law.

The agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they deemed that Israel has acted to 'arbitrarily to deny restrict or otherwise impede directly or indirectly' delivery of any U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians there.

On this question the report cited 'deep concerns' that Israel played a significant role in preventing adequate aid from reaching starving Palestinians. However it said Israel had recently taken some positive steps although still inadequate and the U.S. government did not currently find Israel restricting aid deliveries in a way that violated U.S. law governing foreign militaries that receive U.S. military aid.

Van Hollen accused the administration of glossing over what he said were clear Israeli blocks on food and aid deliveries during much of the war. 'That´s why we have hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that have nothing to do with Hamas on the verge of starvation' he said.

Lawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support an accusation the Biden administration denies. They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific Israeli airstrikes on schools crowded neighborhoods medical workers aid convoys and other targets and restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza violated the laws of war and human rights.

Their opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel´s military and further heighten tensions with Netanyahu´s hard-right government over its conduct of the war against Hamas.

Any finding against Israel also could endanger Biden´s support in this year's presidential elections from some voters who keenly support Israel.

At the time the White House agreed to the review it was working to head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to Israel.

Israel launched its offensive after an Oct. 7 assault into Israel led by Hamas killed about 1200 people. Two-thirds of the Palestinians killed since then have been women and children according to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.

Human rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January in a case brought by South Africa the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it could to prevent death destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

Israel says it is following all U.S. and international law that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.

Biden in December said 'indiscriminate bombing' was costing Israel international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April the Biden administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to Israel if it didn´t change its handling of the war and humanitarian aid.

Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s and early 1990s were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or toward Palestinians.

A report to the Biden administration by an unofficial self-formed panel including military experts academics and former State Department officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys journalists hospitals schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that the civilian death toll in those strikes - such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians - was disproportionate to the blow against any military target."

For example although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue if you held shares since 2005 you'd have done very well indeed. Nonetheless only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.

Given this risk we thought we'd take a look at whether Ebusco Holding (AMS:EBUS) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. In this article we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. Let's start with an examination of the business' cash relative to its cash burn.

See our latest analysis for Ebusco Holding

How Long Is Ebusco Holding's Cash Runway?

A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. As at June 2022 Ebusco Holding had cash of €151m and such minimal debt that we can ignore it for the purposes of this analysis. Looking at the last year the company burnt through €86m. So it had a cash runway of approximately 21 months from June 2022. Importantly analysts think that Ebusco Holding will reach cashflow breakeven in 3 years. That means unless the company reduces its cash burn quickly it may well look to raise more cash. Depicted below you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.

How Well Is Ebusco Holding Growing?

It was quite stunning to see that Ebusco Holding increased its cash burn by 1056% over the last year. As if that's not bad enough the operating revenue also dropped by 37% making us very wary indeed. In light of the above-mentioned we're pretty wary of the trajectory the company seems to be on. Clearly however the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.

How Hard Would It Be For Ebusco Holding To Raise More Cash For Growth?

Since Ebusco Holding can't yet boast improving growth metrics the market will likely be considering how it can raise more cash if need be. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.

Since it has a market capitalisation of €802m Ebusco Holding's €86m in cash burn equates to about 11% of its market value. As a result we'd venture that the company could raise more cash for growth without much trouble albeit at the cost of some dilution.

How Risky Is Ebusco Holding's Cash Burn Situation?

Even though its increasing cash burn makes us a little nervous we are compelled to mention that we thought Ebusco Holding's cash burn relative to its market cap was relatively promising. Shareholders can take heart from the fact that analysts are forecasting it will reach breakeven. We don't think its cash burn is particularly problematic but after considering the range of factors in this article we do think shareholders should be monitoring how it changes over time. For us it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock. For example it could be interesting to see how much the Ebusco Holding CEO receives in total remuneration.

Of course Ebusco Holding may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity or this list of stocks that insiders are buying.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

Chris Hill: TikTok is a private company that's causing problems for some of the biggest public companies. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me today Motley Fool senior analyst Bill Mann. Thanks for being here.

Bill Mann: Hey Chris. How are you?

Chris Hill: I'm doing well. The two biggest players in digital advertising are unsurprisingly Google and Meta Platforms but it appears that their collective bigness is getting a little smaller. According to industry analysis reported by Axios that this year the two companies are going to bring in less than half of all digital advertising in the U.S. That's the first time since 2014 that that has happened. They are still dominant but their dominance is coming down a little bit and there are few ripple effects I want to get to. But I think first and foremost Bill if you are a shareholder of either Alphabet or Meta Platforms how concerning is this to you?

Bill Mann: I would describe it as being at least partially concerning. There are two places where most of the incursions have come. The first is what very broadly is called e-commerce but you could very specifically call it Amazon doing their own ads and the other place is TikTok. TikTok has taken a pretty substantial market share especially among the types of consumers that advertisers most favor. The 30 and below tend to do searches using TikTok rather than Google or Facebook or any of the other search engines so it is a bit of a sea change. It's also important to note that it is still a rapidly growing rapidly changing industry. So I wouldn't describe it as a four-alarm fire but they should in fact wonder where that warmth is coming from.

Chris Hill: I want to get to TikTok in a second. But first one of the things we've heard and maybe it's the proximity of where we live relative to Capitol Hill. But over the past decade or so we have heard various drumbeats around big tech monopolies. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are very much on that list. If you are working in the corporate law offices of either of these companies are you quietly heartened by this? Because it makes the monopoly case against them a little bit harder doesn't it?

Bill Mann: Are you going with the bad news as good news argument?

Chris Hill: I'm trying not to do that. Let's just go with if this is as you said it's not a four-alarm fire but it's partially concerning. Is that a silver lining here?

Bill Mann: Let's be clear. Neither you nor I are lawyers in general much less antitrust lawyers but we do have to think about this and I do want to make sure that we'd say that so that anybody who isn't antitrust lawyer out there isn't saying well that's not correct. But I think that probably here in the U.S. these companies being American companies have seen a fairly substantial protection against antitrust. Where they really have had to worry has been Europe where being protective of Google and Facebook and Apple if you want to throw another one into the mix there's not really been an upside to the downside. Yes I think this actually probably gives them a little bit more of an argument but it's called a duopoly for a reason and that reason is still that 50% of a $30 billion market is still a massive massive market share. It may actually give them a little more cover to operate. I don't know that it gives them any cover to do what you would want companies to do in times like these when market prices are depressed which is to go out and go shopping. I think they still would have a pretty substantial argument against being allowed to do much.

Chris Hill: Let's go back to TikTok for a second because we have seen just over the past month or so a couple of state governments ban government employees from having TikTok on their devices. There is legislation moving somewhere through the United States Congress to do the same at the federal government level where. Do you see this going? If you had to bet on an outcome what would you be betting on?

Bill Mann: Man it is inarguable to me that TikTok as the leading product of a Chinese company called ByteDance is in fact tracking us in ways that we may be incredibly uncomfortable with if we put a lot of thought into it. There are also arguments to be made that TikTok at this point supports so many small businesses in the U.S. that it has become unbannable that it's something too big to fail too big to ban. I'm not sure that I'd buy that. I do think that the argument needs to come down to one of protection and I just don't know that the will is there at this point in time to make that happen.

Chris Hill: I can think of several companies that would be thrilled at the news that TikTok is --

Bill Mann: It's possible. We've talked about a couple of them.

Chris Hill: I did let's just call it a hyperlocal poll of the three younger people in my family and I just posed to them like ""Hey just indulge me for a second. Let's just say TikTok went away. Let's just say it went away"" and of course they were immediately like ""Wait is it going away?"" I'm like ""No just work with me. Let's just say it's going away where would you go for short-form video?"" and all three of them pointed to YouTube Shorts in part because of the way that Google and YouTube are really pushing short videos. I'm sure that's part of it but I guess to your point about is TikTok unbannable that has to be part of the equation. Part of the equation for any regulator thinking about that part of the equation has to be like well wait who's going to benefit from this? Right the big tech companies just get more dominance in a platform where they're getting their butts kicked at the moment.

Bill Mann: Yeah I think that's exactly right. I mean I think in the short term they would benefit. I mean if you think about TikTok it came out of nowhere and in an environment in which we would have already said and it is almost always a mistake to do this to say well the race is over and Google and Facebook have won. The race is never over. So I would suspect that if TikTok is banned it would be a very quick jelly doughnut-like shot in the arm for these companies in their own platforms. But people are going to congregate someplace else and I would suspect that that someplace else isn't someone's garage right now or it is fairly low in the App Store right now and may not be something as large and an unwieldy as an Instagram or YouTube.

Chris Hill: Bill Mann always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.

Bill Mann: Hey thanks Chris.

Chris Hill: It's not just stocks that have had a rough 2022. Bonds have as well but that means corporate debt is on sale. Robert Brokamp and Alison Southwick discussed the ins and outs of buying bonds.

Alison Southwick: When the stock market drops in our heart of hearts we hope it will recover because it always has in the past. The problem is we don't know exactly when or to be honest even if. That's because there are no guarantees with equities and this can be pretty distressing for investors. Fortunately there are investments that like stocks can go up and down in value but are contractually obligated to return a certain amount of money on a certain date and right now many of those investments are selling at a discount. Yes we are talking about boring old bonds. They're not nearly as exciting as stocks but believe it or not the bond market is actually bigger than the stock market. Partially because investors like what bonds provide: reliable income and relatively low volatility. At least that's what they usually provide. This year has been very different. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond index has lost more than 10% in 2022 making this the worst year for the index since its inception in 1977.

Robert Brokamp: Yeah. It's been a pretty rough year for bonds and thanks largely to the Federal Reserve which has been in hiking rates since March and when rates go up bond prices go down because who wants to pay full price for a bond yielding 2% when I can go out and buy a new bond yielding 4%. But here's the deal. Many bonds are now trading for 90 to 95 cents on the dollar and their prices will rise as they get closer to the maturity date which is the date that the bond holder gets the money back. They'll get the full value of the bond otherwise known as the par value. You throw in the highest yields we've seen in over a decade and you get a decent return on a usually safe investment.

Alison Southwick: I suspect most of our listeners understand that you probably shouldn't have all your money in the stock market especially if you're close to or even in retirement. Most of us have probably seen bond funds in our 401(k). So is a mutual fund or an ETF the best way to go when it comes to buying bonds?

Robert Brokamp: Yes and no. I think that's the way most people buy bonds but buying an individual bond may be a better choice if you want to be very certain about how much interest you will receive and how much money you'll get back in the future when the bond matures. Most people haven't spent much time buying individual bonds so you may wonder well how do you do it? So you can buy individual Treasuries directly from Uncle Sam commission-free at Treasurydirect.gov and Treasuries are considered the safest investments in the world. If you look at the bond area of your discount broker website you'll likely see a whole inventory of Treasuries corporate bonds municipal bonds and if you've never bought individual bonds before you may see some terms you're not familiar with. So let's discuss an example. I checked one of my accounts and I see a bond that is trading with the following information.

So it's offered by the Simon Property Group which is a real estate investment trust focusing mostly on retail properties throughout the world. You'll see the name of the bond and then what you'll see are ratings from the ratings agencies and the agencies are generally Standard and Poor's Fitch and Moody's. Basically the ratings are the agency's assessment of the risks that a company will default on its bond obligations. So the ratings range from the best at AAA. That means very very low likelihood of default all the way down to single D that's the lowest. That means this company is hanging on by a thread. There's also a dividing line at triple B so anything with that rating or above is considered investment grade. Anything below that rating is considered speculative otherwise known as junk. If you're going to buy individual bonds I think you're best to stick with investment-grade bonds. Now this bond from Simon Property Group is rated with a single A. That's good.

It means it has likely a low risk of default doesn't mean it can't default but according to the ratings agencies it's a very low-risk. Then the next thing you're going to see when you look up a bond is its coupon. This bond has a coupon of 3.3%. That is the amount of interest paid as a percentage of the bonds full or par value. The term coupon harkens back to the days when investors actually bought paper bonds with several coupons attached and to get the interest you actually had to bring the coupon into a bank. But the coupon rate is not the current yield on the bond. Because for this bond the price of the bond is trading at a discount. Specifically its price is 95.8% of its par value. When you look up the price of a bond the way they're priced is always a percentage of the par value. So what you really want to look for is the yield to maturity which for this bond is 4.7%.

That's closer to the actual return you'll receive. It's a combination of the interest payments and the increase in value of the bond as it moves back to 100% of its par value on the maturity date which for this bond is Jan. 15th 2026 so a little more than three years from now. Now you're considering this bond from the Simon Property Group you may also look at its stock which has a dividend that is currently yielding a very impressive 6.2%. So you may wonder why buy a bond that will return below 5% when I can buy a stock with a higher yield that also has higher price appreciation potential? Of course the answer is you could have much more faith and the return you'll get from the bond.

As long as the company is still in business you'll definitely get the interest and a bit of price growth because it's trading at a discount over the next three years. Actually the stock who knows what the stock will be worth three years from now or how much the dividend will be? Plus if the company does go under bondholders get paid back first and the typical recovery is about 25% to 50% of the value of the bond. Shareholders get paid last and they usually lose their entire investment. So that's just one example. As you look at the inventory of bonds offered in your brokerage account you're going to find plenty of issues selling for 90% or less of their par value. Therefore you'll get the growth and the income when the bond matures assuming the issuer is still in business and that last part is important. Even highly rated bonds can default so diversification is just as important with the bond portfolio as it is with the stock portfolio.

Alison Southwick: So yeah diversification. A bond fund does seem like the easier option because I get instant diversification with a single investment and it also seems like a lot less work.

Robert Brokamp: Yes it is. Learning to buy individual bonds can take some work. You definitely take the time to educate yourself. Also buying bonds below or above par value in a regular taxable brokerage account so not an IRA can create a variety of tax issues so you'd want to make sure you learn more before you begin your bond buying venture. You do get a ton of it diversification with a bond fund for example the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF owns more than 10000 bonds. On top of that according to Morningstar the weighted price of those bonds is 89% of their par values which means most are trading at discounts. You can also look at the fund's yield to maturity which is 4.9%. That's a helpful hint as to what the returns could be especially when you're comparing one fund to another. But it's also a bit misleading because the fund won't actually hold all those bonds maturity.

In fact this is the primary downside of a standard bond fund. Holdings are traded in and out of the fund throughout the year so investors don't really know how much the fund will be worth in the future. But there's a relatively new solution. Target date bond ETFs. These are funds that only own bonds that mature in the same year. While the share price of the fund will go up and down with interest rates and if you own corporate bonds also the overall economy they tend to return to their initial net asset value or share price or maybe even a bit higher when the ETF liquidates after all the bonds have matured so the two main issuers of target date bond ETFs are BlackRock which calls them iShares iBonds and Invesco which calls them BulletShares. Let's talk about the history of the iShares iBonds Dec. 22 corporate bond ETFs. That's the one that is just maturing this month.

Its inception was in March of 2015 at a share price of $25. It only owns corporate bonds that matured in 2022. The share price throughout the last seven years definitely moved up and down especially during the pandemic panic of 2020. But now that we have reached the end of the maturity year of the ETF it is returned to its $25 share price. In fact the fund is now all cash and it soon will be disbursed its shareholders and then the fund will cease to exist. Now if you're looking for one to invest in now for the next few years let's consider the iShares iBonds December 2026 corporate bond ETF. That's one it's going to mature in four years holds 513 bonds currently trades at $23.50 so at a discount of its initial share price and it has a yield to maturity of 5% because all the bonds will mature in 2026. You can feel reasonably confident that you will earn approximately 5% annualized if you hold this fund until 2026 barring some significant economic downturn that results in like a huge wave of defaults.

Alison Southwick: Hey Bro. Let's wrap this up with talking about how much should someone invest in bonds.

Robert Brokamp: It's a general rule of thumb here at the Fool is that you should have 5%-10% of your portfolio out of stocks as a starting point. Once you are within a decade of retirement maybe consider having 25% to 35% out of stocks and then once you're retired perhaps 35% to 45% out of stock. Of course as always depends on your circumstances your risk tolerance and whether you have other resources like a pension or something like that. That non-stock money should include both cash and bonds. For money you want to keep absolutely safe and liquid cash is still the best bet especially with high-yield savings accounts nowadays offering 3% or higher. For money you need in the next year to actually individual Treasuries are pretty hard to beat these days. The rates are over 4.5% plus the interest is free from state taxes. Then for money you don't need for 3-5 years or longer that you want to keep out of the stock market I think bonds are great place to consider because they are now offering the most attractive potential returns they have in well over a decade.

Alison Southwick: Well that doesn't sound so boring after all.

Robert Brokamp: Glad you think so Allison.

Chris Hill: As always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you tomorrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,

JEFF KOWALSKY / AFP

While the United States has been paralyzed in the days leading up to Christmas by freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls disrupting transportation in much of the country and prompting numerous calls for caution from authorities Western Europe is experiencing mild temperatures. Frédéric Nathan forecaster at Météo-France analyzes the dynamics at work in this cold snap.

Is the current cold snap in the United States where we have seen particularly low temperatures exceptional?

It is part of events that occur from time to time. This polar cold that is hitting the southern United States is driven by the position of low-pressure systems in the north. It is important to understand that there is less solar radiation in the north in the polar region than in the tropics and that is why it is colder in the north. Depending on the positioning of these low and high-pressure areas we come under the influence of polar or sub-Saharan air. This scenario is permanent it is nothing new.

How do you explain that the scenario in the United States is not producing the same effects in Europe?

The cold air masses that hit the United States passed through Canada and continental stretches. They were particularly intense and therefore that air has been unable to warm up. This explains the records that have been set in the last few days such as the -41°C observed on December 21 in Casper Wyoming the lowest temperature since 1939 the first year that measurements were taken at this station. But again the United States is not in an extraordinary situation and not many records have been broken so far.

Along the Rocky Mountains the drop of about twenty degrees occurred within just one hour.

What is most impressive is how quickly temperatures plummeted with thermometers plunging 20 to 25 degrees in a matter of hours. Along the Rocky Mountains in the northeast of the country the 20-degree drop occurred within just an hour on December 22! After hitting the Great Lakes region the active center of this low-pressure system and cold air is expected to move towards New York and then up to Quebec Canada accompanied by heavy snowfall most of the time.

In Europe these cold air masses coming from the Arctic zone cross seas such as the North Sea where the temperatures become milder.

Lake Michigan froze over on December 22 2022. SCOTT OLSON / AFP

Nevertheless very low temperatures were observed last week in France.

This dynamic does not prevent episodes of extreme cold as occurred a few days ago in France. The natural circulation of air masses on earth goes from West to East. But in some cases this circulation is also reversed with air masses coming from the East especially from Russia. Crossing continental stretches they produce very low temperatures well below zero with winds that can be very violent with freezing rain... These situations are well-known.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

With consecutive days of extreme winter weather across our network behind us continuing challenges are impacting our Customers and Employees in a significant way that is unacceptable.

And our heartfelt apologies are just beginning.

We're working with Safety at the forefront to urgently address wide-scale disruption by rebalancing the airline and repositioning Crews and our fleet ultimately to best serve all who plan to travel with us.

We were fully staffed and prepared for the approaching holiday weekend when the severe weather swept across the continent where Southwest is the largest carrier in 23 of the top 50 travel markets in the U.S. These operational conditions forced daily changes of an unprecedented volume and magnitude to our flight schedule and the tools our teams use to recover the airline remain at capacity.

This safety-first work is intentional ongoing and necessary to return to normal reliability one that minimizes last-minute inconveniences. As we continue the work to recover our operation we have made the decision to continue operating a reduced schedule by flying roughly one third of our schedule for the next several days. And we're working to reach Customers whose travel plans will change to offer specific information and available options also available at Southwest.com/traveldisruption.

Our Employees and Crews scheduled to work this holiday season are showing up in every single way. We are beyond grateful for that. Our shared goal is to take care of every single Customer with the Hospitality and Heart for which we're known.

On the other side of this we'll work to make things right for those we've let down including our Employees.

With no concern higher than ultimate Safety the People of Southwest share a goal to take care of each and every Customer. We recognize falling short and sincerely apologize.

Southwest Airlines Monitors Winter Storm Elliott: Update 5 – Dec. 24 2022

We continue to proactively manage and update our operational plan and flight schedules in response to Winter Storm Elliott and we are grateful for the support of our Employees as we work to stabilize our network. With more than half of the airports where we operate in the continental U.S. under duress from the storm Southwest is uniquely affected given our size and structure.

As it remains a very dynamic situation we don't have specific numbers to share on flight disruptions but the storms have forced thousands of cancellations throughout our network. We appreciate our Customers' patience and apologize for inconveniences as we work to get them to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible this holiday. Customers are encouraged to confirm their flight status at Southwest.com or on the Southwest app.

Southwest Monitors Winter Storm Elliott: Update 4 – Dec. 23 2022

We continue to proactively manage and update our operational plan and flight schedules in response to Winter Storm Elliott. With more than half of the airports where we operate in the continental U.S. under duress from the storm Southwest has been uniquely effected given our size and structure.

As it remains a very dynamic situation we don't have specific numbers to share on flight disruptions but the storms have forced hundreds of cancelations throughout our network. We appreciate our Customers' patience and apologize for inconveniences as we work to get them to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible this holiday. Customers are encouraged to confirm their flight status at Southwest.com or on the Southwest app.

Southwest Monitors Winter Storm Elliott: Update 3 – Dec. 22

Southwest continues to alter its operational plan as Winter Storm Elliott affects a number of airports in our Network.

Challenging working and travel conditions especially in Denver and Chicago have resulted in disruptions to Southwest's nearly 12000 scheduled flights Wednesday Dec. 21 through Friday Dec. 23.

Most of these disruptions were proactive schedule adjustments to ensure safe operations to protect the integrity of the entire Southwest Network and to limit prolonged exposure in dangerous working conditions. However the changing operational environment and treacherous conditions led to additional later cancellations.

Customers are encouraged to confirm their flight status at Southwest.com or in the Southwest app.

We apologize for inconveniences as our Team works to get Customers to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible. Customers traveling to from or through airports listed in our travel advisory may voluntarily change their travel plans within 14 days of the originally scheduled departure.

We'll continue to provide updates on SWAMedia.com as our operational plan evolves.

Southwest Monitors Winter Storm Elliott: Update 2 – Dec. 21

As Winter Storm Elliott marches eastward Southwest has implemented operational adjustments to its schedule through Dec. 23.

The Safety of Employees and Customers is Southwest's top priority and proactive schedule adjustments aim to ensure safe operations protect the integrity of the entire Southwest Network and limit subjecting our People to dangerous working conditions.

We have reduced operations at some airports we serve primarily Denver and Chicago Midway. Of the nearly 8000 scheduled flights for both Thursday Dec. 22 and Friday Dec. 23 Southwest has canceled about 500 flights.

Customers are encouraged to confirm their flight's status at Southwest.com or the Southwest app. We apologize for inconveniences as our Team works to get Customers to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible.

A travel advisory remains active for scheduled travel beginning Tuesday Dec. 20 and continuing through Monday Dec. 26. Customers traveling to from or through airports listed in the advisory may voluntarily change their travel plans within 14 days of the originally scheduled departure.

We'll provide updates via SWAMedia.com as our operational plan evolves.

Southwest Airlines Monitors Winter Storm Elliott: Update 1

Southwest Airlines is monitoring the development and forecast of Winter Storm Elliott and has offered increased flexibility to Customers across a wide swath of our Network.

Based on the current forecast a travel advisory is active for scheduled travel beginning Tuesday Dec. 20 and continuing through Monday Dec. 26. Customers traveling to from or through airports listed in the advisory may voluntarily change their travel plans within 14 days of the originally scheduled departure.

Southwest never charges fees to change or cancel an existing reservation. The travel advisory waives any applicable fare difference for Customers who may be affected by Winter Storm Elliott and wish to alter their itineraries. Customers are encouraged to confirm their flight's status at Southwest.com or through the Southwest app.

We'll provide updates via SWAMedia.com as our operational plan evolves.

Not only are we seeing record numbers of travelers around the holidays but we’re also witnessing some of the worst winter storms we’ve seen in a long time. While thousands of flights have been canceled nothing seems to be going quite as bad as Southwest Airlines’ situation in Denver.

Southwest declares “state of operational emergency”

As first reported by aviation watchdog @xJonNYC Southwest Airlines has declared a state of operational emergency at Denver International Airport (DEN). This started late on December 21 and applies until further notice. Long story short the airline doesn’t have nearly enough rampers at the moment which is causing huge issues.

Things seem to be going well at southwest pic.twitter.com/5ChyDpAxv9 — 🇺🇦 JonNYC 🇺🇦 (@xJonNYC) December 24 2022

In a memo to employees the airline reports receiving “an unusually high number of absences.” The airline states it has an obligation to customers and to fellow employees to safely and efficiently run the operation so the airline has declared a state of operational emergency.

What does this entail?

Employees alleging illness will be required to provide a doctor’s note on the first day they return to work indicating when the doctor was seen and confirming that the employee was unable to work on the days of the claimed illness; telemedicine appointments don’t qualify and failure to comply with these requirements will be considered insubordination and will lead to termination

The company is denying any requests for personal absence and ramp employees will be required to work their usual shifts; failure to comply will also result in termination

The company will apply mandatory overtime regardless of an employee’s status; if an employee refuses to work overtime they’ll also be terminated

Just how bad is Southwest’s operational performance?

Southwest is performing horribly operationally at the moment. For example on Friday December 23 2022 the airline canceled 32% of its flights and delayed 52% of its flights. So only 16% of flights operated on-time. Ouch. Things didn’t look much better the day before and still aren’t looking good today (though they don’t look as bad as yesterday).

As also noted by @xJonNYC the situation got so bad that on December 22 that a Tampa to Denver flight returned to Tampa because there wouldn’t be sufficient ground staff to assist with the flight. The airline ended up operating a nearly four hour flight to nowhere. Ouch.

this SW flight had to turn around and go back to Tampa as there were no rampers at DEN available for it to land there:https://t.co/P3WJl7EhCB — 🇺🇦 JonNYC 🇺🇦 (@xJonNYC) December 24 2022

A Denver-bound Southwest flight returned to Tampa

My take on Southwest’s operational challenges

Obviously weather is horrible in many parts of the country so it’s interesting how Southwest seems to specifically be struggling in Denver more than elsewhere. It makes you wonder what’s going on in Denver specifically that’s causing this and not other stations.

While I can appreciate that Southwest needs to run a reliable operation this memo comes across as borderline cruel. That’s especially true for an airline that always talks about how its biggest asset is its employees. Southwest executives have long said that the strategy is to take care of employees and then in turn have them take care of customers.

Specific to this situation:

If someone just has a common cold there’s not really a need to go to a doctor so to force someone to go to a doctor’s office to get a note is ridiculous especially when telemedicine is excluded (trying to discredit telemedicine seems like a bizarre move)

The pandemic should have taught us that we should stay home if we’re not feeling well to help protect others; Southwest is encouraging sick people to come to work here

Threatening to terminate anyone who requires a last minute personal absence is awful; so if you have a family members who is suddenly ill or dying you’ll have to decide between spending time with them and keeping your job

Southwest isn’t showing much “heart” here

Bottom line

While airlines around the country are having operational challenges nothing is quite as bad as Southwest Airlines’ situation in Denver. The airline has declared a state of emergency and is threatening to terminate ramp employees for any of a number of reasons. This includes if they call in sick but don’t get a doctor’s note from an in-person visit or even if they need to take a personal absence.

(AP) — A battering winter storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses across the United States on Saturday left millions more to worry about the prospect of further outages and crippled emergency response efforts and an airport in snowbound New York state.

Across the country officials have attributed at least 18 deaths to exposure icy car crashes and other effects of the storm including two people who died in their homes outside Buffalo New York when emergency crews couldn’t reach them amid historic blizzard conditions.

Deep snow single-digit temperatures and day-old power outages sent Buffalo residents scrambling Saturday to get out of their houses to anywhere that had heat. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the Buffalo Niagara International Airport will be closed through Monday morning and almost every fire truck in Buffalo was stranded in the snow.

“No matter how many emergency vehicles we have they cannot get through the conditions as we speak” Hochul said.

Blinding blizzards freezing rain and frigid cold also knocked out power from Maine to Seattle while a major electricity grid operator warned the 65 million people it serves across the eastern U.S. that rolling blackouts might be required.

Pennsylvania-based PJM Interconnection said power plants are having difficulty operating in the frigid weather and has asked residents in 13 states to refrain from unnecessary electricity use through at least Christmas morning. The Tennessee Valley Authority which provides electricity to 10 million people in Tennessee and parts of six surrounding states directed local power companies to implement planned interruptions but ended the measure by Saturday afternoon.

Across the six New England states more than 273000 electric customers remained without power on Saturday with Maine the hardest hit and some utilities saying it could be days before electricity is restored. PJM Interconnection also warned rolling blackouts might be required.

In North Carolina 169000 customers were without power Saturday afternoon down from a peak of more than 485000 but utility officials said rolling blackouts would continue for “the next few days.”

Those without power included James Reynolds of Greensboro who said his housemate a 70-year-old with diabetes and severe arthritis spent the morning bundled beside a kerosene heater with indoor temperatures “hovering in the 50s.”

In the Buffalo suburb of Cheektowaga two people died in their homes on Friday when emergency crews could not reach them in time to treat their medical conditions according to Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. He said another person died in Buffalo and said the blizzard may be “the worst storm in our community’s history.”

Forecasters said 28 inches (71 centimeters) of snow accumulated as of Saturday in Buffalo — part of an area that saw 6 feet (about 1.8 meters) fall just over a month ago resulting in three deaths. More is expected overnight.

The downfall blocked the furnace in the home of Brian LaPrade who woke up Saturday morning to temperatures in his Buffalo house dipping to below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius.)

“This morning I had to go out and dig out the vents” LaPrade told the AP. “As it was the snow was taller than my snow blower.”

It was taking ambulances over three hours to do one trip to a hospital in areas where an ambulance can get through the snow Poloncarz said. Plows were on the roads but large snow drifts abandoned cars and downed power lines were slowing progress.

On the Ohio Turnpike four died in a massive pileup involving some 50 vehicles. A Kansas City Missouri driver was killed Thursday after skidding into a creek and three others died Wednesday in separate crashes on icy northern Kansas roads.

A utility worker in Ohio was also killed Friday while trying to restore power according to the Buckeye Rural Electric Cooperative. It said the 22-year-old died in “an electrical contact incident” near Pedro in Lawrence County.

A woman in Vermont died in a hospital Friday after a tree broke in the high winds and fell on her. Police in Colorado Springs said they found the dead body of a person who appeared to be homeless as subzero temperatures and snow descended on the region. Near Janesville Wisconsin a 57-year-old woman died Friday after falling through the ice on a river the Rock County Sheriff’s Office announced.

In Lansing Michigan an 82-year-old woman died after being found Friday morning curled up in the snow outside of her assisted living community Bath Township police reported. A snowplow driver found the woman as temperatures hovered around 10 degrees.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said one person died in a traffic accident attributed to the weather in western Kentucky and a homeless person died in Louisville.

Along Interstate 71 in Kentucky Terry Henderson and her husband Rick were stuck in a massive traffic jam caused by several accidents for 34 hours. The truck drivers weathered the wait in a rig outfitted with a diesel heater a toilet and a refrigerator but nonetheless regretted trying to drive from Alabama to their home near Akron Ohio for Christmas.

“I wish we should have stayed” said Terry Henderson after they got moving again Saturday. “We should have sat.”

The storm was nearly unprecedented in its scope stretching from the Great Lakes near Canada to the Rio Grande along the border with Mexico. About 60% of the U.S. population faced some sort of winter weather advisory or warning and temperatures plummeted drastically below normal from east of the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians the National Weather Service said.

As millions of Americans were traveling ahead of Christmas more than 2360 flights within into or out of the U.S. were canceled Saturday according to the tracking site FlightAware. While in Mexico migrants camped near the U.S. border in unusually cold temperatures as they awaited a U.S. Supreme Court decision on pandemic-era restrictions that prevent many from seeking asylum.

Forecasters said a bomb cyclone — when atmospheric pressure drops very quickly in a strong storm — had developed near the Great Lakes stirring up blizzard conditions including heavy winds and snow.

Western New York often sees dramatic lake-effect snow which is caused by cool air picking up moisture from the warm water then dumping it on the land. But even area residents found conditions to be dire on Christmas eve.

Latricia Stroud said she and her two daughters 1 and 12 were stranded without heat or power in their Buffalo house since Friday afternoon with the snow too deep to leave.

“I have to go over a snowbank to get out” Stroud told the AP. “There’s a warming center I just need a ride to get there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M0amF4LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvZm9ybWVyLXN0LWF1Z3VzdGluZS1maXJlZmlnaHRlci13aG8tc3VlZC1vdmVyLWdhcy1leHBsb3Npb24tZGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former St. Augustine firefighter who sued over gas explosion dies,"ST. AUGUSTINE FLa. – A former St. Augustine firefighter who was one of the first to respond to a massive fire and explosion at a gas station more than 10 years ago has died.

Michael Riley was 61 years old.

Riley who died Tuesday served as a firefighter for more than 30 years nearly eight of those with the St. Augustine Fire Department.

In August 2011 Riley was among the first to respond to a massive fire and explosion at a gas station on State Road 16 and Masters Drive. An above-ground storage tank overflowed and the vapors and heat from a fuel delivery truck caused the blast.

Friend and fellow firefighter Chance Hines was also at the scene. He lost all hearing in his left ear.

“We were absolutely covered in fuel” Hines said. “To see men like Mike Riley standing there trying to protect the community was amazing.”

Riley’s health really started declining six years ago when he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s encephalopathy and Parkinsonism. He eventually could not walk on his own and had trouble speaking.

“His family has been incredible at helping future generations of firefighters with some of the same illnesses that Mike was experiencing” Hines said.

Riley’s family believes his eventual health issues stemmed from that accident.

News4JAX spoke with Riley and his family last year after they sued the fuel tank driver his then-employer and the owner of the former gas station. A case they ultimately lost.

Riley’s wife Lani is advocating for people like Michael through an upcoming documentary called “Behind the Smoke” and fighting for new legislation to protect firefighters.

Through it all Hines said his bond with Riley will stand forever.

“These are my brothers and sisters that we work with. Even after we retire or something happens” he said. “Mike was exactly what you would want as a firefighter. He absolutely loved the job the career. Just fantastic at what he did.”

ST. LOUIS — Michael and Teri McDermott are finally taking steps in a new direction.

""It has been crazy and a whirlwind” said Teri McDermott.

A long and frightening journey brought them to Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis.

The McDermotts are from Seattle but their active lifestyle was put on hold when Michael woke up a few months ago in excruciating pain.

""I had felt a little bit of pain in my rear flank” recalled Michael McDermott. “And one night I went to bed and the pain started flaring up and it didn't stop.""

Doctors did scans looking for kidney stones but instead found a cancerous tumor on his kidney that later grew into his heart.

""That's a big problem” said Dr. Adeel Khan. “If at any time a piece of it is to break off it can cause pretty much instant death.""

He was in a sense a ticking time bomb.

""We didn't even know if he would make it to St. Louis” his wife said. ""We had no idea. I literally asked ‘Will he die?’ And they said ‘We don't know. We can't tell you that.’ So on the flight there I just kept looking at him and going 'are you breathing? Are you gonna make it?'""

They did make it and days after arriving at Siteman Michael McDermott was wheeled into surgery.

Keep in mind this operation was so intricate doctors at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Maryland said they couldn't do it and told them that Washington University surgeon Dr. Adeel Khan was his last best hope.

""We had three teams working on him with cardiothoracic and urology and each one of us doing our part” said Dr. Kahn.

There was no guarantee that Michael would ever wake up again so the family took some comfort in knowing that just weeks before his daughter Kennedy moved up her wedding so Michael could walk her down the aisle.

""It was probably the hardest part of the whole thing” Michael McDermott said through tears. “Knowing that she had to change everything around so that I could be there because they weren't sure how long I had in a sense you know.""

Fast forward and Michael McDermott just got word – he's going home for the holidays.

""I think in his case everything went exactly as we had planned” said Dr. Kahn. ""Exactly as how we had thought. And it was very smooth. We didn't lose much blood. He did really well and the end result was really good.""

The road to recovery still has bumps and cracks Michael McDermott will still need chemotherapy to shrink the tumor but he's no longer a ticking time bomb.

""I think how blessed I am is what it comes down to it. I'm just blessed that I can be there for my kids and with my wife” said Michael McDermott. ""Dr. Khan extended my life.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MtaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI1L2xha2UtY291bnR5LXZvbHVudGVlcnMtc3BlbmQtY2hyaXN0bWFzLXNlcnZpbmctbHVuY2gtdG8tcGVvcGxlLWluLW5lZWQv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy1oZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjUvbGFrZS1jb3VudHktdm9sdW50ZWVycy1zcGVuZC1jaHJpc3RtYXMtc2VydmluZy1sdW5jaC10by1wZW9wbGUtaW4tbmVlZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lake County volunteers spend Christmas serving lunch to people in need,"Even as a winter storm brought hazardous road conditions and low temperatures to Lake County this holiday weekend volunteers from St. Noel Church in Willoughby Hills spent their Christmas serving lunch to local residents in need.

The volunteers served Christmas lunch as part of the meal program at St. James Episcopal Church in Painesville. This meal continued what team leader Leslie Jevnikar estimated to be one and a half years of partnership between St. Noel and the meal program.

“It’s a wonderful feeling just to be helping I think” Jevnikar said. “Everyone who comes here is always so grateful for the meals and it’s just a wonderful way to give to others.”

She added “Especially today at Christmas time I think that Jesus was born today and Jesus is here and he’s been here for many years and I think he’s here at St. James and so he wants us to be of service to others to lift the burdens of others and I think that’s our main role.”

This was the second time that volunteer Janet Malm served lunch for the meal program. She described the lunch as a “beautiful thing” saying “I’m so grateful for everything I have and I wanted to help others experience some joy and love and serve them.”

The Christmas lunch included honey-baked ham a yam bake from a family recipe green bean casserole cranberry sauce and Christmas cookies Jevnikar said. The food was donated to St. James by a food bank.

In addition to serving the meal she noted that the volunteers spoke with diners and provided a space for a communal eating experience.

“I think it’s nice to know their names” Jevnikar said. “I think that God wants us to know everybody’s names and I think it’s nice to know their stories and to hear them vent about the challenges that they’re having in life and it’s nice for them all to sit in this area and to talk with one another.”

In addition to volunteering with the meal program Jevnikar added that St. Noel provides a food pantry. More information is available at stnoel.org/food-pantry.

Meal program Executive Director Alice Griffith explained that the St. James meal program is in its fortieth year of service to area residents. Volunteers come from around 20 organizations including churches service groups and schools. They provide meals from 1 to 2 p.m. on weekends and 5 to 6 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays. Nearby St. Mary’s Catholic Church provides meals on Wednesday and Thursday evenings.

“We collaborate with many many organizations so it’s wonderful” she said. “It’s expanded to the point where we couldn’t do it without their help.”

The program is also open on national holidays and Good Friday as noted on its web page serving meals on those days from 1 to 2 p.m.

“It’s really a wonderful program because we have so many people involved in serving those who are hungry” she said adding “We really try to develop a relationship with those who come to us for a meal and to give them a spiritual life as well as nourish them.”

Each meal serves an average of 40 or 50 people Griffith noted with more people coming at the end of the month.

“We work with the food bank to receive most of our food and also local restaurants will volunteer or donate food if they have extra” she said adding “All our meals are hot meals and they’re nutritious so our goal is to not only feed their hunger but improve health too.”

According to Griffith Lucky’s Food Market in Concord Township and Gartman Model Bakery in Painesville are among the local businesses that donate food.

“We are a non-profit so we just function on grants and private donations” she said.

Griffith added that there are no requirements to receive a meal from the program.

People who are interested in volunteering can call the church she added. The church’s phone number is 440-354-3526 and St. James is located at 131 North State St. in Painesville.

An interest form is also available on the meal program web page which can be found at stjamesoh.org/mealprogram.

Jevnikar said “I think it’s doing God’s work. It’s what when God has given us his grace and his mercy that we need to give back to others in need and when God gives plenty to others we need to give even more so that’s the way I look at it. We need to give and give because our rewards are in heaven.”

Leslie’s son Ben added “I think everyone needs a meal on Christmas that’s an important thing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tZXRyby9zYW1lLXNleC1jb3VwbGUtZmlnaHRzLXRvLWdldC1qZWZmZXJzb24tY291bnR5LWZvc3Rlci1jaGlsZHJlbi1yZXR1cm5lZC10by10aGVpci1ob21lL2FydGljbGVfYjUyYmZiYzctYzA1MC01ZmNkLTljNDItODc2ZDBiMTMwOGRjLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Same-sex couple fights to get Jefferson County foster children returned to their home,"ST. LOUIS — Last spring a few weeks before Easter authorities removed three siblings from a Jefferson County home for allegations of abuse or neglect. They were hungry needed a foster home fast. Erica Marks and her wife Melissa Yearian of St. Louis got the call. On a moment’s notice they agreed to help.

It was a tough assignment from the start. The children — ages 14 months 2 and 7 — had extensive needs.

Marks and Yearian aren’t typical foster parents though. Both are child therapists. Yearian had even previously been a state-contracted caseworker in the foster care system as well as a supervisor of court-appointed child advocates.

They said they did their best to provide a nurturing home. They set out carrots half-eaten by the Easter Bunny. They wrestled with waitlists to get services covered by Medicaid and requested additional supports. They got the children into day care and school. They enforced a strict 6:30 p.m. bedtime and other boundaries. They bought a bigger house in south St. Louis than they’d planned to have a better living arrangement.

“They were doing so well in our home” Marks said. “Maniacs all three of them. Big personalities.”

But in complex family court cases like these with multiple stakeholders involved there can be disagreements about what is best for children in state care. At the very least that is what happened with the three siblings from Jefferson County which disrupted their first placement in care.

The state safety net for vulnerable children is overburdened by societal challenges turnover in the workforce that’s supposed to help and an ongoing shortage of available foster parents willing to take someone else’s children into their homes for an undetermined amount of time. A foster family in Chesterfield was recently so fed up with the system they started seeking potential adoptive parents on their own rather than wait for the court system to eventually catch up.

Marks and Yearian are on the opposite end of the spectrum. They are fighting to get their foster children back.

On Nov. 2 Samantha Richards a supervisor at Family Forward a state-contracted agency that does foster care case management notified them that the children would be removed in two weeks. According to a copy of the letter the new foster home would be closer to the biological parents and “can provide care to all three children.”

What’s more the letter said the children were being removed for a bunch of “competencies not being met” regarding: meeting children’s developmental needs supporting relationships between the children and birth families and working as a member of a professional team.

Marks and Yearian were stunned by the letter. Initially they hoped it was all just a matter of poor communication. So they made calls sent emails and requested emergency meetings. They hired an attorney and showed up in court. They filed an official grievance with the state’s Alternative Care Review Board or ACRB asking that the decision be reviewed before removing the children. They said they had solid evidence to address accusations made against them.

“We love all three children in our home and we strongly believe that removing them from our care to another stranger foster placement is not in their best interest” they wrote in the grievance. “We believe it will result in significant unnecessary trauma that could easily be prevented. We would be more than willing to collaborate with the team to meet the needs of the children and ensure continued strong connection with their family of origin.”

They said they didn’t get a response from the ACRB. On the evening of Nov. 22 two days before Thanksgiving the children were removed.

“They were devastated and sobbing as were we” Marks and Yearian described in written plea for help to state officials. “We had to pull them off of us to send them with (the caseworker). The youngest didn’t understand what was happening.”

Reached by telephone Family Forward caseworker Teresa Stein deferred questions to Richards her supervisor who did not respond to a request for comment. In her Nov. 2 letter to Marks and Yearian Richards went into detail about why the children were being removed. Among the reasons:

• While searching for counselors it was indicated that there was a conflict of interest due to Marks and Yearian having worked with some of them professionally in the past.

• A request to have the eldest child placed separately from her siblings.

• Rigid time frames to schedule visits.

• Disruptions in facilitating phone calls between the biological mother and her children.

• Denying home supports.

Yearian and Marks discussed the case in-depth with the Post-Dispatch and shared a stack of correspondences that lay out their rebuttals including:

• They knew three counselors but provided a list of more than 150 they reached out to and didn’t know.

• They asked to only temporarily remove the eldest child from their home for the safety of her younger siblings; once her medication was adjusted it was no longer an issue.

• They wanted a later bedtime but the children were “miserable” the next day if they didn’t get 13 hours of sleep writing: “This is common for kids who have experienced trauma — they sleep way more than expected or way less.”

• Marks and Yearian hotlined a team member twice who was responsible for transporting the children to parental visits. They were concerned about improper car seats.

• Even though telephone calls weren’t court-ordered until Nov. 9 Marks and Yearian facilitated calls with the mother on Tuesday nights but that “we became uncomfortable continuing to supervise calls because it required us to tattle on mom about different things.”

• They were participating in home supports.

No help from state

Marks and Yearian continue to fight the removal hoping it will be reversed. They’ve amassed several letters of support ranging from a second-grade teacher who didn’t want the eldest child pulled out of school because of successful interventions there to service providers to fellow social workers.

“I don’t want to toot our own horn” Yearian said. “We are actually pretty well-respected in our fields.”

While working on her master’s degree in social work at Columbia University in New York she said she was taught and encouraged to hold people accountable. Marks who earned her master’s in social work from St. Louis University said she also doesn’t hesitate to step on toes to better advocate for people in need including herself.

In a Dec. 12 letter to a top administrator at the Missouri Department of Social Services Children’s Division Marks argued that they’ve been discriminated against defamed and not taken seriously in court.

“My wife and I fought tirelessly to get the children into all the services they needed without help from their caseworker” Marks wrote in the detailed letter to Children’s Division Deputy Director Teri Armistead head of state foster care.

Armistead responded with a kind note saying others would follow up soon because she was leaving Children’s Division. Armistead said her replacement Angie Swarnes or Lauren Masterson unit manager over foster parent recruitment and licensing or Regional Director Pam Alston would look into the matter and respond.

One week passed without further response. On Dec. 19 Marks and Yearian reached Children’s Division Director Darrell Missey. A former family court judge in Jefferson County Missey told them by email that he was sorry for their struggles but doesn’t get involved in the details of particular cases. He said he did read their description of events and encouraged them to continue to work with an attorney on the matter.

“As I explain to people these cases are before courts which are designed and equipped to handle such disputes” Missey wrote. “You have a lawyer and have addressed the issue with the court. As such I would be powerless to accomplish anything contrary to that court order. Further any issues regarding the court’s order could be addressed through the legal system not through the hierarchy of the agency.”

Marks and Yearian aren’t convinced there was a court order to remove the children. They said they haven’t been shown one despite their attorney’s requests.

Associate Judge Shannon Dougherty declined to comment by phone about the ongoing case in her court in Jefferson County. Asked more broadly if same-sex foster parents face more obstacles for placement than traditional families she said: “I don’t look at anything other than if somebody is an approved foster parent and if they are appropriately doing their foster parent duties.”

William Dodson guardian ad litem or an attorney representing the best interests of the three children in question also would not comment on specifics of the case because it involves personal information about minors. More broadly he said he hadn’t witnessed bias toward same-sex foster parents in Jefferson County.

Dwindling hope

Marks and Yearian haven’t given up.

“We really just want the kids back” Yearian said. “Our hope is dwindling.”

Yet the car and booster seats remain in place. Three stockings hang from the staircase of their home in south St. Louis.

“We had a full Christmas ready for them” Yearian said.

The eldest was to get a new television. A new soccer goal was ready to be put up in the backyard for the middle child. A toy veterinarian play set for the youngest.

They said Family Forward has called seven times to see if they can take on more foster children who need a home.

“We are in the grieving process” Yearian said. “We need time to recover from this.”

CIT Bank is one that charges no incoming wire transfer fee and $10 for outgoing wire transfers if your balance is less than $25000. If your balance is more than $25000 the wires are free. $10 is already a relatively cheap fee but free is free!

Anyway you’re not here for that – you’re here to learn whether CIT Bank has a bonus and the details of that bonus. I’m happy to report they have an active promotion going on right now and it’s pretty good.

Who is CIT Bank?

CIT Bank is now a division of First Citizens Bank after the two completed their merger in early 2022. They’re a nationwide bank and so there are no geographic restrictions as to who can open an account with CIT Bank. They are FDIC insured like every other bank listed on this side.

We have a review of CIT Bank if you want to learn more.

From time to time CIT Bank offers a variety of promotions for their accounts. I’ve found them to be pretty generous and so I jumped on a promotion for their Savings Builder account a while back.

Today we have a promotion for their Money Market account and it appears to be available for new and existing customers.

Editor’s Note: As of December 24th 2022 CIT Bank is no longer offering this new account bonus. For other bank bonuses check out our post on the best bank bonuses and promotions or click here to sign up for our email newsletter and get notified of new bank promotions. We will update this post with the new details when they are made available.

How to Get Free Amazon Prime Membership ($139) from CIT Bank [EXPIRED]

The promotion is pretty easy:

Open a new CIT Money Market account using the promo code AMZN22 ;

; Fund your account with at least $15000 within 15 days and keep a minimum balance of at least $15000 for 60 days following the 15-day funding period.

Within 30 days following the end of the funding period if you’ve fulfilled the requirements we’ll send you an email with your Prime membership code.

This promotion will work for new and existing Amazon Prime customers. If you have an existing membership the code can be used to renew your membership for an extra year.

It appears that existing CIT Bank customers can do this promotion – you just have to open a new Money market account and fund it with new-to-CIT Bank funds. Fortunately you can have multiple accounts.

The only restriction is that there is a limit of one Money Market promotional offer per account and per customer – which seems fair to me. Oh and you must redeem it no later than 3/23/2024.

Don’t forget the promotion code!

Open a CIT Bank MMA Account

(Offer expires 12/23/2022)

I‘m an existing CIT Bank customer with a Savings Builder account and I will be trying this out. When I opened my account I was able to enter the promo code and it didn’t tell me I wasn’t eligible. While that doesn’t mean it worked it is a promising sign.

How Does This Bonus Compare?

The bonus is for a membership worth $139 on a deposit of $15000 for 60 days. We use Amazon Prime so we get the full value of the membership and I’m already a CIT Bank customer so it doesn’t add much to any of our financial processes.

I’m a fan of CIT Bank because the offer free outgoing wires when you have a balance of at least $25000 and so this is just another sweetener on the account. The money market account also offers a decent interest rate (it’s not zero!) so it’s an all around good offer.

If you don’t have a CIT Bank account the offer is OK.

Gone are the days when you just needed to switch your SIM card to the upgraded model. When Apple announced the iPhone 14 line the company revealed that US models wouldn't have the physical SIM card tray that's commonly been used across the phone industry. Internationally however the iPhone 14 line retains the SIM card tray for now.

With eSIMs you'll still be able to take full advantage of a carrier's 4G LTE or 5G networks and use your phone the same way you have in the past. Apple has supported eSIMs on iPhones dating back to 2018's iPhone XS XS Max and XR and has long supported the technology on its recent cellular iPads and Apple Watches. The iPhone 13 line even allowed for multiple eSIMs to be enabled at once useful for those looking to have a work number and personal number on just one device.

By embracing eSIMs Apple and other manufacturers can also begin to ditch the physical SIM card slot allowing for more space for additional features on future devices.

Watch this: Why Apple Uses eSIMs on the iPhone 14 04:40

AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon all support using eSIM as do a number of smaller or prepaid providers like Mint Mobile Google Fi or Verizon-owned Visible.

While the core experience shouldn't change there could be a few notable benefits to no longer needing to get a physical SIM card from a carrier. If a network adds a new feature the provider can just push an update directly to the phone whereas in the past you may have needed to order a new SIM card.

Upgrading from 4G devices to 5G for example required a new SIM card at some carriers to be able to connect to the new networks. When buying a phone from a carrier or with a carrier installment plan you usually get the new SIM card in the box so this isn't much of an issue. If you were buying unlocked directly from Apple however you may have needed to get a new SIM.

Using eSIMs will make it easier for consumers to explore or switch cellular providers. T-Mobile and Verizon's Visible have been using eSIMs as a way to give people the ability to try out their respective networks on their existing devices. Last week T-Mobile updated its trial program to now give interested people three months of unlimited data to compare its 5G network with their existing provider.

Should you want to switch eSIM streamlines the process and allows you to be up and running significantly quicker than waiting for a physical card to be mailed or taking your handset into a store.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbGlmZWhhY2tlci5jb20veW91LXNob3VsZC1nZXQtaW4tb24tdC1tb2JpbGVzLTM1MC1taWxsaW9uLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtMTg0OTkyNDIxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Should Get In on T-Mobile's $350 Million Settlement,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='lifehacker.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /you-should-get-in-on-t-mobiles-350-million-settlement-1849924214 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002122691CF10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbGlmZWhhY2tlci5jb20veW91LXNob3VsZC1nZXQtaW4tb24tdC1tb2JpbGVzLTM1MC1taWxsaW9uLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtMTg0OTkyNDIxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGVsZWNvbXRhbGsuaW5mby90bW9iaWxlLWV4cGFuZHMtNWctbmV0d29yay1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLTE5MDBtaHotbGF5ZXIvNjM4NzcxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile Expands 5G Network; Deploys Additional 1900 MHz Layer Nationwide,"T-Mobile has increased 5G capacity and coverage Nationwide.

Apple Google Samsung: guilty guilty guilty.

Long-pressing the power button used to bring up an option to turn your phone off but then these companies decided to get cute and make this a shortcut to summon their digital assistant. This is bad and wrong and I’m politely demanding that these companies return what they took from us.

Look I get the logic. When phone screens got bigger physical buttons like Apple’s home button were axed and existing buttons had to pick up the slack. In the iPhone X Apple re-homed the Siri function to the power button. Since then turning your iPhone off has required pressing a combination of buttons. If you make the fatal mistake of long-pressing the power button in hopes of turning your phone off Siri will start listening to you as you curse about how the power button doesn’t work how it should anymore. And woe to you if you don’t hold down the right button combination long enough — you’ll take a screenshot that you didn’t want and will have to delete later.

Apple Google Samsung: guilty guilty guilty

It’s just as bad on Samsung and Google phones. Long-pressing the power button on the Pixel 7 Pro just now brought up the Google Assistant and a prompt to ask it how to say sorry in Spanish. No Google. It is you who should be apologizing. And the Galaxy S22 phones I used this year all bid me to set up Bixby whenever I made the mistake of long-pressing the power button. Both Google and Samsung let you change it back to the power menu — and Samsung has the decency to put a shortcut to side key options on its shutdown screen — but enough is enough. Long-pressing the power button should by default just turn the phone off.

The thing that really adds salt to the wound is that the button combination to turn your phone off isn’t even the same on every phone. On an iPhone you can press and hold the power button and either volume key to get to shutdown options. On a Pixel phone it’s a short press of the volume up key and power button. If you screw up and press the volume down key you’ll take a screenshot which will make you feel stupid when you find it in your photo gallery later. Samsung makes you press and hold the volume down key and power button.

The button combination to turn your phone off isn’t even the same on every phone

I realize most people only need to remember one of these combinations because they don’t switch phones every week like I do. I get that. And most people probably don’t even turn their phones off... ever. That’s fine too. But I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask for a power button that does the job it’s named for. Sure you can re-brand it as the “sleep / wake button” or a “side key” but we all know what it’s really for. If we can’t have that then at least let’s agree on a standard combination of buttons to press so I can stop taking screenshots of my homescreen on accident.

I have a strong suspicion that my plea is in vain and it’s probably up to us as individuals to save ourselves from power-button chaos."

The global economy is expected to grow at a slow pace of approximately 1.6% in 2023 as financial conditions worsen the winter antagonizes China’s COVID policy and Europe’s natural gas problems persist. 2022 has been the worst year for the S&P 500 in more than ten years as rising interest rates some important corporate earnings misses and growing concerns about global growth weighed heavily on the stock market. Seasonal investing means that an investment is profitable more than half of the time. Investors become increasingly confident in a seasonal investment as the frequency of profitable trades rises.

Seasonal stocks are defined by surging demand during different times of the year. For example a company focused on designing and manufacturing snowsuits is probably not as active during the summer months but may enjoy surges in the winter and holiday season. Similarly air conditioning companies benefit primarily in the summer. Moreover companies that experience peak demand during tourism months are also considered seasonal stocks like hotels and resorts.

Some of the best seasonal stocks to invest in include The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H).

We selected the following seasonal stocks based on positive analyst coverage strong business fundamentals and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022.

The Company has a backlog in its professional segment that is at its highest level since the year began whereas residential products grew +7% on strong year and 2-year comparisons and despite many “home” categories across big-box retailers witnessing declines.

From the Company’s humble beginning building tractor engines for the Bull Tractor Company in Bloomington Milwaukee the Company has methodically grown into the diversified conglomerate of today that possesses industry leading brand awareness market share technological prowess and profitability. We are always enamored with a company’s beginnings so herewith is the short story of The Toro Corporation’s storied history. The “Toro” name was chosen given its first relationship with The Bull Tractor Company which according to Company documents was the #1 brand of farm tractors in 1914.

“Mattel (24% 1.40%; 16% 0.96%) the global toy and media company was a strong contributor in the fourth quarter and for the year. Despite store closures in Asia causing -20% regional revenues during the third quarter Mattel’s consolidated sales still grew 8% due to its strong North American recovery. Barbie sales remain impressive as they have been for years American Girl is finally returning to growth and Fisher Price is also recovering. The company is successfully passing through inflated costs with higher pricing and without losing volume. Despite the impressive results the stock trades too low at less than 14x forward earnings and that is before Mattel begins to monetize its massive non-earning asset Intellectual Property portfolio. Our appraisal of the value grew by more than 30% this year.”

Here is what Baron Fund has to say about DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and although it was a successful investment we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened! We sold even though we considered Ed Stack Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO a terrific retailer a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores the foundation of Dick’s business from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.” Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new large format stores with attached outdoor student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick‘s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”

So how long does it take to charge your EV at Target?

Target provides electric vehicle (EV) charging stations at most locations. These facilities allow you to enjoy the convenience of boosting your battery as you shop. The time needed to charge your EV at Target will depend on the charging level and battery capacity. It can also differ due to the charging rate of the onboard charger and the state of your car’s battery.

Here is more information about the types of EV chargers and the time required to charge your vehicle at Target.

The difference between EV chargers

EV chargers are available in three categories based on how fast they charge. Level 1 charging is slow and uses a standard 120-volt(V) household wall outlet. You will often find level 1 charging equipment in residential areas at homes and garages.

Level 2 charging uses a 240V outlet regularly found in commercial areas like Target stores. However some workplaces also offer such equipment.

Level 3 or direct current (DC) fast charging is the fastest often available in public locations. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging this type uses direct current instead of alternating current (AC) and outlets of over 480V. Tesla Superchargers are a type of level 3 or DC fast chargers.

The time needed to charge an electric car at Target

According to Home Battery Bank Target partnered with ChargePoint Tesla and Electrify America to provide level 2 and 3 Charging. If you use level 2 charging equipment you can add about 20-30 miles of driving range in an hour.

On the other hand you will gain 8-20 miles per minute when using level 3 charging. The exact figure will vary based on your EV’s efficiency and charging speed. Most cars can charge from empty to 80% within 30 minutes when using Level 3 charging at Target.

Level 3 charging can lower the time needed to reach a desirable battery level. The stations at Target provide 50-350 kilowatts (kW) of charge. While a 350-kW station will charge an electric vehicle faster it doesn’t mean your car can accept it. For this reason you should always verify your EV’s charging limit.

Here is an estimate of the time needed to charge some popular electric vehicles at Target from 10% to 80%.with 350-kW level 3 equipment.

Ford Mustang Mach E- 16 minutes Volkswagen ID.4- 25 minutes Porsche Taycan- 14 minutes Tesla Model 3- 15 minutes Tesla Model Y- 16 minutes Nissan Leaf-27 minutes

While some vehicles have similar charging speeds they may not offer the same driving ranges. This implies that one owner may use the same battery capacity to drive a longer distance than another EV driver.

The difference in driving range depends on the battery capacity and age. Per Autoweek it could also fluctuate due to driving styles tire conditions and the weather.

Other locations to charge your electric car

Looking for a place to charge your electric vehicle? Walmart has #EV chargers available at retail locations across 29 states and 435 EV charging stations in operation at stores and clubs. Learn more: https://t.co/xgT0ix3xks pic.twitter.com/gaVieuj7I1 — Walmart Inc. (@WalmartInc) April 10 2019

Many businesses now offer EV charging stations to embrace the electrification of the auto market. Hence car owners now have many options for places to charge their cars.

Walmart opened its first Electrify America EV charging station in Arizona. Over time the company has launched more EV stations in most stores. The cost of charging your EV at Walmart is 43 cents per kW per hour.

Another retail store offering EV charging stations is Costco. If you have a membership with the company you will pay a $10 deposit to use the facilities. However non-members must pay a $20 deposit refundable after completing the transaction. The cost of charging your EV at Costco depends on the kilowatts used per hour.

Sam’s Club a Walmart-owned retail division is another location where you can charge your EV. The charging prices vary based on the provider and location. EV owners using the 90-kW equipment pay a lower rate than those using 350-kW plugs.

It’s easy to find an EV charging station since many businesses now offer them. Discover nearby facilities by researching online or using a tool like PlugShare.",,,,,,

A popular misconception has emerged about Elon Musk and Tesla: The megabillionaire’s love affair with Twitter is the main reason Tesla shares have lost so much value this year. But Tesla’s steep stock selloff this week proved that the problems at Musk’s car company go well beyond Twitter.

Even as Musk signals he may give up his CEO title at Twitter investors became concerned that the outlook for Tesla’s sales and profit is taking a turn for the worse. A sign of the weakening demand: Tesla has announced a rare sale. The company offered two rebates for buyers who take delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year initially offering a $3750 discount earlier this month. Tesla then doubled that rebate to $7500 Thursday.

“Tesla clearly is starting to see demand cracks in China and in the US at a time that EV competition is increasing across the board” said Dan Ives tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull who cut his price target for the stock Friday from $250 to $175. “The price cuts that Tesla enacted was the straw that broke the camel’s back on the stock.”

Another reason Tesla’s stock is sinking: The US economy could tip into recession next year hurting car sales. Musk said on an Twitter Spaces call Thursday he foresees the economy will be in a “serious recession” in 2023.

“I think there is going to be some macro drama that’s higher than people currently think” he said according to Reuters adding that homes and cars will get “disproportionately impacted” by economic conditions.

Tesla’s questionable valuation

Part of the problem with Tesla’s stock price is that critics question whether it was ever worth the trillion-dollar valuation it had at the start of the year. At its peak Tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined despite having a fraction of the sales of any of them. Today it is worth $399 billion.

“It got ahead of itself in the near-term” said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures another Tesla fan. “I still believe this can be a much bigger company. I think it will see those kinds of numbers again. But it could take a long long time to get there.”

Tesla’s growth prospects - a target of 50% sales growth annually helped drive that valuation. It conceded in October that it will miss that sales target for this year.

The stock’s climb to dizzying heights – rising 743% in 2020 alone – was driven by Musk’s reputation as a genius who would disrupt the massive global auto industry.

“Tesla was viewed as a disruptive technology company not as an automaker and a large part of that premium is related to Musk” said Ives.

Overpromising and underdelivering

Critics of Tesla said much of its sky-high valuation was based on promises that Musk made about future products many of which came years after they were originally promised.

A prime example is the Cybertruck the Tesla pickup truck first unveiled three years ago with promises that production would start in 2021. Now it is slated to start production next year with a ramp-up in production in 2024 putting it years behind other electric pickup offerings from Ford and upstart EV maker Rivian both of which have electric pickups available for purchase today. It could also trail planned electric pickup offerings from General Motors.

“Elon Musk has a pathological problem with the truth” said Gordon Johnson one of the largest critics of Tesla among analysts. “When people say he’s a genius and innovator it’s based on all his promises he never lives up to.”

Johnson said Tesla shares will have a much steeper fall ahead once it starts being priced like other automakers rather than on its promises. He said that for Tesla to hit its growth targets it needs to be building new plants almost every year but that new factories in Germany and Texas that opened in spring are still not operating at full capacity. And he said that its plant in China has had to scale back production due to weak sales in the market in the face of the Covid restrictions.

“Demand in the US has collapsed” he said. “Two months ago your wait time was two or three months. Now you can get one immediately. They’re going to build more cars than they sell for a third straight quarter. It’s the definition of excess capacity.”

Tesla is still by far the largest EV maker worldwide although that title is being challenged in some key markets by Volkswagen in Europe and by BYD in China. And more competition is coming from established automakers such as Ford and GM.

The Twitter factor

That’s not to say Twitter has played no role in Tesla’s stock price demise this year: Tesla shares have lost 66% of their value since Musk’s interest in Twitter was first disclosed in April with a 45% decline since he closed on the deal in late October.

Investors have been disappointed that Musk appears to be paying for so much of his $44 billion purchase of Twitter by selling Tesla stock. Musk Tesla’s largest shareholder has sold $23 billion worth of Tesla shares since his interest in Twitter became public in April.

On Thursday’s Twitter Spaces call Musk promised he was done selling shares of Tesla stock until at least 2024 if not beyond. But he hasn’t lived up to a previous promise in April that he was done selling Tesla shares selling $14.4 billion of that stock since that time.

“It’s been a Pinocchio situation for Musk saying he is done selling stock. Investors want to see him walk the walk and not just talk the talk” said Ives.

Another Twitter factor: Musk named himself CEO of Twitter the third major company he leads along with Tesla and SpaceX. So many people assumed that Musk’s loss of focus on Tesla has spooked its former fans on Wall Street.

But this week began with Musk running a poll - on Twitter of course - asking if he should give up the CEO title at his social media plaything. He promised he would comply with the result and 57.5% of those who voted said they want him gone.

That departure may take a while - Musk tweeted he will resign “as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” And the same tweet he cautioned that even if he gives up the CEO title at Twitter he’s not walking away totally saying that he plans to “just run the software & servers teams” after finding a new “fool” to be CEO.

The poll results late Sunday were enough to lift Tesla shares in early trading Monday but the shares ended the day slightly lower and have lost significantly more ground every day since. Tesla shares fell 9% Thursday and it ended the week down 18% after another 2% drop on Friday.

And then there’s the question of how much damage the debacle at Twitter has done to the Tesla brand. Musk has fired thousands of employees banned journalists while allowing Donald Trump and other previously banned accounts back online called for the prosecution of Dr. Anthony Fauci embraced conspiracy theories and made anti-trans statements in his short tenure as CEO.

It may have endeared him to some but angered other potential buyers including liberals who might be willing to pay a premium for a more environmentally friendly vehicle.

“I think it was measurable damage” said Munster who believes the publicity over his time at Twitter cost Tesla 5% of its sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvdGVzbGEtc3RvY2stcGx1bW1ldGVkLWVsb24tbXVzay10d2l0dGVyL3N0b3J5P2lkPTk1NzU2NzMz0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3MvdGVzbGEtc3RvY2stcGx1bW1ldGVkLWVsb24tbXVzay10d2l0dGVyL3N0b3J5P2lkPTk1NzU2NzMz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla stock has plummeted since Elon Musk took over Twitter. Here's why.,"Shares of Tesla have fallen 45% in two months since the Twitter acquisition.

Tesla stock has plummeted since Elon Musk took over Twitter. Here's why.

Tesla stock has plummeted since CEO Elon Musk took over Twitter falling more than 45% in about over two months.

In all the company's stock has dropped more than 65% since January when Musk began investing in Twitter. By comparison the tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen about half as far over that period.

Musk said on Tuesday that he will resign as head of Twitter when the company identifies a successor. The news temporarily buoyed Tesla stock before it again turned downward.

The electric vehicle company faces falling demand amid recession fears heightened competition and pandemic-induced production challenges.

Moreover some analysts and major investors have sharply criticized Musk over a perceived lack of focus on Tesla saying the company needs leadership as it contends with an adverse business environment.

""Musk is viewed as 'asleep at the wheel' from a leadership perspective for Tesla at the time investors need a CEO to navigate this Category 5 storm"" Dan Ives a longtime Tesla bull and managing director of equity research at Wedbush said in a research note on Thursday.

""Instead Musk is laser focused on Twitter which has been an ongoing nightmare that never ends for investors with hopes a new CEO is picked in the coming weeks as a first step forward"" Ives added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Aside from investor concerns over Musk the company's stock losses owe in part to insurgent rivals and diminished demand.

Tesla remains the top-selling electric vehicle company in the U.S. but its lead has slipped in recent months as competitors offer a host of affordable alternatives a S &P Global Mobility report showed last month.

The company held 65% market share of new registered vehicles in the U.S. through the third quarter of this year a drop from 71% last year and 79% in 2020 the report found.

Responding to weakened demand Tesla announced on Wednesday that it would offer $7500 discounts on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered in the U.S. this month. Shares in Tesla fell by nearly 9% the following day.

Still significant investor attention has focused on Musk and his apparent focus on Twitter.

The world's richest person has sold nearly $40 billion worth of Tesla stock since late last year including a $3.6 billion sale as recently as last week as he has financed the acquisition of Twitter.

The sales have reduced the stake Musk holds in Tesla raising questions about his continued level of involvement with the company.

Some major Tesla investors have called for Musk to place his primary focus on Tesla which boasts a market capitalization of $392 billion far larger than the value of Twitter for which Musk spent $44 billion.

""I think it is in the best interest for Tesla shareholders for Elon to be back at Tesla working full time"" Ross Gerber CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management tweeted on Sunday.

For his part Musk has defended his actions at Twitter as part of an aggressive effort to rescue the company from financial peril which he described in a Twitter Spaces interview on Tuesday as an ""emergency fire drill.""

""That's the reason for my actions"" he added. ""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever.""

In a Twitter Spaces interview on Thursday Musk vowed to stop selling Tesla stock until at least 2024 though he has previously violated commitments to halt sales of the stock. He added meanwhile that he hadn't missed ""a single important Tesla meeting"" since acquiring Twitter.

Musk also said on Thursday that he expects the economy to fall into a ""serious recession"" next year further slashing demand for expensive items.

To be sure this year has pummeled automakers across the sector. Shares of Ford have plummeted 45% in 2022; while General Motors has fallen 43% and Toyota has dropped 26%.

Interest rate hikes at the Federal Reserve have spiked borrowing costs making car purchases more difficult for consumers already strained by sky-high inflation. Meanwhile pandemic-induced production bottlenecks and chip shortages have persisted increasing costs and causing delivery delays.

In recent months falling consumer sentiment has placed added pressure on the industry.

Despite these headwinds Tesla can stanch its financial bleeding and turn around its business said Ives of Wedbush Securities.

He attributed roughly 70% of Tesla's stock decline in recent months to Musk's focus on Twitter and urged Musk to return his attention to the company and stop selling Tesla stock.

""Taking a step back the long term Tesla transformational story remains intact"" Ives said adding that he expects global electric vehicle demand to significantly accelerate over the coming years.

Tesla he said is the ""clear leader poised to benefit front and center.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGVzbGEtb3duZXItc3RyYW5kZWQtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWV2ZS1jYXItd291bGRudC1jaGFyZ2UtaW4tY29sZC0yMDIyLTEy0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90ZXNsYS1vd25lci1zdHJhbmRlZC1jaHJpc3RtYXMtZXZlLWNhci13b3VsZG50LWNoYXJnZS1pbi1jb2xkLTIwMjItMTI_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla owner says he was stranded as his car wouldn't charge in the cold,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.businessinsider.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /tesla-owner-stranded-christmas-eve-car-wouldnt-charge-in-cold-2022-12 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223C19E10>, 'Connection to www.businessinsider.com timed out.

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Contract chipmaker Hua Hong Semiconductor has long played second fiddle to China’s national champion Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp in their home base of Shanghai but US restrictions on advanced technology and Beijing’s yearning for chip self-sufficiency have thrust it into the spotlight.

Already listed in Hong Kong China’s second-largest chip foundry received regulatory approval last month for a $2.5bn secondary listing in Shanghai on the tech-centric Star Market. Most of the funds to be raised are intended for upgrading and expanding its production facilities.

Hua Hong’s lack of cutting-edge technology has proved a boon rather than a handicap of late. During its third-quarter earnings call in November the company said it had been barely affected by the actions of the US as the chips it produces are several generations older than the latest microprocessors.

Industry experts said China had to re-evaluate its domestic semiconductor supply chain after Washington imposed curbs on the development of high-performance chips. Hua Hong’s focus on older chips could make it Beijing’s new favourite with the benefits of policy support and funding to follow.

“Our years of pushing for localising advanced chip production had almost reached a dead end” said a Shanghai-based government official who did not wish to be named. “The vulnerability of the localised semiconductor supply chain has been exposed by the latest restrictions on us accessing crucial US equipment.”

Washington introduced a series of sweeping restrictions in October which have barred US companies from exporting technology for producing chips with features smaller than 14 nanometres or 16nm in some cases. This made it much harder for leading producer SMIC to catch up with the advanced factories or “fabs” of competitors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Hua Hong told the Financial Times it had “always been in full compliance on rules and regulations with respect to export control” and would continue to try to attract investors domestically and globally because of the large capital expenditure required for capacity expansion.

Compared with SMIC Hua Hong has adopted a different strategy of optimising its manufacturing techniques for the mature “nodes” or generations of its less-miniaturised chips in order to maximise the performance and reliability of its products. They have found wide use in the Internet of Things 5G telecoms equipment and electric vehicle markets.

“Just try to squeeze the most juice out of the mature nodes” said Douglas Fuller an expert in China’s semiconductor industry at Copenhagen Business School. “That’s a sustainable path now when we count all the subsidies and the rate of return to society.”

Hua Hong’s older processes also provide an opportunity for less advanced Chinese chip equipment makers to test and improve their products by supplying its production lines and replacing foreign tools that may become restricted.

“For Chinese equipment manufacturers replacing imported equipment on Hua Hong’s mature process lines is more easily achieved” said William Li a Taiwan-based analyst at research firm Counterpoint.

Hua Hong has also acted to localise its suppliers in areas such as equipment and materials according to three people familiar with the matter. In addition it is giving domestic customers higher priority.

In 2022 the chipmaker cut orders several times from foreign customers in order to prioritise domestic companies as its production capacity became overstretched according to four Hua Hong employees who did not wish to be named.

Hua Hong’s products for original equipment manufacturers are increasingly competing with Germany’s Infineon and Texas Instruments of the US.

“Many Chinese customers have replaced imported modules with homegrown ones since geopolitical tensions escalated” said an executive from a power module company in the southern hub of Shenzhen. “So we are partnering with Hua Hong to pick up as many orders as possible.”

The executive who preferred to remain anonymous said Chinese manufacturers such as Hua Hong and SMIC were more co-operative and “more willing to come down in price” for the struggling chip market.

According to the Shanghai government official one way to encourage core industry players to concentrate on basic chips was to accelerate the process for Hua Hong’s secondary listing. Almost 70 per cent of funds raised will be invested in its only 12-inch (300mm) wafer fab in the eastern city of Wuxi according to its prospectus.

A government adviser working with fabs across China who did not wish to be named said Hua Hong had been underrated in the past by industrial policymakers. It was seen as taking a less proactive role in research and development.

When the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund restructured its investment portfolio in 2021 it chose to divest Hua Hong shares. However it returned in June with a $232mn investment.

Strong demand in its home market meant Hua Hong’s third-quarter results stood out among its foundry peers. Quarterly revenues grew 40 per cent year on year to $630mn while net profits doubled to $104mn compared with the same period a year earlier.

Analysts at Jefferies investment bank said the growth in capacity at the Wuxi fab would increase Hua Hong’s momentum earning it more orders from local chip design houses.

“Hua Hong will be a strong force driving the domestic chip supply chain’s growth” said the government adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L3dvcmxkL3J1c3NpYS1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4tdGVjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The supply chain that keeps tech flowing to Russia,"In March this year a new firm appeared in Turkey's corporate registry. Azu International described itself as a wholesale trader of IT products and a week later began shipping U.S. computer parts to Russia.

Business was brisk Russian customs records show. The United States and the EU had recently restricted sales of sensitive technology to Russia because of its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and many Western tech companies had suspended all dealings with Moscow.

Co-founded by Gokturk Agvaz a Turkish businessman Azu International stepped in to help fill the supply gap. Over the next seven months the company exported at least $20 million worth of components to Russia including chips made by U.S. manufacturers according to Russian customs records.",,,,,,,,,

These variants were found in six Korean patients with Stargardt disease and three of them (p.Arg290Gln p.Thr1117Ala and p.Asn1588Tyr) were novel in a previous study20. The p.Asp645Asn and p.Cys1140Trp variants were previously found in Korean or Chinese patients with Stargardt disease2122. Our study indicated that the significantly decreased ABCA4 expression of p.Arg290Gln p.Thr1117Ala p.Cys1140Trp and p.Asn1588Tyr variants on the plasma membrane could be due to intracellular degradation. In particular p.Thr1117Ala p.Cys1140Trp and p.Asn1588Tyr indicated remarkably decreased ABCA4 expression whereas ABCA4 expression of p.Asp645Asn was comparable with that of the wild-type. In a previous study p.Asp645Asn indicated an increased affinity for ATP compared with that of the wild-type in ATP-labeling experiments23. Additional functional experiments including ATPase activity assays and molecular mechanism experiments are required to determine the effect of this variant on ABCA4 functions. Recently Runhart et al. reported that a mild variant of ABCA4 p.Asn1868Ile had incomplete penetrance and could result in late-onset Stargardt disease when it presents in trans with other severe ABCA4 variants2425. Therefore even if p.Asp645Asn is insufficient to cause loss-of-function of ABCA4 it can cause a disease phenotype when it is associated with another severe ABCA4 variant. In previous studies all Korean patients with Stargardt disease were heterozygotes for two ABCA4 variants2026. The patient with p.Asp645Asn had another variant p.Lys2049ArgfsTer12. Genetic testing of the parents of this patient was not performed. However the family tree indicated that the parents were not affected by the disease and the patient did not have any other ABCA4 variant other than the two variants. In addition p.Lys2049ArgfsTer12 was present with the p.Thr1117Ala variant in another Stargardt disease patient. In this family the patient's parents were not affected by the disease as well and the patient did not have any other ABCA4 variant other than the two variants26. Further p.Lys2049ArgfsTer12 was reported in two Korean patients with Stargardt disease in another study21. Based on these findings it can be inferred that p.Lys2049ArgfsTer12 exists in trans with p.Asp645Asn in a patient with Stargardt disease. In a previous in silico analysis p.Lys2049ArgfsTer12 was categorized as a severe variant27.

Recently p.Arg290Gln and p.Asn1588Tyr were categorized as mild/moderate variants whereas p.Cys1140Trp was categorized as a causative variant of unknown severity using in silico analysis27. In previous studies patients carrying the p.Arg290Gln or p.Asn1588Tyr variants had another ABCA4 variant p.Leu1157Ter. In another patient the p.Cys1140Trp variant existed in trans with an in-frame ABCA4 variant p.Ile1114del26. To date the severity of these two variants p.Leu1157Ter and p.Ile1114del has not been reported. In a previous study the researchers investigated a genotype–phenotype correlation in their patients26. They observed that patients with p.Asp645Asn p.Thr1117Ala p.Cys1140Trp or p.Asn1588Tyr variant indicated typical features of Stargardt disease flecks bilateral macular atrophy and blocked fluorescence in fluorescein angiography. The patient with p.Arg290Gln exhibited bull’s-eye maculopathy without flecks. The age of onset was 11–16 years and the median best-corrected visual acuity was 20/320. To determine whether the ABCA4 variants examined in this study have a significant effect on the phenotype of Stargardt disease analyzing the phenotype according to the genotype with a larger number of patients is necessary.

Allikmets et al. reported several putative important sites in the ABCA4 promoter using the Transfac transcription factor database18. Although photoreceptor-specific elements were not identified in the ABCA4 promoter region similar sequences were found in the regulatory regions of other photoreceptor genes including rhodopsin and S-antigen/arrestin. However the functional roles of these sites were not examined using molecular experimental tools. Recently Cherry et al. identified and functionally characterized human eye-specific CREs19. In their study a promoter variant (rs11802887) and an enhancer variant (rs752024867) found in patients with Stargardt disease indicated significantly increased or decreased reporter activity respectively although both were not within the readily recognizable transcription factor-binding motif.

This study investigated the effect of genetic variants in the ABCA4 proximal promoter on ABCA4 transcription using in vitro assays. The luciferase reporter assay indicated that c.-1086A>C c.-900A>T and c.-761C>A variants had significantly altered luciferase activities compared with that of the wild-type. We found that GATA-2 was bound to the ABCA4 promoter region near the c.-1086A>C or c.-761C>A variant site. GATA-2 plays an important role in the development of various tissue types. The GATA family is originally divided into the hematopoietic- (GATA-1/2/3) or cardiac (GATA-4/5/6) family of transcription factors and several variants in GATA2 are associated with various blood diseases2829303132. Further GATA-2 plays an important role in other tissues including retina central nervous system and prostate333435. In particular a previous study revealed that GATA-2 is an essential transcription factor for the transcription of neuroglobin which is mainly expressed in the retina and brain35. Regarding the effect of GATA-2 on the regulation of transporters GATA-2 plays an important role in maintaining water homeostasis in the body by controlling aquaporin 2 expression in the collecting tubules36. This study found that the sequence of wild-type c.-1086A (ACT A TCTCT) is similar to the consensus sequence (WGATAR) of GATA-2. Our prediction that the c.-1086C variant (ACT C TCTCT sequence) reduces GATA-2 binding affinity because it is less consistent with the GATA-2 consensus sequence was confirmed using a gel shift assay. The c.-761A variant also had a sequence similar to the consensus sequence of GATA-2 GGG A TGGAA. The wild-type c.-761C contains GGG C TGGAA which is hypothesized to lower the binding affinity of GATA-2 and this was confirmed using a gel shift assay. In addition we observed that GATA-2 acts as an activator of the ABCA4 promoter similar to the role in the transcription of neuroglobin. Our data suggest that the decreased luciferase activity of c.-1086A>C results from the reduced binding of GATA-2 while the increased luciferase activity of c.-761C>A results from the increased binding of GATA-2.

HLF (originally known as E2A-HLF) in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia is a chimeric transcription factor produced by the translocation of E2A on chromosome 19 and HLF on chromosome 1737. Although the t (19:17) E2A-HLF leukemia subtype is rare it has a high mortality rate because it is resistant to chemotherapy38. HLF is mainly expressed in the liver lungs kidneys and neurons but not in normal blood cells39. The role of HLF in the body is not clearly elucidated although it is involved in activating coagulation factor VII and factor IX genes and in synapse formation in the central nervous system in a mouse model3940. In a previous study we revealed that HLF binds to the promoter region of lactosylceramide α-23-sialytransferase 5 (ST3GalV) and regulates the transcription of this gene41. ST3GalV is an enzyme involved in the production of ganglioside in the body. It is distributed throughout the body and is particularly highly expressed in the central nervous system4243. In this study we observed that the sequence of the c.-900T variant (GA T AACACA) was similar to the consensus sequence of HLF (RT T ACRYAAT). In addition it was predicted that the binding affinity for HLF is weaker in the wild-type c.-900A because the wild-type sequence (GA G AACACA) is not as similar to the consensus sequence of HLF; this prediction was confirmed using a gel shift assay. Furthermore HLF activated the ABCA4 promoter. These results suggest that the increased luciferase activity of c.-900A>T is a consequence of the stronger binding between the c.-900T variant and HLF.

This study revealed that several ABCA4 variants found in patients with Stargardt disease could affect ABCA4 expression and common variants of the ABCA4 proximal promoter alter the ABCA4 transcriptional activity which is regulated by GATA-2 and HLF. In particular the H3 haplotype reduced promoter activity; therefore investigating whether this haplotype is associated with the ABCA4-associated retinopathy including Stargardt disease through presenting with other ABCA4 variants is necessary.",,,,,,,,,

Julia Simpson the president and chief executive of the W.T.T.C. called the report “a big shout-out for nature.”

Alarmingly the report notes that one in four species worldwide faces the threat of extinction (as assessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature) and that species abundance the number of individuals of each species in a particular location has fallen 68 percent since 1970 according to the World Wildlife Fund. To combat these declines the report which has been endorsed by the Secretariat of the U.N. Biodiversity Conference and the World Commission on Protected Areas offers recommendations that include raising awareness of the importance of biodiversity among travelers; auditing travel companies and those that supply them for their impact on nature; collaborating with local communities as guardians of nature; and investing in species protection and habitat reconstruction.

While the W.T.T.C. has already published a road map to net-zero carbon emissions for the travel industry by 2050 Ms. Simpson calls nature positive tourism “a practical guide for our industry” to protect nature and encourage biodiversity while awaiting more powerful solutions to decarbonize travel particularly aviation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vbWFya2V0cy90aGUtdG9wLTQtZG93LXN0b2NrLXdpbm5lcnMtb2YtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One Company Dominates Wall Street on Oil Frenzy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/markets/the-top-4-dow-stock-winners-of-2022 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vbWFya2V0cy90aGUtdG9wLTQtZG93LXN0b2NrLXdpbm5lcnMtb2YtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL25vLWxvbmctbGluZXMtYXQtcGhsLWJ1dC10cmF2ZWxlcnMtc2VlLWNhbmNlbGxhdGlvbnMtZGVsYXlzL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy9uby1sb25nLWxpbmVzLWF0LXBobC1idXQtdHJhdmVsZXJzLXNlZS1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLWRlbGF5cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No long lines at PHL but travelers see cancellations delays,"No long lines at airport just some cancelations and delays

No long lines at airport just some cancelations and delays

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Holiday travelers are hitting some snags.

While the winter storm has moved out it's still causing some delays from the roads to the skies.

On Christmas Eve travelers braved brutally cold temperatures.

At one point more than 200 million Americans were under a winter weather advisory or warning as a result of the massive winter storm that just swept across the country.

That led to problems at airports across the country as people tried to get home for the holidays.

More than 5800 flights within into or out of the U.S. were canceled by Friday night according to the tracking site FlightAware causing more mayhem as travelers try to make it home for the holidays.

At Philadelphia International Airport we counted about three dozen cancellations and another two dozen delays just this morning.

Philadelphia resident Maya Rajan spent all last night trying get back to her family in Detroit Michigan as her flight kept gettting delayed.

""First it was 5:30 and then it got delayed to 7 but at that point I still stayed at home"" Rajan said. Then the flight was delayed to 8:15.

""So then I left to come here and then right as soon as I checked my bag it delayed to 9:55. And then as I was calling my family it delayed to 10:55"" said Rajan.

If you opt to drive to your destination today be extra careful.

After the rain and snow we received over the past couple days followed by yesterday's flash freeze.

There will probably be some slick spots on the roads especially on highway ramps and bridges.

So if you have to drive anywhere AAA suggests you slow down and give yourself plenty of distance between yourself and the car in front of you.

Ole Miss Preview,"Joey McGuire will lead the Red Raiders against Lane Kiffin and the Rebels Wednesday

NRG Stadium in Houston Texas is the home of the 2023 Texas Bowl between the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Ole Miss Rebels. The Big 12 and the SEC will meet head-to-head on Dec. 28 with kickoff slated for 8 p.m. (CST).

Previously having won the bowl in 2012 and lost 2015 it will be the Red Raiders’ third time in the Texas Bowl. In his first season as head coach of the Red Raiders Joey McGuire has had a successful season. With two wins over ranked opponents this season (University of Houston and Texas Longhorns) Texas Tech finished 4th in the Big 12 with a record of 5-4.

McGuire led his team to a winning season finishing 7-5 overall. But while his first season as head coach in Lubbock was a success it didn’t come easily.

The Red Raiders had a problematic season when it came to having a single quarterback at the helm. Due to injury the Red Raiders not only had three quarterbacks that routinely rotated into the starting role but three quarterbacks that threw for 1000 yards each.

Between Donovan Smith Behren Morton and Tyler Shough the Red Raiders accumulated 3684 passing yards for 25 touchdowns and 17 interceptions.

Nonetheless the Red Raiders finished their season strong with Shough taking the snaps. Winning the last three games of the season Shough accumulated 1062 passing yards with six touchdowns and three interceptions. Posting a 59.4 completion percentage Shough had the best passer rating among his teammates at 134.1.

Shough led the Red Raiders out of the trenches with big victories over the Kansas Jayhawks the Iowa State Cyclones and the Oklahoma Sooners.

Most notable was the 51-48 overtime victory over Oklahoma. On the Red Raiders’ Senior Day Shough put together a phenomenal performance passing for 436 yards and two touchdowns. Wide-receiver Jerand Bradley who had himself a career day caught eight passes for 173 yards and a touchdown.

While the Red Raiders capped off a successful regular season they will have to face off against a tough opponent in Ole Miss on Wednesday.

In his third season as head coach at Ole Miss Lane Kiffin led the Rebels to a 8-4 season record finishing 3rd in the SEC West. Trailing only No. 5 Alabama and No. 16 LSU Ole Miss finished with a 4-4 conference record.

Unlike the Red Raiders Ole Miss lost its last three games of the season to Alabama Arkansas and Mississippi State. While entering the Texas Bowl on a three-game losing streak Ole Miss has all the offensive artillery to cause problems against the Red Raiders.

Leading the Rebels this season was quarterback Jaxson Dart. The sophomore transfer from USC threw for 2613 yards and 18 touchdowns. Despite throwing eight interceptions Dart completed 63% of his passes and remained a consistent quarterback for the Rebels in 2022.

Perhaps the biggest impact and surprise of the season is freshman running back Quinshon Judkins. A true freshman Judkins went from playing at Pike Road High School in Alabama to being the primary running back for Ole Miss.

It was expected that Judkins would take on a secondary role behind Zach Evans who transferred from TCU but the freshman took control and had a stellar season. With 251 rushing attempts Judkins posted 1476 yards for 16 touchdowns. With eight games with over a hundred rushing yards and six multi-touchdown games Judkins averaged a monstrous 5.9 yards per carry.

All of that led to a stock market year almost everyone will be glad is over. The Star Tribune gathered six Twin Cities investment professionals in early December to talk about how to emerge from a year that left little choice but to absorb losses in both equity and fixed-income markets. This year was the hardest in decades for the industry and our Investors Roundtable guests are ready to turn the page and move on. They expect more market volatility but also see opportunities in 2023. Last year our roundtable was on Dec. 7 when the S&P 500 was at 4686. Our participants at that time had anticipated a rocky year but modest growth. Russia's war with Ukraine turned the tide. Picks that day were for the S&P 500 index to finish 2022 between 4800 and 5150. What a difference a year makes. This year's discussion touched on the markets the economy and where to look in 2023 to find positive returns. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Meet the roundtable

Lisa Erickson Senior vice president and head of public markets at U.S. Bank Craig Johnson Chief market technician at Piper Sandler Jim Paulsen Chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group Martha Pomerantz Portfolio manager and head of the Minneapolis office of Evercore Wealth Management David Royal Chief investment officer and chief financial officer of Thrivent Roger Sit Chief investment officer of Sit Investment Associates

Why did the market sink in 2022?

Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group: In a simple way it was just nothing more than overheat. Your classic overheat. It was a product of a number of things but certainly the severity of the pandemic and its uniqueness and how frightening it was. It caused people to over hoard and policy officials to over stimulate.

I think the big thing that really tipped it that wasn't there at the end of last year was the war. Which probably elongated the peak of inflation that might have been earlier had it not been for that.

Lisa Erickson senior vice president and head of public markets at U.S. Bank: I think if you see 2021 as the year of reopening 2022 is really the year of inflation.

Inflation just ended up more sustained than most believed it could have been. And as a result of that you had a repricing as central banks really had to pivot and tighten policy. And that caused multiples to fall in the U.S. equity markets.

Roger Sit chief investment officer of Sit Investment Associates: I'll take it one step higher. The problem with the market this year has been the fear of going into a recession. And it is because the central banks — and not just the U.S. but all around the world — have become much more aggressive in terms of raising rates. Because of inflation because of the war because of other geopolitical issues.

And everyone is afraid that we're going to have a policy mistake done by the central banks around the world that's going to throw us into a deep recession.

Craig Johnson chief market technician at Piper Sandler: I remember at the start of the year everybody talked about inflation being transitory. And then you pretty much figured out that it wasn't transitory — that it was more of a wage spiral. And then the Fed jumps all over this and starts raising rates very very quickly leading to the scenario of hard soft violent landing. Nobody really knows at this point in time.

Martha Pomerantz: portfolio manager and head of the Minneapolis office of Evercore Wealth Management: The Fed raised rates so quickly so much. And when they do that it totally changes the dynamics. So the multiple that you're willing to pay on stocks simply goes down.

The reason that the FANG stocks — these are the technology-orientated stocks — came down is because they had the highest multiples. It's growth-oriented stocks technology stocks or long bonds that come down the most because they're the most vulnerable when this happens.

Equity and bond markets were down in 2022. What are the implications?

David Royal chief investment officer and chief financial officer of Thrivent: This was the worst year for a 60/40 portfolio [60% equities and 40% bonds] since 1931. Investors were shocked — I own bonds; I thought I was safe.

This is probably a time when you want to be finally adding some duration if rates really are peaking. The first thing I learned about investing was when you have a recession you've got to add duration.

Sit: The whole reason we had this crappy bond market on top of an equity market which hasn't occurred since the 1930s is because we we stole from our future with all this quantitative easing. Remember we had a 16-plus-year bull run where we had artificially low interest rates around the world because it was staggered everyone cutting rates. At one time we had more than 70 percent of GDP in a negative interest rate environment.

I think this is reaching a point where it is now appropriate to have a more diversified portfolio of both bonds and equity depending on your time outlook.

Pomerantz: Now is a better time to be a bond investor because yields are up so you can actually buy something and you can [earn interest] on it; it's no longer this ""there is no alternative."" There is an alternative. Now you can own bonds instead of owning stocks. And with anything we think the interest rates will be peaking at some point because we think we're beyond inflation rising. The period ahead is a lot more positive than it has been.

Johnson: I asked a friend of mine Sam Stovall over at [investment research firm] CFRA what the forward returns are when you have a negative return in your 60/40 portfolio. And he found that going back since 1972 a year after those negative returns your portfolio is up 13.1 percent. And it's higher 78 percent of the time. So to your point now is the time to be leaning into the market and buying investments.

Erickson: We would encourage investors to consider alternative assets. Things like real estate or global infrastructure because when you have a difficult period like this having diversified income streams from a number of different sources can be really helpful to provide that balance to the portfolio.

Cryptocurrency also crashed in 2022. Can it still become a regular part of investment management?

Sit: I've never been a believer in the cryptocurrency. I believe in the technology. I believe in blockchain. But I've never been a believer in this cryptocurrency and it's because I believe that you need a sovereign body backing it.

Paulsen: There's this thought that crypto is collapsing in a way that it has never done before. It's down 70-some percent from its high. There are two other periods where it went down 80 plus over a one-year period. So I don't know if crypto is doing anything different than it's done the whole time of late.

Johnson: A couple of things on the crypto landscape. Number one Fidelity has come back and said that it is going to continue to keep moving forward with trading of cryptos and putting it into 401(k)s. They're still believers from that perspective.

Second thing is that cryptocurrencies are a way for people to do transactions. There are more people that have internet connections in the world than have bank accounts. What is going to ultimately make this a more investable asset class? It's going to take more rules more regulations and it's going to take the adults to come into the room.

Royal: We learned a lot about Bitcoin by how it behaved last year. It has been the opposite of an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has behaved like an extremely long duration asset where your entire bet is on the terminal value. But generally speaking if I'm going to take a bet on a really long duration asset I'd rather buy into a profitable software or biotech company where I can at least kind of value that in my head.

Investors have been beaten up in 2022. How should they approach 2023?

Pomerantz: I think it's the same investment principles. Whether it's a bull market or a bear market — it doesn't really matter. The most important thing is to focus on what your long-term goals are and not be so focused on the short term. Setting an asset allocation that's appropriate for each person's personal circumstances is more important than anything else making sure you're diversified and own high-quality holdings. Make sure you know that these businesses are going to be around that they really have a stream of income that you can depend on.

Sit: It is coming back to security selection — a stock-picking market. That's where you have to find those companies that have a real product or real service that can grow their sales line. Hopefully they're of that high quality and they get pricing flexibility. You want companies that are scalable so when they get the volume and sales that leads to exponential improvement in margins and that leads to better earnings per share growth.

Paulsen: I think people have been through a lot of volatility a lot of disappointment a lot of fear. When people are really fearful that's when you want to go the other way. And when people buy anything with a dot-com that's when you want to get out.

What market indicators should investors pay attention to in 2023 and why?

Royal: One that I think hasn't gotten as much attention recently as much as I think it deserves is the decline in productivity. Productivity is down three-and-a-quarter percent so far this year. These are volatile numbers but they are probably directionally related to the fact that real wages are down roughly 3 percent year over year.

If you had a persistent decline in productivity perhaps due to COVID's lingering effects what would you have? You'd have strong labor demand because you need more people to do stuff. You'd see inflation you'd see a decline in real wages you'd probably see things that look like supply-chain issues as various inputs got stress throughout the whole process.

Erickson: Probably the number-one indicator is going to be inflation because that's what's really driving the more restrictive policy whether it's monetary and even of course a lot less emphasis on fiscal support as well. A second key indicator is the direction of monetary policy and when the Fed can start taking the foot off the gas pedal in terms of being very restrictive on rates.

Johnson: What I like to do is simply come back and look at the charts. One of the indicators I'm going to be looking at is going to be market breadth. And right now that's expanding and the numbers of new highs in the market are expanding.

Pomerantz: All of these things are focused on domestic issues. But a big thing for us is what happens worldwide. What happens with the war with Russia and Ukraine? If there's a cease-fire and they figure this out that's going to make a big difference because that's going to alleviate supply issues pricing issues for oil. In China it looks like they're starting to lessen some of their zero-COVID policy. If they really open that up again and we end up with another growth engine it totally changes the dynamics here.

Where should people invest in 2023 and what is your S&P 500 prediction for the year?

Erickson: We're more cautious right now and advise a more defensive positioning for investors on the back of still-elevated price pressures monetary policy that's restrictive and the fact that we're seeing slowing growth momentum both in the macro indicators as well as what companies are saying. And so that really leads us to be de-emphasizing on a relative basis equities — both international developed and U.S. — and emphasizing things like higher-quality fixed-income and real assets. As far as where we see the U.S. equity market hopefully ending up 2023 our forecast is 4275.

Pomerantz: We continue to think good diversification is the most important thing for your portfolio. And it's really based on what each individual investor's long-term goals are and what their personal situation is. And when it comes to equities we look for high-quality companies the solid balance sheets and the reasonably valued. There's a lot of opportunity to take advantage of volatility that's going on currently and also to possibly manage for tax advantages. And we think fixed-income with higher yields — it's a great time to own fixed income.

Our long-term estimate for equities over time will annualize at a rate of about 10 percent a year. I'm simply using that estimate for next year. I would say 4400.

Johnson: I've titled our 2023 outlook report ""A Hop A Drop and A Pop."" I do think we've got a little bit of a hop going on right now. I think it's going to carry on probably into the first quarter. But when the Fed is ultimately sort of done raising rates I wouldn't be surprised if they go a little bit too far and perhaps kill the patient to a degree. And then they've got to come back and restimulate and hence later on in the year I think the pop can kind of play out.

We like U.S. equities. We like the energy sector. I'm also starting to see meaningful improvements in the industrial sector with the reshoring-theme stocks. I'm also seeing positive things happening in the financials not necessarily banks per se but a lot of the insurance companies.

As I do my same bottoms-up methodology that I have done for years I'm looking for 4625.

Sit: First I think the market is discounting a recession already not a soft landing. But I think in 2023 the second half of the year it's realistic to say that we are going to see an improvement in the economy relative to this year. It's going to be a stock-picker's market. We'd be focused more on the secular growers tech health care and health technology as well as financials and the cyclical growers in industrials.

We believe you should have some quality international companies — that hopefully their marketplace is not just their home market of Japan or China but they're selling globally so they can weather the storm as well. Volatility is here to stay for a while. In terms of our S&P forecast we're seeing around 4350.

Paulsen: I think we're not going to have a recession. And if we do it'll be very mild. And I think earnings do far better than what people think and hold their own overall. There's also some really good things already happening here and we've talked about consumer confidence starting to come up.

Whatever you have in cash you might want to stick some of that in bonds for the first time in awhile. But I would still overweight equities right now and bring down my cash in particular over that period of time. And I do like cyclicals particularly industrials and financials. And my favorite sector is consumer discretionary — the one sector that's hurt the most by inflation. I also would have a small cap tilt. I think there is a lot of interest in smalls and I'd have some overseas.

I think we have a huge year I think 5100.

Royal: Focus on asset allocation this year. This isn't a year to stray too far from your long-term target allocation — whatever that is. We will start the year modestly overweight on equity nowhere near what I would view as a max overweight but we will be overweight equity.

Within fixed income we are looking for quality fixed income. With the possibility of recession out there I'd rather go longer duration but stick to the higher quality.

On the equity side there are two themes: I like some of the quality large growth names and we talked about technology. Those stocks are down quite a bit more than the broader index. And then I think small caps are interesting here. You wouldn't normally want to get overweight on small caps if you thought there was a possibility of recession because small caps could considerably feel a recession. But valuations are pretty attractive. I think they have a little bit of cushion.

For my year-end number I polled our team and got a variety of numbers. I was going to say 4500 but one of our quantitative analysts said 4503 so 4503.

Will the post office be open on 26th December?

No. Post offices will be closed on 26 December because Christmas fell on a Sunday a day that USPS staff always have off.

The US Postal Service works to avoid a situation where residents go two days without mail. While no mail will be delivered on Monday the 26th deliveries were made on Christmas Eve meaning there will be no unusual disruptions to the mail service.

USPS retail and delivery services will be closed on Monday December 26 in observance of the federal holiday. Normal services will resume on Tuesday December 27 at posted hours.

Other state and federal government offices will also be closed the day after Christmas so to avoid wasting time it is advised to make your trip on Tuesday.

Will banks be open on Monday 26 December?

Most banks follow the calendar of the US Federal Reserve the nation’s central bank which will be closed on Monday 26 December. While customers may be able to access ATMs a trip inside the bank to take care of any financial services may not be an option. When the central bank resumes its operations on Tuesday so will most banks across the country.

For those looking to spend gift cards or exchange presents you may want to check and see if the retailer will be open on Monday or if they are giving workers the day off.

The same goes for New Year’s Day

Since New Year’s Day also falls on a Sunday the holiday will be observed on Monday as well with banks reopening for business in 2023 on Tuesday 3 January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpa2luZ3MuY29tL3Bob3Rvcy9nYW1lLXBob3Rvcy12aWtpbmdzLXZzLWdpYW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Game Photos: Vikings vs. Giants,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpa2luZ3MuY29tL3Bob3Rvcy9nYW1lLXBob3Rvcy12aWtpbmdzLXZzLWdpYW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212236C1210>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

As many people get ready to prepare their Christmas dinners others may opt to go for a takeaway instead.

There are many reasons a household may do this such as limited availability in their area for all the ingredients needed to make a feast or because they simply fancy a change from the usual rush involved in making Christmas dinner. Nowadays it's all too common to order food for delivery via a food ordering app such as Uber Eats Deliveroo or Just Eat.

However Christmas is understandably a day when many services are either not operating or run a limited service and takeaways are no exception. Because of this you may find yourself left without any food if you don't check availabilities in advance.

Fortunately all the major food delivery apps have confirmed whether or not they will be running their services on Christmas Day. Here's a breakdown of what they've said...

Uber Eats

Uber Eats will operate on Christmas Day however availability will be dependent on whether local restaurants will be operating on the festive day or not. If you want a grab a takeaway from your favourite location on Christmas Day check their opening times in advance to avoid being disappointed.

Deliveroo

Deliveroo has confirmed that its services will be in operation as usual on Christmas Day. While customers will be able to log onto the Deliveroo app to make an order from local takeaways and grocers availability will depend on individual restaurants or opening hours.

Just Eat

Just Eat has highlighted that its delivery operation will be closed on Christmas Day however as it's a marketplace the majority of restaurants on the platform carry out their own delivery with their own drivers. Because of this they may choose to stay open with customers being able to order food through the app for delivery.

Therefore it's important to check with the takeaway of your choice to see if they will be open and willing to take orders on Christmas Day.

Why Trust Us?

Jennifer Garner recently revealed her favorite foundation-meets-concealer.

The 50-year-old star told Prevention she loves .

Garner shared some of her other favorite skincare recs.

Jennifer Garner tends to have the best advice. Whether she’s touting her cute casual sneakers for every day walking around the lengthening mascara she uses to create defined lashes or even the eye cream she says plumps and decreases lines we can’t get enough of her recommendations. That’s why when she recently sat down with Prevention we asked about her must-have beauty products. What topped the list?

The pick strays from her usual Neutrogena recommendations (don’t worry she still uses the brand for all of her skincare needs). In fact the Neutrogena ambassador has long loved the and s from the brand. And she was so ready to sing the brand’s praises (which makes sense—it’s been 20 years since her iconic Neutrogena face splash commercial).

The foundation-meets-concealer wins Garner’s love for covering a bit of redness. “My friend Monica Blunder has a great little [concealer]” Garner told Prevention. “I put a little around my nose.”



The beauty rec has plenty of love from shoppers to back it up. And it’ll save space in your makeup bag. Blunder Cover is designed to level up the look of skin thanks to its all-in-one concealer/foundation make that aims to even out skin tone. The formula is sheer upon first application but can be built upon as a concealer for places that need a bit more coverage according to the brand.

The skin-loving product contains botanicals like arnica edelweiss and gentle hydrating oils to give your complexion a refreshed appearance.

Though it’s a bit pricy fans say it’s worth it—Garner isn’t the only one who loves the concealer. Just check out the reviews section. “I’ve been following Monika Blunder since before she came out with this. I bought it the minute it was released and have used it DAILY since. Literally. It’s the perfect consistency for whatever you need...either concealing or to be used like a foundation. It does not break me out either (I have SUPER sensitive skin). Please don’t ever change the formula as there is NOTHING like this on the market” wrote one happy Nordstrom customer.

“I have dry skin and am in my 40s. This stuff is beautiful and lasts through the heat. I have tried many foundations and this is one of my favorites” wrote another.

If the price tag is a bit steep for you not to worry. Garner has plenty of drugstore beauty must-haves that will level up your routine. Check out some of her favorites in skincare below to get glowing like the star.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkY2V4ZWMuY29tL3NvdXJjaW5nLXByb2N1cmVtZW50L2FydGljbGUvMjI2MDQ4NTMvZXhpZ2VyLWZyaWVuZHNob3JpbmctdG8tcHJvbW90ZS1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4tcmVzaWxpZW5jZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Friend–Shoring to Promote Supply Chain Resilience,"As the world faces increased economic and political turmoil unwanted geopolitical leverage against supply chains poses a major threat to businesses and governments alike. The U.S. Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen has called upon the U.S. and its allies to strengthen supply chain resilience in response to ‘unfair trade practices’ from China with a particular focus on developing stronger supply chains for key components such as semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries.

As a result of COVID-19 the geopolitical crisis in Ukraine and increased reliance on China businesses are searching for ways to stabilize the global supply chain and avoid further economic complications. The pandemic also resulted in the eye-opening realization that many countries no longer have the capacity or expertise to manufacture their own goods; making the U.S. and many other parts of the world heavily reliant on a country that promotes corrupt trade and labor practices. While globalized specialization has historically led to more stabilized supply chains and deeper production capabilities now is the time to rethink the model for the most critical products components and raw material created by nations with guiding principles that do not align with the West’s.

Supply chain redesign is critical – a sentiment which is reinforced by Yellen’s call to action. Practices such as friend-shoring (limiting supply chain networks to allies and friendly countries) can stabilize global supply chains through increased insulation from external geopolitical and economic threats.

Replacing the Dependency on China

An enormous amount of goods are manufactured in China from electronics and fast fashion to cleaning products and home appliances. In 2021 the United States imported a whopping $541.53 billion worth of goods from China making the U.S. one of China’s biggest trading partners. However the various supply issues experienced during the pandemic from toilet paper to critical technologies highlighted just how heavily the world relies on China for everyday items. With this immensely powerful global position China’s monopoly on the market is not only an issue during critical times but also informs massive areas of weakness – for both commercial business and national government security - when it comes to managing risk within our supply chain systems.

The U.S. government is increasingly prioritizing the enforcement of regulations and policies that encourage domestic investments to drive growth. On December 21 2021 President Biden passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). This regulatory act targets forced labor within the global supply chain by preventing trade between the United States and providers in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) – a region accused of criminal workplace practices such as torture forced labor and genocide.

To further decrease reliance on China countries can prioritize friend-shoring to redefine their position in the global supply chain. These alliances will allow countries that have lost their positioning in the global economy to utilize their unique offerings while also giving them a newfound competitive advantage. Additionally because the supply chain runs very deep it is difficult to monitor every aspect of the production journey. The line between cheap products and ethical consumerism is often blurred. The shift to friend-shoring will refocus the contribution of other countries into the supply chain and decrease economic risk.

Economic restructuring

The supply chain disruptions experienced in recent years have led more businesses to explore onshoring operations giving them more control over how and where their products are produced. Likewise the Biden administration recently finalized a rule that increases domestic content requirements for Federal government procurements governed by the Buy American Act (BAA). This change is intended to align Federal procurement policy with the Biden Administration's recently published strategy to improve supply chain resiliency in critical sectors such as information and communications technology (ICT) clean energy defense public health agriculture and transportation. Similarly friend-shoring offers countries the opportunity to not only re-establish their position in the global supply chain but also strengthen relationships with nations that maintain shared values.

With friend-shoring companies are encouraged to move their operations within allied territories. When businesses maintain close relationships with trade partners they can not only closely monitor operations but also help utilize offerings specific to their region. In her speech Yellen emphasized the importance of the relationship between the U.S. and South Korea-- which have long maintained a strong economic and political alliance. With a strong global reliance on exports from China such as batteries and semiconductors the U.S. and South Korea can work together to strengthen the supply chain through tactics that seek to combat economic displacements such as increased prices. By deploying friend-shoring operations countries can better regulate supply chains and monitor economic restructuring from a more friendly standpoint.

Strategic partnership with allies

Beyond strictly economic factors friend–shoring also promotes consumer relationships and deepens strategic partnerships. According to a 2021 Label Insight Food Revolution Study 94% of customers consider how transparent brands are about themselves. Transparency can be achieved through implementing allied partnerships within the supply chain that will ultimately improve customer experience.

When deploying friend-shoring operations businesses are able to closely regulate manufacturing processes and monitor production creating more security. As stricter regulations on supply chain standards are being enforced within the U.S. consumers are given a greater piece of mind when purchasing goods produced domestically. With a growing emphasis on ethics within the workplace consumers are prioritizing the purchase of goods from brands that promote an ethical environment.

Furthermore friend–shoring allows countries to grow alongside their larger counterparts and maintain more control over regional resources. Even if countries were to replicate a specific material it is likely that the costs of production would be even higher than the industry is worth. For example the United States can utilize its advancements in manufacturing technology with natural resources from allied nations to create high-demand products under more ethical conditions. It is no secret that countries that do not have access to advancing technology are likely to fall behind socially and economically. Because many smaller countries do not have the technological advances and funding required to manufacture goods friend–shoring offers the potential for these countries to work with larger countries that can capitalize off their unique offerings. This creates a two-way benefit for both under-developed countries and world leaders such as the U.S. to deepen their relationships.

Friend-shoring for a Transparent Supply Chain

Although it will be difficult to completely eradicate reliance on China friend–shoring is a strategic approach when reevaluating supply chains. As tensions continue to rise globally it is important for companies to properly evaluate and remain transparent as to where and how their products are manufactured.

Transparency will strengthen not only business relationships but help promote customer relationships as well. Countries can work together to strengthen their economic standing and promote ethical practices within the global supply chain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyL3doaWNoLXN0b3Jlcy1hcmUtb3Blbi1jbG9zZWQtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWRheS0yMDIyLXNlZS1saXN0Lmh0bWzSAXNodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGV2ZWxhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8xMi93aGljaC1zdG9yZXMtYXJlLW9wZW4tY2xvc2VkLWNocmlzdG1hcy1kYXktMjAyMi1zZWUtbGlzdC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which stores are open closed Christmas Day 2022?

UPS mail delivery restaurants stock m,"Christmas Eve 2022 is Saturday Dec. 24.

It’s a day of remembrance around the birth of Jesus with some people attending a midnight mass at church to observe the day.

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 10 most visited countries in the world.

It is almost impossible to talk about travel now without discussing the ramifications of the Covid-19 pandemic on the industry. International travel was suspended globally as authorities and government raced to get ahead of the spread of the virus. From 2020 to the start of 2022 international travel was mostly limited to only critical travel having a devastating impact on not just leisure travel but business travel as well. Even in 2021 when there were moments especially in summer of the burden on healthcare increasing international tourism was still largely restricted or allowed with several caveats including negative tests proof of vaccinations and registration on various apps. Tourism has accounted for around 10% of the global GDP employing more than 320 million across the world. In 2019 more than 1.5 billion people took foreign trips which then saw a decline of 72% after the pandemic.

In 2022 thanks to the invention of the Covid-19 vaccine most of the world was able to resume to a somewhat normal life as infection and serious illness deaths decreased. The summer of 2022 can be considered the first time since 2019 that travel resumed and it did so with the release of pent-up demand of the last two years. While major airlines including Delta Air Lines Inc. (NASDAQ:DAL) American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) saw major losses in 2020 and 2021 they posted record growth in revenue in 2022 along with soaring profits as prices went sky-high responding to demand. The price per passenger increased to record levels even in economy while business class flights became much more expensive as well. United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) returned to profitability in Q2 2022 thanks to soaring demand.

The economy of many countries is boosted by tourism and is an important sector but for some the dependence on tourism is much higher. For example the United States which is one of the most visited countries in the world has a heavily diversified economy and tourism only makes up 3.3% of the nation's total exports.

Now that tourism is recovering major airlines aren't the only one reaping the rewards. Many of the biggest hotels in the world are now filled to capacity with travelers such as Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) and Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) with each of these hotel chains earning billions in revenue and renting out hundreds of thousands of rooms across thousands of properties.

Story continues

To determine the most visited countries in the world we took a look at the number of people visiting each nation along with the receipts from inbound tourism with data courtesy of The World Tourism Organization an agency of the United Nations. We assigned 70% weightage to the former criterion and 30% to the latter. Unsurprisingly Europe dominates the list. So without further ado let's take a look at the countries benefiting the most from tourism revival starting with number 25:

25. Belgium

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 3.2

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 0.4

The European nation is well-known for its chocolates and diamonds while perhaps the best place to visit in Belgium is Bruges whose city center is a prominent World Heritage Site of UNESCO a place where you will be transported to the past.

24. Belarus

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 3.4

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 3.8

Belarus's involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine has earned it significant condemnation from many countries and will most likely result in tourism in the country suffering.

23. Ukraine

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 3.7

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 1

Unfortunately Ukraine which has so much to offer will definitely drop off this list next year thanks to the Russia-Ukraine war which has absolutely devastated the country.

22. Morocco

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 3.7

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 3.8

Morocco is home to a strong tourist industry and it is one of the most visited places in Africa.

21. Albania

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 5

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 2.3

Albania is home to archeological and cultural heritage attracting millions of people every year.

20. Saudi Arabia

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 3.5

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 15.3

A lot of visitors to Saudi Arabia visit the country to perform Hajj or Umrah which are holy activities performed by Muslims.

19. Dominican Republic

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 4.4

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 5.7

Dominican Republic is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Caribbean.

18. Switzerland

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 4.3

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 11

The only reason perhaps that Switzerland isn't ranked as high in the list of the most visited countries in the world is because it is incredibly expensive but the amazing views of lakes valleys and mountains not to mention amazing ski resorts make it a must-visit country.

17. Bulgaria

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 6.3

Total tourism receipts in 2021 (in billions): 2.5

Tourism is a major contributor to Bulgaria's economy and in 2017 nearly 12 million people visited the country.

16. Netherlands

Total arrivals in the country in 2021 (in millions): 5.3

Some might find the idea daunting in a city estimated at over 700000 in 2017. So for those looking for something to do in the Emerald City without any company the following are great places to start. In this case the Seattle Freeze is on your side!

Stroll along Alki Beach

Alki Beach is a real treasure out in West Seattle. The 135.9-acre park includes 2.5 miles (4.02km) of beachline the Alki Bathhouse a monument commemorating the arrival of the first white settlers in 1851 and a picturesque view of Seattle. Enjoy the sand and smell of salt water capture the mountain range-framed city and explore tide pools. If you don’t make it to West Seattle often this can also be a great excuse to check out the area.

Watch an IMAX movie at the Science Center

Enjoy coffee at the Elliott Bay Book Company

Claiming to have Seattle’s first bookstore café the Elliott Bay Book Company is a Seattle staple. It’s a perfect place on a rainy day to get you out of the house while still feeling cozy and comfortable. Attend one of the 500-plus author readings they have every year or just relax with a cup of coffee while you journal or read. Either way good luck with your self-control—it takes focus to resist buying every book in the store.

Solo jam session at MoPOP

In Seattle museums are interactive. Beyond the “no-touching” museum etiquette the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP) is an experience that engages audio visual and tactile senses. Their Sound Lab is a cool place to jam out. Instruments including guitars drums mixing boards and keyboards are available as well as 12 soundproof rooms. Guests can take automated lessons or opt to explore on their own. The Jam Studios even allow people to record their music. “MoPOP provides the tools; visitors bring the creative spark.”

Shop at the original Nordstrom (sort of)

Nordstrom started in Seattle in 1901 as a shoe store on Fourth and Pike called Wallin & Nordstrom. Over the years ownership was passed down through the generations of Nordstroms and expansion turned the original location into the company’s Seattle flagship store. In 1963 the flagship store moved to Fifth and Pine. That means that technically the current downtown Seattle Nordstrom location is two blocks away from the original Nordstrom location. Conceptually however people can still shop at the original store—or the evolved version of it that flourished into a 100-year-old international chain.

Relax at Waterfall Garden Park

Yes you can visit a waterfall without leaving the city. If you’re looking for a relaxing getaway oasis with flora and the sounds of a waterfall to wash your stress away the Waterfall Garden Park is the place for you. Pop in behind Occidental Square Park to read or enjoy a snack. The 22-foot (6.71 m) waterfall is also on the site of the first United Parcel Service (UPS) location founded in 1907 (yet another major American company started in Seattle) so you can also enjoy the history humming beneath your feet.

Play at Pike Place Market

Pike Place may be a tourist attraction but that doesn’t mean locals can’t enjoy it too. The market is huge and sprawling so take some time to explore the sections with which you’re less familiar. Try some new food or revert to favorites. Be a tourist or act like a local. Grimace at the Gum Wall and marvel at the mountainous views. Grab a video of the fish throwing. This market is a place in Seattle that has something(s) for everyone. Find your corner of Pike Place Market and thrive in it.

Rent a bike

As a green city Seattle is indeed a promoter of bike usage with bike lanes and bicycle options on public transportation. Though the most recent public bike-share program has closed the city is testing out some privatized bike-share programs. The pilot will last through the end of 2017. Between then and the official implementation of the companies’ programs (or if they never take root) there are also some stores from which people can rent bicycles. Ride around the city without worrying about parking or cross the 520 bridge to stop for a picture of Mt. Rainier. Whatever you do just be prepared for the hills!

Watch as the sun sets (or rises) at Kerry Park

Kerry Park provides some of the most iconic views of Seattle. With the city skyline Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains laid out more beautifully than an artist could have imagined the only thing to make the view more magical is the quickly changing color of the sun rising and falling. Forget everything at home and climb to Kerry Park to take in the silence all while appreciating our place in the world. Well maybe bring some sunglasses—and a camera.

Pinball it up!

The Seattle Pinball Museum—does anything else need to be said? The merely seven-year-old museum features over 50 games which change regularly from as early as 1934 to the present. The best part? Once you pay admission (no more than $20) you can play the games—all day. Though this is an exciting place to get sucked into on your own it can also be rented out for events.

A 'bomb cyclone' over the US Midwest - a phenomenon caused by a drastic rapid drop in atmospheric pressure - has created an unprecedented cold-weather hurricane across much of the country.

The vast swirling system which extends from Texas as far north as Canada has sparked chaos on the busiest travel weekend of the year with hundreds of millions trying to get home for the Christmas holidays.

More than 7000 flights have been cancelled huge pile-ups have shut many the few roads still open and 1.5 million people are without power as temperatures plunge as low as -45C.



The US National Weather Service has told people to 'forget' about driving in the blizzards

Reuters

The US National Weather Service (NWS) said it had been forced to issue ""one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever"" with 240 million people covered.

Some areas are expecting to 90cm of snow with blizzard warnings in place for eight million people.

The NWS said visibility was ""zero"" in many areas and advised against all travel. The storm has wrecked festive plans for tens of millions with 15000 flights delayed in addition to the cancellations.

A 50-vehicle pileup on the Ohio Turnpike in a blizzard near Toledo killed two drivers injured dozens and shut down both lanes of the highway state police reported. Stranded motorists were evacuated by bus to keep them from freezing in their cars in sub-zero temperatures according to the Toledo Fire & Rescue Department.

Three weather-related fatalities were confirmed in neighboring Kentucky - two from car accidents and one a homeless person who died of exposure. ""Please stay home and stay safe"" Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on Twitter announcing the deaths.

The freezing weather extended far further south than is usual even for extreme winter storms with temperatures falling as low as -18C in the city of El Paso Texas near the Mexico border. Exposure to such conditions can cause frostbite within minutes.

Hard-freeze warnings were posted in southern Georgia and across much of all four Gulf Coast states - Texas Louisiana Alabama and Florida. In South Dakota Native Americans even burned clothes to stay warm after running out of fuel said tribal officials.

Heating and energy prices spiked as inclement weather forced energy production cuts and bone-chilling cold drove demand higher.

The airport chaos was ""the worst ever seen"" according to officials with 20000 flights expected to be impacted before Christmas Day.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the US aviation system ""is operating under enormous strain"" while rail operator Amtrak cancelled dozens of trains disrupting holiday travel for thousands.

The American Automobile Association (AAA) had estimated that 112.7 million people planned to travel 50 miles (80 km) or more from home between Friday and January 2.

That number was likely to plunge due to treacherous weather complicating air and road travel going into the weekend.

The city of Buffalo and its surrounding county on the edge of Lake Erie in western New York imposed a driving ban and all three Buffalo-area border crossing bridges were closed to inbound traffic from Canada due to the weather.

Dr Constantino Chiwenga Vice President and Minister of Health and Child Care

Right from the onset of the New Dispensation His Excellency The President of the Republic of Zimbabwe Dr ED Mnangagwa tasked Cabinet to think outside the box and to come up with tangible deliverables with a positive direct bearing on people’s lives.

It was not only an idle call to action but a call which he went further to buttress by superintending the drawing up of strategies and interventions with which Government has been and hopes to continue rebuilding the country.

All these strategies sector by sector are meant to feed into the broader national vision whereupon Zimbabwe must rapidly develop into an upper middle-income economy by 2030.

The health sector is no exception.

Having had the privilege and honour to be assigned the enormous responsibility of being Minister of Health and Child Care — since August 4 2020 — over and above my role of Vice President the year ending next week has been a year of hard work of delivering.

Under the capable leadership of His Excellency The President the year 2022 has been a year in which the ministry has been seized with the task to build modernise equip and rejuvenate our health services to standards consistent with an upper middle income economy.

This dear compatriots is no mean task.

It’s a task with which we are priming our health services to a level where we will halt all outbound medical tourism promote regional and continental inbound medical tourism and most importantly give our populace the comfort and confidence they deserve in our health services.

This is the journey we sought to quicken our step towards its achievement in 2022 and for which we are confident we are getting closer by the day albeit with obvious challenges.

As per my first speech as the Minister of Health and Child Care on September 7 2020 — among the first tasks that I was given as I superintended over the ministry was to restructure the ministry in line with international best practices.

The main objective of the restructuring of the ministry and agencies is to achieve efficiency effectiveness integrity as well as integration of the Ministry of Health and Child Care with national institutions through collapsing insular and in some cases fiefdom tendencies which limited and curtailed synergies.

This strategy is informed by “Whole Government Whole Society” approach to challenges afflicting the country.

In this regard the bottom line is to have a national health system that ensures that everyone has equitable access to healthcare services of sufficient quality again as per the dictates of another key Government strategy of leaving no one and no place behind.

To achieve these broad-based results the year 2022 saw the Ministry of Health and Child Care coming up with a number of projects and strategies.

COVID-19

Despite having grand and long-term plans Zimbabwe — under the Second Republic was faced with arguably the biggest public health threat the country has ever witnessed that of Covid-19 pandemic.

Faced with this challenge Government with the help of its partners mounted a concerted response right from 2020 when we recorded our first ever Covid-19 case. By 2022 the Covid-19 threat had not recede and our key priority was to consolidate on our gains from 2021 and ensure we keep this threat at bay.

While it is disheartening that we lost several of our compatriots to this killer pandemic it is worth noting that together as Zimbabweans and with support from our partners especially the People’s Republic of China we have continued to mount a coordinated response to combat the virus.

Our response has and continues to court international admiration and commendation including from United Nations agencies and several other international development organisations.

The Covid-19 threat is still lingering and I urge you compatriots to remain vigilant adhering to all Government mitigation protocols — some of which I appreciate are an inconvenience as well as taking up vaccination for those who are yet to get their jabs.

INFRASTRUCTURE

Zimbabwe as is the case with most African countries and the developing world in general has an infrastructure legacy challenge which primarily dates back to colonial injustices and marginalisation.

The infrastructure development gap stretches from rural areas resettlement areas urban areas and even to major hospitals where gaps to our health facilities have to be fixed to get to levels consistent with an upper-middle income economy as prescribed by His Excellency The President.

To cover this gap Government this year undertook several health infrastructure projects.

The under-construction Lupane Provincial Hospital in Matabeleland Province is the biggest beneficiary of this infrastructure thrust by Government.

This year we managed to rejig the scope of the Hospital which will now on completion become a first of its kind institution to cater for all its staff accommodation needs as well as halt all referrals particularly to Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo.

In addition to offering all expert services Lupane Provincial Hospital which is one good example of the Second Republic’s leaving no place behind will now become a Doctors Training Institution in partnership with Lupane State University.

As per the “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa ngavanikazi balo” approach Government this year released funding through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development which saw construction works gathering pace towards completion and operationalisation of Lupane Hospital whose development has stalled for several years.

In line with the dictates of Universal Health Coverage which entail that we must take health services right to people’s doorsteps this year we managed to construct a total of 38 new clinics and 10 health posts.

Compatriots it must be noted that one of the challenges afflicting our health delivery system is reluctance to seek medical attention. By taking these services closer to our people we are also encouraging the culture of early medical consultation.

While we celebrate the 48 medical facilities it is important that I single out the Stoneridge Health Centre in Harare South which was commissioned by His Excellency The President this year.

This facility is a model whose services and architecture we believe will give our people the best quality at their local clinic and going forward we will replicate it in several districts.

As a ministry we were once again honoured to have His Excellency The President commissioning the hand-over of the new-state-of-the-art Natpharm Warehouse which was done through a grant from the ever friendly People’s Republic of China.

This “majestic warehouse” as per the words of His Excellency will go a long way in stabilising drug supply throughout the country thereby facilitating attainment of rapid economic transformation.

The need for such a facility was amplified by the global medicinal supply disruption occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic and it being operational now means Zimbabwe is now insulated from any such disruptions in the future.

Our expectation is that we will now experience a gradual increase and ultimately filling up of these shelves with “Made in Zimbabwe” pharmaceutical products in line with our national Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Strategy.

This is a frontier for which we have laid seeds and will be vigorously pushed going forward.

It must also be noted that we managed to finalise the construction of other warehouses and medical storage facilities in 2022.

The year also saw us making huge progress in renovating eight medical laboratories and two mortuaries in Midlands and Matabeleland North provinces in addition to two theatres that are getting a makeover in Mashonaland West and Mashonaland East provinces.

Major renovations were also done at 29 medical facilities which include clinics and hospitals all in a bid to give them the level of service that our dear patients deserve.

We also managed to drill 40 boreholes at medical facilities dotted around the country over and above a concerted electrification program through which we will soon make sure that all our health points have access to power.

In the power provision roadmap in 2022 we continued with the implementation of the solar-for-health-initiative which is also being supported by development partners.

To date we have managed to install solar energy at 1 047 health facilities out of a target of 1860 which translates to more than 56 percent of the initial target. It must be noted that this progress has mainly been registered on facilities in rural areas.

MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

Dear compatriots the importance of modern-day scientific equipment in an efficient health delivery system cannot be overemphasised.

For us to have a modern healthcare system we want there is need for our hospitals to have all essential and state-of- the-art medical equipment. Minus the said equipment our dedicated personnel manning these facilities will be curtailed and unable to deliver the services our people deserve.

It is for this reason that in 2022 Government continued to prioritise the availing of essential medical equipment.

I am pleased to report that six CT (computerized tomography) Scan machines at our General Hospitals were repaired and are servicing our people. The MRI machine at Sally Mugabe Hospital that had not been functioning was also serviced.

In addition also Government also procured an additional MRI which has since been delivered and will be installed at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals at the earliest possible time.

We also procured and installed 400 Vital Signs Monitors which were installed at all Central Provincial General District and Mission Hospitals throughout the country. 200 Syringe Pumps were also procured in this year and so far 25 have since been delivered.

We also took delivery of 65 multi-parameter monitors 37 dental x-ray machines. We are still waiting for the delivery of dental chairs which are important to the deployment of these machines.

Still on dental care we bought and took delivery of 24 dental autoclaves. As soon as all this equipment is installed and made fully operational we will experience a marked improvement in the services that our patients get from our facilities throughout the country.

2022 also saw Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals and Sally Mugabe each getting an Ophthalmic Operating Microscope both bought by Government in line with the directive by His Excellency The President Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa.

Partners also came to our aid with a donation of one ophthalmic operating microscope which has been installed at Bindura Hospital.

As we strive to eradicate neonatal mortality Government bought Cardio Topography (Foetal Monitors) which have since been distributed to Gwanda Mpilo Sally Mugabe Chitungwiza Parirenyatwa Binga and United Bulawayo Hospitals.

AMBULANCE SERVICES

As you will appreciate an efficient ambulance system is a key anchor to a thriving health system. Government is alive to this obvious fact and we have thus created an Ambulance Services Directorate which is part of the newly streamlined Ministry of Health and Child Care structure.

In future this directorate will be complemented by staff from the Accident and Emergency Nursing School which we opened in Chivhu last year.

Graduates from the school will be equipped with emergency service specialties to help in the provision of emergency services. Furthermore crews – especially nurses will receive specialist training aimed at equipping the ambulance services with specialist personnel that will give our patients the best ambulance experience.

Government has also opened up to public/private partnerships in equipping this department and we are happy with the private sector support we got in 2022.

In the year ending next week Government purchased and got delivery of 32 all-terrain ambulances complete with installed state of the art emergency equipment that is aimed at giving the patient a near hospital experience as they get transferred to the actual hospital.

We also received a donation of 12 ambulances from partners and these will go a long way in equipping our ambulance services.

I was thrilled to learn that ACE Air and Ambulance — a local Air Ambulances services company — was nominated among three finalists by the International Travel and Health Insurance Journal (ITIJ) for the prestigious Global Air Ambulance Company of the year 2022 award.

Their nomination was based on their having surpassed global service excellence showcasing distinction and innovation which is in line with the Second Republic’s thrust of excellence and serving with distinction.

HUMAN RESOURCES

Human capital is by far the most important asset in our health services. Zimbabwe has been a global pace-setter in the training of best health professionals. No wonder we continue to be a target of hawkish economies that are always on the prowl to snap up our professionals.

It’s a situation that gives us discomfort in that we cannot continue training for them to benefit and our hope is that through United Nations platforms we will find modalities to help us recoup on our training investment.

Notwithstanding these setbacks Government forged ahead with the prioritisation of its health sector human capital base.

This year the Health Services Board (HSB) engaged all qualified health professionals willing to take up employment within the public service.

Through our excellent nurse training programs we increased the number of nurses and other health professionals undergoing different health sector training programs in our schools.

As part of efforts to improve patient care we snapped up 556 students for the PCN training program.

Following the successful separation of conjoined twins in a delicate operation that casts international attention on us in 2021. I was heartened by His Excellency President Dr ED Mnangagwa’s honouring of all members of staff that participated in the delicate operation.

To appreciate these dedicated professionals His Excellency bestowed the Medal for Meritorious Service on them and on their hospital.

As we close the year ladies and gentleman allow me to — on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Child Care and indeed on behalf of Government to express my sincere gratitude to these man and women in the healthcare service who toil day in and day out in service to our great nation.

INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM

As we march towards an advanced and modern health system that will give us the comfort and quality of life we deserve the best way to gauge our progress is through third part assessment.

This third-part assessment gets even weightier when it comes from international organisations accredited to the United Nations.

Compatriots I was particularly encouraged with commendation we got from organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the manner in which we are managing our health services under the capable leadership of His Excellency President Dr ED Mnangagwa.

This year we were chosen to host high level international summits on health like the 22nd International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa which convenes in 2023 (ICASA 2023). We are also billed to hold the High Level International Consultative Conference Leading to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD 30).

The offer to host the latter came after our presentation in Thailand during the International Conference on Family Planning which drew commendation from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) as being one that shows Zimbabwe is on course to achieve set targets and an example which other nations can learn from.

Back home the ministry was recognised with an award for the best Healthcare stand at the 2022 Zimbabwe International Trade Fare (ZITF).

Dear compatriots Government remains resolute to reduce the burden of Communicable and Non-Communicable Disease.

Let me reiterate the need to continue addressing health determinants. Food and Nutrition Security remains a priority. I am excited that the year was characterised by successful programmes designed to ensure food and nutrition security.

Empowered communities remain a catalytic vehicle towards universal health access. Quality education and empowerment programmes by Government have been instrumental in attaining good health and wellness.

Let me urge you all to adopt healthy lifestyles as this is key in improving our quality of life. Healthy eating regular exercises and good mental health initiatives must be prioritised.

CONCLUSION

Compatriots as we close the year amid several success stories some of which I have highlighted this does not mean that 2022 was a bed of roses for the health services sector. We continue to grapple with a number of legacy challenges most of which trace their origins to colonial imbalances and deprivation.

However our progress under the Second Republic give us the energy to face our challenges head on with confidence that we can achieve the goals we desire.

We are grateful for the guidance we continue to get from His Excellency President Dr ED Mnangagwa and we can never thank him enough for his dedication to duty in pushing the national agenda.

Let me also take this opportunity to wish you a merry Christmas and a prosperous 2023 filled with good health.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXRoa2lhd2Fhei5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi90YXRhLW1vdG9ycy1lbnRlcnMtdGhlLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc2VjdG9yLXRvLWhlbHAtaW5kaWEtdXAtaXRzLXNkZy1nYW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TATA Motors Enters The Healthcare Sector To Help India Up Its SDG Game,

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

La pregunta recurrente es: “¿Está ya por delante de Tesla?”. La respuesta es sí y no. BYD supera a Tesla si se incluyen los vehículos eléctricos híbridos enchufables (PHEV) junto con los vehículos eléctricos de batería (BEV). Si sólo se tienen en cuenta los BEV puros Tesla sigue por delante por ahora.

“BYD muestra las ventajas de centrarse en un solo tipo de tren motriz: el eléctrico” afirma Corey Cantor analista principal de vehículos eléctricos de BloombergNEF.

BYD dejó de producir vehículos de combustible fósil en marzo. Por ahora las ventas fuera de China son minúsculas pero eso podría cambiar pronto. La empresa ha ampliado su red de ventas a varios países latinoamericanos y recientemente ha firmado un acuerdo de compra de terrenos para construir una planta de producción de vehículos eléctricos en Tailandia.

Nuevos vs viejos fabricantes

Las nuevas y ágiles empresas pueden desbancar a las más antiguas de la lista de vehículos eléctricos más vendidos. Por ejemplo el mini BEV Hongguang de 5.000 dólares catapultó a SAIC-GM-Wuling a los primeros puestos del mercado. Los minicoches podrían ser la próxima gran novedad en los entornos urbanos.

“Esperamos que la clasificación de los más vendidos cambie a medida que se intensifique la competencia. No hay que descartar sorpresas” afirma Cantor.

Otra forma de analizar el mercado de los vehículos eléctricos es por ventas totales hasta la fecha. Actualmente los tres primeros son Tesla BYD y Volkswagen. Este último aspira a ser el mayor vendedor de coches eléctricos en 2025.

BNEF espera que se vendan 103 millones de vehículos eléctricos en 2022 según sus últimas perspectivas. China y Europa siguen siendo los principales mercados con una cuarta parte de las ventas mundiales cada uno. El mercado estadounidense también se está acelerando ya que los nuevos incentivos impulsan la fabricación local y las ventas de vehículos eléctricos.

A principios de esta semana el Departamento de Energía concedió un préstamo de 2.500 millones de dólares a una empresa conjunta de General Motors y LG Energy Solution – Ultium Cells – para ayudar a financiar nuevas plantas de fabricación de baterías de iones de litio en Ohio Tennessee y Michigan.

“Este préstamo impulsará la producción nacional de baterías necesaria para reducir nuestra dependencia de otros países a fin de satisfacer la creciente demanda y apoyar los objetivos del presidente Biden de generalizar la adopción de vehículos eléctricos y reducir la contaminación por carbono producida por los vehículos de gas” declaró la secretaria de Energía de EE.UU.

(Prohibida su reventa y archivo)

Seúl 25 de diciembre (Yonhap) -- Las ventas de álbumes físicos en Corea del Sur están a punto de alcanzar el hito de los 80 millones de unidades en 2022 gracias al excelente desempeño de la banda masculina BTS y los populares grupos femeninos según ha dicho el sábado Circle Chart.

Las ventas acumuladas de álbumes físicos para los 400 álbumes de K-pop más populares alcanzaron los 742 millones de copias a fecha del 10 de diciembre lo que representa un aumento del 299 por ciento con respecto al año anterior dijo el rastreador local de ventas de álbumes.

La superbanda de K-pop BTS vendió 607 millones de copias en formato físico durante el período mencionado impulsando las ventas de los álbumes que no son en formato de reproducción extendida (EP según sus siglas en inglés).

Este año también destacó un aumento en las ventas de los álbumes de bandas femeninas.

Las cantantes se hicieron con el 326 por ciento del total de ventas de los álbumes de K-pop en 2022 lo que supone un incremento del 165 por ciento respecto al año anterior según Circle Chart.

No obstante la proporción para los cantantes se redujo un 173 por ciento registrando el 662 por ciento del total.

De acuerdo con el detalle en marzo y abril del año pasado se obtuvo $us 483 millones por la exportación de electricidad al país vecino. Posteriormente los ingresos por la venta de energía eléctrica se redujeron y las ganancias no superaron ni el millón de dólares incluso en mayo de 2023 solo se generó $us 8.637.

Los meses siguientes junio y julio no hubo demanda de energía eléctrica por parte de Argentina. Se retomó el consumo de electricidad en agosto y septiembre cuando demandó el energético por un valor de $us 071 millones.

Argentina nuevamente demandó electricidad boliviana en enero y febrero de este 2024 por un poco más de $us 2 millones.

A partir del 13 de marzo de 2023 Bolivia comenzó a exportar energía eléctrica a la Argentina a través de la Línea de Transmisión “Juana Azurduy de Padilla” en 132 kilovoltios (KV) hecho que se convirtió en un hito histórico para el país ya que nunca antes exportó electricidad.

Electricidad

La construcción de la línea de interconexión Bolivia – Argentina “Juana Azurduy de Padilla de 132 kilovoltios (KV) para la exportación de energía eléctrica al mercado vecino demandó una inversión de Bs 3653 millones.

Para este proyecto se construyeron 120 kilómetros (km) de líneas de transmisión En el lado boliviano 4649 km y en el lado argentino un total de 7388 km. Además de las subestaciones Yaguacua en Tarija sur de Bolivia y Tartagal en Salta norte de Argentina que tienen capacidad para inyectar hasta 120 megavatios (MW); además de puestos de transformación de 150 megavoltamperio (MVA) de potencia (3×50 + 1×50 MVA) en 230/132 kV instalados en la subestación Yaguacua para reducir el nivel de tensión de 230 KV a 132 KV.

En el primer día de exportación de electricidad a Argentina a través de ENDE Transmisión Argentina SA filial de la Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE Corporación) Bolivia alcanzó a inyectar 913 megavatios hora (MWh) con una potencia de 60 MW para abastecer a regiones del norte en el vecino país con electricidad generada desde la Planta Termoeléctrica del Sur (Tarija).

Según datos de ENDE por día de exportación de electricidad a Argentina Bolivia factura aproximadamente $us 106.000.

El 1 de junio del año pasado el presidente de Bolivia Luis Arce y el ahora exmandatario de Argentina Alberto Fernández se reunieron en Yacuiba Tarija para inaugurar la Línea de Interconexión Internacional entre ambos países

Ambos mandatarios coincidieron que la interconexión eléctrica mejora la calidad de vida de los “hermanos” del norte argentino.

Concreción

El 26 de febrero de este año en la Audiencia de Rendición Pública de Cuentas Final 2023 el presidente de ENDE Corporación Manuel Valle destacó que durante el año pasado se logró concretar la exportación de electricidad a Argentina lo que permite la interconexión con un sistema de otro país.

“Es un hito porque nos da la posibilidad de intercambiar energía no solo a nosotros vender sino que cuando tengamos la necesidad podamos comprar en función de nuestro requerimiento y de nuestro interés. Eso es importante señalar” expresó Valle.

El ejecutivo consideró que esta primera “experiencia en la exportación de electricidad al mercado argentino” abre oportunidades para incrementar la capacidad o construir una nueva línea de transmisión para exportar más energía eléctrica a Argentina.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXZvei5jb20uYXIvY2l1ZGFkYW5vcy9uYXZpZGFkLWVuLWNvcmRvYmEtdW5hLXBlYXRvbmFsLWRlc2JvcmRhZGEteS1sYXMtdmVudGFzLXN1cGVyaW9yZXMtYWwtbXVuZGlhbC1lbi1lbC1tZXJjYWRvLW5vcnRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Navidad en Córdoba: una peatonal desbordada y las ventas “superiores al Mundial” en el Mercado Norte,"Pasó en esta Navidad y en las anteriores. Ya es un clásico de las fiestas de fin de año. La gente aguarda hasta último momento para realizar las compras ya sean regalos navideños o la clásica comida de Nochebuena.

Por esto la peatonal y los centros de comercios –como shoppings e hipermercados– estaban desbordados por una multitud.

Regalitos de Papá Noel o del Niño Dios eran los más buscados por estas horas en los comercios pero también las habituales compras de carnes y alimentos en los tradicionales mercados cordobeses.

En la Capital se observaba en la mañana del sábado 24 de diciembre a miles de personas recorriendo la peatonal en busca de un presente para la Fiesta y también de adornos con los colores típicos navideños.

Navidad: ventas en el Mercado Norte de Córdoba

En el Mercado Norte de la ciudad de Córdoba había también una multitud. “Se está vendiendo excelente” dijo uno de los carniceros a La Voz.

Por lo general los cordobeses eligen “un bicho” para tirar a la parrilla o al horno de cara a la Nochebuena.

“Con los lechones me quedé sin stock” dijo otro carnicero.

Lechones cabritos asado de vaca costillares y hasta nutrias llegaron a venderse para estas Fiestas. “Con la final del Mundial explotó pero ahora se ha vendido creo que más. La Navidad es algo más familiar y reúne a más gente” indicó otro comerciante.

Lo cierto es que el sábado por la mañana el Mercado estuvo abarrotado en busca de asado y de precios porque las Fiestas invitan a juntarse en familia pero también son muchos los cordobeses que salen a caminar para encontrar ofertas en medio de un año en el cual la inflación se disparó."

The customer Mallory (@.simply.mallory) posted several videos on TikTok explaining what happened. In one video she said she traded her old phone into Verizon in September and was given an $800 promotion and $285 credit towards her bill.

Mallory said that she noticed that her December Verizon bill was “significantly” larger than she expected it to be. She said she almost just paid the bill but wasn’t able to because of an issue with Verizon’s system that day so she decided to call Verizon customer service.

She said the customer service representative told her she owed more than $700 but she knew that wasn’t right and asked him for an itemized breakdown of her bill. She continued that he told her the credit she received for trading in her phone wasn’t processed and the system took it back it in November.

The representative said there wasn’t much he could do about the credit and told her she’d have to pay the bill. Mallory said she refused to pay any bill even after the representative offered her a $150 “inconvenience credit.”

“So I tell him ‘if your system can decide I don’t get [the credit] your system can put it back'” Mallory said in the clip.

Despite Mallory’s confession of acting like a “Karen” commenters reassured her that her reaction was anything but Karen-like.

“Babe. Karen’s are typically in the wrong and over reacting. Ur not a Karen” one viewer commented.

“Not a Karen this behavior was definitely warranted though” another said.

Other viewers encouraged Mallory to hold on to any paperwork or evidence of her $800 credit and some even suggested pursuing legal action.

In a second video Mallory said she refused to accept the inconvenience fee. She told the customer service representative that if he couldn’t do what she needed and get the entire bill taken care of she would talk to his supervisor.

“I pulled that card” Mallory said. “I don’t care. I worked in a call center. Things can be done. If an error happened where the system just took away almost $300 and added it to my bill then you guys can put it back and make it right.”

Mallory claimed that the representative cut her off while she was talking and put her on hold without warning. She said that when he came back a few minutes later he lectured her about a lack of appreciation for the inconvenience credit saying he would have felt “surprised” if he was given $150 in a similar situation.

Mallory clapped back that he would also have been surprised if almost $300 had been added to his phone bill.

“You’re not about to belittle me and talk down to me and make me sound incompetent for doing what I was told. For understanding what I was told in the store” Mallory said recounting her words to the representative.

She claimed that the representative tried to backpedal and deny that he was being condescending and went to talk to his supervisor some more. She said that when he came back from another hold he told her that he could give her credit back.

“Moral of the story: if you trade in your phone make sure you get the credits that you are given keep an eye on your bill and don’t let anybody anybody talk down to you and tell you how it’s going to be when you know that they’re in the wrong” Mallory said.

Several viewers shared that they had similar experiences as Verizon customers.

“Verizon does this. They say we owe $1000+ cuz they took all the credits they gave us back” one viewer commented.

“True Verizon story when I called re unscrupulous treatment at the store they tried to say I’m elderly and probably got confused. I was a 59 CFO” another said.

“Verizon banks on customers who don’t view bills and customers who don’t push back” a third speculated.

In a third video Mallory expressed shock at the outpouring of support and flood of Verizon horror stories she received in response to her videos. She said she is considering switching her phone provider when she and her husband’s phones are paid off.

She also clarified that a Verizon store manager intentionally gave her both the $800 promotion and the $285 phone credit. Some viewers commented on previous videos that customers only get one or the other and suggested that Mallory may have been in the wrong for thinking that she got both.

The TikToker said the one thing that was her fault was her mistake of throwing away the paper receipt with the manager’s signature.

Here's Why,"There's been a lot of hype around 5G over the past six years and to an extent it still exists today. Driverless cars remote surgery the metaverse -- all buzzwords that have yet to materialize in any real way.

One area where it has noticeably helped change our lives? It finally provides some long-overdue competition to cable companies for home broadband. I've been exploring whether 5G and technologies like it (known as ""fixed wireless"") could replace traditional home broadband over the past year testing out midband solutions from Verizon and T-Mobile as well as millimeter-wave options like Honest Networks.

I ditched my Spectrum subscription and even switched my apartment to Honest which provides gigabit upload and download speeds to our building for $50 per month. It was great for months and I would have been happy to continue using it.

Locating local internet providers

At least until Spectrum came knocking.

Competition breeds deals

Spectrum's deal of three months free was awfully compelling. Screenshot by Eli Blumenthal/CNET

Since ditching Spectrum I got a flyer in the mail offering three months of free TV and internet if I switched back. There were no contracts or commitment strings attached either. The company seems to be hoping that once people sign up they won't leave again so quickly.

Locating local internet providers

As an avid sports fan the appeal of traditional cable was certainly enticing for the rest of the NFL and college football regular seasons MLB postseason and the beginning of the NBA and NHL campaigns. Getting and managing regional sports networks in New York is a hassle and the only streaming service that offers all of them (DirecTV Stream) is pricey at $90 per month for the Choice package.

While my internet speeds wouldn't be as fast as the gigabit promised by Honest Spectrum's Internet Ultra offers download speeds ""up to 500Mbps"" which is more than enough for all of my and my roommates' work video chats streaming and gaming.

Plus even after the three months are up the internet charge would be $40 per month a $10 monthly savings compared to T-Mobile and Honest.

I can't say this deal is a direct result of 5G internet options joining the fray and adding competition. I also don't know if Spectrum is offering this everywhere or just in some markets like New York City but it does seem to be a newer option.

""We have nationally consistent regular pricing and customer-friendly policies like no modem fees data caps or contracts"" a Spectrum spokesman said in a statement. ""We often offer promotions to new or upgrading customers to give them the chance to sample a service or package at a discount for a specific period of time before the regular price takes effect.""

These deals also aren't always just for new subscribers. The old trick of calling up your provider and threatening to switch to T-Mobile or Verizon which I noticed when helping a friend with their Optimum bill in New Jersey helped lower their bill by $40 per month before they adjusted anything on their service.

The cable companies seem to be concerned and perhaps rightfully so. Verizon's earnings saw consumers flee its traditional wireless phone business amid higher prices but the carrier did add 234000 consumer ""fixed wireless"" users.

T-Mobile added 578000 home internet users in its most recent quarter and now has over 2.1 million subscribers.

Comcast the largest cable operator in the US seems to be particularly worried and earlier this month began rolling out TV ads against T-Mobile's Home Internet encouraging users to head to its website where it ""compares"" the two broadband options. A number of cable companies -- including Comcast Optimum and Spectrum -- have also been offering bundles of home internet with their own mobile services.

""I think you'll see (cable companies) getting more aggressive with promotions and work on driving up speeds to try and counter the momentum the telcos are getting"" Technalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell says.

""Given how fast (home internet) subscribers for both T-Mobile and Verizon have been growing consumers clearly get it and seem eager to move away from cable companies"" he says.

Faster speeds are coming too

Beyond the price and deals the rise of 5G home broadband has also coincided with a renewed push by cable companies on speed. Comcast's lead point against T-Mobile is that it has more gigabit offerings available and that its broadband could be up to 36 times faster than T-Mobile's 5G home internet.

""Fixed wireless over 5G is making it crucial that cable companies upgrade their infrastructure to be able to claim consistently high speeds particularly on uploads where wireless can struggle today"" said Avi Greengart an analyst for research firm Techsponential.

A wide variety of other providers including Optimum Spectrum Verizon and AT&T have added new multigigabit speed tiers and expanded their buildouts for fiber service all while the three major wireless providers continue to build out and improve 5G service. This push for faster options should allow for not only the prospect of better speeds for those looking for a boost but also better selections for their needs.

""People who are continuing to work at home or who just want the fastest option will look at fiber"" says O'Donnell. ""Mainstream users now have multiple choices and folks who have had limited options (rural etc.) now can finally get something reasonable.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvbW9iaWxlL3VwZ3JhZGluZy10by10aGUtaXBob25lLTE0LW1lYW5zLXNheWluZy1nb29kYnllLXRvLXlvdXItc2ltLWNhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upgrading to the iPhone 14 Means Saying Goodbye to Your SIM Card,"When you switch to the iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max you'll need to set up an eSIM. Gone are the days when you just needed to switch your SIM card to the upgraded model. When Apple announced the iPhone 14 line the company revealed that US models wouldn't have the physical SIM card tray that's commonly been used across the phone industry. Internationally however the iPhone 14 line retains the SIM card tray for now.

With eSIMs you'll still be able to take full advantage of a carrier's 4G LTE or 5G networks and use your phone the same way you have in the past. Apple has supported eSIMs on iPhones dating back to 2018's iPhone XS XS Max and XR and has long supported the technology on its recent cellular iPads and Apple Watches. The iPhone 13 line even allowed for multiple eSIMs to be enabled at once useful for those looking to have a work number and personal number on just one device.

By embracing eSIMs Apple and other manufacturers can also begin to ditch the physical SIM card slot allowing for more space for additional features on future devices.

Watch this: Why Apple Uses eSIMs on the iPhone 14 04:40

AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon all support using eSIM as do a number of smaller or prepaid providers like Mint Mobile Google Fi or Verizon-owned Visible.

While the core experience shouldn't change there could be a few notable benefits to no longer needing to get a physical SIM card from a carrier. If a network adds a new feature the provider can just push an update directly to the phone whereas in the past you may have needed to order a new SIM card.

Upgrading from 4G devices to 5G for example required a new SIM card at some carriers to be able to connect to the new networks. When buying a phone from a carrier or with a carrier installment plan you usually get the new SIM card in the box so this isn't much of an issue. If you were buying unlocked directly from Apple however you may have needed to get a new SIM.

Using eSIMs will make it easier for consumers to explore or switch cellular providers. T-Mobile and Verizon's Visible have been using eSIMs as a way to give people the ability to try out their respective networks on their existing devices. Last week T-Mobile updated its trial program to now give interested people three months of unlimited data to compare its 5G network with their existing provider.

Should you want to switch eSIM streamlines the process and allows you to be up and running significantly quicker than waiting for a physical card to be mailed or taking your handset into a store.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ29iZWFycy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdG8td2F0Y2gtbGlzdGVuLXRvLWJlYXJzLWJpbGxzLWdhbWUtdHYtcmFkaW8tb25saW5lLXN0cmVhbS0yMDIyLXdlZWstMTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to watch Chicago Bears vs. Buffalo Bills: TV radio watch online live streaming | 2022 Week 16,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2xhdGVzdC1iYXRjaC1vZi10d2l0dGVyLWZpbGVzLXNob3dzLWNpYS1mYmktaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4tY29udGVudC1tb2RlcmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latest Twitter Files shows CIA FBI have spent years meddling in content moderation,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nypost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/12/24/latest-batch-of-twitter-files-shows-cia-fbi-involved-in-content-moderation/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227389DB0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2xhdGVzdC1iYXRjaC1vZi10d2l0dGVyLWZpbGVzLXNob3dzLWNpYS1mYmktaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4tY29udGVudC1tb2RlcmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

In addition to listing his 50 Central South duplex for $90 million last week Wynn has listed two Sun Valley Idaho homes for $27 million as well as a Palm Beach property for $78.5 million. That’s in addition to a Beverly Hills California estate that is looking for $100 million after initially seeking $125 million in March 2020 according to WSJ.

Sue Engelmann and John Sofro of Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Sun Valley Properties have the Sun Valley listing. The larger of the two homes is 12400 square feet with seven bedrooms and sits on 2.4 acres. He bought the home which has a catering kitchen and two guest wings in 2009 for $7.5 million. The property has a heated pool and hot tub.

Wynn also bought the adjacent 3200-square-foot four-bedroom house which sits on 2 acres. He uses that home for hosting guests.

The 11000-square-foot apartment on the 30th and 31st floors of the Ritz-Carlton in New York has three bedrooms four bathrooms two half-bathrooms 15-foot ceilings a library wet bar media room terraces and views of Central Park.

Building amenities include a spa and health club business center in-room dining services and housekeeping — a benefit of being atop a hotel.

Wynn paid $70 million in 2012 to buy the penthouse from Millenium Partners founding partner Christopher Jeffries.

Serena Boardman of Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.

The nine-bedroom 17000-square-foot mansion in Palm Beach Florida went on the market in November the outlet reported. He bought the property a year ago for $49 million and after a renovation put it back on the market in November for $78.5 million.

Lawrence Moens of Lawrence A. Moens Associates is the listing agent.

Wynn has had success flipping properties in the area. In April he sold a waterfront Palm Beach home for $32 million within a year of buying it for $24 million.

A company tied to Wynn paid $49 million for a lakefront mansion at 1350 North Lake Way in March 2021. That same month he flipped the waterfront property at 235 Via Vizcaya for $23.7 million two months after buying it for $18.4 million.

And in 2019 he paid $43 million for the oceanfront mansion at 1960 South Ocean Boulevard. A year earlier he sold the lot at 1350 South Ocean Boulevard for more than $20 million.

He hasn’t had as much success — yet — in selling his 3-acre property in Beverly Hills which he bought in 2015 for $48 million. The 11-bedroom mansion was originally listed for $135 million in March 2020 before he slashed the asking price a couple of times to its current $100 million price tag.

The 80-year-old Wynn who is worth $3.3 billion according to Forbes is the founder and former chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts. He stepped down from the company about four years ago after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct were revealed by WSJ.

A number of casino operators changed up their real estate portfolio this year with sales acquisitions and leasebacks — showcasing a flurry of activity after the short but steep economic fallout caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

And a number of those deals announced last year have closed in 2022.

Here are six of this year’s major deals on the Strip including one anomaly.

Las Vegas Sands shifts focus

Las Vegas Sands Corp. officially exited the Las Vegas market in February after Apollo Global Management Inc. took over the reins of its three Strip assets — The Venetian Palazzo and The Venetian Expo.

Las Vegas Sands is still headquartered in Las Vegas but it has turned its focus on investments in Macao where it is a market leader and Singapore. It is also concentrating on other investments in the U.S. with prospects in Texas Florida and New York.

Apollo Sands and Vici Properties Inc. first announced the $6.4 billion deal in March 2021.

Under terms of the deal Apollo paid a total of $2.25 billion. New York-based Vici a real estate investment trust affiliated with Caesars Entertainment Inc. paid $4 billion in the transaction. It now owns all of the real estate assets while Apollo operates the properties.

Apollo is no stranger to the gaming industry. It acquired Caesars Entertainment then called Harrah’s in 2008 with private equity firm TPG Capital then invested $2.4 billion into Caesars’ Las Vegas operations. The firms sold their remaining stake in Caesars in 2019 two years after Caesars’ main operating unit emerged from bankruptcy in 2017.

The new Venetian owners have since found the resort has substantially outperformed expectations since the acquisition which it shared during a recent Nevada Gaming Commission meeting. The company doled out $1500 bonuses to its 7000 employees in early December and told the commission that it plans to invest $1 billion in the property in the next three to four years.

Palms makes history

When the Palms reopened on April 27 it came back to much fanfare and it carved out a chapter in Las Vegas’ history book. After the off-Strip casino-resort was dark for more than two years it opened as the first resort in Las Vegas to be owned and operated by a Native American tribe.

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians the tribe that operates the Yaamava’ Resort and Casino in Highland California purchased the 21-year-old property from Red Rock Resorts for $650 million in May 2021.

It revamped the property with a new cafe furnishings and upgraded the back-of-house features.

Not much else was needed as the property underwent a $690 million facelift in 2019 while under Red Rock Resorts’ ownership. Red Rock invested heavily in the property’s daylife and nightlife components including the Kaos Nightclub.

Palms General Manager Cynthia Kiser Murphey told the Review-Journal in September that now the focus is on attracting Las Vegas locals as well as its Southern California clientele.

Cosmopolitan changes hands

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas officially became an MGM Resorts International property in May a deal that extended MGM’s footprint on the Strip.

Blackstone sold The Cosmopolitan for $5.65 billion in September 2021 with MGM purchasing the resort’s operations for $1.63 billion and entering into a 30-year lease agreement. The Cosmopolitan’s real estate was sold to a group of new investors though Blackstone retained an ownership stake in the property.

Blackstone purchased The Cosmopolitan in 2014 for $1.73 billion then invested $500 million into renovating its roughly 3000 guest rooms and luxury suites as well as upgrading the bar and restaurant offerings.

Bally’s takes over Tropicana

In another sale-leaseback agreement Bally’s Corp. closed on its $308 million purchase of the Tropicana Las Vegas from Penn Entertainment Inc. in September. The deal was first announced in April 2021.

Bally’s is expected to pay the property’s land owner Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. a REIT affiliated with Penn Entertainment $10.5 million annually in a 50-year lease agreement.

The Tropicana could also see another big change in its future. The 35-acre site on the south end of the Strip is being considered as the site for an MLB stadium project for the Oakland Athletics. Bally’s CEO Lee Fenton said last month that the Tropicana is still “very much in the cards” as a potential site.

The Mirage gets a new owner

On Monday Hard Rock International officially closed its $1.08 billion purchase of The Mirage from MGM Resorts International. The Nevada Gaming Commission approved its licensing to operate the hotel-casino last week.

Hard Rock owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida said it plans to gut the three-wing property and spend billions to expand and upgrade it with the Hard Rock branding starting in late 2023 or 2024.

When the resort expands it will go from 3044 rooms as The Mirage to 3640 rooms as the Hard Rock; 836 slot machines to 2000; and 51 table games to 212. The casino will be enlarged from 94000 square feet to 174000 square feet while the convention space will grow from 200000 square feet to 283000 square feet. The theater will go from 3278 theater seats to 6265 and 18 food and beverage outlets to 21.

The new owners also plan to replace one iconic feature — The Mirage volcano — with an all-suites tower in the shape of a guitar.

Caesars changes its mind

Caesars’ decision to not make a deal is what landed the company on the list.

For more than a year Caesars executives publicly floated the idea of selling one of its Strip resorts though it had talked about selling a Strip asset dating back to when Eldorado Resorts announced it was acquiring and merging with Caesars in 2019. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit a year later executives said at the time it would delay those plans while the hard-hit gaming and tourism industries bounce back.

Meanwhile Wall Street analysts identified the Flamingo and Planet Hollywood Resort as two prime candidates for a sale.

Caesars CEO Tom Reeg told investors it expected a sale announcement in early 2022 but no such announcement came. By summer Reeg shifted his tone when during its second-quarter earnings call he found investors and analysts’ focus on a deal “kind of amusing.”

“This is a change in you not in us. This has been discretionary for us from day one and it remains so” he said at the time. “If we have a trade that makes sense for us we’ll do it. If we don’t we’re fine waiting.”

In November Reeg announced the company decided against a sale because the market wasn’t favorable and the cash flow of the asset considered for sale had continued to increase.

“Despite us talking about how this was a discretionary process for us it created an unnecessary overhang in the stock” Reeg said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call while apologizing to shareholders.

Litt said in a presentation to investors that the real estate — which he values more than its $1.7 billion market cap — can be sold or spun off and leased back to Six Flags which runs 27 theme and water parks in North America.

Litt said in a press release there are numerous real-estate and private equity firms that would be interested in the real estate.

This isn’t the first time Litt waged a campaign to overhaul companies including hospitality giant MGM Resorts retail investor Taubman Centers developer Forest City Realty Trust Saks Fifth Avenue parent Hudson’s Bay Co. and casino real-estate owner Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc.

In 2016 MGM Resorts created MGM Growth Properties a REIT that owned several casino resorts. This year MGM Growth Properties was sold for $17.2 billion to VICI Properties according to the release.

The move could double Six Flags’ share price over the next 18 months according to Litt.

L&B isn’t the only or even the biggest activist shareholder at Six Flags according to the Journal. The company’s largest shareholder is H Partners Management —which has a seat on the board — recently agreed with Six Flags to increase its common stock stake in the amusement park operator to 19.9%.

The pandemic took its toll on the amusement park giant which temporarily closed its parks for up to a year. Six Flags’ CEO Selim Bassoul who took the reins at the company in late 2021 increased prices and removed discounts believing consumers would be willing to pay more for amusement parks after having limited entertainment options since March 2020.

But the company’s shares are down more than 50% this year and reported revenue in the period ending Oct. 2 dropped 21% from the prior year according to WSJ. Attendance had also declined 33 percent to about 8 million visitors with the price hikes and removal of free perks attributed to the falloff.

The canine is in line to get a bullet and stab protective vest to wear on the job.

Berkley police said the vest is a charitable donation from a nonprofit group Vested Interest in K9s Inc.

Officer Brian Anderson who lives and works with Bear put in the application to get his partner some added protection.

The vest is expected to be delivered within about two months. Vests from the charitable group are worth from $1774 to $2283 and weigh about 5 pounds.

Bear is almost two years old. Berkley Public Safety Lt. Jason Kobernick said Vested Interest waits until K-9 dogs are at least that age before donating a vest to them so they are full-size and don’t outgrow it.

Working K-9 dogs face dangers on the job just like officers Kobernick said.

“There are quite a few (incidents) where the dogs are injured” he said. “That’s because they are usually the first one’s to enter a building. Also (suspects) can be desperate to get away and the dogs often take the brunt of that.”

Bear is trained in tracking suspects sniffing out drugs and protecting his handler Officer Anderson.

“Bear has been an incredible addition to the department” Kobernick said “both for morale service” and community relations.

Matt Koehn Public Safety Director said in a statement that the department is grateful for the donation from Vested Interest.

“Anything we can do to help protect Bear while he is protecting Officer Anderson and the public is much appreciated” Koehn said. “We are very thankful to all who made donations.”

Vested Interest founded in 2009 to donate protective vests and other assistance to dogs in law enforcement nationwide.

The canine body armor is made in the U.S. custom fitted and certified by the National Institute of Justice.

Thus far the charitable organization has given out more than 4845 vests valued at $6.9 million to K-9 dogs in all 50 states.

Vested Interest’s program is open to active U.S. law enforcement dogs that are at least 20 months old. Funding comes from private and corporate donations.

Walt Disney World’s original Tomorrowland was much different than the version of this iconic land we see today while visiting the Magic Kingdom. When the Resort opened in 1971 Tomorrowland was only home to a couple of attractions along with a much more open view of Disney’s Contemporary Resort (which is still located just minutes from the Park). With most attractions and areas of Tomorrowland left unfinished on October 1 1971 the only opening day attractions Guests could explore included the America the Beautiful – which was shown in the Circle-Vision – and the Grand Prix Speedway. A couple of months later on December 24 Flight to the Moon joined this limited selection. (If you’re wondering about the rest of Tomorrowland as we know it today the majority of the land’s attractions including the Tomorrowland Transit Authority Peoplemover Space Mountain the Carousel of Progress and The Astro Orbiter then called the Star Jets opened as a result of a 1974 expansion. The only other exception is If You Had Wings which opened in 1972.) However Flight to the Moon wasn’t exactly an original attraction. It was actually a classic already – albeit one from a different park! Before Flight to the Moon opened in the Magic Kingdom the attraction operated at Disneyland Park where it was sponsored by McDonnell-Douglas. It ran at Disneyland from 1967 to 1975 when it transformed into Mission to Mars. Flight to the Moon was also relatively short-lived in Florida too. In the Magic Kingdom the attraction was also reimagined into Mission to Mars in 1975.

What Riding Flight to the Moon Was Like

Never got to experience this attraction firsthand? Well you might actually be more familiar with it than you think! Flight to the Moon used a similar setup as Extra-TERRORestrial Alien Encounter (which is the attraction that ultimately replaced it) and Stitch’s Great Escape albeit with an entirely different storyline and original concept. As its name suggests Flight to the Moon’s storyline focused on well a flight to the moon. During the attraction “Mr. Tom Morrow” voiced by George Walsh would interact with a Cast Member and share information about flight control and the process of getting to the moon. The problem with this concept was when the attraction debuted at Walt Disney World in 1971 it was intended to showcase something futuristic for Tomorrowland. However since nearly all of the Guests had witnessed a real moon landing for the first time just a few years earlier in 1969 the attraction’s excitement was already outdated.

Becoming Mission to Mars

In 1975 as the rest of the Tomorrowland had been expanded Flight to the Moon was due for an update – and it was reimagined into Mission to Mars. The new version of the attraction was designed through a collaboration with NASA to remedy the datedness of Flight to the Moon. Guests would witness a flight to Mars instead! Mr. Tom Morrow was gone but George Walsh returned to voice Mr. Johnson in Mission Control. From there the attraction followed a similar design as the original with Guests experiencing lifting off and flying to the Red Planet in a setup much like the theater of Stitch’s Great Escape. While no G-forces were actually used in the attraction the seats would move slightly and sound and visual effects worked to simulate the sensation of moving through space to fly to Mars.

A Piece of Disney History

By the way if Mr. Tom Morrow and Mr. Johnson sound like familiar names to you you aren’t imagining things! You may recognize them from another Tomorrowland attraction. There are plenty of ways Walt Disney World’s Tomorrowland – and even other parks and resorts around the world – have paid homage to Flight to the Moon. For example earlier audio tracks heard aboard the Tomorrowland Transit Authority Peoplemover said “Paging Mr. Morrow Mr. Tom Morrow please contact Mr. Johnson in the control tower to confirm your flight to the moon” as a nod to the former attraction. Similarly the original incarnation of Star Tours featured a reference to Mr. Tom Morrow. The space port audio track featured a public announcement for “Mr. Morrow Mr. Tom Morrow… Please check with the Star Tours agent at gate number four.” At Disneyland Park Tom Morrow was reintroduced in a much more obvious way in 1998 after a long absence. He appeared as a lab coat-wearing robot who served as the host of Innoventions. Simultaneously Tom Morrow 2.0 appeared as a smaller audio-animatronic at Innoventions at EPCOT from 2000 to 2007. After he was removed from EPCOT’s Innoventions in 2008 and Disneyland’s Innoventions in 2012 Mr. Tom Morrow made one more appearance (and you can still catch him there today!) The audio-animatronic’s head is on display inside the Collector’s office at Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout at Disney California Adventure Park.

The Legacy of Flight to the Moon

Flight to the Moon was not only the first new addition to the Magic Kingdom’s Tomorrowland paving the way for some of our favorite attractions in the Park today but it also led to the themes and storylines that would later become Mission: SPACE. Both Mission: SPACE and Mission to Mars were created following consultations with NASA to ensure an accurate and realistic experience for Guests but the relationship between the two doesn’t stop there. To learn more about how this extinct Tomorrowland attraction paved the way for one of EPCOT’s most thrilling experiences today continue reading this post."

By Sckylar Gibby-Brown |

It’s been 17 years since the last time Warner Bros. aired a commercial during the Super Bowl. Now per CBR.com the studio will return to the most-watched annual television broadcast in the world to present a full trailer for the highly anticipated The Flash starring Ezra Miller. After the trailer premiers on Super Bowl Sunday (February 12 2023) fans will be able to see it in the lineup of trailers that play before screenings of Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania which releases the following Thursday February 16.

The last time Warner Bros. released a trailer during the Super Bowl was in 2006 when the studio released promos for Bruce Willis’ 16 Blocks Kurt Russel’s Poseidon and Hugo Weavings’ V For Vendetta. Warner Bros. had previously released a one-minute teaser trailer for The Flash at the October 2021 DC FanDome.

Compared to the MCU DC films have had a tough go with constant hits or misses with their blockbuster comic book adaptations. Warner Bros. Discovery is in recovery mode right now with their newly appointed co-CEOs of DC Studios James Gunn and Peter Safran making drastic changes to DC’s filming plans in hopes of rebooting the studio and finding the success that Marvel has had. After receiving extremely positive reactions from previewers The Flash is hopefully the movie that will help the DCU find its footing again.

Preview test scores for The Flash have reported that the film is one of the best movies to come out of the superhero genre possibly ever. Some reviewers have said that it is as good as Spider-Man: No Way Home a film that was not only critically acclaimed but also a tremendous commercial success during the global quarantine. The Flash has tested higher than any previous DCU film and even rivals the scores of Christopher Nolan’s incredibly successful Dark Knight trilogy.

Ezra Miller as the Flash in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)

Despite The Flash being a highly anticipated film that fans have been waiting years for and the high test scores from previewers promising that this blockbuster will be a good movie the question still remains of whether The Flash will be able to bring in enough audience members to make it a commercial success. The star of the film Ezra Miller has faced a slew of legal problems over the last year that have given the actor and the studio some bad press with some fans even calling for the movie to be canceled or at least recast.

Miller was arrested in March of 2022 for harassment and disorderly conduct in Hawaii. It was also alleged that the actor has engaged in threatening behavior engaged in cult-like behavior endangered children and manipulated a vulnerable teen. After Miller’s arrest they met with Warner Bros. executives in order to save The Flash and then published a public apology citing becoming aware of mental problems that caused them to act out and they are now working hard to resolve these issues.

Despite the violent and illegal activities that Ezra Miller has been accused of Warner Bros. has stood by the actor and has not made any announcements regarding plans to recast them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL2hhcnJ5LXBvdHRlci1yZWJvb3QtZXZlcnl0aGluZy1zYWlkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harry Potter: Everything That's Been Said About a Possible Reboot,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL2hhcnJ5LXBvdHRlci1yZWJvb3QtZXZlcnl0aGluZy1zYWlkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223B28D00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The actress' short-lived series The Time Traveler's Wife is being removed from HBO Max along with several other HBO and HBO Max originals. According to a press release by Warner Bros. Discovery all of these shows are being licensed to a third-party company called FAST.

The Time Traveler's Wife was based on a sci-fi romance novel by Audrey Niffenegger and was adapted into a six-episode HBO series that premiered earlier this year. The show had a few die-hard fans but the reviews were generally negative and the series was canceled in July. Now it is one of eight HBO shows leaving the HBO Max streaming catalog in Warner Bros. Discovery's new deal with FAST. However it's not clear when or even if these shows will be available to stream again nor where they may be licensed.

Leslie is best known to most fans for her role on Game of Thrones as Ygritte – the wildling woman who falls in love with Jon Snow (Kit Harington) north of the Wall. Leslie and Harington even fell in love in real life and married after filming those sequences together but Leslie is quickly developing an extensive resume outside of that iconic performance. She also played Gwen Dawson on Downton Abbey and Maia Rindell on The Good Fight among other roles.

The Time Traveler's Wife also starred Theo James as Leslie's main love interest with two pairs of younger actors playing their characters at different points in the timeline. The show was developed and written by Steven Moffat and directed by acclaimed Game of Thrones director David Nutter. In general criticisms of the show seemed frustrated with the source material itself as well as some adaptational choices that were regarded as shortcuts.

The Time Traveler's Wife joins seven other shows in this new FAST licensing deal – The Nevers Raised by Wolves FBoy Island Legendary Finding Magic Mike Head of Class and Westworld. Five other shows are leaving the platform but have not been confirmed for the FAST deal yet. They are Gordita Chronicles Love Life Made for Live The Garcias and Minx. There's no telling where these shows may be headed.

While these removes from HBO Max have been devastating to fans and creators alike The Time Traveler's Wife has one advantage over some of its contemporaries. The show was released on DVD back in October making it available to watch even if it is not licensed to stream anywhere online. You can find it wherever DVDs are sold.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvZXZlcnktY2FuY2VsZWQtYmF0bWFuLW1vdmllLWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Every canceled Batman movie to this day,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvZXZlcnktY2FuY2VsZWQtYmF0bWFuLW1vdmllLWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223B2AEC0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Officials for each jurisdiction held public hearings and approved the rate adjustments over the past two months according to the San Rafael-based waste hauler.

The rate increases are part of the hauler’s service agreements with each jurisdiction and are calculated based on the consumer price index adjustments and other factors said Garth Schultz principal of R3 Consulting Group Inc. a waste management consulting firm that produced a rate study.

“Those include adjustments to rate elements for collection disposal composting recycling compliance with state and local requirements and adjustments resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic” Schultz said in an email.

Subscriptions have been down during the pandemic and Marin Sanitary Service also experienced a major outbreak that disrupted operations. More than 40 workers at the company tested positive for COVID-19 in June 2020 the company said.

“The COVID impacts could fill a blue book” said Patty Garbarino company president. “It’s safe to say that we made it through — and all are healthy and well now.”

In San Rafael rates will increase by 7.15% over 2022 levels for all ratepayers in the city. The increase is the highest in the company’s service area. For a residential 32-gallon trash bin the new monthly rate is $50.19.

The company received forgiveness for its Paycheck Protection Program loan in 2020. However the company had a shortfall of $613327 in 2021 billed revenues which is affecting the new rates according to a San Rafael city staff report.

This is also the third and final year of an increase in San Rafael’s refuse vehicle impact fees which are increasing by $345667 contributing 1.3% to the overall rate increase according to the city.

Over the past 10 years rate hikes for the city have ranged from less than 1% to more than 9% with the average equaling 4.71% annually. Last year’s increase was 2.39% and included an illegal-dumping pilot project according to a city staff report.

Rates are increasing 5.45% in Larkspur; 6.28% in Ross 5.89% in San Anselmo; 5.06% in Fairfax; and 6.17% in the Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District.

All increases apply to residential and commercial properties.

For residential 32-gallon trash bins that will mean a monthly rate of $54.04 in Larkspur; $46.16 in Ross; $54.30 in San Anselmo; $47.61 in Fairfax; and $43.93 in the Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District.

Yet it is one of the largest producers of waste in Africa.

A recent United Nations Industrial Development Organisation report stated that Nigeria generated 32 million tonnes of waste annually. Of this figure 2.5 million tonnes accounted for plastic waste and e-waste 461300 tonnes.

Undoubtedly the improper management of waste had caused an increase in sanitation-related diseases and flood disasters.

In 2018 a platform specialising in market and consumer data Statista reported a 59 per cent informal management and disposal of waste with about four per cent of the government’s intervention in the waste disposal system. This data further revealed that individuals and communities had devised means to dispose of their wastes in most states with little intervention or policies from the government.

Several studies have also affirmed that waste burial open-air burning and dumping were the commonly practised waste disposal systems.

This uncontrolled and indiscriminate dumping of refuse has caused a dirty and littered environment including stench from open dumpsites and smoke from haphazard burning of refuse. These practices consequently contributed to the environmental crisis the country faced.

The adverse effects of improper waste disposal include air soil and water contamination and the spread of airborne diseases which affect humans and animals.

Data from World Economics placed Nigeria’s Environmental Air-Quality value as 61.7PM 2.5. This value placed Nigeria as 14th out of 124 global listings of countries with the worst air quality.

A recent report by Clean Up Nigeria titled “State of the Nigerian Environment 2022’’ stated that only three states namely Lagos Oyo Abuja and Bauchi operated sanitary landfills while other states practised open dumping.

A sanitary landfill is a safe method of waste disposal where a pit with a protected bottom is dug for trash to be deposited buried in layers and compressed to make it more solid. The report inferred that this unhealthy system affected the health of sanitation workers and other members of society.

The National Coordinator Clean Up Nigeria Ene Owoh in a statement said “This development is not only alarming but indicates a lack of seriousness by the government at all levels to key into the global best practices of waste modernisation with related benefits. Only four cities namely Abuja Uyo Bauchi and Abakaliki can be said to be clean in the year 2022.

“Performance indicators from our studies show that over 176.3 million Nigerians in 2022 are living in an unclean environment compared to 172 million in 2021. This equally calls for serious incremental review on the part of governments at all levels to help confront the challenges of ensuring a cleaner and safer environment.”

Other safe methods of waste disposal include plasma gasification incineration waste compaction biogas generation composting and vermicomposting among others. Some environmentalists have called for a nationwide practice of proper waste management.

In his contribution Dean of Environmental Engineering at the University of Abuja Prof Toochukwu Ogwueleka urged state governments to ensure proper waste management in the country. Ogwueleka stated that no state in Nigeria had a sanitary landfill. He added that states that had sanitary landfills had converted them into open dumping due to poor maintenance.

The don further noted that the significant issue with waste management in the country was the lack of manpower highlighting the need for capacity building in the sector. He said “Sanitary landfill must have geotextile material underneath which prevents leaching of chemical wastes from the dump to groundwater. It must also have a vent for gas recovery. There is no provision for gas recovery or leaching in the dump sites we have in the country. What we call sanitary landfills in Nigeria is far from it it is an open dump.”

The dean opined that state governments should develop capacity in the waste management agencies rather than focus on sanitary landfills which he termed the last resort in waste management.

He further said that poor investment in waste management waste composition and generation analysis transportation management and unnecessary importation of waste equipment increased improper waste disposal schemes.

He added that transportation accounts for nearly 70 per cent of waste management cost adding that if properly managed and reduced it would reduce the cost of waste management.

Ogwueleka said “We need to look inwards using local means to solve the waste issue in Nigeria. Most of the equipment imported to tackle waste is unnecessary. For instance in composition Nigeria has more organic dense waste than volume compared to the developed world where you find more plastic waste. Some of the equipment they use in waste management cannot directly work for us.

“Compactor trucks are better for voluminous waste but that’s what most of our governors buy without adequate knowledge of the composition or volume of waste generated in the state or an area. Our waste is already dense what we need is to find local solutions to local problems. Optimising and scheduling routes for transporting wastes using adequate truck size after carrying out appropriate waste generation analysis will curb the issues we face with waste.”

On global best practices he called for the incorporation of an integrated waste management system with an emphasis on reduction recycling/reuse and recovery of waste as the way forward.

The professor stated that reducing waste should begin from the source of production while concentrating more on recycling waste to wealth and recovering energy from waste among others.

He added “We must work on reducing waste from the point of generation to final disposal. In the developed world only a few waste get to the dump sites. Organic waste do not get to dumpsites at all they are recycled. Let’s employ both the formal and informal sectors. The informal sector such as Babanbola (scavengers) should not be left out they engage in a lot of waste recoveries transported to different states in Nigeria. Babanbola is an integral part of waste management that should be incorporated into the sector. More attention should be paid to waste to wealth and waste to energy.’’

Similarly an environmental and toxicology expert Prof Olayinka Adewoye said that the best measure was for state governments to establish waste recycling centres and material recovery facilities in each senatorial district. He noted that doing such would reduce environmental pollution and create employment opportunities.

Adewoye said “Some global best practices that state governments should incorporate are the establishment of enviropreneurship centres biogas plant stations biofertiliser conversion centres and introduction of polluter pay principle.”

He added that individuals should learn to reuse waste reduce waste generation and recycle waste urging the government to enforce existing laws on waste management.

A professor of Climatology at the Faculty of Social Sciences University of Calabar Cross River State Imo Ekpoh decried the relegation of waste management to the background in most developing countries.

He added that decays from uncollected waste could infiltrate the water sources and pollute the air of such an environment.

Ekpoh said “The first impact of improper waste management is that littered waste is an eyesore and destroys the beauty of the environment. Also with the dry season pathogens especially viruses bacteria and fungi generated from the waste will be blown into the air and become airborne viruses and bacteria which humans can easily inhale. As a result people become sick with all kinds of communicable diseases because the environment is polluted by pathogens.”

The lecturer called for an efficient and country-wide waste management system to prevent airborne diseases and illness.

He said “There are four major types. Either you can do it by what is called landfills incineration composting or biological reprocessing. The dominant method practised is the landfill where a dumpsite is constructed. There must also be the political will to engage in proper waste management because it is expensive to get the trucks and experts that will manage the sites.”

He urged the government to ensure the proper collection of waste to promote good health for the citizens and cleanliness of the environment.

He stated “It is better to collect the waste and transport it to a proper waste collection site. If you don’t have a proper landfill or incineration site you can take it far away from population centres and burn them. Burning is not encouraged because it increases global warming subsequently climate change. Controlled burning is incineration.’’

Besides a professor of Environmental Sustainability Environmental Education and Learning for Sustainable Development Anthony Kola-Olusanya stated that the lack of a proper waste management system led to the indiscriminate dumping and burning of refuse.

Kola-Olusanya who is also the Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic Research Innovation and Partnerships Osun State University Osun State added that the lack of sanitary landfill increased the presence of vectors and odious smells in the environment. He called for the need to engage in sustainable management of solid waste disposal using the three principles of reducing reusing and recycling.

He said “Reduction approach; this call for lowering the levels of material consumption in society. Two Reuse; the campaign around the world now is to move away from using one-time-use containers to reusable containers. Recycling is the attempt to maximise the lifespan of the consumption of materials. This will reduce the quantum of the waste that would have gone into the sanitary landfill.

“Waste reduction is done when we reuse what we waste. Luxury items can be reused manufacturers can also reduce the size of their products to cut down on waste materials from it. The immediate thing the government can put in place is a sanitary landfill because it has its advantages.

Garbage and sewage are dumped into the canal’s open waters from Hadapsar and Satavwadi. (HT PHOTO)

The irrigation department has stopped supplying water from the Khadakwasla dam into the canal lowering water levels in the area. To make matters worse several pigs were discovered dead in the canal on Wednesday fueling citizen discontent with PMC.

On December 19 citizens protested the irregular water supply in front of the police post at Bhekrainagar Chowk. Many of the protestors chanted anti-administration slogans especially after senior citizens and children became ill after drinking the water. Local agitators have threatened to stage an even more aggressive protest if nothing is done to address the situation.

“The problem has been happening since the inclusion of Phursungi and Uruvali Devachi village under PMC in 2017” said Yogesh Tukawade a resident of Bhekrai Nagar.

“We only get water every two weeks and it only lasts an hour. For our water supply tankers are required. For bathing we have private tankers and government takers.”

Since 2008 tankers have been delivering water to the residents of Phursungi and Uruvali Devachi. Individuals from these villages have long complained that the municipality does not provide adequate funds for village development.

Garbage and sewage are dumped into the canal’s open waters from Hadapsar and Satavwadi heavily contaminating it as it flows towards Bhekrai Nagar.

“If water was let into the canal we would not have been disgruntled by this issue. We are now however compelled to use the same contaminated water for all of our activities” said Sanjay Harapale a social activist and Bhekrai Nagar resident.

Residents have been fighting for good water purification systems for nearly 12 years. However PMC officials have done nothing to address this problem.

They also approached Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran(MJP) for the establishment of a water purification system. The tender for this passed 12 years ago with a contract for 3 and a half years to complete the task is yet to be proceeded with.

Aniruddha Pawaskar Superintending Engineer (Water Supply Department) PMC said: “Bhekrai Nagar is newly merged under the PMC and the water network is not complete too. This will take approximately six to seven months to complete. We’re working to improve the connection but it will take some time for the water supply to return to normal.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5uZXQucGgvMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9jaHJpc3RtYXMtc3Bpcml0LWNvbWVzLWFsaXZlLWluLXNlbWlyYXJhLWlzbGFuZNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5uZXQucGgvYW1wL3N0b3J5LzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvY2hyaXN0bWFzLXNwaXJpdC1jb21lcy1hbGl2ZS1pbi1zZW1pcmFyYS1pc2xhbmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas spirit comes alive in Semirara Island,"The fiberglass boats are built through a bayanihan system with the beneficiaries taking part in the fabrication and technical assistance provided by experts from the Municipal Agricultural Office of Caluya Antique. | PHOTOGRAPHs COURTESY OF SMPC

TDT DMCI Holdings Inc. unit Semirara Mining and Power Corporation the largest local coal producer in partnership with the Department of Energy is bringing Christmas cheer to fisherfolk of Semirara Island as they will receive additional 35 motorized fiberglass boats for their livelihood. The boats will be distributed to the fisherfolk of barangays Semirara (25 recipients) Tinogboc (5 recipients) and Alegria (5 recipients). To date SMPC has turned over 40 of the pledged 75 boats. Materials to fabricate the boats including the motor engine propeller shafting and rudder assembly were provided by SMPC. The fiberglass banca program aims to promote sustainable fishing in the area. Priority is given to indigent fishermen to give them additional livelihood income and food sustenance for their families. ""We hope to help our impact communities by coming up with a sustainable livelihood program that will generate greater economic benefit for the locals"" Maria Cristina Gotianun SMPC president and chief operating officer said. Gonzago Magan a beneficiary from Barangay Tinogboc with his wife and grandchild. Compared to traditional wooden boats fiberglass boats are of greater benefit to fishermen because they are more durable spanning approximately 30 to 50 years. ""May mga pagkakataon na malakas ang alon lalo na ngayong Disyembre. Pero dahil sa fiberglass bangka nakakapangisda pa rin kami sa medyo mas malalim. Nakakapanghuli kami at binebenta namin sa tindahan"" (Even with the strong waves this December we are able to fish in deep waters because of our fiberglass banca and sell the catch) Gonzago Magan a beneficiary from Barangay Tinogboc said. ""Nakakatulong po talaga dahil malakas ang bentahan ng isda ngayong buwan kaya may panghanda na kami sa Pasko para sa mga apo namin"" (It's a big help to us because fish sell well this month so we have food for our grandchildren this Christmas) he added. SMPC's Social Development Program supports the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals or UN SDG specifically on food security and poverty alleviation. SMPC has also spearheaded other initiatives to protect the island's ecosystem and long-term sustainability. Its Semirara Marine Hatchery Laboratory maintains a giant clams nursery that propagates and reseeds endangered clams which are considered keystone species crucial to marine water biodiversity along the coastal waters of Semirara Island. SMPC also deployed man-made reef balls in the coastal waters to create artificial reefs that can help combat the adverse effects of overfishing and destructive fishing methods. Two of the company's power subsidiaries Sem-Calaca Power Corporation and Southwest Luzon Power Generation Corporation deployed such artificial coral reefs in April 2022 along the Marine Protected Area of Barangay Carenahan in Balayan Batangas and equipped the shoreline with a watchtower that local sea patrol community volunteers can use to monitor activities in the protected environment.

Read more

NEW YORK — Is James Harden seriously considering a return to the Houston Rockets in free agency? Or is the 76ers point guard letting the team know there will be no discount this time around?

We’ll find out in negotiations this summer. But ESPN reported the former an hour before the Sixers faced the New York Knicks in a Christmas Day game on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.

“I’m here” Harden said following the Sixers’ 119-112 victory over the Knicks. “We are playing very well. And I don’t know where the report came from. But I’m very excited to be here. We are playing well and we’re continuing to get better.”

The future Hall of Famer was in no mood to talk about the report hours earlier.

Asked before the game about the report Harden responded: “What report?”

Harden said he didn’t know what the reporter was talking about. He also became agitated when asked about the report that he was considering going back to Houston.

“Why would you ask me about that on Christmas man?” he said. “You didn’t say Merry Christmas or nothing. You asked me about something that I ain’t even … I’m not answering. I didn’t see nothing.”

Later told why the question had to be asked Harden responded: ”I’m not talking right now before the game.”

Harden signed a two-year $68.6 million contract with the Sixers on July 27. He has a player option for the 2023-24 season which enables him to become a free agent this summer.

Harden opted out of a $47.4 million player option this summer to re-sign with the Sixers. He’s making $33 million this season. The pay cut he accepted created enough cap space to sign his former teammates and friends P.J. Tucker Danuel House Jr. and Montrezl Harrell in free agency.

He played a little over eight seasons in Houston before forcing a trade to the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 13 2021. Harden one of the Rockets’ all-time best players won the 2018 NBA MVP award and three scoring titles as a Rocket.

Harden finished with 29 points 13 assists and four steals against the Knicks on Sunday.

After a rocky to start this season he and Joel Embiid have formed a dominant All-NBA pairing. The Sixers are 8-1 since his return with the only loss coming at Houston in his first game back from a foot injury. During the Sixers’ current eight-game winning streak Harden 33 is averaging 21.6 points 12.8 assists and 1.8 steals (including four steals against the Knicks).

If he opts out this summer Harden could demand a lot of money from the Sixers if he is indeed considering going back to the Rockets. Houston will have a lot of cap space this summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JyaWFuYnVzaGFyZC8yMDIyLzEyLzI0LzEyNTAwMC1sYWlkLW9mZi1pbi1tYWpvci1jdXRzLWFzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1mZWFycy1zcGlrZWQtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWZvcmJlcy10cmFja2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,125000 Laid Off In Major Cuts As Recession Fears Spiked According To Forbes Tracker,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2022/12/24/125000-laid-off-in-major-cuts-as-recession-fears-spiked-according-to-forbes-tracker/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JyaWFuYnVzaGFyZC8yMDIyLzEyLzI0LzEyNTAwMC1sYWlkLW9mZi1pbi1tYWpvci1jdXRzLWFzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1mZWFycy1zcGlrZWQtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWZvcmJlcy10cmFja2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Here's how to stop it.,"The BDN Opinion section operates independently and does not set news policies or contribute to reporting or editing articles elsewhere in the newspaper or on bangordailynews.com

Anastassia Fedyk is an assistant professor at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. Yuriy Gorodnichenko is a professor of economics at UC Berkeley. James Hodson is chief executive of AI for Good Foundation. They are co-founders of Economists for Ukraine. They wrote this for the Los Angeles Times.

For the last several months Western observers have watched Russia systematically destroy Ukrainians’ access to electricity heating and technology by targeting civilian power and communications infrastructure. It is a total war against the Ukrainian people.

Much of this targeted destruction is made possible by Western technology running on Western-designed devices core operating systems and networking software. A damning report from the Yermak-McFaul International Working Group on Russian Sanctions reveals that a large part of the technology systems enabling Russia to continue its attacks against civilians comes from Ukraine’s allies.

Companies such as Microsoft Google Cloudflare Oracle IBM AutoCAD and others have made public statements announcing that they are “exiting the Russian market” — but simply stopping new sales of equipment without shutting off existing phones and operating systems is wholly insufficient.

Many vendors continue to allow their products to be used to help manage servers monitor networks secure data build artificial intelligence and other capabilities that have clear potential to be co-opted for military purposes. These technologies are critical to Putin’s ability to damage Ukraine’s digital and physical infrastructure.

Western technology firms operate inside Russia by the rules of the Russian government. The relatively compliant Google which has a long history of coordination with the Russian government’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor is practically the only major American information platform still allowed to operate within Russia. It has tried to operate its information platforms in a delicate balance to comply with the Russian government’s implicit rules. But now Android devices are being used on the battlefield to communicate and coordinate attacks.

The time for delicate balance is well past. After 10 months of war Russians are not rebelling against the Putin regime’s murderous actions even though the costs are growing ever higher for them. Many are rejoicing in the damage done in Ukraine. There is little hope of making Russians want to stop their aggression. What remains is to hinder their ability to continue.

As Ukrainians face a brutal winter with limited heat and power even as they work to set up “points of invincibility” to provide refuge for the most vulnerable the least the West can do is to stop enabling Russian aggression with Western-produced technology.

What’s needed is more comprehensive information technology sanctions that cover military-enabling technology cyber-enabling technology and information-war-enabling technology.

Block IT services and access to stop further use by the military.

It’s imperative that the West limit Russia’s access to cloud computing resources and cloud-based data such as commercial satellite imagery and GIS systems and terminate all licenses and access to IT service providers such as Microsoft Google (Cloud and Android) SAP Oracle IBM Cisco and dozens of others. It is not possible to identify all potential military-enabling uses of such technologies so they should be blocked comprehensively. The same goes for manufacturing equipment and industrial technology provided by Western companies that are remotely accessible or reliant on international connectivity and communication.

Prevent Russia from using network and web-related technologies to communicate securely.

We should prevent access to software and related apparatus for secure digital communications network monitoring proxy networks VPN and other similar services that allow the use of digital resources remotely. This would include blocking access to services such as Cloudflare and access to patches/updates for security vulnerabilities in key network software and operating systems.

Make social platforms more accountable by requiring that data on content consumption by region language and source be publicly available.

Require social media digital advertising networks and content-sharing platforms to perform stringent checks before allowing paid-content sharing and prior to allowing content to reach an audience of more than 10000 accounts. Any platform distributing news-like content should report on key consumption metrics so that the reach of pro-Russian versus independent news sources in each region and language can be readily ascertained.

Impose stricter controls on technology transfers to Russian companies and nationals working in Western nations.

Examples of Russian firms supplying equipment to Western governments and infrastructure persist. Stronger monitoring of these firms is crucial to better protect national security and the West’s industry and technology base. Russian nationals working in related technology areas should be subject to “deemed export” regulations as applied to non-U.S. nationals working on any technology subject to export controls.

Russia will continue to exploit all available channels to carry out its aggression. The first step is to block Western technology from operating in Russia until attacks on civilians and infrastructure stop and Russians are held accountable for the committed crimes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvZ2FtZXIubmV0L2dhbWVzLW9mLTIwMjItZ29kLW9mLXdhcnMtZ3JlYXQtZHVhbC1wcm90YWdvbmlzdHMtYW5kLWEtbG9vay1iYWNrLWF0LWhvcml6b24tZm9yYmlkZGVuLXdlc3RzLWFjY2Vzc2liaWxpdHktb3B0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Games of 2022: God of War's great dual protagonists and a look back at Horizon Forbidden West's accessibility options.,"This piece contains spoilers for God of War Ragnarok!

I've noticed a common theme within recent PlayStation exclusives: the addition of the dual protagonist perspective. For example you play as both Ratchet & Rivet in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and as Ellie and Abby in The Last Of Us Part 2. However I think that Santa Monica Studios absolutely nailed the dual protagonist narrative in God Of War Ragnarok.

Embarking on my journey with Kratos and Atreus filled me with glee. Their father and son relationship was my favourite aspect of the franchise reboot alongside that addictive Leviathan Axe recall thumping into Kratos' raised right hand.

Here the dual protagonists open the narrative scope and allow players to follow the perspective of both Kratos and Atreus and explore their relationship to the wider Norse realms and companion characters like Freya.

It makes a big difference. The player already understands the mindset of Kratos and his thoughts on Atreus. However as the game unfolds the player slowly starts to unravel clues to Atreus' growing maturity and emotional strength.

The Atreus segments give us enough time to spend with characters that Kratos would view as enemies. Atreus' relationship with Odin Thor and Thrud present the player with valid emotional connections with antagonistic presences by flipping the table on our perceptions. It was fantastic to team up with Thor and command him to throw Mjolnir to attack enemies on my behalf. I was surprised to get a more intimate view of the Thor Sif and Thrud household and it also mirrored the fracturing relationship between Kratos and Atreus. The phrase ""For our children we must be better"" is at the core of Ragnarok framed perfectly in the powerful ending of the climactic battle with Thor. Kratos uses kindness and compassion to prevent unnecessary bloodshed. Kratos finally trusts Atreus by giving him the ultimate choice on how to deal with Odin. ""This is your choice son I trust you"" he says and Atreus makes the difficult but correct choice of empathy - to follow the path of justice over rage and violence. ""We survived today because of your choices. Who to trust. Who to call friend. Son. You are ready"" Kratos says. Atreus replies ""Remember our promise."" Kratos responds ""Loki will go."" With an emotional tremble Kratos then touches his heart whilst saying that ""Atreus... remains."" The epilogue is emotionally effective because we finally get to face the colossal boss - the emotional breakthrough. Kratos finally believes that Atreus has the power to have autonomy in his life and to be trusted. Kratos learns that without Atreus' company Kratos can easily slide back into the killing monster witnessed by the death of Heimdall. Atreus ultimately makes Kratos a better God. Throughout it all the dual protagonist perspective allows us to follow Kratos and Atreus on their separate journeys which ultimately brings them closer together to value their unique father-son relationship.

Still here? I couldn't let 2022 go without talking a little about another PlayStation exclusive one that ate up a lot of my year. I want to focus on the accessibility aspects of this second PlayStation game which is Horizon Forbidden West. (I played it on PS4 because the PS5 did not work for my accessibility setup.)

The plethora of accessibility settings present in Forbidden West gives players control over their gameplay and the chance to align it with their abilities to ensure that enjoyment isn't affected by unnecessary barriers. It's a great start for Guerrilla able to design Forbidden West from the beginning with accessibility in mind. The studio's attempt is extremely well executed and it means more gamers can enjoy the amazing characters and wonderous world of Forbidden West.

Horizon Forbidden West.

Guerrilla understands that disabled gamers don't just want an easy mode but they do want control over important aspects of gameplay such as how much damage Aloy receives or how much damage enemies take. The main aspect of combat is to accurately tear off enemy parts for crafting purposes. However the precision necessary to do this can be difficult to achieve as enemies are extremely mobile.

Because of this Forbidden West has added the option to loot those specific parts once you get the kill. This option was great for me as it provided a safety net when fatigue caused me to forget to tear parts off in battle. The auto-heal option removed the need to press up on the d-pad especially useful when I made the ridiculous decision to fight a Tremortusk and two Scrappers with low tier weaponry. If you assume that I survived the massacre you'd be absolutely right... if right actually meant wrong. I'm an advocate for the implementation of toggles and Guerrilla has happily obliged here too. There are toggles for aiming opening the weapon wheel crafting Shieldwing activation and Pullcaster. The crafting toggle is clever: you can easily craft arrows or ammo whilst in the weapon wheel by tapping X instead of holding it. During combat it made a huge difference by reducing fatigue and unnecessary constant muscle usage. This is supplemented with the option to increase the weapon wheel time slowdown. It doesn't completely stop time but slows it enough for me to choose the right weapon ammo type or alternate fire.

Guerrilla has added sprint when pushing the left stick fully forward and this option enabled me to slide (by pressing crouch) for the first time. But the clever bit is that if you are crouching and push the stick fully forward you don't ruin stealth by accidentally sprinting. This option should appear in all games because sliding is useful but more importantly super awesome.

Horizon Forbidden West.

I wouldn't say that Horizon Forbidden West has the best control remapping system seen in PlayStation exclusives - Insomniac's Spider-Man Miles Morales is still the star - but it's not far off. It's flexible enough to alter the button layout and change layouts for different contexts such as when aiming separate joint actions or layer actions on one button. For example the new ability to glide using the Shieldwing can be assigned to most face buttons because it only activates after jumping. The remapping surprisingly allows you to layer the Interact action onto other buttons; I layered it to the dodge action thus freeing up the triangle button to be used as the ""use trap"" button. The great aspect of the ""use trap"" button is that if you hold it it accesses your backpack where you can craft traps or swap between them without using the d-pad.

The choice to assign actions when aiming is great. You have to consider controls for your Pullcaster for activating the essential Concentration mode which slows time for increased accuracy and for the first time your weapons have multiple unlockable alternate fires. The additional option to automatically activate Concentration mode when aiming makes gameplay intuitive fluid and more immersive.

The only accessibility issue with Horizon Forbidden West is that the process to swap between three alternate fires in the weapon wheel requires the use of the d-pad. There should be an option to either use the left stick or triggers to swap. Alt fires are essential tools in Aloy's arsenal and swapping between them is usually a choice between life or death. Beyond this Forbidden West continues the progress we're starting to see in accessibility. See you in 2023!",,,,,,,,,

For 20 years the place where icons like James Harrison Troy Polamalu and Hines Ward called home was known as Heinz Field. Named after the famous condiment brand it was a moniker that just rolled off the tongue. And regardless of how one feels about Heinz's toppings (this writer for example can't stand ketchup) it seemed to suit the franchise well. So much so in fact that Pittsburgh made the playoffs in 14 of its 21 seasons prior to the latest name change to Acrisure Stadium.

That doesn't look to be the case this year. In the laundry list of issues that have popped up in Pittsburgh's season the name of its stadium likely doesn't rank first. But it hasn't helped matters particularly among a raucous fanbase anchored to many of its traditions.

So just what is Acrisure? The Sporting News gives you the skinny on the multi-billion dollar company and its (unpopular) foray into the sporting world.

What is Acrisure?

Based out of Grand Rapids Michigan Acrisure is one of the more prominent financial technology and insurance companies in the United States.

The company was founded in 2005 by Greg Williams and Ricky Norris a firm established to snatch up smaller insurance companies in its native Midwest.

Acrisure has seen stable growth over the past decade or so cementing its status as one of the most prominent insurance companies in the world. It offers tech for a number of different industries including asset management real estate and cyber services.

The company has made serious waves in recent years blossoming from a $28 million business to one that closed a $725 million Preferred Equity campaign earlier this year and received a valuation of $31 billion.

With all the capital its acquired over the years it was little surprise that Acrisure made the jump into the sporting landscape. Per Axios the company will shell more than $150 million over the course of its 15-year deal with Pittsburgh.

Williams a self-described Steeler fan vowed to “invest in the Pittsburgh community.”

It will take a long time for folks to get acclimated to the old digs with a new name. Commentators have mistaken the new title for its more famous past one. So too have fans many of whom have done that in an act of resistance from ownership's unpopular decision.

But with a 15-year deal on the cards Steelers fans — and NFL viewers as a whole — better get used to Acrisure.

Fallout of name change from Heinz Field to Acrisure Stadium

The name change left many Pittsburgh supporters who liked the Heinz Field name upset. Some players even weighed in including legendary Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.

I can't believe it it doesn't seem right or real! Home will always be Heinz Field! I will never forget the last game and all the amazing fans at FOREVER HEINZ! -- Ben.#ForeverHeinz

People even started a Change.org petition to have the stadium name reverted back.

Many wondered why Heinz didn't renew its sponsorship with the Steelers and keep its name in place. The company explained shortly after the new stadium deal was done that it all boiled down to one thing: money.

The Kraft Heinz Company released a statement addressing their naming rights deal with the Steelers. They explained that they couldn't justify paying as much for the rights as Acrisure was willing to shell out.

While we worked diligently with the Steelers for several months around a new naming rights deal they found a new partner willing to pay significantly more than we could justify.

That said Heinz — a Pittsburgh company — isn't ending its sponsorship of the Steelers entirely. They are going to be a ""significant long-term partner"" for the organization and outlined some work that the company will do for the Pittsburgh community.

While our name will no longer be on the stadium Heinz will remain a significant long-term sponsor of the Steelers and we’re excited to announce the details of our new partnership in the days ahead. Kraft Heinz is committed to its ongoing support of the Steelers and the Pittsburgh community in a city that is our co-headquarters. In addition to our partnership with the Steelers we look forward to our continued support of organizations such as the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and Grow Pittsburgh as well as sponsorship of events like Picklesburgh among others.

So Heinz will still have a significant presence in Pittsburgh. It may just be a bit muted compared to when they had the stadium naming rights.

Updated on December 13th 2023

Here at Sure Dividend we are fond of dividend stocks particularly stocks with long track records of consecutive annual dividend increases.

We believe that stocks like the Dividend Aristocrats an elite class of 68 S&P 500 stocks with 25+ years of successive dividend hikes have the potential to outperform the market over the long term – especially during uncertain times in the markets.

The requirements to be a Dividend Aristocrat are:

Be in the S&P 500

Have 25+ consecutive years of dividend increases

Meet certain minimum size & liquidity requirements

There are currently 68 Dividend Aristocrats. You can download an Excel spreadsheet of all 68 (with metrics that matter such as dividend yields and price-to-earnings ratios) by clicking the link below:

In this article we celebrate dividend-growth investing by sharing and discussing some of the most famous dividend-related quotes told by well-known personalities in the investing world. They are great to read and study and bear wonderful wisdom and insight.

“Dividends may not be the only path for an individual investor’s success but if there’s a better one I have yet to find it” – Josh Peters

In this quote Josh Peters suggests that collecting dividends from investments can be an important characteristic of an individual investor’s success. The idea expressed here is that collecting dividends is a dependable and effective way for individual investors to earn a return on their investments.

In fact Mr. Peters suggests that dividends make for the ultimate route for investors to build wealth over time. It’s easy to trust his words considering he has written one of the best dividend-investing books of all time The Ultimate Dividend Playbook.

Dividends can provide a predictable source of cash flow and thus they can be exceptionally beneficial for those who are looking to build wealth over the long term.

“Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It’s to see my dividends coming in.” – John D. Rockefeller

John D. Rockefeller was America’s first billionaire with a fortune worth about 2% of the national economy. In 1913 his personal wealth was estimated to be around $900 million or about 3% of the country’s GDP of $39.1 billion that year.

Now to say that dividends are the “only” way one gets pleasure would be abnormal to say the least. Whether Mr. Rockefeller’s words are true or just a way for him to convey the importance of dividends through this exaggerated statement the point remains the same: Dividends are a great way to build wealth.

When a company pays or even better increases its dividend payments it can signal that its future outlook remains positive and that management is confident in its capacity to keep generating profits. Thus regular dividend increases in general can be a cheerful sign for investors as they can indirectly indicate a potential for an upsurge in the value of the company’s stock (i.e. building wealth over the long term.)

“A cow for her milk a hen for her eggs and a stock by heck for her dividends“ – John Burr Williams

In this quote John Burr Williams uses the analogy of a cow a hen and a stock to illustrate the importance of dividends for investors. Just as a cow is valuable for the milk it produces and a hen is valuable for the eggs it lays a stock is valuable for the dividends it pays.

In other words stocks don’t really have value unless investors can receive a real tangible return on their investment through regular payouts. The statement also implies that non-dividend-paying stock can be quite more speculative as the lack of dividends can make it significantly more difficult for investors to assess a stock’s future total return prospects.

“The very attention we place on rising dividends puts us squarely in the position of ‘owners’ of a company of true investors who understand that a satisfying and reasonable return from a stock investment isn’t a gift of the market or luck or the consequence of listening to some market maven but it is the logical and inevitable result of investing in a company that is actually doing well enough in the real world to both pay dividends and to increase them on a regular basis“. – Lowell Miller

Lowell Miller is no stranger to the investing world. He has written an excellent book titled The Single Best Investment: Creating Wealth with Dividend Growth in which he urges prospective investors to avoid listening to the noise diverting the markets but rather allocate their money to dividend-paying stocks that offer stable returns and reduced risk characteristics.

His quote emphasizes the significance of thinking like a business owner when holding a stock which can be essential for three key reasons:

Long-term focus: Business owners typically focus on their business’s long-term growth and success rather than short-term market fluctuations. By thinking like an entrepreneur when owning a stock investors can take a similar long-term view and make decisions based on company fundamentals rather than short-term market movements.

Diversification: Business owners commonly diversify their investments to spread risk and increase their chances of success. By thinking like a business owner when owning a stock investors are more likely to diversify their portfolio and reduce risk. Research and Due Diligence: Business owners typically do extensive research and due diligence before investing in a business. Thinking like an entrepreneur when owning a stock encourages investors to conduct their own research and due diligence to make informed investment decisions. Lowell Miller suggests that investing in companies that are able to pay and grow their dividends regularly constitutes good investment practice. “The good thing about the dividend-paying stocks is first of all you have stocks which are real assets if we have some inflation. I think we’re going to have 2% 3% maybe 4%. That’s a sweet spot for stocks. Corporations do well with that. It gives them pricing power. Their assets move up with prices. I’m not fearful of that inflation.” – Jeremy Siegel

Mr. Siegel’s quote essentially points to the fact that investing in dividend-paying stocks can be a suitable strategy in the event of inflation – and during highly-inflationary environments in general. This theme is more relevant than ever as inflation remains quite elevated despite unwinding lately. The annual inflation rate in the U.S. stood at a lofty 7.1% in November of 2022.

Inflation is fundamentally a constant expansion in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. And since dividend-paying stocks are real assets paying out real tangible assets (cash or stock) they can provide a steady source of income that can assist in mitigating the effect of climbing prices.

A good example here includes consumer staple stocks like The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) which have managed to increase the prices of their goods by a rate that is more or less equal to the rate of inflation lately. This is due to their highly inelastic goods as they comprise household essentials that consumers tend to buy regardless of the underlying state of the economy.

Therefore Mr. Siegel’s quote also indicates that moderate inflation can even be a favorable factor for companies as it can give them pricing power which can result in their assets appreciating in value.

“I believe non-dividend stocks aren’t much more than baseball cards. They are worth what you can convince someone to pay for it.” – Mark Cuban

In this quote Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban suggests that the value of non-dividend stocks is subjective. If a stock doesn’t pay dividends it’s way more problematic to value them making it hard to tell whether you are paying a fair price when buying them.

The primary reason that non-dividend-paying stocks may be harder to value is that they do not offer a predictable income source like dividend-paying stocks. This means that it can be harder to determine the value of non-dividend-paying stocks based on traditional valuation methods such as the dividend discount model which is typically used to value dividend-paying stocks.

Non-dividend-paying stocks can also be harder to value than dividend-paying stocks because their value is predominantly helmed by the company’s growth potential which can be tough to predict. For this reason such stocks are more sensitive to market fluctuations and overall more volatile and speculative than dividend-paying stocks as Mr. Cuban suggests.

Final Thoughts

All these quotes we discussed stress one thing: the importance of dividends when investing. Amongst other points they teach us that dividends are a critical contributor to a stock’s total return including their role in the appreciation of the stock price and the income they generate.

The quotes also underscore the significance of dividends in inflationary environments their power to help investors value stocks more accurately and that they also expose whether a company is in a healthy financial position.

In our Sure Analysis Research Database we currently cover more than 830 securities including all those featuring superior dividend growth streaks such as the Dividend Aristocrats (25+ years of dividend increases) and Dividend Kings (50+ years of dividend increases).

In addition to listing his 50 Central South duplex for $90 million last week Wynn has listed two Sun Valley Idaho homes for $27 million as well as a Palm Beach property for $78.5 million. That’s in addition to a Beverly Hills California estate that is looking for $100 million after initially seeking $125 million in March 2020 according to WSJ.

Sue Engelmann and John Sofro of Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Sun Valley Properties have the Sun Valley listing. The larger of the two homes is 12400 square feet with seven bedrooms and sits on 2.4 acres. He bought the home which has a catering kitchen and two guest wings in 2009 for $7.5 million. The property has a heated pool and hot tub.

Wynn also bought the adjacent 3200-square-foot four-bedroom house which sits on 2 acres. He uses that home for hosting guests.

The 11000-square-foot apartment on the 30th and 31st floors of the Ritz-Carlton in New York has three bedrooms four bathrooms two half-bathrooms 15-foot ceilings a library wet bar media room terraces and views of Central Park.

Building amenities include a spa and health club business center in-room dining services and housekeeping — a benefit of being atop a hotel.

Wynn paid $70 million in 2012 to buy the penthouse from Millenium Partners founding partner Christopher Jeffries.

Serena Boardman of Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.

The nine-bedroom 17000-square-foot mansion in Palm Beach Florida went on the market in November the outlet reported. He bought the property a year ago for $49 million and after a renovation put it back on the market in November for $78.5 million.

Lawrence Moens of Lawrence A. Moens Associates is the listing agent.

Wynn has had success flipping properties in the area. In April he sold a waterfront Palm Beach home for $32 million within a year of buying it for $24 million.

A company tied to Wynn paid $49 million for a lakefront mansion at 1350 North Lake Way in March 2021. That same month he flipped the waterfront property at 235 Via Vizcaya for $23.7 million two months after buying it for $18.4 million.

And in 2019 he paid $43 million for the oceanfront mansion at 1960 South Ocean Boulevard. A year earlier he sold the lot at 1350 South Ocean Boulevard for more than $20 million.

He hasn’t had as much success — yet — in selling his 3-acre property in Beverly Hills which he bought in 2015 for $48 million. The 11-bedroom mansion was originally listed for $135 million in March 2020 before he slashed the asking price a couple of times to its current $100 million price tag.

The 80-year-old Wynn who is worth $3.3 billion according to Forbes is the founder and former chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts. He stepped down from the company about four years ago after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct were revealed by WSJ.

Roads are ""covered in black ice"" and visibility is limited the Minnesota State Patrol warned imploring drivers to slow down and buckle up. Windchill advisories and warnings were in place with windchills in the -30s across the state.

Statewide between 4:30 p.m. Friday and 11:30 a.m. Saturday there were 350 crashes 30 with injuries 282 spin outs and one jackknifed semi the patrol said.

Ferocious winds that pounded nearly every corner of Minnesota on Friday whipped up whiteouts and led state and county agencies to shut down thousands of miles of highways that in calmer conditions would have hummed with holiday travelers.

Instead most roads were empty as a blizzard packing winds in excess of 50 mph reduced visibility and pushed snow back onto plowed lanes. Several counties in southern Minnesota took plows off the roads until conditions improved the National Weather Service said.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation reopened Interstate 90 between Albert Lea and the South Dakota border but advised that road conditions are still difficult.

MnDOT also said ""no travel"" advisories will be lifted on several highways across south central and southwest Minnesota but some remain closed as snowplow crews continue working to clear drifts. MnDOT advises drivers to check 511 for the latest conditions.

Metro Transit said 43% of buses were delayed by an average of nine minutes at noon Saturday while light rail has ""stabilized.""

Widespread and prolonged periods of whiteout in frigid conditions led scores of motorists to stall or land in ditches across south and south-central Minnesota. Troopers had to remove several vehicles from the ditch along Hwys. 71 and 68 south and west of Redwood Falls said Sgt. Troy Christianson with the State Patrol.

""First responders are swamped"" said Minnesota Department of Transportation spokeswoman Sandra Schlagel. On Friday afternoon Gov. Tim Walz declared a peacetime emergency in response to the storm activating the Minnesota National Guard to assist with rescuing motorists.

Conditions were bad enough that Meeker County in central Minnesota and Freeborn Jackson Mower and Blue Earth counties in southern Minnesota pulled plows off roads Friday afternoon.

Travel was not advised across much of the west southern and central parts of the state where a blizzard warning remained in effect until Saturday morning. Winds consistently howling between 35 to 50 mph made for tough going even in the southern metro counties of Dakota and Scott also included in the blizzard warning.

""You create your own emergency if you stall spin out or crash"" said Anne Meyer another MnDOT spokeswoman. ""That is why we don't want people going out when travel is not advised.""

Few people were out and about in Blue Earth where the lack of traffic on I-90 made for a slow morning at the Farmer's Daughters Kitchen about 40 miles west of Albert Lea. The eatery located just off the freeway is normally packed for Friday breakfast said owner Becki Steier.

""We had some customers this morning but it's quiet now"" she said. Scores of trucks were idled at a truck stop across the street she said.

Down the road in Fairmont Hannah Johnson a property supervisor at the Quality Inn said she'd seen only a handful of travelers make reservations to get out of the blizzard. Likewise she saw just a few vehicles on the road while she was out shoveling.

Johnson said she didn't mind the blizzard. ""It's going to be Christmas soon and we're going to have all this snow.""

The North Pole-like weather was felt along the North Shore of Lake Superior. Grand Marais had the second-strongest wind gust ever recorded at the harbor clocked at 74 mph Friday morning according to the Weather Service in Duluth.

Slick conditions in the Twin Cities led to crashes and spin outs all day MnDOT said.

Air travelers suffered for the second straight day as close to 5000 flights were canceled nationwide by Friday afternoon. At Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport there were 157 cancellations of incoming or departing flights by 3 p.m. according to the flight tracking website flightaware.com.

Amtrak scrubbed Empire Builder runs between Chicago and Seattle through Sunday. The train stops at Union Depot in St. Paul. Metro Transit buses were rolling but many were running late.

Travelers weren't the only ones experiencing setbacks. UPS Amazon and FedEx officials said severe weather could cause delays for Christmas deliveries.

Philip Ekman owner of Albertville-based Platinum Courier Service said the weather had not slowed the 20 drivers he employs.

""For the most part they're pretty hardy people"" he said.

But the heavy snow and intense cold prompted customers to scale back on deliveries that were not considered essential and could be postponed Ekman said.

For Christmas presents that needed to be delivered on time Ekman said Platinum was not slowing down. One of his drivers picked up an expensive watch at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and was on the road to deliver the gift in Michigan he said.

With frigid conditions expected to continue into next week CenterPoint Energy and Xcel Energy asked customers to consider temporarily lowering thermostat settings to conserve energy and save on heating bills. Both utilities said they were seeing a short-term rise in natural gas market prices due to the extreme cold across much of the country.

""Consider conserving natural gas for the next few days because the wholesale cost is passed on directly to customers"" read a statement from Xcel Energy.

CenterPoint Energy recommended settings at 65 degrees during the day and 60 degrees when asleep or away from home.

Sunday should bring a sunny Christmas morning with temperatures in the single digits and a chance of snow toward evening. By midweek a thaw could mean highs above freezing Wednesday and Thursday.

He landed a position as an electrical engineer for Ukrainian Railways right out of college. But after the Russian invasion forced him to flee to Minnesota Holiuk's sponsor in Brooklyn Park helped him write a resume on a donated laptop and apply for 150 jobs in engineering and related fields.

Holiuk 33 landed a handful of interviews. He recently took a computer test at the post office to operate a mail-sorting machine but while he is nearly fluent in English he struggled to understand some of the technical words. Holiuk has yet to land an offer three months after arriving here.

""It's discouraging because I know he's getting turned down for jobs he's really qualified to do"" said his sponsor Mark Norlander.

At least 280000 Ukrainians and Afghans have resettled in the United States over the last 16 months. Among the many scrambling to find work are professionals with advanced skills — engineers doctors military officers teachers scientists — who are trying to find jobs in the fields they excelled in back home instead of taking on the usual refugee employment in factories warehouses and retailers. Yet they can face obstacles ranging from American institutions not accepting their degrees to having little guidance in white-collar employment searches.

This summer the nonprofit Prosperity Ready conducted entry-level job training for Afghan evacuees in manufacturing and hospitality. Founder and CEO Lisa Perez recalled being ""floored."" The talent she said ""is just unbelievable and the work ethic the degrees the experience."" Her organization also conducts a course to help degreed immigrants find jobs; the next starts Jan. 17. Half of the upcoming group hails from Afghanistan.

""We're hundreds of thousands of workers short in our state right now and so to have people who are so talented sidelined — it's not OK"" said Perez. ""There's applicable skills. It's just is there enough support from employers and from community-based organizations to help them make that transition?""

She said the job market here is different from what they're used to.

""There are so many barriers and there are flat-out broken parts of our employment system"" said Perez. ""It doesn't matter how smart you are or how much experience you have."" Without someone helping she added ""it's really really hard.""

The Toro Co. which provides solutions for the outdoor environment makes presentations to Prosperity Ready's immigrant students and Perez introduced Afghan newcomer Fahim Loodin to the Bloomington-based firm. Loodin had worked for Western companies in Afghanistan providing security and logistics services to the U.S. government during the war and began work in May at Toro as a customs compliance specialist in the global trade department. It reminds him of his old work culture.

""I love my job"" said Loodin. ""I love the environment.""

Zahidullah Zahid served as acting director general and deputy of the Afghanistan Nuclear Energy Agency overseeing several hundred employees working to use nuclear technology techniques efficiently in medicine agriculture environmental protection public safety and other fields.

But he hasn't worked since Aug. 14 2021 when he saw people running past his office in Kabul saying the Taliban was coming. Zahid knew his life was in danger; his staff had received training and support from Western institutions including Sandia National Laboratories. He and his family went into hiding in safe houses after the Taliban seized power. They spent five months at an American military base in Qatar before coming to Minnesota in October.

He set about updating his resume. Zahid 38 has a biology degree from Kabul University and received his master's in chemical biological radiological nuclear events protection from Tor Vergata University of Rome. He documented his extensive expertise in emergency preparedness and response protection of radioactive sources; serving as a chemical and biological weapons prohibition officer; collaborating with the International Atomic Energy Agency and other major international organizations; and traveling to cities across Europe over the last decade for conferences and training. Those trips as he noted on his resume included participating in a NATO regional cooperation course in Rome and a preparatory committee of a conference in Geneva on the Biological Weapons Convention.

""This for me a new place a new environment — starting from zero you have to work for yourself for your family"" he told the Star Tribune in a meeting two weeks after his arrival with his wife and seven children. ""And I know I cannot find a job in my field … because they are not accepting the educational documents of other countries.""

Zahid wondered if he would have to work in a supermarket or deliver pizza and how it would mentally affect him. Zahid who is fluent in English wants to work in emergency preparedness and response or at least a job managing people in an office the way he is accustomed. While waiting for his official work authorization he's applied to a few jobs online. His brother's friend reached out to a state legislator about connecting Zahid with a job at Xcel Energy and Zahid plans to sign up for Prosperity Ready's job search program.

At his new home in Eagan this week Zahid was markedly more optimistic as he sipped green tea: ""I'm 100 percent confident that I can find a good job here but it needs time.""

He's willing to take an exam and receive more training he said but he has found navigating the American job market overwhelming at times. ""There is not a proper system available that you can go submit your documents and tell them 'I am good in this area I have expertise in this area please find me a job.'""

The International Institute of Minnesota noted that it has worked with a series of refugees on their job searches. The agency said it helped one Ukrainian land a job as a math professor at Dunwoody College of Technology; it aided a Ukrainian refugee with a legal background in connecting with Mitchell Hamline School of Law to work toward her law degree and network with local lawyers and a retired judge.

The institute also helped a Ukrainian software designer network and secure job interviews and an Afghan client with resumes and cover letters for his job search following a career working for international agencies banks and nonprofits running infrastructure and housing development programs.

Reza Haidari 25 was an officer in the Afghan Air Force who was halfway through his training in Slovakia to be a helicopter pilot. Then the Taliban took over and he couldn't return home. He sought refuge in the United States and found work as a janitor at first. Then Haidari upgraded to medical assembler at Medtronic for $22 an hour. But he misses flying.

""If I could get any kind of job at the Air Force I'd love that … to be honest I'm totally lost"" said Haidari who lives in Richfield. ""I have no idea what to do here. I'm searching for any kind of purpose in my life.""

Holiuk arrived in Minnesota in late September with his wife 2-year-old and twin 11-year-old daughters. They recently moved into an apartment in Brooklyn Park and he feels pressure to find work soon. He said he hasn't heard from a job counselor assigned to him when he received public aid from Hennepin County.

He wrote a cover letter to railroad companies explaining how the war had prepared him for the job: ""Because we had to leave our home for the safety of my wife and 3 children I have had to adapt to new and unexpected circumstances and learn many new things. I expect to use this ability to adapt and learn quickly in my work for [a new job].""

Holiuk said he misses working.

""I apply for jobs every day"" he said. ""If I have a call for some company and they say 'Can you go work the next day?' I say yes because I want to work."""

Brands Inc YUM restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken is the face of Christmas in Japan. The ordinarily quiet restaurants become abuzz with activity as the holiday approaches.

Talking Turkey ... Or KFC: The tradition of eating fried chicken for Christmas by the bucket loads stems from one man — Takeshi Okawara who was the manager of the first KFC that opened in the country in November 1970 in Nagoya reported TimeOut a local publication.

Okawara apparently overheard an ex-pat reminisce about eating turkey for Christmas and hit upon the idea of dishing out fried chicken instead according to the report.

In 1974 KFC reportedly came up with the slogan “Kentucky Wa Kurisumasu” or Kentucky is Christmas which fortified the link between the festival and chicken.

Book Ahead Or Line Up: As a Tokyo-ite I can attest firsthand that people start booking their Christmas meals at KFC as early as November. Even so on the day the meals are supposed to be picked up you can expect to queue up outside a KFC. Many times employees set up special stalls outside the restaurant so customers can pick up their KFC goodness.

Last year The Japan Times said KFC is now encouraging people to order online to avoid the “perennial” Christmas queues.

A company spokesperson said that the move was an “infection countermeasure” in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

What's In Store? You might be forgiven for imagining that a KFC Christmas would be all sloppy fast food fare. This year the restaurant chain is dishing up a “Premium Roast Chicken” for JPY 6200 or $45. There are various combos on sale including what the company calls “Party Barrel” which features 8 pieces of original recipe chicken a cheese-based dessert and four cheese Doria — a gratin-like rice dish popular in Japan.

The Party Barrel is on sale for JPY 4480 or USD 33. Several cheaper options are available including one which contains barbecue chicken and is priced at JPY 1980 or $14.50.

Beyond The Colonel: The popularity of eating fried chicken is now well-established in Japan. So popular is the dish that it is promoted during the winter holiday season in convenience stores and by other restaurant chains for those who can’t or couldn’t be bothered to queue up at Colonel Harland Sanders’ doorsteps.

You could even give a loved one the gift of crispy deep-fried chicken this season thanks to LINE — a super app that is popular in the country.

The baseball star has admitted that he didn't always have the best attitude with media and his fans during his prime. ""I mean I was just flat-out dumb. What can I say? I'm not going to try to justify the way I acted toward people. I was stupid"" he said in an interview with Sports On Earth. Being known as the villain also didn't help him receive any grace when he found himself in a steroid controversy.

The lengthy investigation into his alleged use of steroids lasted over five years with the baseball star admitting to using banned substances but claimed it was done unknowingly. In 2007 as the baseball star made history with a home run record many were unsure whether to celebrate it. A shadow of doubt hovered over his accomplishment and companies were hesitant to capitalize on the moment. In 2001 after he broke yet another record he was greeted with endorsement deals with Yum! Brands Inc. and Fila.

According to The New York Times the steroid scandal possibly cost him $10 million a year in lost endorsements. Before news of the steroid scandal broke he was reportedly in talks with MasterCard for a considerable sponsorship. Those talks broke off as the company quickly backed away from the controversy. With this scandal Bonds didn't just lose endorsements in the end he quite possibly cost himself a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame.",,,,,,
