Casey Rodgers) ruled that 3M will not be allowed to avoid liability for the earplug lawsuits and pull the MDL into bankruptcy court.

This ruling was imposed by Judge Rodgers as an unprecedented judicial sanction as punishment for 3M’s blatant misconduct and abuse of the litigation process. But on a more basic level it applied the principle of estoppel – you cannot take one position for years in litigation and then take a contradictory position when you come up with a new litigation tactic.

This ruling has far-reaching implications for the thousands of earplug lawsuits because it effectively nullifies 3M’s bankruptcy play regardless of how the court rules on appeal. Does all of this slow down justice in the 3M class action? It does. But it also boxes 3M into a corner where it can choose a global settlement or it can continue to be slammed by juries.

This post will provide a detailed summary of yesterday’s major ruling by Judge Rodgers.

Read the Court’s 3M Sanctions Order

Procedural Background

In August 2022 after 4 years of litigation and 16 bellwether trials it seemed like the massive 3M earplug class action might finally be moving into the settlement phase. Judge Rodgers had recently required both sides to participate in a settlement mediation session. Then 3M shocked everyone by unveiling a new controversial legal strategy. 3M claimed that the party responsible for the earplug claims was Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”) and then 3M had Aearo file bankruptcy to stay the earplug lawsuits and force them to be resolved in bankruptcy.

Aearo was the company that originally designed and made the Combat Arms earplugs at the heart of the litigation. But 3M acquired Aearo back in 2008 and since that acquisition Aearo had essentially ceased to exist. Aearo’s products employees offices and everything else became 3M’s products and employees. Aearo continued to exist only on paper. It had no assets or employees or anything. Plaintiffs’ lawyers sued Aearo just because – you know – we sue everyone to be safe.

During the litigation 3M never suggested that Aearo was a separate independent entity. 3M never claimed that Aearo and not 3M was the party with liability for the earplug lawsuits. Why? They hadn’t come up with the bankruptcy idea. Then in a desperate effort to avoid a massive settlement 3M suddenly changed its tune. 3M claimed that Aearo was a separate company and was responsible for the earplug claims. Then 3M had Aearo file bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy Court Rejection

The problem with the bankruptcy gambit was that it was such a transparent strategy for a very large company to avoid paying the damages that a jury said that it should – and from paying an appropriate settlement based on what the bellwether trials suggested that it should. So it was just not victims and their lawyers who saw it for what it was. So did the bankruptcy judge and Judge Rodgers.

The bankruptcy court in Indiana promptly denied 3M’s effort to pull the earplug cases into the Aearo bankruptcy proceeding. The bankruptcy Judge held that the automatic stay in Aearo’s bankruptcy did not extend to 3M. 3M immediately filed an appeal of this ruling which was expedited to the Third Circuit. That appeal is still pending but as discussed below yesterday’s action by Judge Rogers makes it a moot point if it holds up on appeal.

Order Sanctioning 3M

Yesterday’s ruling by Judge Rogers was prompted by a motion filed by the earplug plaintiffs asking Rodgers to rule that 3M was precluded from claiming that it had no liability for the earplug claims and shifting blame to Aearo. That motion offered several different legal grounds which gave Judge Rodgers the authority to make this ruling. These included judicial estoppel waiver the federal rules of civil procedure and sanctions for bad faith conduct.

Judge Rodgers decided to base her ruling on the inherent power of the courts to impose sanctions for bad faith conduct. She devotes the first several pages of her 22-page Order to laying out the law of judicial sanctions and making it very clear that she is well within her authority.

Federal courts possess certain inherent powers not conferred by rule or statute to manage their affairs to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.” Goodyear Tire 137 S. Ct. at 1186 (internal citations omitted). “That authority includes the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.” Id.

Order at 3.

Next Judge Rodgers went out to explain in great detail the story of 3M’s bad faith in the earplugs MDL. She explains how 3M spent the last four years aggressively defending the earplug cases but never made any mention of Aearo being the real responsible party or a party at all:

Scorched earth battle was waged against every theory of liability alleged in this litigation yet there was nary a whisper that Aearo and not 3M was the only proper target or even a target at all.

Order at 6.

Rodgers describes how 3M’s dissatisfaction with the 16 bellwether trials (resulting in almost $300000000 in jury verdicts) ultimately prompted it to devise the strategy for getting out of the MDL recasting Aearo as the “real party defendant” for the first time. Then instead of actually filing bankruptcy 3M had Aearo file bankruptcy.

The next few pages of the Order recite the numerous instances in which 3M took actions in the MDL litigation which held itself out as the real party and were totally inconsistent with its current position regarding Aearo:

all 16 bellwether trials went forward with no suggestion from 3M that it had anything but exclusive liability for alleged CAEv2-related injuries. 3M sent a corporate representative to every trial (ironically now Mr. Rucker). Aearo sent no one. Defendants were referred to collectively as “3M” for purposes of liability and damages by both sides and the Court with no objection from 3M. In cases involving apportionment of fault the parties agreed to jury instructions and verdict forms allowing fault to be apportioned to a single defendant 3M and 3M never once argued that the relative fault of any other defendant should be considered in connection with the plaintiffs’ injuries even in cases involving CAEv2 use that occurred solely before 3M acquired Aearo.

Order at 13.

Finally Judge Rogers vented her frustration with 3M’s conduct and laid out her sanctions:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTEyLTIzL3ZpZGVvLXRoZS10b3hpYy1sZWdhY3ktb2YtM20tcy1mb3JldmVyLWNoZW1pY2Fsc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Toxic Legacy of 3M's 'Forever Chemicals',"Why did this happen?

Sign up for the free newsletter to get important environmental news by registering at this link.

It’s been about 20 years since Minnesota where the chemical giant 3M is based first began investigating drinking water contamination around a 3M factory that made the class of chemicals known as PFAS or per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances. Around the same time a lawyer named Rob Bilott was looking into similar pollution from a DuPont factory in West Virginia that was causing the gruesome deaths of nearby cows.

This was the beginning of the public consciousness around what we now call “forever chemicals.” In the wake of these investigations 3M and DuPont pledged to stop making PFOA and PFOS which are only two out of thousands of different types of PFAS. Minnesota settled with 3M for $850 million and DuPont spun off its PFAS business into the company now called Chemours.

Since then PFAS hotspots have arisen like a game of whack-a-mole in states including Maine where the chemicals have tainted sludge fertilizer that the state long encouraged for use on farms and seeped into waterways from military firefighting foam use. Marina Schauffler reported on topics like these in-depth in The Maine Monitor’s recent series “Invisible and Indestructible.” Regulators in places like New England have said that PFAS issues identified so far are only the tip of the iceberg for what’s to come.

3M and DuPont along with companies that bought PFAS from them now face scores of lawsuits — from states towns fire departments and individuals — accusing them of marketing the chemicals for use in all manner of other household and industrial products all while knowing the risks. The chemicals persist for decades in the environment and are linked to a range of deadly human health problems. Reporting by The Intercept has shown the 3M knew this and sought to bury it using a similar playbook to that of Exxon in regards to climate change. Now state and federal regulation of PFAS is finally on the rise years after Rob Bilott first began calling for these reforms.

It was likely with this massive legal liability in mind that 3M announced this week it will stop making and using PFAS altogether by 2025. “While PFAS can be safely made and used we also see an opportunity to lead in a rapidly evolving external regulatory and business landscape to make the greatest impact for those we serve” said 3M CEO Mike Roman in a press release.

It’s a splashy headline but what does it really mean? In many ways the PFAS cat is out of the bag — in Maine and worldwide the chemicals have been shown to be in drinking water wastewater rivers our bodies breast milk crops soil compost food packaging pets wildlife. Removing and destroying PFAS is an evolving challenge and towns states and water utilities are struggling to figure out how to fund testing and treatment. After 3M’s announcement some called for the company to go much further in helping fund this effort.

In the U.S. 3M has made the chemicals at factories in Minnesota Illinois and Alabama — all of which are or have been the subject of drinking water contamination investigations. Illinois is the most recent of these — there federal authorities stepped in to order a response to PFAS in the Mississippi River after reporting has shown state regulators failed to take action for years. And 3M and DuPont are not the only companies that have caused PFAS pollution. Factories that use the chemicals to make their own products — such as Saint-Gobain in New Hampshire — are the subject of similar investigations and PFAS in firefighting foam has polluted water at scores of airports and military installations.

The chemicals are used in paper-making which has caused some of Maine’s PFAS pollution and attracted class-action lawsuits as Mainers begin to ask how the chemicals have harmed their health land and water and who will pay to make it right. Maine has not yet joined the huge raft of federal lawsuits against 3M DuPont and firefighting foam makers which is being heard in combination in South Carolina but state Attorney General Aaron Frey said in May that the state planned to do so soon.

Billions in eventual legal settlements with 3M DuPont and other companies that used PFAS could help cover testing cleanup and health costs. But those cases may stretch for decades as has DuPont’s fight with cancer patients and others whose health problems are linked to PFAS in the Ohio River Valley. 3M has also opposed some state PFAS regulations in court — they successfully delayed New Hampshire’s limits for the chemicals by a year for example by suing over the rules’ use of Minnesota science on PFAS and pregnant people.

It’s unclear from this week’s 3M announcement what will become of the lawsuits the company is facing for past manufacture and sale of PFAS. “3M will continue to remediate PFAS and address litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions” the company said in its release.

It’s also unclear what the future holds for the successor chemicals to PFAS known as GenX — shorter chains of molecules that have been shown to have some of the same problems and risks. GenX chemicals have already been the subject of at least one settlement around a Chemours factory in North Carolina. According to New Hampshire Public Radio 3M declined to answer questions about what its PFAS announcement meant for GenX manufacturing.

“I think the devil is in the details here because PFAS is such a large class of chemicals” New Hampshire-based PFAS activist Andrea Amico whose family was exposed to the chemicals in Portsmouth N.H. told NHPR’s Mara Hoplamazian. “I’m really curious as to how 3M defines PFAS and if they’re truly going to stop making all PFAS chemicals or if it’s just a certain type of PFAS.”

Other advocates agreed that 3M’s move raised more questions than it answered both about the company’s next steps and the fate of PFAS throughout society.

“After telling everyone — their neighbors their workers and their regulators — that PFAS are safe while poisoning the entire planet 3M is now pledging to slink out the back door with no accountability. Congress and the courts cannot allow this to happen” said Scott Faber a senior vice president with the Environmental Working Group in comments sent to media. “No one should trust 3M’s commitment to do the right thing. They never have before.”

You aren't likely to find cheap stocks among Wall Street's favorite names but if you are willing to hold your nose and buy when others are fearful there are always some hidden gems around. Today that list includes A.O. Smith (AOS -0.01%) 3M (MMM 1.64%) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.91%) all of which are facing some near-term pressures.

Over the long term though these companies are likely to be just fine. Here's a quick look at each.

1. A.O. Smith: A little turbulence

While A.O. Smith isn't a household name the water heaters it makes allow you to live a more enjoyable life. If yours broke you would be on the phone immediately to replace it.

That is in fact the core of this industrial stock's business. Roughly 70% of its revenues come from North America and a significant portion of that revenue (around 80% or so) is derived from replacement sales. Although not exciting this geographic region is a reliable slow-growth foundation.

The rest of the company's sales come from foreign markets like China (the vast majority) and India where hot water is an increasingly affordable luxury.

For years China has been the key growth engine for A.O. Smith. That market has been a bit more difficult of late leaving the company's results choppy. But it is now starting to use its Chinese game plan to reach into India more aggressively. Given the size of the population and growth trends within India it is highly likely that this market will become a reliable growth engine too.

Meanwhile the stock's yield is near a 10-year high suggesting the stock is cheaply priced today. At 2.1% the dividend yield is modest on an absolute level but it has been increased annually for over 25 years and it has grown at a double-digit clip over the past decade. This is a stock worth buying and holding for even conservative types.

2. 3M: Beyond the ugly headlines

Next up is 3M which is facing legal and regulatory headwinds. On the legal front military veterans are suing the company with claims that earplugs it produces were defective. On the regulatory front chemicals the company produced at some plants have been found in the surrounding environment and need to be cleaned up.

Both could be costly issues and neither will be resolved quickly. Therefore this is not a stock for the faint of heart.

However 3M has increased its dividend annually for over 50 years (making it a Dividend King) has an investment-grade-rated balance sheet and currently sports a 4.9% dividend yield. The yield notably is near its highest levels dating all the way back to the 1980s! Yes the headwinds are an issue but it looks like Wall Street is pricing in a lot of bad news.

As for the company's underlying business which is inherently cyclical it is doing about as well as expected. Notably each of its divisions had operating margins over 20% in the third quarter of 2022 despite high rates of inflation. There's going to be a lot of headline-grabbing noise here but if history is any guide 3M seems likely to muddle through in stride.

3. Stanley Black & Decker: Executing the plan

The last company on the list is probably the hardest to love right now. Stanley Black & Decker entered 2022 expecting to earn between $12 and $12.50 per share on an adjusted basis. By the third quarter that number had fallen to $4.15 to $4.65 per share. What a difference nine months can make!

The problems are numerous. For example inflation is increasing the company's costs rapidly. The power tools the company sells expose it to retail customers a group that tends to be much more reactive than professionals to weakening economic activity. And the efforts to deal with these two issues will make things worse before it helps to make them better.

But management is addressing these issues. For example it is reducing production to trim down inventories (increasing near-term costs to benefit future performance). It has been selling noncore assets to strengthen the balance sheet. And it is focusing on innovation to maintain and perhaps grow its market share over time. It isn't pretty right now but it looks like the company is moving in a good direction.

The bad news however has pushed the stock down and the dividend yield up to a historically high 4.1%. The dividend meanwhile has also hit that 50-year threshold to make it it a Dividend King. If history is any guide Stanley Black & Decker looks very cheap right now -- if you can handle buying a stock with some very prominent warts.

Don't dawdle

The headwinds facing A.O. Smith 3M and Stanley Black & Decker won't be solved overnight but they won't likely last forever either. If you are looking for cheap stocks these should probably be on your shortlist. And you'll want to do the deep dive now before other investors catch on to the opportunity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFya2FuYWdhemV0dGUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvMjAyMi9kZWMvMjMvemVsbWEtZWFzdGVybGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ZELMA EASTERLING Obituary,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.texarkanagazette.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /obituaries/2022/dec/23/zelma-easterling/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226904760>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFya2FuYWdhemV0dGUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvMjAyMi9kZWMvMjMvemVsbWEtZWFzdGVybGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmNoaXRlY3RhbmRpbnRlcmlvcnNpbmRpYS5jb20vcHJvamVjdHMvdGhpcy1yZXRhaWwtc3RvcmUtaW4tZ3VqYXJhdC1vZmZlcnMtYS1sdXh1cmlvdXMtc2hvcHBpbmctZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1mb3ItbXVuZGFuZS1ob21lLXByb2R1Y3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This retail store in Gujarat offers a luxurious shopping experience for mundane home products,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.architectandinteriorsindia.com/projects/this-retail-store-in-gujarat-offers-a-luxurious-shopping-experience-for-mundane-home-products on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmNoaXRlY3RhbmRpbnRlcmlvcnNpbmRpYS5jb20vcHJvamVjdHMvdGhpcy1yZXRhaWwtc3RvcmUtaW4tZ3VqYXJhdC1vZmZlcnMtYS1sdXh1cmlvdXMtc2hvcHBpbmctZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1mb3ItbXVuZGFuZS1ob21lLXByb2R1Y3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

But it's not the Mexican border that's being clogged up. It's the one Texas shares with New Mexico.

Jerry Pacheco president of the New Mexico-based Border Industrial Association said the supply chain-disrupting inspections by the Texas Department of Public Safety is an unnecessary extension of Gov. Greg Abbott's get-tough border policies that are again front and center.

""It's a real bush-league tactic"" Pacheco said in an interview.

Abbott at a news conference in Austin on Wednesday said he has not reimposed his highly controversial order issued in April that required commercial vehicles crossing Texas' international border as part of an effort to crack down on unlawful immigration and cross-border smuggling. But the governor defended the ramped-up inspections that began earlier this month.

""That's all run by the Texas Department of Public Safety and they have a right and the ability to do these inspections"" Abbott a Republican whose third term in office begins next month told reporters. ""And they have found through these inspections that there were several vehicles that were not safe for the roads that could have posed dangers to Texans. And there were other flaws they found either with regard to the drivers or vehicles.""

Pacheco whose association bills itself as ""the premier industrial advocacy organization in New Mexico that focuses on improving the business environment"" has contacted the office of U.S. Sen. Ben Lujan D-New Mexico to determine whether the inspections run afoul of any federal laws.

""I have asked ... the state to investigate whether Texas is violating any interstate commerce laws by doing these inspections on the New Mexico border and impeding commerce across states"" Pacheco wrote to Lujan's office. ""I would like to see if your office can ascertain whether any violations are occurring.""

A spokesman for Lujan said the office is working with the appropriate authorities to address Pacheco's concerns.

In the interview with the USA TODAY Network Pacheco said the trucks being slowed down are carrying products ranging from produce to consumer electronics to auto parts. The long lines of trucks are also needlessly delaying ordinary motorists commuting back and forth to work or driving to meet their families' needs.

""Everybody's angry. This is an intentional cost delay of the logistics and supply chain here"" Pacheco said adding that he questioned whether Abbott is ""not well informed enough to know that he's hurting his Texas based companies as much as he's already New Mexico companies.""

In a statement issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw made no mention of any political implications of the inspection policy.

“We are committed to enforcing compliance with safety standards and one of our department’s primary functions is to ensure Texas roadways are safe for all Texans and visitors to our great state” McCraw said. “Cartels do not care about the condition of the vehicles they send into Texas any more than they do about the human lives they cram into tractor-trailers or those lost to a fentanyl overdose.""

The statement went on to say that the state's top law enforcement agency which for several years had maintained an outsized presence along the Texas-Mexico border would not disclose ""operational specifics"" of the inspection policy but did say its purpose is to ""help deter cartel smuggling activity.""

Abbott in recent days has directed stepped-up law enforcement activity in the El Paso region as migrants from Central and South America have began amassing at the border in anticipation of the lifting of a Trump-era policy commonly called Title 42.

The measure which has its roots in a World War II policy allows migrants seeking asylum in the United States to be sent back across the border as a means to curb the spread of COVID-19. The Biden administration had sought to end the policy on Wednesday but was blocked at least temporarily by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts.

The policy's fate remains in the hands of the full Supreme Court but there is no firm timetable for a decision.

Abbott's truck inspection order in April part of a sweeping set of measures the governor said were needed to protect Texas from illegal immigration proved to be short-lived. He was barraged with criticism from several business and trade organizations and drew the ire of the Mexican government the Democratic Biden administration and briefly became a flash-point issue with his 2022 election-year opponent Beto O'Rourke.

The governor rescinded the policy after his counterparts in the Mexican border states signed agreements requiring Texas-bound trucks to follow specified safety guidelines.

But federal authorities in Mexico also took steps seen as a swipe at Texas. After the inspection order forced major traffic tie-ups at the border Mexican officials made plans to re-rout the country's planned commercial rail line from El Paso to Santa Maria New Mexico about 20 miles west of El Paso.

The trucks being detained at the Texas-New Mexico border crossed into the United States at the international bridge in Santa Teresa.

Several busloads of migrants were dropped off in front of Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence in Washington DC on Christmas Eve in 18 degree weather late Saturday.

An initial two busloads were taken to local shelters according to an administration official. More buses arrived outside the vice president’s residence later Saturday evening. A CNN team saw migrants being dropped off with some migrants wearing only T-shirts in the freezing weather. They were given blankets and put on another bus that went to a local church.

Amy Fischer a volunteer with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network which has been receiving migrants sent to DC since the spring said the organization had been prepared for Saturday night’s arrivals having been informed about it earlier by an NGO working at the border in Texas.

The arrivals included asylum seekers from Ecuador Cuba Nicaragua Venezuela Peru and Colombia according to Fischer who told CNN the buses were supposed to go to New York but were diverted to DC due to the weather. Busloads of migrants have been arriving in Washington weekly since April.

“The DC community has been welcoming buses from Texas anytime they’ve come since April. Christmas Eve and freezing cold weather is no different” Fischer said. “We are always here welcoming folks with open arms.”

SAMU First Response a nonprofit that has been assisting migrants since the buses began coming to Washington earlier this year was also on the ground Saturday night helping arrivals. The organization’s managing director Tatiana Laborde described the stunt as “extremely inhumane” but said if done properly it could provide a road map to easing tensions at the southern border.

“What they’re seeing is much worse than what we see here. The three buses are just a small portion of what they experience on a day to day” Laborde said in an interview with Sara Sidner on “CNN This Morning” on Monday.

“If things like this are done in a coordinated and humane manner it could really be a good option for those border towns that are struggling” she added.

Laborde said most migrants were aware of the buses’ destinations and she said about 60% were headed to New York either to shelters or to stay with friends and family. She described this as “a pattern we’ve been seeing over the past couple months.”

It’s not clear who is responsible for sending the migrants to the Naval Observatory where the vice president’s residence is located though CNN reported earlier this year that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had sent buses of migrants north including to a location outside Harris’ home. CNN has reached out to Abbott’s office for comment on the latest arrivals.

The White House however put the blame on the Texas governor calling it a “cruel dangerous and shameful stunt.”

“Governor Abbott abandoned children on the side of the road in below freezing temperatures on Christmas Eve without coordinating with any Federal or local authorities” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said in a statement.

“As we have repeatedly said we are willing to work with anyone – Republican or Democrat alike – on real solutions like the comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures President Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office but these political games accomplish nothing and only put lives in danger” Hasan said.

Abbott is one of at least three Republican governors who have taken credit for busing or flying migrants north this year to protest the Biden administration’s immigration policies. He previously confirmed in September that his state had sent the buses to Harris’ residence at that time.

It's a scary time to be an investor with the markets languishing and the threat of additional interest rate hikes next year weighing on stock prices. In this environment it is important to control risk and one way to do that is by investing in quality healthcare companies with consistent sustainable dividends.

Cardinal Health (CAH 1.50%) and AbbVie (ABBV 0.22%) offer dependable revenue growth with above-average dividends. These are the type of value companies investors turn to in tough times and they are likely to be among the first stocks to bounce back when the economy improves.

Cardinal is in the middle of everything

Cardinal Health's stock is up more than 60% over the past year. The drug and laboratory products distributor operates in two segments: pharmaceutical and medical. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023 it reported revenue of $49.6 billion up 13% year over year with income from operations of $137 million down 67% over the same period in 2022 and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 down 57% year over year. The pharmaceutical segment is the one fueling growth bringing in $46 billion of the company's first-quarter revenue up 15% year over year. Medical saw revenue fall by 9% to $3.8 billion with lower product and distribution sales.

The company's bottom line was hurt by supply chain issues and inflation because many of its contracts are long-term limiting how fast the company can raise prices. New CEO Jason Hollar however is focusing on raising prices.

Cardinal is also looking at improving its medical segment sales. In November the company in a collaborative effort with Medically Home launched a supply chain network and last-mile fulfillment solution Velocare. The point is to deliver hospital-level care at home for patients bringing critical products and services to patients within an hour or two saving money and bringing more efficient care.

What I like about Cardinal is it doesn't have the expenses that pharmaceutical and medical device makers do in developing and making drugs and medical devices. It carves out its own profits from being the middleman. With inflation rising so fast this past year that put a short-term strain on the company but it is built for long-term success with less risk than most healthcare companies.

Cardinal also offers an above-average quarterly dividend which it raised by 1% last year to $0.4957 per share the 36th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. Its current yield is roughly 2.5%.

AbbVie is prepared for its next phase

AbbVie has proven its doubters wrong for so long that they're even joining the shareholder ranks. Over the past year the pharmaceutical stock is up more than 20%.

The looming patent cliff for Humira has made AbbVie a better company. The immunology blockbuster's sales will likely decline beginning in 2023 when it faces biosimilar competition in the U.S. for the first time. CEO Richard Gonzalez said he expects sales for Humira to drop 45% by 2024. The anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy has long been the standard of care for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.

However AbbVie already has two drugs that are lining up to replace the $20 billion in revenue that Humira earned last year: Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Just as Humira did the two biologics are steadily adding approvals. Skyrizi gained its third Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval this summer to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease and it also picked up that approval this fall in Europe. Rinvoq already has approvals to treat active ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis along the spine) Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis atopic dermatitis rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.

AbbVie said last year that the two drugs should deliver $15 billion in annual revenue by 2025. They're well on the way as they combined to bring in $5.3 billion in the first nine months of this year with Skyrizi's sales up 75.6% year over year and Rinvoq's up 54.5% in that same period.

Thanks in no small part to a big research and development budget fueled by Humira profits the company has a huge pipeline particularly in oncology with 26 molecules currently in trials. Another drug with huge potential is Vraylar which earned its fourth indication this month by the FDA as an add-on therapy for major depressive disorder. An estimated 21 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2020 according to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The drug was already approved to treat schizophrenia manic or mixed episodes from bipolar I disorder and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.

The company is raising its dividend by 5% next quarter to $1.48 per share offering a yield of around 3.7% more than double the average S&P 500 dividend of 1.82%. AbbVie because it spent years as part of Abbott Laboratories is a Dividend King that is on schedule to raise its dividend for the 51st straight year. The one downside to AbbVie stock is the pain of knowing you could have gotten a lower share price a few months ago but that annoyance ends when you consider the company's potential for growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ibG9vbWJlcmdsYXcuY29tL2lwLWxhdy9hbGxlcmdhbnMtdmliZXJ6aS1wYXRlbnRzLXNob3VsZC1iZS1uaXhlZC1tYWtlcnMtb2YtY29waWVzLXNhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Allergan's Viberzi Patents Should Be Nixed Makers of Copies Say,"Two generic-drug makers seeking to sell copies of Viberzi a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea asked a federal judge to cancel the patents AbbVie Inc.’s Allergan unit asserted in a November patent-infringement bench trial in Delaware.

Despite the inflation showing signs of cooling the Fed indicated to keep raising interest rates and predicted the terminal rate to reach as high as 5.1% next year higher than the September projection of 4.6%.

According to “Reinvent for growth” a new report from Accenture six in seven consumers globally (86%) say they want an all-in-one platform to simplify their entertainment experiences with video streaming fantasy sports social media ecommerce and more.

As part of its second annual global entertainment study Accenture surveyed 6000 consumers to understand their preferences and behaviors regarding their online entertainment experiences. Four in 10 respondents (41%) said they would pay for an all-in-one platform for their entertainment services. In addition three in five (61%) want the ability to share their streaming profiles across platforms to allow for better personalization of content the survey found.

“Standalone streaming services are running up against some simple facts: There are limits to what consumers will pay for and only a certain amount of complexity and options that they are prepared to deal with” said John Peters a managing director in Accenture’s Media & Entertainment industry practice. “It is time to reimagine entertainment ecosystems so that media companies can move to profitable growth by helping consumers get everything they need and want.”

Other findings from the report further highlight the need for media organizations to reconsider their operational and content strategies:

More than one-third (35%) of consumers unsubscribed from at least one of the top five streaming video-on-demand services in the last 12 months and 26% said that they plan to cut one or more in the next 12 months.

More than seven in 10 consumers (72%) reported frustration at finding something to watch up 6 percentage points from last year.

More than half (55%) of consumers said they are overwhelmed by the number of streaming services to choose from with 26% saying it can take them more than 10 minutes to settle on a streaming choice (up from 17% last year).

Accenture’s report also highlights three emerging roles for entertainment companies hoping to better compete for consumers’ time attention and money:

Audience aggregators are platform companies with a diversified business model that monetize attention and engagement directly and indirectly by tying multiple entertainment and other services together in one place.

Audience cultivators will create and efficiently monetize entertainment in one or multiple forms (e.g. video music gaming etc.) by knowing their core audience focusing on content/cost efficiency and ensuring that they’re included in audience aggregator platforms and bundles.

Content merchants will focus on making the best possible content without needing to monetize the engagement their content achieves.

“The future of the media industry is moving toward aggregated platforms” said Imran Shah a managing director with Accenture’s Communications Media & Technology industry group. “These platforms will achieve two crucial outcomes — creating inclusive lower churn services and bundles that will drive revenue for media companies while delivering experiences that enable consumers to easily find and access content.”

CLAYTON Mo. — The U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday bypassed Centene Corp. (NYSE: CNC) in awarding $136 billion in contracts for the health insurance provided to active-duty military members a blow to the Clayton giant and St. Louis' largest public company by revenue which has long held some of the work.

The Defense Health Agency said it was awarding the TRICARE contract for its west region to TriWest Healthcare Alliance of Phoenix owned by Blue Cross Blue Shield nonprofits including Blue Shield of California Regence Blue Shield and BCBS of Arizona along with the University of Colorado Hospital Authority and the University of New Mexico Hospital.

The $65.1 billion contract held by Centene for years through its Health Net Federal Services subsidiary includes a 12-month transition-in period plus eight one-year option periods a Defense Department spokesman said. The west includes 1.5 million beneficiaries in Arkansas Illinois Louisiana Oklahoma Texas and Wisconsin.

Centene said in a statement that ""we are disappointed by the DHA's decision.""

""We have a debriefing scheduled with the DHA in early January and have requested details to which we are entitled under the government's procedure rules"" it said. ""Following receipt of this information we will be in a position to determine our options regarding the Agency's decision.""

Centene this year lost another major award when the California Department of Health Care Services announced in August its intent to award contracts for Medicaid managed care contracts to Centene’s subsidiary Health Net of California Inc. in nine counties but not in others including Los Angeles and Sacramento counties. Centene is preparing to take legal action if a California state agency rejects its protest over how bidders were chosen. And Centene which has had a stagnant stock price this year has grappled with allegations of improper Medicaid billing to states. It's set aside $1.1 billion to resolve the claims which are now also the subject of a shareholder lawsuit against ex-Centene executives.

For Kevin Buckler of Adobe Road Winery that has meant making the most of California’s bustling wine scene to craft a four-bottle set of red blends designed for the motorsport fan. Yes I’ve drank my way through the Racing Series and yes I’m here to share just what I thought.

I first heard about Adobe Road through fellow auto journalist Teia Collier who sampled two of the wines at the Petaluma CA winery itself. After seeing the design of the “Shift” bottle which features a cork topper shaped like a shift knob I immediately fell in love . I considered nabbing the full Racing Series collection from Adobe Road’s website but I will admit that the $369 asking price was a little steep for my budget — thanks largely to the fact that the four wines are packaged in an incredible “museum-quality” box.

Spotlight On: Kevin Buckler of Adobe Road

But I was in luck: I’ve been able to find each of the reds in stores around Texas or via friends who had bought a bottle themselves. I started out with the first bottle — Shift obviously — back in early March of this year after finding it at the Bucc-ee’s just outside of Texas Motor Speedway. Since then I’ve drank my way through the collection and made tasting notes for each bottle (I am an aspiring wine snob). You’ll forgive me for lacking photos of my own — I didn’t set out intending to write a review but having finished the collection and falling in love I thought it only made sense to share my amateur thoughts with the world.

Redline

Out of all the wines in The Racing Series collection I think Redline was probably my least favorite — but that’s not to say it was in any way offensive; it was more just not totally my taste. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon Syrah Zinfandel Petit Sirah and Malbec there’s a whole lot going on here. Bold blackberry flavors give way to licorice and chocolate-covered fruit — three things I’m not a fan of when they’re not flavors in wine. I did however adore the fact that it had a nice spicy finish. It’s an adventure in a bottle so if you want you’re a big fan of savoring each moment of a sip you’re going to love where Redline takes you.

Apex

Next on my list is Apex a Bourdeaux-heavy blend that feels like velvet on your tongue and yet transforms into leather smoke juicy red fruits and holiday spices. My mom who is not a massive red wine fan said that it tasted like smoked pulled pork to her — it just has that cherrywood-smoked meatiness that makes it terribly fun to drink. It’s not massively bold in the sense that it doesn’t come at you like a punch but it does have the kind of flavor you want to roll around on your tongue for a while. It’s a slow wine. We had it with grilled steak and it was fantastic.

The 24

How do you pay homage to the endurance it takes to compete in a 24-hour race? For Adobe Road that means blending Grenache Mourvedre Syrah Malbec and Petit Syrah. If you’re patient enough to led it breathe you’ll be rewarded with a complex first sip that somehow manages to be fresh and fruity while also being dark and brooding and a little bit spicy — a big burst of flavor and excitement that mimics the start of a race. On your tongue though it feels soft and velvety and as you ease into the bottle you’ll find it steady and able to keep up with the duration of a long race. The splash of Malbec keeps that steadiness exciting all the way throughout.

Shift

Alright fine I’ll just come right out and say it: Shift was easily my favorite wine of the bunch. I’m a sucker for anything Tempranillo and having it blended with Zinfandel Syrah and Petit Sirah. It’s the kind of dry that will soak up just about all the moisture from your tongue but the blend’s bold fruity flavors help add a little extra punch without being overpowering. It’s one of those wines that holds up entirely by itself but it would also pair well with hearty meat dishes and strong cheeses; personally I recommend sipping it with an intent to enjoy it undistracted by anything else. Plus the bottle is an art piece in and of itself. I rinsed mine out and popped it on my kitchen cabinets alongside a few of my other gorgeous bottles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcGV0YXBpeGVsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2hhcy1hbnl0aGluZy1yZWFsbHktY2hhbmdlZC1pbi1waG90by1lZGl0aW5nLXNvZnR3YXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Has Anything Really Changed in Photo Editing Software?,"I guess I’m the sucker that keeps a lot of the digital photography software companies in business. In order to “stay current” in my recommendations I have to keep looking at new versions of software products and that requires a near endless tithing that’s getting old.



Adobe Photoshop

Let me just say up front that all the Adobe Disaster Scenarios that people worried about when they changed over to the Creative Cloud licensing program turned out to be Paranoid Dystopia. The price for the photography plan hasn’t really changed. We get regular useful updates that include excellent new features. You don’t have to store your images in the cloud. And so on.

As far as I’m concerned Photoshop went from a product I had to buy a massive upgrade to every 18-24 months to one that gets upgraded regularly though not as massively in each iteration because those happen more frequently now. I’ve looked at how much I was paying on average in the old Creative Suite version versus what I’m now paying on average per year with Creative Cloud. If anything the Creative Cloud option seems to be a few dollars less expensive when averaged out over five-year periods.

Your mileage may vary of course as you might not have been updating every time like I was and you might be paying more for the cloud version depending upon where you live and what options you’ve selected.

Still my first conclusive statement to the headline’s question is this: Photoshop is still iterating still getting better still the best tool overall and oh it also comes with Bridge and Lightroom Classic and some cloud storage space too. As long as things continue as they are with Creative Cloud Adobe has me as a customer. Given my advancing age that’s probably for life.

That’s far less true of any other equivalent software product.

Capture One

Capture One’s latest “re-pricing and revising” is a good example. Capture One would love to have the same customer base and loyalty as Adobe. Well actually not so much that as wanting the same predictable and profitable revenue stream. Once customers are bought into a SaaS (software as a service) subscription you have a predictable revenue stream and can match development costs against that more easily. But it also makes it a little more difficult to do promotions to “juice the coffers” (because your subscribers will complain about not getting the same deal).

That’s put Capture One—and others read on—in a tough spot. They’ve conditioned themselves on using a constant stream of marketing promotions affiliate commission programs attempts at segmenting (version for only one brand) and a raft of commercial presets to keep the money stream coming and fuel their “keep up with Adobe” aspirations. All while keeping their Axcel Fund owners happy. That’s right Capture One has a venture fund partner (Axcel V fund) that owns 56%. On Axcel’s pages you’ll find statements like “Our proven Accelerating Value Creation model…” and “sharpen the commercial focus.” You are the product.

Axcel’s actual customer is not you. It’s corporate private investors asset managers pension funds life insurers banks and financial institutions. I have little doubt that Capture One’s ongoing changes to their business model are tweaking and tuning driven by Axcel.

Is that a bad thing? It’s difficult to tell but something’s a little amiss methinks.

For example the current annual cost of the Adobe Creative Cloud Photography Plan is $120 per year. Capture One Pro’s similar plan is $179 per year (substantially more if you pay month to month). We’ve had 15 major revisions of Capture One in its lifetime even though the current version is numbered 23. Looking at the things added in each major version I’d say that feature-wise Capture One is still in “catch up” mode to Photoshop/Lightroom though getting closer recently.

The problem I have is that I feel like Capture One is trying to get more money for less. Their iPad version for instance requires another $4.99 per month subscription. Capture One Pilot is a smart device tethering program that yes costs another $14.99 (not a subscription but what is the likelihood that it converts to a subscription at some point?).

The latest customer-unfriendly thing Capture One has done—and this isn’t their first time at the slap-the-user bar—is to make their perpetual license version ($299 with “reduced price [33% off] every time you upgrade” [sic]) no longer receive feature upgrades for a period of time (was one year).

Disclaimer: As of today the Capture One Web site still says that perpetual license users still get “minor software updates included.” That will change on February 1 2023.

Nothing is different in Capture One’s attempt to move to SaaS subscriptions than Adobe’s. We’re seeing the same negative feedback. That’s to be expected. But again my primary complaint is that I feel that Capture One is offering somewhat less for more money than Adobe now. I just don’t see the value proposition though obviously Axcel does.

My best guess is that attempting to make the change from perpetual to SaaS is going to cost Capture One customers. I’m pretty sure they’ll lose me as it makes no sense to pay more for less.

Disclaimer: I was almost convinced via extended one-on-one training with Capture One to make the change from Photoshop. Almost. There’s much to like about their approach particularly when it comes to color model. But in the end it was “too little for too much” for me. Your mileage may vary.

Skylum Luminar

We have other players that are effectively SaaS wannabes now: Luminar is attempting the $119 annual subscription but retains the $249 perpetual license. Of course that’s almost never what you actually pay. As I write this the Luminar Neo license is $99 for a year and the perpetual license is $149. Skylum (Luminar’s maker) even seems to be confused themselves because the $99 subscription appears to include nothing extra while the $149 perpetual license does. They’re totally confused now in their marketing campaigns plus they’re a well-known affiliate commission provider and have multi-times-a-year sales. I have no idea how much you’ll pay for Neo.

Of course we’ve also had Luminar Luminar 2018 Luminar 3 Luminar Flex Luminar 4 and now Luminar Neo which seems to indicate that they either don’t know how to develop and name an ongoing product or that they are using naming confusion to trigger new sales of ostensibly similar products. Personally I’m no longer impressed by Skylum’s products. Both the products and their marketing of them seem gimmicky to me. Personally I’d love to just have their Intensify plug-in back (no longer runs properly in some Photoshop/macOS installations). I tended to use that plug-in over the Nik Color Efex Pro one for some tonality changes.

ON1 Photo RAW

ON1 is another possibility. The basic ON1 Photo RAW subscription is $90 billed annually or $8 a month. The perpetual license is $99 (often discounted) but doesn’t include their plug-in suite. The plug-in suite is $150 perpetual (often discounted). Then there’s their 1TB cloud storage option but they seem to have backed off of clearly explaining why you might want that (hint: mobile devices). At least their pricing strategy isn’t “more than Adobe for less.” (Clicking on the “Mobile” icon on their Web page at first didn’t seem to do anything: that’s because nothing changes in the above-the-fold view with certain browser window sizes; the additional information is below the fold and you have to scroll to it.)

I’m not overly impressed by the ON1 Photo RAW program itself though. It feels a little disorganized has a great deal of UI clutter with no clear theme their automatic masking tends to need lots of adjustments and I don’t like their hidden panel style. But the product works reasonably well these days.

Meanwhile their plug-in suite caters to those who love to browse through hundreds of presets. There are actually a couple that I like for specific things in the suite which is enough to have me leave it installed in my Photoshop Filters menu. But it’s not a great value. I don’t get $150 of value from it (I paid less through one of their many promotions).

DxO PhotoLab

Next up we have DxO PhotoLab 6. It’s a perpetual license program ($219 currently though discounts are available from time to time). I must admit that I kind of like PhotoLab these days. It’s approachable deep in features yet broadly applies things automatically and I find it very consistent across different camera models. That was their whole approach in the first place: figure out what the photo should be (sans vignetting and linear distortion and apply a consistent color/tonal model) and just apply that.

These days DxO PhotoLab seems to get a major update about once a year so keeping it current can be more expensive than an Adobe Photographer’s Plan if you don’t watch their promotion pricing carefully.

Serif Affinity Photo

Finally we have the program that you should pay more attention to if you’re really looking for value. That’s Serif’s Affinity Photo. Serif has Photoshop (Photo) Illustrator (Designer) and InDesign (Publisher) knockoffs that are extremely good and only available through perpetual licenses.

Photo has just gone from Photo to Photo 2 (as have the other Serif products). Regularly priced at $70 there’s an introductory discount of 40% off through January 25 2023 and an “all products all platforms” offer of $99. That’s Photo 2 Designer 2 and Publisher 2 on macOS Windows and iPadOS. Yikes. Take that Adobe. While Photo 2 still doesn’t quite match the current Photoshop CC 2023 in features all the basic Photoshop capabilities are there including compatibility with PSD files layers blend modes focus merge extensive masking non-destructive editing and more.

So here’s a suggestion: if you’re worried about your Photoshop CC capabilities when your subscription ends make sure you have a Photo 2 perpetual license. While they’ve raised their prices a bit with their new versions A Photoshop near equivalent for $70 is still a bargain right? Moreover Serif hasn’t been trolling their user base for constant upgrading. Photo lasted from 2015 until 2022 after all.

So there you have it. Some basic thoughts on where we’re at with photo editing tools at the moment. I’ll update my software recommendations page early in 2023.

The data necessary to develop the new application was provided by Dr. Marcin Dyderski from the Institute of Dendrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The co-authors were Sonia Paź from the Poznań University of Life Sciences Lee E. Frelich from the University of Minnesota in the US and Andrzej M. Jagodziński from the Institute of Dendrology PAS. The app itself was created pro bono by Appsilon as part of the Data for Good initiative.

Dr. Dyderski's research shows that the most important factors that will determine the occurrence of specific tree species in specific places by 2070 are: the temperature amplitude during the year the average temperature of the hottest quarter the maximum temperature of the hottest month and the amount of precipitation in warmest quarter. The key factor responsible for the highly probable disappearance of endangered tree species is water deficit during the growing season.

Marcin Dyderski told PAP that the app is designed to increase awareness of the coming changes in nature and help professionals who develop forest management and nature conservation strategies.

He said: “We have intentionally added a layer with the ranges of forest inspectorates to our app so that it can be used by forest management professionals in Poland. We will feed further data to the already available application and show various dependencies. This way we will expand the knowledge base on the ranges of trees and create even more detailed forecasts.”

He added that when trying to predict how specific tree species would behave over the next 50 years he relied on the information contained in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

He continued: “In our research we took into account 19 features describing the climate in Europe which are based on monthly temperature and precipitation values. In the forecasts we assumed three climate change scenarios from the IPCC AR5 report - optimistic (assuming that by 2100 the temperature will increase by an average of 0 2-1.8 degrees) moderate (1-2.6 degrees increase) and pessimistic (2.6-4.8 degrees).”

The scientists divided the trees into three groups: 'winners' - species that will grow unhindered 'losers' that will lose more than 50 percent of their existing habitats and non-native species - North American species planted in forests that may expand or shrink their potential ranges in particular regions.

According to data the trees least resistant to climate change will include pine birch spruce and larch while trees such as ash fir oak and beech will cope well. This does not mean however that a vacuum will remain in the place of extinct species.

Dr. Dyderski said: “These forecasts are subject to uncertainty because they only take the climate effect into account. Theoretically ash is the species that should resist climate change but we already know that a fungus has appeared in Europe that is wreaking havoc - and we do not know how well ash will resist it. There may be many similar events.”

Despite the uncertainty accompanying long-term forecasts the researcher explains some of the scientists' findings have a high level of certainty. We know which species suffer the most due to climate change so protective measures in managed forests must be introduced immediately. One solution already being introduced is to apply the strategy of 'risk spreading' to more species.

He said: “We need +assisted migration+ i.e. the introduction of for example southern populations of native species in managed forests. A strategy of species dispersion can also be used - i.e. promote of highly diverse species compositions in new forest plantations.

“The goal is to introduce more tree species (at least three species) that we know to coexist well. For example oaks and beeches can be planted next to pine trees. When there is a problem with one species the second or third one will maintain the primary function: it will create forest cover provide ecosystem services and produce timber.”

Changes related to replacing pine or spruce with deciduous species will significantly affect the functioning of forests. The availability of light will decrease and the rate of matter circulation will increase and the forest's capacity to retain water and buffer temperature will increase.

Dyderski said: “Species of undergrowth plants fungi and animals associated with conifers will be less common and there will be more species associated with deciduous trees.”

The team are now testing 10 native tree species that could be used to help increase the resistance of forests to climate change.

Dyderski said: “In the case of native species we are able to predict their behaviour when introduced to different areas. In the case of alien species we will not know all the dependencies. For example we do not know what the interaction with native species of herbivores and pathogens will be. There is a danger that insects that feed on leaves will not want to eat the new species right away and this will cause its uncontrolled spread - just like it happened in the case of the American black cherry.”

Note: This review was first published on 13 December 2022.

Time for Team Red to play

Ladies and gentlemen Team Red has entered the match.

With the new Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT graphics cards officially launching today AMD has joined NVIDIA in a two-way battle for the hearts and minds (and wallets) of PC gamers.

We have already covered the technology behind both card and the RDNA 3 microarchitecture powering it so be sure to read it here first if you have not.

While both RX 7900 cards are claimed to be powerful enough to provide 4K maxed-out gaming AMD says it is offering this capability at a much lower price. Broadly speaking AMD is not touting its latest RDNA 3-based cards as the fastest or most powerful options that compete with NVIDIA’s flagship GeForce RTX 4090. The company literally wants you to know that it may not have the most expensive and most powerful graphics card for you but it might have a powerful graphics card that won’t cost an arm and leg and still gives you the kind of performance befitting a next-gen GPU.

You see while Team Green’s top-of-the-line RTX 4090 is priced north of US$1599 AMD feels that the bulk of the serious gamers are really going to shell their money for top-tier cards within the US$1000 budget threshold. That’s why they have priced the 7900 XTX and 7900 XT at US$999 and US$899 respectively. Incredulously this also means that unlike NVIDIA which has raised the prices of its cards over the last three generations AMD has kept the pricing of its 7900 series in line with the 6900 counterparts.

The key question is at US$999 does the Radeon RX 7900 XTX offer better performance and value over the more expensive US$1199 RTX 4080? In this review we intend to find out exactly that.

Meanwhile let’s have a look at the card’s specifications.

But first let’s talk about the Radeon RX 7900 XTX reference card.

An evolved reference design

Unlike NVIDIA’s RTX 40 series Founders Edition which looks very overly engineered with its supersized build to house an equally supersized cooling system AMD has a more traditional approach to its reference-design graphics cards. To be clear NVIDIA’s founders edition cards are not reference-design cards but rather a first-party custom design that the company sells to gamers under the NVIDIA brand.

The Radeon RX 7900 XTX reference design is an evolution of the Radeon RX 6900 series. The two-tone silver and black on the older 6900 makes way for a mostly-black scheme with some gunmetal accents. The cooler shroud and backplate are made entirely of a die-cast aluminium alloy and have a solid premium feel. While the looks and aesthetics may be subjective the build quality of these cards is right in the league of NVIDIA's Founders Edition cards in my opinion.

Unlike NVIDIA’s commitment to a single-cable 16-pin 12VHPWR connector AMD has stuck with the standard dual 8-pin PCIe power connectors (see above image) on the card. No adapters are required. But like NVIDIA AMD has also stuck with a PCIe 4.0 interface on its RDNA 3 cards as AMD engineers acknowledged that the interface has plenty of bandwidth and isn't necessary to move on to PCIe 5.0.

That said it's not all “old” tech that AMD has stuck with. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX gets two full-size DisplayPort 2.1 connectors beside an HDMI 2.1b and a USB-C with DP 2.1 passthrough. NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are still on the older DisplayPort 1.4a standard which while it's not outdated and is still sufficient to pair with displays that are on the market now AMD's updated display connectivity options are designed to pair with the industry's latest and speedier screens that will come out in 2023.

Now that you have had a good overview of the Radeon RX 7900 XTX let’s check out the card’s performance on the next page."

This call for conservation was brought on by increased demand due to the snow and near-zero temperatures.

PJM Senior Vice President of Operations Mike Bryson took to Twitter explaining the importance of these energy conservation efforts.

AES Ohio is requesting that its customers limit their electricity use voluntarily from Christmas Eve until 10 a.m. on December 25.



Here are a few ways that customers can conserve energy:

-Set thermostat slightly lower than usual if your health permits.

-Delay the use of major electric appliances such as stoves dishwashers and dryers.

-Turn off non-essential lights equipment and appliances.

“We sincerely appreciate the cooperation and patience of our customers who can help ensure the stability and reliability of the system for all by taking these steps” said Kristina Lund president and CEO AES Ohio. “Public conservation can make a difference and every little bit counts.”

If additional actions are required AES Ohio would begin emergency temporary interruptions of service to customers to extend available power generation and help maintain operations until additional power is available.

These brief outages would alternate between customers and last until more electricity became available and the power grid began to function normally.

With rows of Victorians squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder it’s a far cry from the megamansions on oversized lots in Pacific Heights.

Chesky’s neighborhood? Dolores Heights or in Chesky’s words a residential neighborhood “near the Mission Castro and Noe Valley neighborhoods with plenty of great boutiques restaurants and coffee shops.”

When Airbnb CEO and founder Brian Chesky listed his home on Airbnb in November the entrepreneur who’s worth $7 billion  disclosed the San Francisco neighborhood he lives in . And it’s not anywhere near Billionaires’ Row in Pac Heights known for its A-list of tech and old money residents from the Getty family to Larry Ellison .

The inside of Chesky’s home is nice but it’s no Birch Castle the home of tech entrepreneurs Michael and Xochi Birch whose luxe and lacquered Pac Heights mansion features a bar reclaimed from a decommissioned British pub. Instead it has the light airy West Elm-chic look that Airbnb helped make ubiquitous. There’s a normal-sized kitchen and his golden retriever is allowed to sit on his squishy-looking gray couch. According to the Airbnb listing you even have to share a bathroom.

Other technorati live nearby. Until he sold his home for $31 million earlier this year Mark Zuckerberg’s pied-à-terre was in Dolores Heights.

Instagram founder Mike Krieger and his family also live in the neighborhood as well as a coterie of other early Facebook employees.

Zuckerberg’s entrance into the neighborhood 15 years ago was a turning point said Bernie Katzmann a real estate agent who has lived in Dolores Heights for 25 years. He personally knows of several billionaires in the neighborhood though he won’t name names.

“The changes really started when Zuckerberg bought his house” he said. “A lot of people suddenly started recognizing that it’s a beautiful area. That’s what really started the migration to the area and it’s become a much wealthier area than it was.”

Prior to that Dolores Heights was a family-friendly and modest neighborhood recalls Carolyn Kenady who chairs the Dolores Heights Improvement Club the area’s neighborhood association.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3RoZS1ob2xpZGF5LWNvdHRhZ2Uta2F0ZS13aW5zbGV0LWFpcmJuYi0zNzIwNDM0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Now Rent the Cottage From “The Holiday” on Airbnb,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-holiday-cottage-kate-winslet-airbnb-37204346 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3RoZS1ob2xpZGF5LWNvdHRhZ2Uta2F0ZS13aW5zbGV0LWFpcmJuYi0zNzIwNDM0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2NvdWxkLWFpcmJuYi1zdG9jay1yZWNvdmVyLWluLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Airbnb Stock Recover in 2023?,"Recession worries have led to a massive sell-off of Airbnb stock.

It has been a tough year for vacation rental giant Airbnb (ABNB -0.50%). The general bear market and growing pessimism about the future of travel spending have pushed the stock down 49% year to date.

With 2022 coming to an end many investors are wondering if Airbnb will fall further in the new year or if it's headed for a recovery in 2023. Let's take a closer look and see.

A closer look at Airbnb today

Airbnb is the largest vacation rental listing platform in the world with over 4 million hosts offering short- and long-term stays in virtually every country. Despite the stock's beaten-up share price the home-sharing platform had one of its best years ever. The return of travel in 2021 and 2022 helped its revenue earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and net income grow in the double digits year over year.

Many investors were worried its massive growth would come to a screeching halt as consumers slowed spending. After all travel is often one of the first things people cut back on if budgets are tightening. But travel spending remains high. As of the third quarter of 2022 nightly bookings were up 25% compared to the year before and 2022 holiday travel is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels.

Many young start-ups like Airbnb aren't profitable in the first few years. But Airbnb is already wildly profitable. The company has grown its free cash flow by 519% since its IPO while growing its operating margins by 138%. This puts the company in a strong position to maintain healthy growth in 2023 and beyond but that doesn't mean its share price will reflect that.

2023 could be a mixed bag

The stock is down roughly 50% year to date through no fault of its own. In fact the company repeatedly beat earnings estimates and delivered absolutely stellar growth for shareholders. But general sentiment from investors on the outlook of the economy and markets often guides share-price movement more than the actual performance of the company. That means 2023 could be another tough year for Airbnb if recession worries continue or if a recession actually ensues.

The Motley Fool takes a long-term approach to investing recommending investors buy and hold stocks for five years or more. Airbnb is no exception to this rule. The stock could have a tough year ahead but if we think long-term about the future of this vacation rental platform then a recovery seems inevitable.

It has plenty of cash on hand to cover its operations in the near future; even if a recession were to negatively impact travel spending. It's also releasing new features like Airbnb Categories and AirCover to promote its listings and gain more bookings. New strategies for attracting and retaining guests should help it sustain its earnings and growth over the long term.

Airbnb is also benefiting from a growing number of long-term renters on the platform thanks to remote working. In the third quarter of 2022 stays over one month long accounted for roughly 20% of its bookings. These bookings aren't something that would likely stop in the event of a recession.

Right now it trades around 27 times its forward earnings which is a steal of a deal compared to other high-growth tech stocks which have price-to-earnings ratios ranging from 30 times to as much as 220 times their forward earnings. I personally believe today's low share price makes for an excellent opportunity to buy this high-growth stock. Just remain patient with its timeline for share-price recovery. If all goes well for Airbnb it could make investors a fortune over the next decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2Zhc2hpb25pc3Rhcy10aHJvdy13aWxkLWFmZmFpci1hdC1haXJibmItZGFtYWdlLTEyMGstcGlhbm8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fashion insiders throw wild bash at pricey Airbnb 'damage' $120K piano,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nypost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/12/23/fashionistas-throw-wild-affair-at-airbnb-damage-120k-piano/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227842050>, 'Connection to nypost.com timed out.

Upon arrival Ms Angaman went to take a shower to freshen up. Later in the night at around 03:00 she went to the bathroom. She then noticed a digital clock which was directly facing the shower.

She told BFMTV: “After investigating it a bit I realised that there was a sort of circle there like you get on cameras.”

She then woke her partner and together they took the clock apart to reveal a camera inside with an SD card attached.

She said: “It was really lecherous because it was facing right towards the shower.”

After searching the rest of the apartment the friends discovered another similar device on a piece of furniture in the bedroom. The camera was positioned so you could see the bed.

Ms Angaman then decided to take the SD cards and look at them on her computer. She found a folder named “December 2022” which contained a video of her in the bathroom and videos of her friends going to the toilet.

She said: “I realised that it was completely messed up it felt like a big slap in the face.”

Ms Angaman reported the issue to the Dieppe police station and made a formal complaint. Police are now investigating. The report has also been sent to the police station in Rouen.

The cameras also have a video showing the man who installed them.

Ms Angaman said: “I don’t know if these cameras were connected by WiFi and if they could look at their view in real-time? What has this pervert done if he watched the videos? I feel dirty.

“I think about it all the time I’ve even dreamt about it! It’s so stressful.”

When contacted by 76Actu Airbnb confirmed that it had refunded the woman in full and said it was taking the incident “very seriously”.

It said: “We immediately suspended the host’s account and we will cooperate with the police in their inquiries.”

It added that it has “strict policies against using any kind of recording devices inside the properties rented on our platform and we take firm measures against anyone who breaks the rules”. It especially bans “the use of hidden surveillance devices or their use in private spaces such as the bathroom bedrooms or relaxing areas”.

It said that “less than 0.1% of reservations give rise to a security report by hosts or travellers”.

Airbnb is often controversial in France with some cities introducing more stringent property rules against them in a bid to keep local accommodation more affordable for residents. One property developer in Annecy (Haute-Savoie) even banned Airbnb-style lets in their properties.

However Airbnb is still popular among some in France. In October the company launched a €1million eco-friendly plan in France with funds going to help hosts make sustainable renovations to their rentals.

The plan was dubbed ‘win-win’ by the French government.

It will also set a target year for achieving a net zero investment portfolio by the end of 2025. These actions are essential to managing climate risk and fulfilling Allstate’s purpose of protecting customers and generating attractive returns for shareholders.

Allstate’s pledge means it will exceed by 20 years the 2050 net zero target set in the Paris climate accords. It also reflects Allstate’s decades-long history of integrating strong environmental principles and practices into its business strategy while building community resilience and helping customers prepare for and recover from climate-related catastrophes.

"" For 25 years Allstate has worked to strengthen resilience to increased severe weather caused by global warming through prevention preparedness and risk reduction"" said Tom Wilson Chair President and CEO of The Allstate Corporation. "" As the severity of hurricanes tornadoes and wildfires has increased the negative impacts on customers shareholders and society have also grown. To supplement our short-term remediation initiatives we are making net zero emissions commitments that are tangible and reasonable.""

The company will accomplish its 2030 net zero goals by reducing the emissions and square footage of Allstate’s offices purchasing renewable energy where possible working to reduce emissions of suppliers and removing the impact of remaining real estate through the limited purchase of credible carbon offsets where available.

Allstate’s responsible investing strategy already includes a dedicated impact portfolio that supports climate change mitigation and adaptation targeting at least $375 million in climate-related commitments between 2021 and 2022.

The company will publicly share progress on emissions goals through its annual sustainability reporting available at Allstate’s sustainability website. Details on Allstate’s climate strategy can be found in its 2021 Sustainability Report.

AWS’ recent win of a five-year enterprise software license contract which was awarded by the United States Navy remains noteworthy. This highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS' innovative cloud products and services.



Notably the contract will provide the U.S. Navy access to AWS’ commercial cloud environment and professional services. It will also be able to avail AWS training and certification courses.



This $723.9 million deal comes right after the Pentagon’s recent declaration of Amazon Alphabet GOOGL Microsoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL as the winners of the multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract for the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability.

Portfolio Strength – Key Catalyst

AWS’s growing efforts toward expanding its portfolio offerings are likely to continue adding strength to its customer base.



Recently AWS introduced a new data management service namely Amazon DataZone which eases the data management process and enables data producers to govern data access seamlessly.



Further the company bolstered its ML strength by introducing eight new capabilities for Amazon SageMaker namely Role Manager Model Cards Model Dashboard new data preparation collaboration across data science teams automated model validation geospatial capabilities and Automatic conversion of notebook code into production-ready jobs.



The company announced a new service called Amazon Security Lake which is a purpose-built security data lake. It automatically centralizes an organization’s security data from cloud and on-premises sources into a purpose-built data lake.



It also announced a fully managed compute service namely AWS SimSpace Weaver that enables customers to deploy spatial simulations to model dynamic systems with many data points.



Further it announced a new cloud application called AWS Supply Chain which provides improved supply chain visibility to businesses.



Additionally it introduced a new analytics service called AWS Clean Rooms that helps customers analyze and collaborate on collective datasets without revealing underlying data.

Bottom Line

We believe that portfolio strength will continue to drive AWS’ customer momentum which in turn will aid Amazon in sustaining its cloud dominance. This will instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.



Notably Amazon has lost 43.6% on a year-to-date basis.



Recently AWS was selected by Yahoo as the preferred public cloud provider for the latter’s advertising technology business Yahoo Ad Tech.



Further it was picked by Brookfield Asset Management as the preferred cloud provider. Also Stability AI selected AWS as the preferred cloud provider. With the aid of AWS’s robust portfolio of cloud technologies and global infrastructure Stability AI strives to build and scale its AI models.



We believe that the expanding customer base will continue to drive AWS’s top-line growth. In third-quarter 2022 AWS generated revenues of $20.5 billion (16% of total sales) which grew 27% year over year.



Further expanding its portfolio and customer base will likely continue to aid Amazon currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in gaining a competitive edge against its peers Microsoft Alphabet’s Google and Oracle which are also making strong efforts to strengthen cloud footprint.



You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.



According to the Canalys report AWS accounted for 32% of global cloud spending in third-quarter 2022 maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.



Microsoft’s Azure which is currently riding on the robust adoption of its cloud offerings increasing number of global availability zones and regions and strength in its consumption-based business was marked as the second-largest cloud-service provider as it accounted for 22% of worldwide cloud spending.



Alphabet’s Google Cloud which is strongly gaining from a solid portfolio expanding data centers availability zones and cloud regions represented 9% of cloud spending making it the third-largest cloud provider.



Meanwhile Oracle continues to benefit from the solid momentum across its cloud business driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management remains a positive.

Google’s India advertisement revenue is likely to continue to see strong growth country head Sanjay Gupta said underlining the US search giant’s optimism for the South Asian market even as globally the company along with major online intermediaries is witnessing a slowdown on that key metric.“I think India will explode in terms of revenues because the ad-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio in India is still very low. It's 0.4%” Gupta told ET. “Globally it goes up 0.6 to 1%. So I think it (India ad revenue) is in a growth phase. I think if we deliver to our customers hopefully our revenue should also grow as the advertisement expenditure grows in this country.” Google India has tailored its advertisement offerings in such a way that it is able to serve both small and big customers which has served well in increasing the ad sales in the country the senior executive said.For the financial year 2021-22 Google India had posted revenue of Rs 24926.5 crore  a jump of nearly 80% from the previous year. Competitor Facebook India's online services had clocked gross ad revenue of Rs 16189 crore up 74% on-year during the same period.But according to global forecasts the growth of advertising space sales online will slow down in 2023 on the back of a cut down in discretionary spending by big tech companies due to the global economic uncertainty.Among major markets however India is likely to remain the outlier. Most experts expect the country’s advertising market to grow between 14% and 17% in 2023.Global advertising and marketing agency Dentsu believes that the Indian ad market will grow 18.1% in 2022 after a 39.4% expansion in the first half of the year.Overall digital ad sales will continue to remain a key driver of the Indian advertising market with nearly 32% growth and may also overtake television advertisement growth the agency said in a report.Advertising conglomerate WPP ’s media investment arm GroupM has in a report said the Indian advertising market is likely to grow 16.8% in 2023 Globally GroupM expects “advertising to grow 5.9% with strong gains in connected TV retail media and fast-growing markets like India”.“This figure represents a slight downgrade from the 6.4% estimate we shared in June but barring an escalation to the war in Ukraine or another pandemic-sized global disaster we expect growth to climb in 2024 to 6.2% before returning to a trend of decelerating mid-single-digit growth through 2027” the agency’s December 5 report said."

The share of US ad revenues held by Facebook’s parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014 according to research group Insider Intelligence.

This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide Meta and Alphabet’s share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.

Jerry Dischler head of ads at Google told the Financial Times that fierce rivalry from new entrants reflects an “extremely dynamic ad market.”

Regulators in the US and Europe have added antitrust scrutiny such as pursuing Google for allegedly promoting its products over rivals.

In December Facebook owner Meta was served with a complaint from the EU’s watchdogs over concerns that the social network’s classified advert service is unfair to rivals. Tech groups are fighting harder than ever for a share of the $300 billion digital ads market even as companies worldwide are cutting their ad budgets in response to rising interest rates and high inflation.

Amazon and Apple have expanded their advertising teams. In July Netflix announced it would partner with Microsoft to build an advertisement-supported tier of its streaming service.

Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has blamed recent revenue falls on Apple’s privacy changes that make it harder to track users and target advertising as well as the growing popularity of viral videos app TikTok owned by Chinese parent ByteDance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2FtYXpvbnMtYW16bi1hd3MtYm9vc3RzLXByb3NwZWN0cy0xNzU3MDU3MzQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon's (AMZN) AWS Boosts Prospects With Navy Contract Win,"Amazon AMZN continues to ride on strengthening Amazon Web Services (""AWS"") offerings which are constantly driving the company's cloud customer momentum.



AWS’ recent win of a five-year enterprise software license contract which was awarded by the United States Navy remains noteworthy. This highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS' innovative cloud products and services.



Notably the contract will provide the U.S. Navy access to AWS’ commercial cloud environment and professional services. It will also be able to avail AWS training and certification courses.



This $723.9 million deal comes right after the Pentagon’s recent declaration of Amazon Alphabet GOOGL Microsoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL as the winners of the multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract for the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability.

Portfolio Strength – Key Catalyst

AWS’s growing efforts toward expanding its portfolio offerings are likely to continue adding strength to its customer base.



Recently AWS introduced a new data management service namely Amazon DataZone which eases the data management process and enables data producers to govern data access seamlessly.



Further the company bolstered its ML strength by introducing eight new capabilities for Amazon SageMaker namely Role Manager Model Cards Model Dashboard new data preparation collaboration across data science teams automated model validation geospatial capabilities and Automatic conversion of notebook code into production-ready jobs.



The company announced a new service called Amazon Security Lake which is a purpose-built security data lake. It automatically centralizes an organization’s security data from cloud and on-premises sources into a purpose-built data lake.



It also announced a fully managed compute service namely AWS SimSpace Weaver that enables customers to deploy spatial simulations to model dynamic systems with many data points.



Further it announced a new cloud application called AWS Supply Chain which provides improved supply chain visibility to businesses.



Additionally it introduced a new analytics service called AWS Clean Rooms that helps customers analyze and collaborate on collective datasets without revealing underlying data.

Bottom Line

We believe that portfolio strength will continue to drive AWS’ customer momentum which in turn will aid Amazon in sustaining its cloud dominance. This will instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.



Notably Amazon has lost 43.6% on a year-to-date basis.



Recently AWS was selected by Yahoo as the preferred public cloud provider for the latter’s advertising technology business Yahoo Ad Tech.



Further it was picked by Brookfield Asset Management as the preferred cloud provider. Also Stability AI selected AWS as the preferred cloud provider. With the aid of AWS’s robust portfolio of cloud technologies and global infrastructure Stability AI strives to build and scale its AI models.



We believe that the expanding customer base will continue to drive AWS’s top-line growth. In third-quarter 2022 AWS generated revenues of $20.5 billion (16% of total sales) which grew 27% year over year.



Further expanding its portfolio and customer base will likely continue to aid Amazon currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in gaining a competitive edge against its peers Microsoft Alphabet’s Google and Oracle which are also making strong efforts to strengthen cloud footprint.



You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.



According to the Canalys report AWS accounted for 32% of global cloud spending in third-quarter 2022 maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.



Microsoft’s Azure which is currently riding on the robust adoption of its cloud offerings increasing number of global availability zones and regions and strength in its consumption-based business was marked as the second-largest cloud-service provider as it accounted for 22% of worldwide cloud spending.



Alphabet’s Google Cloud which is strongly gaining from a solid portfolio expanding data centers availability zones and cloud regions represented 9% of cloud spending making it the third-largest cloud provider.



Meanwhile Oracle continues to benefit from the solid momentum across its cloud business driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management remains a positive.

(Unless you’re “feeling lucky” that is.)

You enter a word or a single letter and Google will populate the search box with a list of “predictions” before you’ve even finished typing. This Google feature is called Autocomplete.

But what exactly is it? How does Google come up with those predictions? Read on to find out how Google Autocomplete works.

What is Google Autocomplete?

Autocomplete is a feature within Google Search that in Google’s own words is “designed to make it faster to complete searches that you’re beginning to type.”

Starting as an experimental feature in 2004 it was fully introduced four years later as Google Suggest and was renamed Autocomplete in 2010.

It is available anywhere you can expect to find a Google search box including:

The Google home page.

The Google app for iOS and Android.

The quick search box from within Android.

The “Omnibox” address bar within Chrome.

Begin typing and you’ll see predictions appear.

In the screengrab above you can see that by typing “new y” Google brings up predictions such as “new york times” or “new york Yankees.”

This makes it easy to finish entering your search on these topics without typing all the letters. The predictions change in real-time in response to each character being typed into the search box.

The user then has the option to continue typing their desired query or choose from the dropdown selection.

But if you know what you’re searching for why do you need Google to tell you?

It saves time. While Autocomplete began as a desktop search feature all those years ago it has become a popular time-saving feature on mobile devices.

Google estimates that cumulatively it saves the equivalent of over 200 years of typing every single day and on average reduces typing overall by about 25%.

How Google Autocomplete works

Google Search doesn’t quite know how to read minds. Instead it makes calculated predictions by looking at searches made by real people.

Autocomplete displays common and trending queries relevant to the characters entered into the search bar.

Here are some key factors used by Autocomplete to predict search queries:

Overall popularity.

Trending topics.

Search history.

Location.

Put simply the results shown are influenced by things you’ve previously searched for the location you’re searching from and the search term data that Google has gathered – using all of this data to automatically predict what you’re looking for.

Let’s take a closer look at each factor.

The popularity of search queries

When it comes to predicting search queries popularity often walks hand in hand with what’s trending. But trends can fade over time whereas one or more subjects might always be commonly linked together.

While some searches are far more common than others some less popular searches might be shown above more common ones if Google deems them more relevant the company says. In short personalized > popular.

Trending searches

We’ve all heard of Google Trends the website that analyzes the popularity of top search queries across various regions and languages. Well this isn’t that.

A current trending search is a term or phrase that suddenly spikes in popularity. As people flock to Google to ask the same question the query can appear as a suggestion even if it hasn’t gained long-term popularity.

Google uses the following example to explain:

When actress Anna Paquin was getting married “Anna Paquin wedding” began appearing as a suggestion just before her big day. The term was useful to suggest as many people were starting to search for it.

If Google had relied solely on long-term data then the “suggestion” wouldn’t have appeared as an option in the search box as it hadn’t widely been searched for previously.

And today Autocomplete no longer offers the term as it didn’t harness enough long-term popularity (though “Anna Paquin married” has stuck).

Previous search queries

The predictions dropdown list will include a variation of topics and questions depending on who is doing the searching. To speed up the search process and identify what you might be looking for Google sifts through your past searches.

In the example below you can recognize that a previous search result appears because the text is highlighted in purple.

On desktop you’ll also see the word “Remove” appear next to the prediction which you can click if you want to delete the past search.

However on mobile things look a little different. You’ll see a clock icon on the left for previous searches and an X button on the right to remove it.

You can also delete all your previous searches in bulk or by particular dates or those matching particular terms using My Activity in your Google Account regardless of the device you use to search.

Language and location

With a service that seems so personalized it’s perhaps no surprise that not everyone receives the same suggestions. Among the factors that can tailor your experience is the language you’re searching in and the location you’re searching from.

The country the state or province and even the city can all produce different suggestions – whether it’s where you currently live or are originally from.

Different suggestions will also appear if you’ve told Google that you prefer to search in a particular language or based on the language Google assumes you use as determined by your browser’s settings.

Why are some predictions removed?

Google outlines that Autocomplete makes “predictions” rather than “suggestions.”

This could be due to several controversial and legal claims previously made which suggested that Google was promoting harmful offensive and/or inaccurate information by suggesting certain search queries.

When rebranding in October 2010 Google moved away from “Suggest” since it’s not always offering the most thoughtful caring or appropriate term.

The company prefers to use “predictions” and is committed to bettering the service by taking on feedback and monitoring searches.

In addition Autocomplete is designed to help people complete a search they intended to do. The feature offers predictions based on the query you were likely to continue entering.

While the results show depend on several factors outlined above Google removes predictions that are against its autocomplete policies which block:

Sexually explicit predictions that do not cover or relate to medical scientific or sex education topics.

Hateful predictions against groups and individuals based on race religion sexuality or other demographics.

Violent or harmful predictions.

Dangerous and harmful activity in predictions.

Google may also remove predictions considered spam closely associated with piracy or in response to valid legal requests.

How do inappropriate Autocomplete predictions happen?

While Google has systems designed to automatically catch inappropriate predictions the search engine processes billions of daily searches.

Billions of searches mean billions of predictions which means that sometimes inappropriate predictions can slip through the net.

While some predictions may seem odd shocking or make you question why someone might want to search for it looking at the actual search results generated sometimes provides needed context.

In some cases the search results themselves may make it clearer that predictions don’t necessarily reflect awful opinions which some people may hold but instead may come from those seeking specific content that’s not problematic.

This is why popular searches measured in our Google Trends tool might not appear as predictions within Autocomplete.

Google Trends is a tool designed as a way for anyone to research the popularity of search topics over time regardless of the search intent.

How to report inappropriate Autocomplete predictions

If you spot something which doesn’t feel right makes you uncomfortable or might offend someone you can report using the “Report inappropriate predictions” link which appears below the search box on desktop.

For those searching on mobile or using the Google app for Android long press on a prediction to get a reporting option. Those using the Google app on iOS can swipe to the left to get the reporting option.

Google reassures users that they don’t just remove a reported prediction that violates their policies but also investigate closely related predictions to provide a broader solution and prevent inappropriate predictions from being made in the future.

More than just Autocomplete

Google Autocomplete benefits all types of users helping them to make searches and load pages more quickly.

Whether you’re looking to inform your marketing strategy generate content ideas research keywords or explore search intent Autocomplete can be a valuable tool.

Search and digital marketers use it to find out what people are actively searching for so they can better meet their customers’ needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLWRldmljZXMtd2VyZS1sb29raW5nLWZvcndhcmQtdG8tMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Products We're Looking Forward to in 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLWRldmljZXMtd2VyZS1sb29raW5nLWZvcndhcmQtdG8tMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ29vZ2xlLWJldHMtb24tc3Ryb25nLWFkLXJldmVudWUtZ3Jvd3RoLWluLWluZGlhL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NDM0MjY5LmNtc9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ29vZ2xlLWJldHMtb24tc3Ryb25nLWFkLXJldmVudWUtZ3Jvd3RoLWluLWluZGlhL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjQzNDI2OS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google bets on strong ad revenue growth in India,"Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit Indian School of Business Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit

On Friday Amazon said in a statement that those deliveries have begun in Lockeford as well as College Station Texas.

""Our aim is to safely introduce our drones to the skies. We are starting in these communities and will gradually expand deliveries to more customers over time"" said Natalie Banke Amazon Air spokesperson in the statement.

Exactly how many packages are being delivered by drone is unclear.

(KFVS) - Power was restored to the remaining 150 Ameren customers without power in Cape Girardeau late Friday night December 23.

This means 90 percent of those affected by the outage have power.

As of noon on Friday the city of Cape Girardeau said Ameren crews were still working to restore power originally hoping to have it fixed by 8 p.m.

According to the city they received reports of frozen water meters. To report a water issue you can call 573-339-6357.

The Shawnee Park Center in Cape Girardeau was opened for residents without power. An original post on the City of Cape Girardeau Facebook page said Osage Centre but due to a generator issue that facility was closed.

According to an Ameren spokesperson the power went out between midnight and 1:30 a.m.

He said the outage was weather-related.

According to the Cape Girardeau Fire Department they were dispatched to the intersection of N. Silver Springs Road and Independence Street around 1:35 a.m. on Friday for a transformer fire at the Ameren UE substation.

They said the fire caused the power outages to residents on the west and north sides of the city of Cape Girardeau.

The fire was contained just after 3 a.m. allowing Ameren crews to assess the damage and begin repairs.

During that time a powerline near Mt. Auburn Rd. was also reported down.

Firefighters say repairs on the line and the substation are projected to take a minimum of 4 hours as of 4:30 a.m. They said Ameren crews report that repairs could take longer due to the weather conditions and the extent of the damage.

American Airlines is vowing to work closely with law enforcement after an Alabama mother was caught on video throwing a computer monitor at one of its gate attendants at Miami International Airport this week.

Camilia McMillie had her bond set at $4500 after appearing before a judge Wednesday jail records show. The 25-year-old is charged with aggravated battery criminal mischief and disorderly conduct following the incident that unfolded Tuesday after she lost track of her children investigators said.

""Acts of violence against our team members are not tolerated by American Airlines and we are committed to working closely with law enforcement in their investigation"" the airline said in a statement. ""Our thoughts are with our team member and we are ensuring they have the support they need at this time.""

The Miami-Dade Police Department said McMillie of Birmingham was traveling to New York City and checked into her flight at gate D-39 after being rebooked for missing her previous flight.

MOTHER IN MIAMI AIRPORT HURLS COMPUTER AT AMERICAN AIRLINES WORKER AFTER LOSING KIDS: ‘WENT INTO A PANIC MODE’

""While the subject was with the gate agent her two minor children walked away without notice to use nearby restrooms"" police said in a statement. ""Once the subject noticed the children were not with her she became irate and began to scream demanding the gate agent to find her children.""

(Warning: Explicit language in tweets below)

Investigators said McMillie then ""pulled the boarding pass reader off the wooden counter damaging the equipment and countertop area"" and ""as she continued to scream she then grabbed the computer monitor and threw it at the gate agent striking her in the shoulder.""

A video captured by a witness shows the gate attendant – who is wearing festive reindeer antlers – bracing for cover as the monitor is hurled in her direction. Other footage reportedly shows McMillie knocking electronics to the ground.

A police affidavit obtained by FOX Business said the American Airlines employee suffered a bruise to her right shoulder while McMillie is believed to have caused over $10000 in damages.

Police also told FOX Business that the Florida Department of Children and Families is assisting McMillie's children.

A4A says the Bahamas is charging ""astronomical"" fees for air navigation services that far exceed the cost of providing those services. The trade group says that the Bahamas views air navigation charges as a way to exercise their sovereign right over their airspace but A4A says the excessive levies are a breach of its obligations under Article 10 of the US-Bahamas ATA.

In addition to the Bahamian government listed respondents include Bahamas-based Air Ambulance Services Ltd. Azure Aviation (Bahamas) Bahamasair Cherokee Air Golden Wings Charter (Bahamas) Inter Island Charters (Bahamas) Island Wings Ltd. KSA Charters Ltd. LeAir Charters Ltd. Performance Air (Bahamas) Southern Air Charter Trans Island Airways and Western Air Bahamas. Airlines party to the A4A complaint include American Airlines Atlas Air Delta Air Lines FedEx Express JetBlue Airways Southwest Airlines United Airlines and United Parcel Service.

""After significant engagement with the government of the Bahamas on this issue the members have not seen or received any details that confirms that Bahamas’s air navigation charges are consistent with their treaty obligations"" the complaint reads. ""Accordingly the members resort to requesting that the department exercise its authorities under IATFCPA (International Air Transport Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974) to remedy the unjustifiable unreasonably discriminatory anticompetitive activities of the Government of the Bahamas.""

Notably the A4A complaint says that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides air traffic services for Bahamian airspace via a May 2021 Air Navigation Services Agreement (ANSA). The ten-year agreement is a solid deal for the Bahamas government with the FAA not charging for services provided for operations above 6000 feet but instead a flat USD80000 annual fee for the provision of data for the Bahamian government to use in billing and collecting fees.

However the Bahamian government is also charging member airlines its own per-nautical mile distance-based fee for the provision of air traffic control services for aircraft transiting Bahamas’s airspace on a minimum takeoff weight (MTOW) basis applying the highest charges to the biggest aircraft.

""Even greater charges (on a per flight basis) are levied for aircraft that land or depart from the Bahamas"" the complaint says. ""Nothing revealed in the members’ engagement of more than a year and a half with the Bahamas indicates a reasonable correlation between the fees charged and the services provided by the Bahamas.""

A4A says member airlines pay the Bahamas government USD51.60 per nautical mile when transiting Bahamas’ airspace and USD61.00 per flight when taking off or landing there. Since the Bahamian government started charging its own fees last year A4A says its member airlines have paid approximately USD20 million.

A4A acknowledges that the fees charged by the Bahamas government are used to fund the local civil aviation authority accident investigations and build its own air navigation capacity. However the trade group says its members already pay into the FAA’s Airport and Airway Trust Fund which covers air traffic control and related facilities. They object to paying the Bahamian government for a service provided by a US agency that they already pay for. Bahamas-based airlines and other non-US carriers flying into the Bahamas are not subject to the same double-dipping regime.

The FAA says interested parties should answer the complaint in Docket DOT-OST-2022-0150 by Wednesday January 11 2023. The agency has 60 days to resolve the complaint with a 30-day extension available if required.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjEvdHJhdmVsL2hvbGlkYXktdHJhdmVsLXdpbnRlci1mbGlnaHQtZGVsYXktY2FuY2VsbGF0aW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to Know if the Winter Storm Wreaks Havoc on Your Holiday Travel (Published 2022),"Wind freezing rain and snow are predicted from the Northwest to the Northeast this week.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursday ordered the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) which sets and enforces reliability standards for the bulk power system in the U.S. Canada and part of Mexico to review existing “physical security” rules for the components of the power system.

The order which requires NERC to deliver within 120 days its report on the effectiveness and applicability of current standards and whether improvements are necessary comes amid reports of similar attacks at other sites across the country.

Earlier this year three men in Ohio pleaded guilty to planning an attack on electric substations as part of a white supremacist plot. In November shots were fired at an American Electric Power substation near Centerburg Ohio knocking out power a local news outlet reported. The FBI is also investigating a string of attacks at substations that happened in Washington and Oregon per The Seattle Times.

“One it reminds us that we need to take physical security into account just as we do cyber security” FERC Chairman Richard Glick said last week at the commission meeting cautioning that the motives for the Moore County attack and some similar incidents elsewhere remain murky and under investigation by local and state law enforcement.

“But in the meantime I think it’s a good idea and this is a good step of trying to reassess our existing physical security standards and whether changes need to be made.”

In 2014 following a sniper attack the year before on a Pacific Gas and Electric’s Metcalf substation in California FERC approved a physical security reliability standard for owners of electric transmission facilities. The standard requires utilities and other transmission owners to conduct regular risk assessments on transmission stations and substations “that if rendered inoperable or damaged could result in instability uncontrolled separation or cascading within an interconnection” Mark Hegerle director of FERC’s Division of Operation and Planning Standards told the commission.

That means facilities that could create hazards for the larger grid if they are knocked out a risk not posed by the North Carolina outages said Rachel Sherrard a spokeswoman for NERC.

“The assets in North Carolina were not individually deemed critical to the grid and the recent attack did not create an uncontrolled or cascading outage which is what the standards are designed to protect from” she said. “However this does raise the question of the need to review an event that impacts several non-critical assets that collectively can have impact beyond any single asset failure.”

Substations serve a variety of purposes including stepping down voltage from the transmission system that transports electricity across long distances to the distribution wires that bring into homes and businesses. Asked if the shootings had made Duke re-examine how it protects substations a spokeswoman said the company wouldn’t discuss specific security measures.

“We have multiple layers of security across our system that allow us to monitor and protect critical infrastructure” the spokeswoman Logan Kureczka wrote in an email. “As the largest grid operator in the country our responsibility to protect the power grid is paramount and our security evolves as threats do.”

In a statement earlier this month the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council which describes itself as the “principal liaison between leadership in the federal government and in the electric power sector” said investor-owned electric companies electric cooperatives and public power utilities “continuously monitor and prepare for threats to the grid and other infrastructure.”

The organization which coordinates efforts to guard against threats to critical infrastructure to improve the reliability and resilience of the grid said it was working with law enforcement investigating the attacks.

“Understanding what happened in North Carolina will be important to minimize future threats and to keep our industry’s defenses at the forefront” the organization said.

FERC Commissioner Mark Christie a former Virginia utility regulator said attacks on transformers the drum-shaped devices on utility poles that lower the voltage before electricity is delivered to residences and businesses are relatively common.

“They’re vulnerable to a drunk with a gun and an attitude. We have a lot of incidents of that. That’s not unusual” he said. “The substations are a different ballgame. … A transformer knocks out a block or two. A substation several tens of thousands of people.”

Noting that it was likely that NERC would come back with a recommendation to upgrade security standards Christie said he hoped the Department of Energy would find a way to use grid resilience money from the bipartisan infrastructure law to lessen the blow for electric ratepayers.

“It’s going to cost money and I hope this doesn’t all flow through to ratepayers” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3RvdjkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcG93ZXItY3Jld3MtbWFraW5nLXJlYWxseS1ncmVhdC1wcm9ncmVzcy13aXRoLW91dGFnZS1yZXN0b3JhdGlvbnPSAWJodHRwczovL3d0b3Y5LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wb3dlci1jcmV3cy1tYWtpbmctcmVhbGx5LWdyZWF0LXByb2dyZXNzLXdpdGgtb3V0YWdlLXJlc3RvcmF0aW9ucw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power crews making 'really great progress' with outage restorations,"Appalachian Power an American Electric Power company had spent several days preparing for Friday's storm.



From watching the weather forecast to updating crews and resources one of the company's concerns was extended power outages due to high winds and putting bucket trucks up in the air. But crews were able to get to work sooner than expected.

""We've been able to be out there since the beginning of the storm” AEP External Affairs Manager Joelle Moray said. “We've been right there from the moment the first outage came in. Because of that we've been able to get a real good handle on all of the outages. There were approximately 1500 customers without power earlier in the day but now that is actually down.

""Crews have already been out there since very very early (Friday) morning and they are making really great process with restoration with those who are currently out.”

Appalachian Power is currently not estimating restoration times because the high winds are expected to continue through Saturday morning.

A suburban woman found some of the American Express gift cards she had purchased and gave out had already been used or had balances missing.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Gift cards are popular holiday gifts but a suburban business woman said she was horrified to find the gift cards she purchased and gave to people didn't work.

Patricia Shelton said she bought the cards directly from the American Express gift card website.

""Each person's gift card was declined"" Shelton said.

Shelton owns a private transport business in Woodstock. She buys gift cards in bulk from American Express and every year gives them out as gifts to friends vendors and work associates.

""I wanted American Express because it's a brand name and they can do whatever they want"" she said. ""If someone wants to go to Home Goods or if they want to get their nails done or they can pay bills with it if they want.""

Recently Shelton gave out some of the gift cards while meeting business associates at a pub but those recipients told her the cards didn't have money on them.

""I wanted to crawl and hide I was so embarrassed. It looked like it had just stolen them off of a kiosk and never paid for them"" she said.

So Shelton checked the remaining gift cards which she keeps in an office safe. She said those too didn't have money on them

""I found five more. And it was mostly the $100 ones"" Shelton said.

She reached out to American Express who after completing an investigation replaced the compromised cards. But months later Shelton said she found four more without a balance. She said American Express told her they're still investigating.

Shelton said her co-worker put the card numbers into American Express's website and found out where some of the money had gone. One $100 gift card was used weeks earlier to buy a gaming app and $70 worth of Taco Bell in California. Others were used for PayPal purchases and gas.

""We gave out throughout the year $2700 or $2800 in gift cards and not everyone has the guts to say 'hey did you steal this instead of paying for it'"" she said.

American Express and a separate company InComm Payments which manages and processes American express gift cards responded to the I-Team saying they can't comment on individual customers because of privacy reasons but they ""take concerns from cardholders very seriously"" and ""We recognize the frustration Ms. Shelton has experienced.""

The companies added ""Fraud prevention is a top priority and our dedicated fraud teams are constantly monitoring for new and emerging threats so we can develop advanced methods for protecting cardholders.""

Shelton bought her cards directly through American Express's website so it's unclear how the alleged fraud occurred.

American Express reminds customers that they can also review account balances and check transactions online.

Also when buying in person consumers should inspect all gift card packaging prior to purchase and look for signs of tampering. Make sure the numbers have not been exposed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXctbWFycmlvdHQtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtb2ZmZXJzLWNvbWUtc3VwZXItY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLXBvaW50cy1hbmQtcGVya3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Marriott Credit Card Offers Come Super Charged with Points and Perks,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXctbWFycmlvdHQtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtb2ZmZXJzLWNvbWUtc3VwZXItY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLXBvaW50cy1hbmQtcGVya3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225F0BD60>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

After a successful 2019 2020 2021 and 2022 with the Amex Insurance Payment offer American Express has a new one on offer for 2023. Here are the details of the Amex Insurance Offer for those payments coming up towards insurance this quarter.

Amex Insurance Offer: 5 Membership Rewards Points for every INR 100 spent

To promote their reach in the insurance segment there is a new Amex Insurance Offer offering bonus Membership Rewards points for paying Insurance expenses on their proprietary Charge Cards and Credit Cards between December 22 2022 and March 31 2023. One earns 5 Membership Rewards points per INR 100 spent on insurance with this promotion.

The promotion is targetted and wants cardmembers to enrol for the offer before making the payment. The interesting part is that Amex does not offer Membership Rewards points for insurance spending since 2014 but they will offer it this quarter. The minimum spend is 100 INR to get the offer. The following cards are being targetted:

The maximum spending for the cards which earn 5 MR/INR 100 and hence this promotion is capped at INR 200000 Insurance Premium payments for all the cards listed above. If you do not have one of these cards you can always apply for it now and receive it in a week or so if eligible. Here is how to get the cards free.

Membership Rewards points are being given as a bonus under this offer and you will not earn any regular points. After the offer ends Cardmembers will stop getting any Membership Rewards Points on Insurance spending. The Bonus Membership Rewards Points will get credited to Cardmember’s account by July 31 2023.

Only eligible transactions going through merchant platforms will be eligible for Membership Rewards Points. Transactions going through an aggregator (like Paypal Paytm PayU etc.) may not trigger Membership Rewards Points since it entirely depends upon how a merchant submits its transactions to American Express.

Bottomline

It is fantastic when you can earn miles for stuff you are already going to have to do such as paying insurance. But when you get points for doing that it is all the more reason to do so. Amex is out there to get members to use their cards for more categories this year which seems just the start.

Which American Express Card are you going to use this quarter to pay for your insurance?

Scientists call for a group to create world peace.

Every year during 2000 to 2006 there were tens of thousands of stress-related tragedies in the U.S.. Official statistics from the FBI and Centers for Disease Control indicate that there were 15440 murders 93438 rapes and 86348 child and adolescent deaths from accidents each year to give a few examples. The current study published in the World Journal of Social Science is the longest and most comprehensive of 50 studies to demonstrate what has been named the Maharishi Effect in honor of Transcendental Meditation (TM) and Maharishi International University (MIU) founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

The results can be seen in the first chart. The blue line indicates that during the Baseline period of 2000 to 2006 the size of the TM and TM-Sidhi group located at Maharishi International University in Fairfield Iowa increased to reach the √1% of the U.S. population (1725 people) and stayed there for five years during the Demonstration period from 2007 to 2011. All stress indicators immediately started decreasing. In the Post period when the size of the group size began to decline the rate of decrease in stress slowed and then it reversed and began to increase.

(See Image 1: Indicators of Stress in the United States)

Image 1: The size of the MIU TM and TM-Sidhi Group is indicated by the blue line the eight indices of stress in the United States are represented by the lines in different colors and the US stress index—the mean of all eight variables—is indicated by the red line. The figure shows a phase transition to a global reduction of negativity in the U.S. when the critical threshold of the √1% of the U.S. population was practicing the TM and TM-Sidhi program together in a group. When the Group size dropped significantly the trend was reversed.

Lead author Dr. David Orme-Johnson said: “What is unique about this study is that the results are so visually striking and on such a large scale. We see reduced stress on multiple indicators at the predicted time for the entire United States over a five-year period. And when the size of the group declined national stress began increasing again. Clearly the group was causing the effect.”

Co-author Dr. Kenneth Cavanaugh commented: “This study used state-of-the-art methods of time series regression analysis for eliminating potential alternative explanations due to intrinsic pre-existing trends and fluctuations in the data. We carefully studied potential alternative explanations in terms of changes in economic conditions political leadership population demographics and policing strategies. None of these factors could account for the results.”

The fact that all variables started decreasing only after the square root of one percent of the U.S. was reached indicates a phase transition. Like when water does not turn to ice until 32◦ F is reached national stress did not start decreasing until the U.S. √1% transition threshold was achieved.

The chart shows that in 2013 when the size of the TM and TM-Sidhi group quickly dropped all stress indicators abruptly increased. Apparently the rapid drop in national coherence shook the nation.

The scientists used regression analysis to estimate how many deaths and events were reduced by the meditator group. For example image 2 shows the red dotted line representing the Baseline trend projected into the Demonstration and Post periods. During the Demonstration period drug-related deaths (the black line) fell to 14% below their Baseline trend and were another 15 % lower during the Post period for a total of 79941 fewer drug deaths. The chart also shows that in the absence of the coherence creating group drug deaths eventually returned to their Baseline level.

(See Image 2)

IMAGE 2. The red dotted line is the number of Drug Deaths forecasted from the Baseline trend. The black line is the actual number of Drug Deaths. Similar analyses were conducted for all variables and the results are displayed in the Table.

TABLE: RESULTS OF REGRESSION ANALYSES. The first column shows the number of events per year during the Baseline period (Intercept). The second column shows the change per year during the Baseline (Slope). The third fourth fifth and sixth columns show the thousands of events averted during the Demonstration during the Post periods the total events averted and percent change respectively. The last column shows the estimated total events averted by each individual participant in the MIU TM and TM-Sidhi group.

The unified field level of natural law

The finding that the effect was holistic causing all variables to move up and down together supports the theory expressed by both Maharishi from the Vedic perspective and by quantum physicist and MIU president Dr. John Hagelin from quantum field theory that the TM and TM-Sidhi groups are creating coherence in collective consciousness from the unified field level of natural law. This is big. It is evidence of the existence of the unified field from a completely different approach than using particle accelerators and detecting gravity waves.

This discovery of the unified field is more than just an intellectual knowledge. It is arguably the most immediately highly practical technological discovery in the history of science. The invention of the wheel mobilized humanity. The printing press radio the telephone the internet and satellites increased our ability to communicate with each other across vast distances and time. The discovery of DNA opened our minds to the subtle mechanics of natural law underlying the evolution and growth of all life forms. These are among the greatest scientific discoveries of all time. But what discovery can reduce human suffering as comprehensively as group meditation?

Relationship between individual and collective consciousness

The paper reviews the many concepts of collective consciousness as they have occurred throughout history in the sciences and humanities. None have practical applications as Maharishi’s does and none have been so empirically verified.

The paper discusses Maharishi’s theory which holds that every individual automatically contributes to collective consciousness and reciprocally collective consciousness influences every individual. This is universally true whatever the form of government—democracy republic monarchy communism or dictatorship.

It is essential for every individual to use evidence-based technologies to reduce their own stress and at the same time the responsibility of every government to provide these technologies to everyone.

The paper summarizes the hundreds of studies showing that practice of TM increases coherence in the individual as indicated by such measures as increased brain coherence decreased anxiety depression and anger increased creativity increased IQ and emotional and social intelligence and decreased PTSD symptoms prison recidivism drug and alcohol addictions and sickness rates in all categories of disease. More coherent individuals form a more coherent society.

The Howard and Alice Settle Foundation

A grant for 75 million dollars from the Howard and Alice Settle Foundation provided stipends for participants to be in the group and provided funding to bring several hundred visiting TM-Sidhi experts from India to further augment the MIU group. Dr. Orme-Johnson commented: “This is a lot of money but the savings from the 10% reduction in crimes would save over 200 billion dollars not to mention all the other savings from reducing other sources of stress in the country.”

The paper concludes with a call to create a permanent √1% group for the whole world 8000 participants practicing the TM and TM-Sidhi program together in one place. And as an engineering safety factor a √1% group on every continent is needed. The world is so interconnected no one is safe until everyone is safe all living in harmony. This is easily within reach of any government or the world's wealthiest citizens. The person who does it will be remembered as the greatest leader in history.

However Estée Lauder’s purchase in November of Tom Ford—an American company with super-premium pricing—may indicate a shift in how the world perceives American brands. After fetching a valuation of $2.8 billion the company has secured a seat at luxury’s power table.

That’s because Ford’s products are considered pricey even compared to other global luxury brands. A 30 ml bottle of Tom Ford Lost Cherry fragrance costs $240 a big markup compared to a same-sized bottle of Hermès D’orange Verte ($132) or Miss Dior fragrance ($72). A Tom Ford suit starts at about $5000 not quite as high as Kiton which can run five figures but more expensive than a suit from Dior or Zegna which starts around $3000.



That’s not the usual positioning of the typical American fashion or beauty firm which tends to aim for accessible prices like those at Coach or Kate Spade.

Europe dominates fashion’s top end

While France and Italy boast the lion’s share of the world’s top luxury brands American fashion and beauty fortunes have historically been made in mass and sports apparel such as Gap or Nike or in categories such as affordable luxury—think Ralph Lauren Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.

Although there are some standout US gown designers Oscar de la Renta and Vera Wang among them those brands have never reached the size or influence of business juggernauts like Chanel or Dior.

Partly that’s because as a nation the US was formed without a formal aristocratic class. Europe’s monarchies were the birthplace of luxury explains Karla Martin Deloitte’s fashion apparel and footwear lead.

“If you think about Burberry in London they started out with a commission to the queen. There’s a strict apprenticeship model and for couture it’s something where every single element has to be sewn by hand. It requires a long time to learn” Martin says. She notes the business was also nationalistic and exclusionary. “There were people who weren’t allowed to be in the business and we’re a younger country of immigrants.”

There’s also a certain timelessness involved. Chanel and Louis Vuitton are not dramatically changing up their look from season to season but rather reinterpreting already familiar house codes. That’s in part the reason why Kering in November parted ways with Alessandro Michele after keeping the designer in its top creative post for seven years. Michele’s magpie eclecticism reinvigorated the brand in 2015 but sales had been slowing and his designs felt too trendy and fadlike.

Martin points out that a real test of a luxury brand is whether it can stand on its own apart from its founding designer. Japan has birthed acclaimed avant garde designers such as Yohji Yamamoto Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo but while not cheap their creations fall more under designer fashion not a grand maison.

“It’s very much an aesthetic of that designer and it’s hard to continue when that designer is gone. Whereas if you think about Dior it’s managed to be quite successful with many designers who are not Christian Dior. This is how the house of Chanel is versus a Japanese designer or Tom Ford or Ralph Lauren. The 100 years of extra history matters” Martin says.

Americans are especially good at beauty and underwear

But Americans have proved themselves in sectors such as high-end cosmetics. Tom Ford for instance is known more for its fragrance and beauty than its fashion line.

Even at luxury prices beauty still remains relatively affordable and so in many ways is more suited to American innovation. Seven of the top ten American billionaires in the fashion and cosmetics sector stem from a single fortune: Estee Lauder. After the sale of Tom Ford its founding designer owes his billionaire status to that company too.

Another category Americans have a firm handle on: underwear. Les Wexner built his fortune on the back of Victoria’s Secret which was once the main star at L Brands. Sarah Blakely became the youngest self-made billionaire with her shapewear company Spanx. Kim Kardashian also found a lucrative niche with her Skims line.



American fashion’s gradual maturation

It’s not just Tom Ford that’s climbing up luxury’s ladder. Capri Holdings the parent company of American outfits Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo is hunting for another European luxury brand to buy after its successful acquisition of Versace in 2017.



At the time of the Versace deal there was concern there would be a culture clash between an American group and a European label. But the Versace integr ation has gone well. Capri is targeting $2 billion in sales for the Italian label and analysts have turned more positive on the group’s prospects overall.

China meanwhile has also produced a few aspirational firms but Fung Group Shandong Ruyi and more recently Lanvin Group all have yielded disappointing results. The latter listed via SPAC recently but the vast majority of investors in the special-purpose acquisition company backed out on the merger. As of writing Lanvin Group’s stock was languishing at around half its debut price of $10 a share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1tb3N0LWhhdGVkLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hbWVyaWNhLTIzMDkyMTE4Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Most Hated Companies in America,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1tb3N0LWhhdGVkLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hbWVyaWNhLTIzMDkyMTE4Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224F871C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

How are they kept filled etc.?

Answer: Water towers are among the most visible components of a public water system and often are a source of community pride.

They essentially are elevated tanks that hold drinking water and gravitational energy and they serve three key purposes:

They provide water storage to level out the peaks of daily water demand.

They maintain water pressure through gravity to distribute water to customers and ensure proper flow from the faucet.

They provide backup capacity in case of a power outage or a fire that requires a large amount of water to extinguish.

""Towers work great"" Neenah Water Utility Director Tony Mach said. ""They just do their job without asking for really much of anything.""

Water towers are a part of a water utility's distribution system. To understand their role it's best to start at the beginning. I'll use the Neenah Water Utility as an example.

Neenah draws raw water from Lake Winnebago. The water is treated — softened filtered and disinfected — before it's distributed via high-service pumps and pipes to residential commercial industrial and municipal customers.

The pumped water either goes directly to a customer — maybe someone's taking a shower or washing dishes — or it goes into a water tower. Neenah has two water towers: one on West Cecil Street with a capacity of 1.5 million gallons and one on Towerview Drive with a capacity of 500000 gallons. The water is stored at the top of the tower. It passes through pipes in the pedestal but no water is stored in the pedestal.

Mach said Neenah prefers to run its pumps at night when demand is lower and electricity is cheaper to fill the water towers. The tanks then are drawn down during the day as customers awake and begin to use more water.

The cycle of filling and emptying repeats daily keeping the water in the towers fresh.

Mach said the utility tries to keep the water level in the towers between 120 and 128 feet above ground which generates a water pressure of 52 to 55 pounds per square inch.

Water utilities can operate without water towers but then the pumps would need to run constantly to maintain pressure.

Neenah's water towers contain a mixer to keep the water moving inside the tank. The mixer helps to maintain a consistent chlorine residual to protect against waterborne pathogens.

It also prevents the water from freezing in frigid weather. Water towers often are made of steel are unprotected from the elements and are painted white which reflects heat from the sun so ice is an issue.

""Before we had mixers in there the joke was we got icebergs as big as Volkswagens in those towers"" Mach said. ""It's amazing what a little bit of mixing energy can do to limit the amount of ice formation.""

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources requires water towers to be inspected every five years. The process can be done when the tank is full of water with the use of a submersible robot but every other inspection requires the tank to be drained. At this time repairs can be made and any sediment can be removed. The tower must be disinfected before it can be filled and returned to service.

He was 61.

Doctors diagnosed de Cavel with a rare form of cancer called leiomyosarcoma in 2018; the disease eventually led to his death.

De Cavel was born in Roubaix France in 1961 and studied at Le Feguide culinary school in France before heading to New York to work as a chef.

""From an early teen I always wanted to be in the kitchen"" de CaveltoldCincinnati Editionin 2014. ""It was something I always enjoyed. I said to my parents 'I want to do an apprenticeship.' ""

He moved to Cincinnati in 1993 to work as head chef for Maisonette then a prestigious fine dining destination Downtown and Cincinnati's only restaurant with a Mobil five-star rating.

His first days were rocky — the airline lost his luggage and he had to delay his start at the Maisonette. Coming from New York Cincinnati's downtown seemed small. But he saw opportunity in the close-knit community.

""It was like everybody is from here"" he said. ""Everyone’s grandmother lives on the corner.""

But he wasn't satisfied to simply hold the top spot at one of the city's most well-regarded restaurants.

His own ventures were numerous spanning both formal fine dining and more causal French fare and included highly regarded restaurants like Chalk French Crust Frenchie Fresh Greenup Café Lavomatic JeanRo Pigalls and many others.

""It's a different era"" de Cavel told WVXU in 2016 as he opened up Restaurant L in Great American Tower. ""Our wish is really to make the new generation and the older generation feel like what we are giving them today is what the Maisonette gave the customers and their guests for many decades in the past.""

De Cavel’s work was recognized a number of times — he was named a semi-finalist four times for Best Chef in the Great Lakes Region and three times for Best Chef in the Midwest by the James Beard Foundation.

Often credited with helping kickstart Cincinnati's dining renaissance the city renamed the corner of Seventh and Vine Streets Downtown for de Cavel in 2021.

""Jean-Robert de Cavel made Cincinnati his home and then he changed us forever"" Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval tweeted Dec. 23. ""Through his life's work in the kitchen and in the community he taught us all to expect more. To believe Cincinnati was deserving of the very best. And thanks to him the very best is what we got.""

Jean-Robert‘s passion for bringing joy to this City and its people never once wavered. We will always hold his memory in our hearts.



Our love and sympathies go out to his family and friends. — Aftab Pureval (@AftabPureval) December 23 2022

His influence went beyond the culinary world. De Cavel participated in a number of charitable causes. After losing their first-born daughter Tatiana to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2002 he and his wife founded the de Cavel Family SIDS Foundation.

""I have a soft spot for charity and doing things for people"" he said in his Cincinnati Edition interview. ""When I came to Cincinnati I realized… you can make a difference as a big fish in a small pond. When I came to town I was in the spotlight as the head chef of the best restaurant in town. I'd never had that dimension before. That made me feel like I want to be connected with people.""

De Cavel leaves behind his wife Annette Pfund de Cavel and his daughter Leticia.

How are they kept filled etc.?

Answer: Water towers are among the most visible components of a public water system and often are a source of community pride.

They essentially are elevated tanks that hold drinking water and gravitational energy and they serve three key purposes:

They provide water storage to level out the peaks of daily water demand.

They maintain water pressure through gravity to distribute water to customers and ensure proper flow from the faucet.

They provide backup capacity in case of a power outage or a fire that requires a large amount of water to extinguish.

""Towers work great"" Neenah Water Utility Director Tony Mach said. ""They just do their job without asking for really much of anything.""

Water towers are a part of a water utility's distribution system. To understand their role it's best to start at the beginning. I'll use the Neenah Water Utility as an example.

Neenah draws raw water from Lake Winnebago. The water is treated — softened filtered and disinfected — before it's distributed via high-service pumps and pipes to residential commercial industrial and municipal customers.

The pumped water either goes directly to a customer — maybe someone's taking a shower or washing dishes — or it goes into a water tower. Neenah has two water towers: one on West Cecil Street with a capacity of 1.5 million gallons and one on Towerview Drive with a capacity of 500000 gallons. The water is stored at the top of the tower. It passes through pipes in the pedestal but no water is stored in the pedestal.

Mach said Neenah prefers to run its pumps at night when demand is lower and electricity is cheaper to fill the water towers. The tanks then are drawn down during the day as customers awake and begin to use more water.

The cycle of filling and emptying repeats daily keeping the water in the towers fresh.

Ossoff's Legislation to Preserve & Protect Chattahoochee River Signed into Law - U.S. Senator for Georgia Jon ...,"Sen. Ossoff briefed leaders on the bill in February

Washington D.C. — U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff’s bill to preserve and protect the Chattahoochee River is now law.

Sen. Ossoff’s Chattahoochee River Act will help improve water quality protect essential public works and restore ecosystems along the river — which are all vital to Georgia’s drinking water supply agricultural industry power generation and more.

The first-of-its-kind law authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to work on water projects up and down the Chattahoochee River throughout the state of Georgia.

The bill was signed into law as part of this year’s Water Resources and Development Act reauthorization.

“This exciting new program will improve water quality protect essential public works and restore ecosystems along the river which supplies much of our state’s drinking water. I thank my colleagues in both parties for supporting my legislation which is now law” Sen. Ossoff said.

“Chattahoochee Riverkeeper applauds Congress for including the Chattahoochee River Program in the Water Resources Development Act” said Jason Ulseth the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. “The Chattahoochee River Program will encourage co-operation between federal and state agencies and stakeholders. Chattahoochee Riverkeeper looks forward to implementation of this program to protect and restore a river millions of people depend on.”

“Senator Ossoff’s new law builds upon the successful efforts of improving Chattahoochee River water quality during the last fifteen years. It is hard to overstate the importance of this river to Georgia Alabama and Florida. This law will provide Georgia and Alabama with new tools to continue the vital conservation and restoration of this precious natural resource for all users” said Katherine Moore Georgia Conservancy President.

Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock co-sponsored the Senate bill and Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-GA-07) led introduction of the House companion alongside Congressman Hank Johnson (D-GA-04) Congresswoman Nikema Williams (D-GA-05) Congresswoman Lucy McBath (D-GA-06) and Congressman David Scott (D-GA-13).

“Clean water is essential for healthy and thriving communities” said Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock. “While the Chattahoochee River’s water quality has improved in recent years hundreds of miles of Chattahoochee watershed waterways still do not meet water-quality standards. I’m proud to have worked with Senator Ossoff to ensure this provision that will invest in improving protecting and preserving the Chattahoochee River gets signed into law.”

“I am very pleased to see the Chattahoochee River Act finally become law” Congresswoman Bourdeaux said. “The Chattahoochee River meets so many critical needs for Georgians. Thank you to Senator Ossoff and my Georgia colleagues for their support in protecting and preserving Georgia’s drinking water and natural resources for future generations.”

“We know more than 1000 miles of waterway within the Chattahoochee River Basin watershed do not meet water quality standards” said Congressman Johnson. “Implementing a Comprehensive Chattahoochee River Basin Restoration Plan will restore the Chattahoochee River protect Atlanta’s drinking water and safeguard this vital natural resource that generates more than $200 million for our local economy and thousands of jobs. I commend Sen. Ossoff and Congresswoman Bourdeaux for their leadership in preserving this resource for future generations.”

“I am committed to ensuring environmental justice for all which includes passing the Chattahoochee River Act” Congresswoman Williams said. “This legislation will protect the most important natural resource in Georgia’s Fifth Congressional District now and for generations to come.”

According to the Georgia River Network the Chattahoochee supplies 70 percent of metro Atlanta’s drinking water.

The river is also a key source of water for farmers and agriculture and it’s a key source of power through hydroelectric dams. As of 2013 the state of Georgia has approvedmore than 6700 water withdrawal permits for agricultural use.

In 2019 the National Park Service reported visitors to the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area added more than $200 million to the local economy supporting over 2000 local jobs.

According to Chattahoochee Riverkeeper more than 1000 miles of waterway within the Chattahoochee watershed do not meet water quality standards creating potential health risks to both humans and wildlife.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhaXJvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vYW1lcmljYW4tbmV3cy90aGUtc29sdXRpb24tdG8td2F0ZXItc2NhcmNpdHktbGllcy13aXRoLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1sZWFkZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Solution to Water Scarcity Lies With Corporate Leaders,"Over 50% of the United States has experienced serious droughts in the past 20 years..At the same time the ability to use rainwater for drinking has been eliminated everywhere from the Arctic to Australia to the Sahara. Our planet is heating up at a rate that people have never imagined. Water scarcity is a reality that we all should care about.

It is hard to argue otherwise especially given that the Colorado River Basin which supplies up to 40 million people with water is experiencing historic droughts. Moreover water shortages extend far beyond the western states and are not unique to this region which should invoke action.

Water Scarcity’s Effect on Business

Executives have the means the power and the resources necessary to tackle water scarcity. Although some may argue that executives should keep their attention on supporting their businesses many companies rely on the water disappearing from the country. The leaders of the biggest companies in the world are raising the alarm. Everyone should be concerned.

Not only would we run out of water but water scarcity also affects the price of water. As a result companies will ultimately spend more on this necessity for their operations products and more. With businesses spending more consumers will encounter rising costs impacting everyone.

Corporate overhead spending will increase profit margins will decline and companies will struggle. Corporate leaders should be concerned and work to address the critical problem of water scarcity. Howeverthe real question is how executives can handle this.

Executives have the most financial power and influence over their industries so they have access to the information and resources to make water scarcity less of a problem in the future. Therefore we must practice corporate social responsibility. The circumstances at hand make it not just an option but a necessity.

Programs Striving for Change

There are numerous initiatives fighting water scarcity. However many of them need more funding. To protect our planet people and the communities we live in and love executives can lead the way toward sustainability. Through corporate leadership the world could have a reprieve from our current challenges. It’s just a matter of choosing where to invest.

Amongst the programs and initiatives that fight water scarcity some of the most promising ones tackle issues like water quality and usage and even work to desalinate the ocean. If every executive contributed regardless of the cost the world would be substantially different from what it is today.

Projects like Captive Systems tackle the removal and recovery of lipophilic substances hydrocarbons and heavy metals from the soil water and air. These kinds of programs should be supported to help provide clean water globally. In addition investing in these programs contribute to mitigating issues like rainwater heavily polluted with PFAS and other toxic substances.

A sustainable future requires us to find ways to clean our water which is why ultraviolet water treatment companies have created programs that help protect our water. If we are not proactive we might fail to have clean water in the future as these choices can dictate the future of our planet and the business world.

One of the most notable projects is the integration of desalination as a more accepted practice. Not only would it provide more accessible options for people to receive water but it maybe the only way to get water in the future.

The oceans make up most of our world so why not find ways to utilize this to our advantage? That is where desalination comes into play to provide a sustainable and economical water supply. These technologies will shape the state of our future and the quality of life we give future generations.

Numerous campaigns urge people to monitor their consumption and work together to address water scarcity and quality. Governments are doing what they can. Still the world’s elite and executives must do their part and prove to consumers that corporate leaders understand their needs.

Although CULANTH102: American Indian Nations Today doesn’t start until 12 p.m. nearly every student is waiting in their seat 10 minutes earlier on this October afternoon. Then Dr. Courtney Lewis promptly strides into the room.

Her dark hair is pulled into a high ponytail revealing tiny square woodcuts of the Cherokee water spider dangling from her earlobes.

“They’re burned in wood because Cherokee legend has it that the water spider brought fire to the Cherokee people” she tells the class.

This semester the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences welcomed Lewis to the cultural anthropology department as associate professor and Trinity’s first American Indian professor. Lewis' hiring was part of Trinity's cluster hire in Native American and Indigenous Studies in spring 2021. With previous experience teaching Native American studies at the University of South Carolina Davidson College and Wesleyan University Lewis was well equipped for the position.

“Building cohesive structures for Native American studies is so important” Lewis said. “There is a lot of racism against American Indians in academia and it’s important that people are made aware of this narrative.”

Lewis a Cherokee citizen described the marginalization and stereotypes from professors and students she faced growing up. The American school system historically sidelines Native American figures in history and misrepresents American Indian culture she said.

“You’re being disappeared as you’re being taught” Lewis said. “You’re being fed the Thanksgiving story in elementary school and you’re the only one who knows that it’s wrong.”

Her father Ronald G. Lewis was the first American Indian to receive a doctorate in social work in 1974. Forbidden from speaking Cherokee in public schools both father and daughter came back to the language together later in life. The single sticker on the back of her laptop is a thumbs up that reads “Osda” — “Good” in Cherokee.

Lewis begins every class period with a brief review of recent news articles about Native Nations across the country. In a course that she dubbed “American Indians 101” Lewis works to introduce Duke students to the diversity of modern American Indian Nations in the United States. This October class period started with a discussion over Cherokee Nation and Chippewa blood quantum systems. “I hope that the students learn something new unexpected and surprising about the current status of American Indians” Lewis said. “And I hope they can take this information with them beyond graduation.” In the 75-minute class period Lewis covered a case study of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians the only federally recognized Native Nation in North Carolina and one of three Cherokee nations. Her presentation is a whirlwind of specific terminology and Cherokee history spanning nearly 100 years up to the current location of the Qualla Boundary. The class doesn’t miss a beat. While some may be tripped up by the term “blood quantum” and the difference between a boundary and a reservation Lewis’ students regularly pipe up with thought provoking questions. Sophomore Yujin Kim is one of the many members of the class that don’t hesitate to delve deeper.

“Comfortable is such a perfect word for describing the class atmosphere and it’s something I’m so grateful for” said Kim. “No one’s really afraid to ask questions or be ignorant — everyone’s focused on educating themselves.”

While American Indian Nations Today is Kim’s first class in Native American studies junior Grace Dewyer is working on pursuing her major in the subject through Program II. A citizen of the Navajo Nation and a member of the Native American/Indigenous Student Alliance (NAISA) at Duke Dewyer is deeply involved in the study of Native American history and culture but must piece together her studies from multiple universities to complete her major.

Taking classes with Lewis has been a highlight of Dewyer’s educational journey.

“I’m not used to seeing anybody else like me in academics” Dewyer said. “I was the only Native American student in my class growing up. Seeing Dr. Lewis is comforting and important for other Native students to feel like they belong here.”

Lewis is heavily involved in student groups such as NAISA as well as advocacy for a stronger Native presence on campus. “My new colleagues in anthropology have been incredibly supportive” she said. Whether through speakers film festivals or Nasher gallery showings Lewis gushes about the responsiveness from faculty on more Native American involvement.

However Lewis Dewyer and Kim made it clear that Lewis’ employment on Duke’s campus is just the beginning for Native studies.

“It’s important to be cognizant of the educational and social systems that we have grown up in” Kim said. “Duke is taking some really important steps in making these hires and expanding studies but I’d like to see a lot more to come and we have a long way to go.”

This spring Lewis will be teaching CULANTH109: American Indians Go Graphic a look at indigenizing pop culture through graphic novels.

As for the future of Native American studies at Duke Lewis remains “confidently optimistic.”

“Trinity made a commitment and as long as the hiring of American Indian faculty continues I think the future of Native American studies at Duke is very bright” she said."

There were about 3.464 million deaths in the U.S. in 2021 805000 more than the total reported in 2020 according to the Mortality in the United States 2021 report from the CDC National Center for Health Statistics.



The death rate for the U.S. increased by 5.3% from 835.4 deaths per 100000 people in 2020 to 879.7 in 2021 data showed. As a result life expectancy at birth for the U.S. population decreased from 77 years in 2020 to 76.4 years in 2021.



COVID-19 was a major factor in the change in mortality rates ranking as the third most prevalent cause of death after heart disease and cancer. A rise in drug overdoses also contributed accounting for more than one third of all accidental deaths in the U.S. according to the CDC. The rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl increased 22% from 17.8 in 2020 to 21.8 in 2021.



Despite the decrease in life expectancy actuarial tables that influence retirement planning and services may not see significant change according to Christian Veenstra co-president of Watkins Ross a retirement plan consultant actuary and administrator.



“Today’s headlines while interesting are likely based on averages of current data—that is the earlier than expected deaths caused by COVID[-19] created [an] average age at death lower than expected” Veenstra says in an emailed response. “But extrapolating that to future experience isn’t so cut and dried.”



Veenstra says that if deaths due to COVID-19 mostly impacted the elderly that would have brought the actual age of death down but would not necessarily provide information for the future mortality of survivors.



Mortality forecasts are used in the retirement and insurance industries for a number of purposes ranging from determining funding for defined benefit plans to valuing annuities and life estates.



Veenstra says there are two schools of thought about how to measure the long-term impact of COVID-19 on mortality. The first is that COVID-19 caused the death of people who may have died at a younger age from a different cause (i.e. those with underlying medical conditions) thereby leaving behind more people with longer life expectancy. If that is true Veenstra writes then “some models actually project longer average lifespan by several months to a couple of years.”



In the second scenario the long-term negative health issues for those who contracted COVID-19 may mean earlier death pushing down the overall mortality rate.



Veenstra says his firm Grand Rapids Michigan-based Watkins Ross is “eagerly awaiting” updates to mortality improvement tables that the Internal Revenue Service and Society of Actuaries usually publish in October which have been delayed due to uncertainty forced by COVID-19.



He notes that when retirement advice is given on the individual level many other factors enter the equation for decisions on asset distribution and associated costs including family history current health and past medical experience. Now that list will include exposure to COVID-19 and vaccination status.



“When we see decisions made by individuals in defined benefit pension plans—such as whether or not to take a lump sum a type of joint and survivor or other annuity option benefit commencement date etc.—participants can become quite honest in order to maximize the benefit for themselves” Veenstra says.

Record inflation deteriorating asset prices skyrocketing rents and concerns about an impending recession have many rethinking aspects of financial planning. They're not sure they want the same things in 2023 as they did in previous years.

For advisors eyeing where the next year will lead them here are the top financial advising trends for 2023:



Engagement.

Defensive planning.

Financial wellness.

Engagement

Bill McManus vice president and managing director of Applied Insights at Hartford Funds would sum up the trends that will continue into 2023 with one word: engagement.

""We will undoubtedly continue to see uncertainty and volatility in the next year"" he says but the challenges clients face will be the same such as generating retirement income and solving challenges with housing transportation and social connectivity.

""Financial professionals will have to continue to adapt how they engage with clients in order to educate them and connect them to resources"" McManus says. He recommends finding a balance between in-person and virtual meetings while also leveraging social media and websites by providing relevant bytes of information and hosting client events.

""Having a system to 'drip' on clients throughout the year can go a long way in helping them solve challenges take advantage of opportunities and maybe most importantly avoid making mistakes"" he says. ""The financial professionals and teams that can successfully do this will be able to more deeply serve their clients build relationships attract new prospects and run a more efficient practice.""



READ 20 Financial Advisor Marketing Tips

Defensive Planning

Most predictions suggest many of the challenges plaguing the economy and stock market in 2022 should ebb in 2023. Inflation is expected to slow and the U.S. may narrowly avoid a recession but that doesn't mean advisors or investors can sit back and relax.

""If the U.S. economy does slip into a recession next year it's crucial to have a plan in place"" says Michelle Young private wealth advisor at Ameriprise Financial. ""We continue to meet with clients at least twice per year are asking them about the security of their employment and talking about their emergency cash reserves.""

She says her focus will be on understanding what can be expected from company earnings in 2023 ""because this is what moves the stock market."" Based on that information she plans to point out opportunities for each individual investor based on his or her unique situation and time horizon.

""We will guide them through the advantages of CDs and fixed-income products in rising interest environments"" she says. ""Investors should continue to lean into areas which reduce portfolio risk including diversification. The beginning of the year is an excellent time to reevaluate your financial goals risk tolerance and to make any necessary adjustments.""

Stephanie Genkin a certified financial planner and founder of My Financial Planner LLC says she also expects a renewed interest in cash equivalent accounts like CDs I bonds and Treasury bills in 2023.

""For the volatility-weary they provide safety and guaranteed income that hasn't been available on cash in a very long time"" she says. While good for short-term savings needs she adds that investments are still the best way to bulk up on long-term retirement accounts for the future.

Tax and Estate Planning Technology

Holistic financial planning is not new but it will become increasingly important for advisors to adopt in 2023 especially with regard to adding tax and estate planning services.

""We are no longer in the age of collecting fees to manage investment-only portfolios and advisors who are not doing more for their clients will eventually lose clients sell to advisors who are offering more or retire to avoid having to add services to their suite of offerings"" says Brian Dudley senior vice president and financial advisor at Wealth Enhancement Group.

Broadening your services into tax and estate planning is especially important in the coming year and something advisors can and should offer to clients with lower assets under management rather than reserving it for only wealthy clients. Luckily this will also become easier to do thanks to advances in advisor technology.

""We have companies like Holistiplan for example that allow an advisor within minutes to analyze a client's or prospect's tax return and provide meaningful financial advice and discuss actionable items"" Dudley says. ""Tax and estate planning advisor technology will be a massive catalyst - or a hurdle for some - for financial advice in 2023 and beyond.""



Banking and Wealth Management Consolidation

Another consolidation that advisors can expect to see more clients looking for in 2023 is banking and wealth management under one roof. The share of investors who prefer to consolidate these two under one roof has risen from 13% in 2018 to 22% in 2021 according to research by McKinsey. This is particularly true for younger and affluent investors: over half of investors under 45 and nearly one-third of those with $5 million to $10 million prefer consolidated relationships.

""In 2023 it will be increasingly important for advisors to offer their clients access to personalized open-architecture solutions where they can pick and choose which offerings are most valuable to them"" says Rajini Kodialam chief operating officer and co-founder of Focus Financial Partners.

""Advisors that have access to firms with scale… are afforded comprehensive solutions in areas such as alternatives and private investments lending and credit valuation and investment banking and family office solutions"" she says. ""This in turn fuels greater success for advisors in their ability to meet the complex wealth structuring needs of their clients.""

External Investment Solutions

Offering a broader array of services is no small feat for advisors. Perhaps this is why there's been a growing trend toward using external investment solutions. Nearly one-third of registered investment advisors or RIAs increased their usage of third-party providers in 2022 compared with 27% of RIAs who increased usage in 2020 according to a recent FlexShares survey of 500 advisors. Laura Hanichak Gregg director of practice management and advisor research at FlexShares ETFs says this trend is likely to continue into 2023.

""Advisors choosing to outsource often do so to spend more time with clients and focus on more personalized financial planning services though recently outsourcing has also proven to be a source of stability in more turbulent market conditions"" she says.

That said advisors should tread carefully into the realm of outsourcing as regulators have yet to finalize their stance on the practice. For instance the Securities and Exchange Commission recently proposed a rule that would introduce new requirements for RIAs to engage third-party service providers.

""This is an important development that we're continuing to monitor heading into next year"" Gregg says.

Financial Wellness

Another financial planning trend Genkin expects to see in 2023 is ""an increased use of the buzzword 'financial wellness.'""

""There is a world of hurt out there when it comes to money"" she says. ""Inflation is at a 40-year high retirement account balances have taken a hit this year as a result of stock and bond volatility. The housing market is out of reach for many families thanks to rising mortgage rates and not enough housing stock in many parts of the country keeping home prices high.""

In a world still reeling from the economic shakeup caused by the COVID-19 pandemic ""financial trauma is more widespread than ever and people are looking for relief"" she says.

""As a society we are genuinely seeking financial wellness"" she says ""but people aren't going to find it in a product.""

Financial wellness is about more than the numbers in your portfolio. ""It's getting right with your personal relationship with money"" she says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZ291dHJndi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2Zvb3RiYWxsLWZvdW5kZXJzLXNvY2lldHktbWVtYmVyc2hpcC1jbG9zZXMtd2l0aC0xLTc1LW1pbGxpb24tcmFpc2VkLmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Football Founders Society Membership Closes with $1.75 Million Raised,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='goutrgv.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/2022/12/23/football-founders-society-membership-closes-with-1-75-million-raised.aspx (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224ED12A0>, 'Connection to goutrgv.com timed out.

Xerox Corporation has agreed in principle to settle a 401(k) lawsuit with plaintiffs who alleged plan fiduciaries mismanaged the retirement plan by passing on to participants excessive fees for recordkeeping services.

Xerox will pay the $4.1 million gross settlement amount into a common fund established for the benefit of the settlement class and agree to intended provisions for prospective relief to plan participants the court filing shows.

“Xerox maintains the company acted prudently and loyally at all times when acting in any fiduciary capacity with respect to the plan” a spokesperson wrote in an email regarding the litigation. “The settlement avoids the risk and uncertainty of further litigation for both parties.”

Per the settlement no later than five years from the effective date of the agreement defendants will use an independent consultant to assist with a request for proposal fee benchmarking study or other comparative analysis to ensure that the plan’s recordkeeping fees remain competitive according to the plaintiffs memorandum of law in support of motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement

The settlement and motion for approval follow a full-day on October 11 in-person mediation with mediator David Geronemus the filing shows.

The plaintiffs represented by firms Nichols Kaster and Garrison Levin-Epstein Fitzgerald & Pirrotti asked in their filing that the court approve the proposed settlement calling the relief it grants “meaningful.”

“This relief directly addresses the core issue that plaintiffs raised in the lawsuit and is designed to ensure that the plan’s expenses are reasonable going forward” plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote in the filing.

“This is a significant recovery for the class compared to the claims that were alleged and it falls well within the range of negotiated settlements in similar ERISA cases” the attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote. “The settlement also provides for meaningful prospective relief as defendants have agreed to retain an independent consultant to assist them in ensuring that the plan’s recordkeeping fees remain competitive in the future by means of a request for proposal fee benchmarking study or other comparative analysis.”

The plaintiffs motion asks the court enter an order:

Preliminarily approving the settlement.

Approving the proposed notices and authorizing distribution of the settlement notices to the settlement class.

Certifying the proposed settlement class.

Scheduling a final approval hearing.

And granting any other relief described in the proposed preliminary approval order.

“Although defendants dispute the allegations and deny liability for any alleged violations of ERISA or any other law they do not oppose relief sought in this motion” the attorneys wrote.

The original complaint was brought before U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.

Xerox filed with the court a motion to dismiss the complaint that was heard and denied by Judge Sarala V. Nagala in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut earlier this year.

The proposed settlement applies to all participants and beneficiaries of the Xerox Corporation Savings Plan at any time from August 11 2015 until January 1 2021—excluding anyone responsible for the plan’s administrative functions or expenses—according to the plaintiffs’ attorneys motion for preliminary approval.

Based on the information provided by defendants there are approximately 36000 settlement class Members according to the document.

Although not published with the memo a copy of the class action settlement agreement was attached as Exhibit A to “an accompanying declaration of plaintiffs’ attorney Brock Specht” with the Nichols Kaster firm the court filing shows.",,,

Payment and insurance ReSound does not list prices on its website. A person must go to a recommended retailer to see how much their hearing aid will cost and whether the company offers a payment plan.

Warranty ReSound offers a warranty of 1–4 years if a person buys their hearing aid through an authorized distributor. The company also offers protection against loss theft and damages for 1 year. Refund policy If a person is not satisfied with their hearing aid they can return it to the hearing care center that sold it. The hearing aid should be in its original condition.

How to order ReSound does not sell hearing aids on its website. Instead it provides a form that a person fills out to find a hearing care professional selling ReSound products in their area. A person can then make an appointment. The hearing care professional will typically perform an ear examination and hearing test before prescribing a specific hearing aid. At this stage if a person wishes to purchase a ReSound product they may do so. Follow-up care The ReSound website offers downloadable guides for its hearing aids. People can also access help through the company’s app.

While they make the sounds of an environment louder they are not designed for people with hearing loss. The distinction relates in part to the fact that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulatory oversight over hearing aids but not sound amplifiers. Hearing-assistive devices A person with hearing loss may benefit from a range of devices including: Assistive-listening devices: These amplify the sounds that a person wants to hear and a person can use them with or without hearing aids.

These amplify the sounds that a person wants to hear and a person can use them with or without hearing aids. Alerting devices: These use a certain sound or light to let the person know that a doorbell or telephone is ringing.

These use a certain sound or light to let the person know that a doorbell or telephone is ringing. Alternative and augmentative communication devices: These help people with severe hearing loss communicate in other ways. One example is a computer program that turns text into speech.

Online hearing aid safety Experts do not always recommend buying a hearing aid online. If someone purchases a hearing aid online without a complete hearing test for example the device may not meet their needs. For people who think they need hearing aids the FDA recommends: having an exam from an ear nose and throat (ENT) doctor visiting an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test buying hearing aids only from a licensed hearing care professional

When to speak with a doctor A person should speak with a doctor if they experience any of the following symptoms of hearing loss: difficulty hearing other people clearly

difficulty hearing in noisy environments

frequently asking people to repeat themselves

listening to music or TV at a higher volume than usual

feeling tired or stressed from concentrating on what other people are saying

finding it difficult to keep up with conversations A person should see an audiologist for a complete hearing test or an ENT specialist if they have bleeding pain dizziness or rapid-onset hearing loss.

With the world population topping eight billion for the first time “Santa is flying faster than ever; we estimate he’s traveling over Mach 7 this year” — seven times the speed of sound more than a mile per second — “to hit all those datapoints around the world in one night” says Adam Gorski aerospace engineer for Exton-based Ansys Government Initiatives.

AGI a flight-simulation subsidiary of Ansys Inc. is one of two Philadelphia-area tech companies that cooperate to track Santa Claus’ Christmas Eve flights in real time using data collected by NORAD the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command.

NORAD collects data from transmitters in many places including a convenient Santa Claus sled beacon — “Rudolph’s red nose” Gorski added.

“Anything that fast is hypersonic — you see it long before you hear it. You need special technology to go that fast” the kind that propels satellites into orbit but doesn’t yet power commercial aircraft he added.

“Also magic reindeer. They go that fast.”

A sister company Center City-based Cesium builds the user-friendly dashboard software that makes Santa easier to track along with systems used by gamers and other participants in the emerging virtual-reality networks known as the metaverse.

Since the 1960s NORAD has tracked planes satellites and other flying objects over North America and made the data publicly available making it easier for flight planners to avoid accidents and improve air traffic safety.

There are Grinches who object. Twitter owner Elon Musk earlier this month suspended social media users including some journalists who provided similar information from public sources that tracked his and other billionaires’ private jets around the world.

Musk said he had safety concerns that the data might be used by those who wish to harm him and other high-profile people; critics accused him of muzzling them and compromising his own promises to lessen restrictions on the circulation of information.

Despite Musk’s cancellations NORAD and its Philly tech partners have continued to post their Santa Claus tracking data through the NoradSantaNews.com website (with links in a few languages) YouTube Pinterest LinkedIn — and also @NoradTracksSanta on Musk’s Twitter network.

Ansys says the sites it services that provide Santa tracking information received more than 20 million visits last year and that traffic has risen each year.

Both Ansys’ Exton unit — it was the private company Analytical Graphics Inc. before Pittsburgh-based military contractor Ansys bought for $700 million it in 2020 — and Cesium were founded by engineer Paul Graziani and his colleagues who left what was then GE Aerospace in King of Prussia in 1990 to start a series of space technology businesses.

The Air Force began tracking Santa in 1965 after a Colorado newspaper accidentally printed its headquarters’ phone number in place of a department store’s call-Santa line and NORAD volunteers began answering the resulting flood of calls. Ansys began aiding the effort 25 years ago; the business now known as Cesium signed on in 2012.

I asked Gorski about Musk’s concern: Don’t his company and NORAD worry all that information about Santa’s location might be abused to compromise security? What if bad actors plot Santa’s course and attempt to rob the sleigh or wreck the gift-giving operation?

“His only defense is reindeer antlers and the ability to move really fast” Gorski acknowledged.

But Santa has many friends and able defenders watching out for him he concluded: “NORAD reports that our Navy jets check on Santa tipping their wings as he goes past.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9ub3JhZC1zYW50YS10cmFja2VyLWNocmlzdG1hcy0yMDIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Track Santa Claus on his way this Christmas Eve with NORAD,"Santa Claus sits ready for flight in front of an F-16 at Buckley Air Force Base.

As many children around the world eagerly await the arrival of Santa Claus on Christmas morning the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is making the wait a little easier with its annual Santa Tracker.

NORAD is a joint organization of the United States and Canada responsible for tracking objects in North American airspace and protecting the continent from potential airborne threats. Each Christmas the organization uses its North Warning System radar system and early warning satellites to track ol' Saint Nick and his reindeer as they bring joy to children who celebrate Christmas worldwide.

The minute Santa launches on his sleigh pulled by his eight famous reindeer (plus Rudolph!) NORAD begins tracking his progress. This year the NORAD Santa Tracker will begin following Santa at 6:00 a.m. EST (0900 GMT) on Saturday (Dec. 24).

NORAD's Santa Tracker tradition has been going since 1955 when the organization's predecessor the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) began offering updates on St. Nick's trip.

""While the tradition of tracking Santa began purely by accident NORAD continues to track Santa"" the official NORAD Santa Tracker website states. ""We're the only organization that has the technology the qualifications and the people to do it. And we love it! NORAD is honored to be Santa's official tracker!""

Eager Santa trackers in the United States can even call in to NORAD to inquire about Kris Kringle's current whereabouts as he makes his way around the world.

""The NORAD Tracks Santa Operations Center is fully operational beginning at 4 AM MST on December 24th"" the tracker's official website states. ""You can call 1 877 HI-NORAD (1 877 446-6723) to talk directly to a NORAD staff member who will be able to tell you Santa's exact location. Operators are available until midnight.""

Over 1250 NORAD personnel join in on the Santa Tracker effort each year answering phone calls and emails about Santa's progress.

The NORAD Santa Tracker is powered by simulation software developed by AGI/Ansys. Adam Gorski an aerospace engineer with Ansys Government Initiatives told Space.com that the simulation software enables NORAD to provide the most accurate track of Santa Claus as possible. ""Ansys simulation software is used to ensure NORAD can safely track Santa as he travels around the world"" Gorski said. ""Ansys simulations ensure NORAD satellites can detect the heat from Rudolph's nose and radars can track Santa's sleigh high in the sky. Our simulations are also used to help Santa's elves perform some aerodynamic analysis on designs of his sleigh over the year.""

The software even aids Santa's journey Gorski added. ""In order to ensure on-time delivery by Christmas morning Santa's sleigh travels at hypersonic speed – Mach 7. Ansys simulation software helps Santa determine if the sleigh needs more reindeer to maintain balance and gain additional power and efficiency.""

The NORAD Santa Tracker website even includes specifications and technical data for Santa's sleigh: It has a maximum speed of ""faster than starlight"" and its emissions remain classified — probably for the sake of the reindeers' dignity.

According to NORAD Santa's wondrous aircraft measures 75 by 40 by 55 candy canes (150 by 80 by 110 lollipops) and its weight at takeoff is 75000 gumdrops. Its passenger weight at takeoff for Santa Claus is 260 pounds (118 kilograms) while its passenger weight at landing is 1260 pounds (571 kg). All of those cookies and milk add up!",,,,,,

The clear takeaway was the three big projects for the 12-lakh strong Army.TOI was the first to report earlier this month that Project `Zorawar’ for 354 light tanks at a cost of around Rs 17500 crore was all set to be cleared by the DAC after the Army-DRDO tussle was resolved in the case.The Army needs such indigenous tanks each weighing less than 25 tonnes with a high power-to-weight ratio as well as superior firepower and protection for high-altitude warfare given the continuing threat posed by China all along the 3488-km Line of Actual Control.Sources said the AoN was also accorded for 480 futuristic infantry combat vehicles (FICVs) with enhanced lethality night-fighting and ISR (intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance) capabilities at a cost of around Rs 20000 crore. “The FICVs will replace some of the old Russian-origin BMP-II vehicles” an officer said.Similarly 300 mounted gun systems will be acquired for around Rs 7500 crore. Importantly AoN was also granted for procurement of 80000 ballistic helmets with enhanced protection levels for frontline soldiers.The IAF’s projects to “enhance its lethal capabilities” include the acquisition of indigenous new-generation anti-radiation missiles (NGARMs) for its frontline Sukhoi-30MKI fighters as well as long-range guided bombs augmentation kits for conventional bombs and advanced surveillance systems.DRDO is developing the NGARMs which are designed to destroy a variety of enemy surveillance communication and radar targets on the ground after being fired from jets. These include Rudram-1 (150-km range) Rudram-2 (350-km range) and Rudram-3 (550-km) air-to-ground missiles as reported by TOI earlier.The DAC also gave the go-ahead for procurement of vertical-launch anti-ship missiles multi-purpose vessels and high-endurance autonomous vehicles for the Navy.

Project Zorawar

The DAC has approved the initiation process for procurement of 354 light tanks also known as Project Zorawar.

Under the Rs 16000 crore-project the Army will induct indigenous light tanks with a maximum weight of 25 tonnes — and a margin of 10 per cent — that have the same firepower as regular tanks.

These tanks will be armed with Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration of tactical surveillance drones to provide a high degree of situational awareness and loitering munition along with an active protection system.

The Army also wants these tanks to be amphibious so they can be deployed across riverine regions even the Pangong Tso lake in Eastern Ladakh.

The project has been named after Zorawar Singh Kahluria — a military general who served under Jammu’s Raja Gulab Singh — known as the ‘conqueror of Ladakh’.

The plan is to design and develop these tanks indigenously a project that will be open to both private and state owned firms.

The Army aims to have the production of a prototype and beginning of trials in three years from the sanction of the project which was Thursday.

The Army currently operates three different types of tanks with the latest being the Arjun Mk 1A which weighs a massive 68.5 tonnes. The T-90 weighs about 46 tonnes and the T-72 about 45 tonnes.

Ladakh stand-off with China has shown that armoured columns are one of the most prominent factors in defining the operational capability of the land forces.

Army sources have in the past admitted that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had inducted a large number of technologically modern “state-of-art” tanks which were being employed operationally as a mix of medium and light tanks with high power-to-weight ratios.

While the Army had also deployed its T-90 and T-72 tanks — surprising the Chinese — lighter tanks would mean faster deployment and increased mobility in mountainous terrain.

Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle

Another big project that got the green light was the Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV). This again will be procured through the indigenous route with the bid being open to both private and state-owned firms.

Incidentally this is the third attempt in over a decade to acquire such capability.

While the AON has been accorded for 480 FICV the Army will acquire at least 2000 of them over a period of time.

The FICV will be a tracked vehicle that will replace the 1980’s vintage Soviet-designed BMP-2 currently in use with the 49 battalions of the Mechanised Infantry each with 51 BMP-2s.

The BMPs are produced under licence at the Ordnance Factory Medak in Telangana.

The proposed FICV are also meant to carry mini tactical surveillance drones and even loitering munitions.

Indian companies expected to be in contention include Mahindra and Mahindra TATA Bharat Forge and Larsen & Toubro.

Foreign firms such as Rosoboronexport of Russia General Dynamic of the US and Germany’s Rheinmetall are expected to be a part of the competition besides companies from South Africa and South Korea.

The FICV project was first envisaged in the mid-2000s and the formal process was initiated in 2009 by the Mechanised Infantry Directorate.

The 2009 plan had envisaged induction of FICVs beginning in 2022. And this was to be given to a private company. However the proposal was withdrawn in 2012 as it was felt that an upgrade of existing systems would suffice.

In 2014 a fresh proposal was mooted under which the government was to select state-run Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and two private firms for separately developing prototypes of the FICVs.

The project was to be implemented under Make 1 category of the defence procurement procedure under which the government would have undertaken 90 per cent of the funding for the prototype for the three selected firms.

This process was stalled with one of the players offering to manufacture the vehicles under Make 2 category in which the money would have been spent by the industry and not the government.

Mounted Gun System

The DAC has also given the AON for the procurement of 300 mounted gun systems for approximately Rs 7500 crore.

This is a project that has been pending for years and is part of a 1999 artillery modernisation programme that was rolled out in 2001.

Unlike a regular artillery gun these 155mmx52 caliber guns will be fitted on a vehicle that will allow it to traverse through tough terrains and also to shoot and scoot quicker.

Ballistic helmets

A small but significant project is Army’s plan to acquire about 80000 ballistic helmets for its soldiers deployed along the borders with China and Pakistan besides in counter insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir.

The idea is to replace the system of “patkas” a round steel plate that the soldiers wear in gun battles.

Even though the Army has gone in for ballistic helmets the idea is for them to withstand direct fire from the AK 47 assault rifles.

Multi-Purpose Vessels and High Endurance Autonomous Vehicles

The Navy has got sanctions for procurement of Multi-Purpose Vessels and High Endurance Autonomous Vehicles.

Sources in the navy said these vessels are more like plug and play which means that they can be used for various purposes with the right equipment including for mine sweeping.

These vessels are meant to perform multi-role support functions such as maritime surveillance & patrol launching/ recovery of torpedoes and operation of various types of aerial surface and underwater targets for Gunnery/ ASW firing exercises.

The Navy has already inked a deal for two multi-purpose vessels with Larson and Tourbo in March this year.

The defence acquisition council (DAC) India’s apex procurement body accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for 24 capital acquisition proposals for the three services and the Indian Coast Guard the defence ministry said in a statement. Of these 21 proposals worth ₹82127 crore relate to future procurement from indigenous sources in what is being seen as a shot in the arm for the country’s self-reliance campaign.

Of the 24 capital acquisition proposals six are for Indian Army six for Indian Air Force 10 for Indian Navy and two for Indian Coast Guard.

“This initiative of DAC will not only modernise the armed forces but also provide substantial boost to the defence industry to achieve the goal of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India)” the ministry said.

Light tanks and FICVs are among the significant proposals cleared by DAC headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh. Under India’s defence procurement rules AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware. The army has been pursuing the development of light tanks for mountain warfare and FICVs amid the lingering 30-month standoff with the Chinese army along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.

The light tank is a key capability the army needs to tackle the increased threat that persists along LAC. The future tank has already been named “Zorawar” after Dogra king Gulab Singh’s legendary general Zorawar Singh. The army expects the light tank prototype development and trials in three years. It will be packed with cutting-edge technologies including drone integration active protection systems and superior situational awareness.

“The AoNs accorded will equip the Indian Army with platforms and equipment such as FICVs light tanks and mounted gun systems providing a quantum jump to its operational preparedness” the ministry said.

The FICV is one of the key indigenous capabilities that the mechanised infantry is eyeing other than night-fighting gear anti-drone weapons and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. These capabilities will transform the mechanised infantry into a more lethal agile and integrated force capable of delivering a swift and effective response in battle.

Several air force and naval projects were also cleared.

The Indian Air Force will be further strengthened with “enhanced lethal capabilities” through the induction of a new missile system long-range guided bombs and advanced surveillance systems the ministry said.

The naval hardware cleared includes new anti-ship missiles multi-purpose vessels and high endurance autonomous vehicles that “will further enhance maritime strength” it added.

Indigenisation of military hardware ranks among the government’s top priorities.

India imposed a phased import ban on 411 different weapons and systems during the last two years to provide a boost to the indigenous defence manufacturing sector. These weapons and platforms are expected to be indigenised in phases over the next five to six years.

Also the government has earmarked ₹84598 crore — 68% of the military’s capital acquisition budget for 2022-23 — for purchasing locally produced weapons and systems. The allocation for local defence purchases has climbed steadily over the last three years – the Centre had earmarked 64% (or ₹70221 crore) of military’s capital acquisition budget for the domestic sector in 2021-22 and 58% (or ₹51000 crore) of the capital budget in 2020-21.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbGVhZGVyc2hpcC5uZy95dWxldGlkZS1haXItcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1ncm9hbi1hcy1hdmlhdGlvbi1mdWVsLXNjYXJjaXR5LXdlYXRoZXItZGlzcnVwdC1mbGlnaHRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yuletide: Air Passengers Groan As Aviation Fuel Scarcity Weather Disrupt Flights,"The warning by Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) to air passengers to brace-up for flight disruption due to scarcity of Jet-A1 also known as aviation fuel is already playing out as passengers traveling for yuletide are stranded at various local airports.

LEADERSHIP gathered that passengers are stranded not because of Jet A1 scarcity but due to bad weather conditions at destinations.

Airline operators had on Tuesday warned passengers of impending disruption of flight operations due to persistent aviation fuel scarcity experienced in the country.

The operators disclosed that the fuel scarcity crisis would result to thousands of travelers stranded at the airports particularly during the yuletide.

In a press statement by the spokesman of AON Prof. Obiorah Okonkwo he disclosed that scarcity of jet fuel returned in the past few days.

However in a travel advisory released by Air Peace airline to customers on Thursday the airline said scarcity of aviation fuel alongside poor weather in some destinations are causing flight delays.

The airline however pleaded for understanding from passengers saying the airline was doing everything possible to reduce the impact on customers’ travel plans.

The advisory reads “the scarcity of aviation fuel alongside poor weather in some destinations is causing us flight delays today and we regret the resulting inconveniences.

We are doing everything possible to reduce the impact of this on your travel plans and plead for your understanding as we hope the situation improves soon.”

However an air traveller Frank Meke said his flight was delayed by over two hours while another airline cancelled his flight over ‘engineering issues’.

He said “ Ibom Air gave it to me today. From non availability of operating aircraft to scarcity of Aviation fuel. Two and half hours in prayers wondering if Ibom will lift us to our destination. Air Peace gave me its own shocker for a scheduled Monday afternoon flight to Canaan City completely cancelled due to ‘engineering issues’.

“If you must travel by air this yuletide brace for all manner of excuses. Just wondering again why flights to Enugu Owerri and Port Harcourt does not experience the tale by moon light stories from all the airlines?

“Good to know no more fighting and breaking of service counters Nigerians have given up complaints of poor services by our master servants the local air carriers.”

Also speaking a travel agent Lilian Ada said one of her client missed his meeting because of flight delay by an airline.

She said “My client who booked Enugu to Lagos 10:30am flight is very angry because his flight was delayed yesterday and he missed his meeting.”

Chineye Onyekuba also disclosed that she was delayed for over 4 hours at the airport before she could be lifted.

“What kind of weather? For more than 4hrs we’re still at the airport.

The light tank is a key capability the army needs to tackle the increased threat that persists along LAC. The army expects the light tank prototype development and trials in three years. It will be packed with cutting-edge technologies including drone integration active protection systems and superior situational awareness.

“The AoNs accorded will equip the Indian Army with platforms and equipment such as FICVs light tanks and mounted gun systems providing a quantum jump to its operational preparedness” the statement added.

As per reports several air force and naval projects were also cleared.

The Indian Air Force will be further strengthened with “enhanced lethal capabilities” through the induction of a new missile system long-range guided bombs and advanced surveillance systems and the naval hardware cleared includes new anti-ship missiles multi-purpose vessels and high endurance autonomous vehicles that “will further enhance maritime strength.

The Indian government has earmarked Rs 84598 crore that is 68 per cent of the military’s capital acquisition budget for 2022-23. The allocation for local defence purchases has climbed steadily over the last three years. (KNN Bureau)"

The star performers in the US Japan and China delivered twice the returns of the FTSE 100's top stocks according to data from eToro exclusively seen by This is Money.

Defence contractor BAE Systems has been the FTSE 100's top-performing stock this year having risen by around 54 per cent.

Top 10: The top 10 best performing stocks on the UK's FTSE 100 index in 2022

US matters: A table showing the top 10 performing S&P 500 stocks in 2022

BAE Systems an arms manufacturer has been bolstered in a year which saw Russia invade Ukraine and mounting global tensions.

Ben Laidler global markets strategist at eToro said: 'While the FTSE 100 may have lost ground in 2022 it has performed well by international standards and finishes the year as the best performing major international market.

'However as the data shows when you dig a little deeper the returns delivered by the UK's star performers pale in comparison to the returns offered by the leading US European and Asian stocks.

'There is no single reason for this but rather a multitude of factors which have held back UK-listed stocks this year. For example US oil stocks have not had to face punishing windfall taxes like BP and Shell have in the UK.'

Within Britain's blue-chip index the likes of Pearson and mining giant Glencore up 51 per cent and 43 per cent respectively.

Having raked in bumper profits shares in oil giants Shell and BP have also performed strongly rising around 41 per cent in the last 12 months.

Performance: The best performing UK stocks have lagged behind rivals in Asia and the US eToro said

British Gas owner Centrica shares have also performed strongly and are up around 30 per cent on a year ago. The company’s profits have soared boosted by record-high global gas and electricity prices although its UK consumer arm British Gas has suffered at home.

Centrica will hand £250million to shareholders via a recent buyback scheme as high wholesale prices put the firm on course for a six-fold increase in net profits compared to last year. The group posted a half-year profit of £1.34billion in July.

But the performance of individual stocks in the FTSE 100 index has been dwarfed by those elsewhere in the world.

For instance in the US Occidental Petroleum Group which is listed on the S&P 500 has seen its shares rise by 115 per cent in the past year which is more than double the gains enjoyed by FTSE 100-listed BAE Systems.

Even the US's tenth performing best S&P 500 stock APA Corp saw its shares jump over 60 per cent year-on-year.

A similar picture emerges when examining stocks in Japan and China. The ninth best-performing large-cap stock in Japan Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings has seen its shares rise by around 58 per cent while the tenth best performing stock in China Jinzhou Jixian Molybdenum Co has surged by 118 per cent in the last year according to eToro.

In China Zhonglu Co which manufacturers bicycles exercise equipment motorcycles mopeds saw its shares surge by 256 per cent over the period.

eToro's Laidler said: 'If you look at Japan the Yen is down more than 17 per cent against the dollar over the past year which has boosted the competitiveness of its firms.

'Sterling on the other hand is down just 7 per cent against the dollar over the past year resulting in a much weaker effect for UK-listed firms.

'And while China's economy has slowed sharply this year it is still growing at a much faster pace than the UK and has inflation of just 2 per cent.

'Taken as a whole though the FTSE 100 looks fairly attractive when judged against its peers. Overall it has benefited from a combination of cheap valuations high dividends and an attractive sector mix of oil stocks and traditional defensives from consumer staples to healthcare.'

He added: 'It's also worth remembering that stock markets are not economies and are not entirely dependant on one another to thrive.

'In fact if global uncertainty remains high in 2023 the FTSE 100 should thrive. Although equally the index's attractiveness will fade if the global economy settles interest rates begin to fall and investors recover their animal spirit.'

In 2021 the FTSE 100 closed at 7384 points having started the year at 6460 points. The FTSE 100 rose 14.3 per cent in 2021 representing its best year since 2016.

Looking to the here and now the blue-chip index was in positive territory for 2022 by a margin of 1.1 per cent at Thursday’s close.

At close on Friday the FTSE 100 was up 0.05 per cent or 3.73 points to 7473.01. In the US the S&P 500 has fallen by around 20 per cent in the last year.

A fairly weak pound has been helpful for the FTSE 100 which is packed with oil companies miners and pharmaceutical companies that make the greater part of their revenues in dollars but have sterling share prices.

Chris Beauchamp chief market analyst at IG said: 'Unless US markets can stage something of a late save this afternoon it is going to be a rather sour end to the year for stocks.

'In such a tough year for stocks it is an achievement for the FTSE 100 to finish for Christmas more or less flat for the year so far while others have suffered much more.

'But with the global economy staring a recession in the face there is unlikely to be too much optimism heading into the new year.'",,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple's elegant design cutting-edge technology and history of the invention have made its products incredibly sought-after for a very long time. Due to its reputation for superior craftsmanship and svelte design products from Apple like the iPod iPad iMac and iPhone are frequently viewed as status symbols. Apple is rnow widely known as one of the most prosperous and well-known technological businesses in the world because of its commitment to design and user-firendly experience.In 1998 the iMac Apple's first computer was released. At that period of time the internet was just beginning its rapid ascent to popularity as a key selling point for PCs.By making the iMac's internet connection quicker and easier than its competitors Apple capitalised on this trend. The iMac's elegant appearance was its key selling point. Of course compared to other computers at the time it also had a contemporary and compact design.Steve Jobs a co-founder of Apple and a former CEO declared during the iMac's introduction that the device was created to allow users to fully utilise the internet's boundless potential. Because of this 'I' stood for ""internet"" while ""Mac"" was for ""Macintosh.""Jobs was quick to clarify that this wasn't even close to being everything that the letter 'I' might indicate though. He covered the many applications of the prefix on a slide.Internet: As previously said.Individual: Users may express themselves and show personality using Apple's iMac.Instruct: Make sure the product is used both inside and outside of the classroom as a learning tool.Inform: There are many options for learning when using a Macintosh to access the internet.Inspire: The iMac was created to motivate people to produce wonderful content and goods.The company began veering away from the 'I' path in 2014 when Apple's current CEO Tim Cook unveiled the Apple Watch.

The custom chips it designs make its products snappier to use or help them eke out an hour or more of extra battery life. Last year though Apple’s chip department hit a serious setback.

Apple planned a generational leap for the graphics processor in the latest version of its high-end smartphones the iPhone 14 Pro. But engineers were too ambitious with adding new features and early prototypes drew more power than what the company had expected based on software simulations. That could have hurt battery life and made the device too hot according to two people with direct knowledge of the incident. Because Apple discovered the mistake late in development it had to base the graphics processor in its iPhone 14 Pro line—which powers the phone’s user interface games and everything else visible on its screen—largely on the design of the chip that went into last year’s iPhone model according to four people familiar with the matter.

Those people described the snafu which hasn’t been previously reported as unprecedented in the group’s history. The iPhone 14 Pro models which went on sale in September showed only small gains in graphics performance compared to the leaps prior generations of iPhones had made over their predecessors according to testing by independent chip-benchmarking firms."
AMAT,Applied Materials,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5ldG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIxMjIzMjAwMDAz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Applied Materials Background of Trillions (KRW) in Investment is Government Support,"The US’ Applied Materials the world’s biggest semiconductor equipment company is setting out to invest trillions (KRW) in the new year. Applied Materials announced that they will invest several billions of dollars in R&D and the expansion of production facilities. They will begin investing at the start of the new year. They will start by building a next-generation applied materials R&D center in Sunnyvale California. They will use this as a key base for advanced material engineering and the development of semiconductor technology and processing equipment. The new R&D center is expected to be an innovative technology platform that collaborates with local universities and the US’ National Semiconductor Technology Center in addition to conducting joint research with semiconductor manufacturers from around the world.



They will also begin investments in equipment. The main target for investment is the factory in Austin Texas. Applied Materials has been mass-producing equipment here since 1993. Austin is where Samsung Electronics’ first foundry factory (FAB) is located and is adjacent to the city of Taylor where the second FAB is being built. This is seen as their intent to respond to the demands of Samsung Electronics’ foundry.



Applied Materials’ actions can be interpreted as their attempt to accelerate R&D investment during a downturn in the semiconductor market and widen the gap in technology. They plan to preoccupy next-generation technology to stay at the forefront of semiconductor equipment companies. Semiconductors are characterized by repeated ups and downs following cycles of booms and busts. Companies that actively invest in R&D during downturns in the semiconductor industry lead the market when it rebounds. Applied Materials’ investment can be interpreted as their strategy to strengthen technical capacities and production capabilities to respond to foundry-centered system semiconductor demands in 2024~2025.

The US government’s semiconductor support policies are taking place behind Applied Materials’ investments. The ‘CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS ACT)’ which sets up subsidies of 52 billion dollars (around 66.3 trillion KRW) for the construction of semiconductor chip manufacturing factories and research facilities in the US is the strong background behind these actions. The California state grants allocated earlier this year is also driving investment. Applied Materials revealed that the total amount of investment is subject to fluctuate depending on the size of the subsidies from the CHIPS Act and state grants. This emphasizes the fact that government and state government support is driving investment. In the future there is a high possibility that other semiconductor material component and equipment companies and manufacturers will be empowered by these support measures and expand their investments in the US.



Applied Materials is increasing their investments not only in the US but also in their global bases. On the 22nd (local time) they held a ceremony to commemorate their investments to expand Singapore’s regional infrastructure. A R&D center for the development of advanced packaging is located in Singapore. Applied Materials will also build a R&D center in Korea. It will be a research base to strengthen their cooperation with Korean semiconductor manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. It has been said that the selection of the R&D center site in Gyeonggi-do is imminent.

Near-infrared light is used in a wide range of applications on a daily basis such as in infrared cameras (night vision cameras) infrared communication (wireless communication) optical fiber communication remote control and biometric authentication. The detection of weak light in the near-infrared region and improvement of sensitivity are indispensable for the advancement in optical communication technology medical diagnosis environmental monitoring and other fields. Compound semiconductors (e.g. InGaAs) having an optimal absorption band of 900–1700 nm are used to detect light in the near-infrared region. However these systems are expensive because of their complicated manufacturing process that involves the use of rare metals and is limited by noise interference. Moreover such semiconductors do not exhibit visible light detection accuracy comparable to that achieved using silicon (Si) and other compounds.

The research team has developed core–shell lanthanide based- upconversion (1) nanoparticles that can convert weak near-infrared light to visible light with high efficiency. Furthermore by developing a near-infrared photodetector (photodiode) that combines these nanoparticles with an inorganic semiconductor material ( lead halide perovskite )(2) that responds to visible light they succeeded in converting the difficult-to-detect weak near-infrared light into electrical signals with an efficiency of 75%. In other words by using the novel inexpensive and simple method of converting near-infrared light—which is considered difficult to detect with high sensitivity—to visible light that can be detected with high precision by using existing technologies and materials the team has achieved drastic improvement in the efficiency of weak near-infrared light detection.

This achievement promotes the proposal of a new resource- and energy-saving near-infrared light detection method using a nanomaterial that converts low-energy near-infrared light to high-energy visible light. As this technology enables weak light in the near-infrared region whose detection and utilization are difficult even in sunlight by converting it to visible light it can significantly improve the near-infrared light reception sensitivity of optical sensors and the efficiency of sunlight utilization in artificial photosynthesis of solar cells among others.

The research was conducted in collaboration with Specially Appointed Professor Tsutomu Miyasaka of Toin University of Yokohama. In this research project “Development of organic–inorganic hybrid interfaces for a one-photon sensing device” in the domain of “Fully-controlled photons and their proactive usage for new era creation” under the JST Strategic Basic Research Program PRESTO the team has aimed at overcoming the limits of sensing functions such as light reception measurement and imaging by realizing ultra-sensitive photodetection that involves the sensing of light at the single-photon level. By adopting a material-chemical approach wherein the organic and inorganic materials are fused at the interface this research aims to develop multifunctional and highly sensitive photodetectors that can provide information related to various aspects of light (e.g. wavelength and anisotropy (polarization)) to the maximum extent possible at the single-photon level.

*(1) Upconversion

Upconversion is a phenomenon wherein two or more photons are successively absorbed to emit light with a shorter wavelength than the excitation wavelength. Upconversion can be utilized to convert low-energy light such as near-infrared light to high-energy light such as visible light or ultraviolet light. Representative mechanisms include two-photon absorption and triplet–triplet annihilation in organic materials and multi-step excitation of nanoparticles containing rare earth ions; these mechanisms have been extensively researched.

*(2) Lead halide perovskites

Lead halide perovskites are one of the semiconductor materials expected to replace Si as the next-generation solar cell material. Although the material exhibits a high energy conversion efficiency of over 20% its bandgap can only absorb visible light in a limited range of less than 800 nm. Perovskite films can be easily fabricated by the spin-coating technology thereby enabling lower cost manufacturing and lower energy consumption than those of inorganic semiconductor materials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHdpcmVhc2lhLmNvbS8xMi8yMDIyL2h1YXdlaS1oYXMtcmFuLW91dC1vZi1jaGlwcy1mb3Itc21hcnRwaG9uZXMtYXMtdXMtc2FuY3Rpb24tY3JpcHBsZWQtdGhlLWNoaW5lc2UtdGVsZWNvbS1naWFudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huawei has ran out of chips for smartphones as US sanction crippled the Chinese telecom giant,"Counterpoint Research revealed that the US trade sanctions has led to Huawei depleting its smartphone chipsets inventory from the company’s HiSilicon chip design arm.

It shows how the US trade sanctions have effectively cut the company’s access to advanced new chips.

Both Huawei and HiSilicon were added to the US government’s trade blacklist known as the Entity List in 2019.

When Huawei Technologies Co once China’s biggest smartphone vendor along with its chip design arm HiSilicon were added into the US’ trade blacklist known as the Entity List in 2019 the company saw a US$12 billion shortfall in its revenue within the same year. The company struggled with supply continuity while having to increase its R&D tremendously. Its smartphone business started deteriorating and three years later the situation appears to be worsening for the Chinese tech giant.

At the point when the sanctions were just implemented research firms like Haitong and Canalys indicated that Huawei had been stockpiling critical US components for almost a year. Even HiSilicon said it had a backup plan to ensure the group’s survival. Three years since Huawei has been added into the trade sanctions and recently Huawei had depleted the entire inventory of its smartphone chipsets from HiSilicon.

In a report by Hong Kong-based firm Counterpoint Research it is highlighted that HiSilicon’s share in the global smartphone market had finally reached zero in the third quarter of this year after declining to 0.4% in the second quarter from 3% the same period last year. Basically the Counterpoint data reflects the effectiveness of the US restriction that has expanded over the years from was first enacted in May 2019.

HUAWEI TO IMPROVE DIGITAL WORLD CONNECTIVITY FOR 120 MILLION PEOPLE IN REMOTE AREAS

Prior to the tightened US sanctions HiSilicon accounted for 16% of the global chipset market share (as of the second quarter of 2020) according to Counterpoint data on the back of its shipments of advanced Kirin chips used on Huawei’s smartphones. HiSilicon also dropped out of the rankings of the world’s top 25 semiconductor vendors because of the stifling US trade restrictions which also reduced China’s overall share in the global chip market according to a report published in April by research firm Gartner.

How did the US drag Huawei down?

To recall it started with the Trump administration that placed the firm along with its chip division HiSilicon and 113 other subsidiaries on the US Department of Commerce’s so-called Entity List on the grounds of national security concerns. The move prevented the company and its affiliates from obtaining American-made components software and other technology from US organizations unless it received a special license.

To put it simply should Huawei intend to buy chips from US firms like Intel or Qualcomm or purchase chip-making equipment from US-based firms like KLA or Applied Materials there would be red tapes for their requests to be approved. Following the move in mid 2019 the Trump administration expanded restrictions on Huawei by blocking the company from acquiring semiconductors that were manufactured overseas using US software or hardware — unless it received permission from the US.

The move was a major step in curtailing Huawei’s silicon efforts because it meant the firm likely couldn’t turn to a contract chip manufacturer like TSMC to fabricate its designs if the foundry was using any US equipment or design tools. As anticipated a few months later chip giant TSMC announced that it would no longer manufacture chips for Huawei due to the US rules.

Therefore Huawei is where it is today: out of advanced chips from its HiSilicon division and are only left with 4G chipsets from US firm Qualcomm obtained through a special license for its latest flagship smartphones. For a while the company bought time by stockpiling components to delay its fate but as Counterpoint’s report shows the depletion of the advanced chipsets designed by HiSilicon was an inevitability.

“Based on our checks and sell-thru data Huawei has finished the inventory for the Hisilicon chipsets. It is also not possible for the brand to obtain newer chipsets from TSMC Samsung etc. because of the trade ban” Counterpoint said. As for the market for smartphone system-on-a-chip shipments in the third quarter it was led by MediaTek Qualcomm and Apple.

Frankly Huawei has seen its market share in the last three years falling in its home market but as of the third quarter the company remained out of the top-five vendor rankings in China data from tech market research firm Canalys shows. Once a 5G champion both in China and globally Huawei since 2020 have not been able to offer 5G in its latest phones.

Now there are talks that the tech giant may finally relaunch 5G smartphones as soon as next year. Before being added into the Entity List Huawei used to produce Kirin chipsets designed by HiSilicon and manufactured by leading chipmaker TSMC. But now the company may be reworking on its phones to use less advanced chips made by Chinese companies that will enable 5G.

This may just be the biggest challenge Huawei is dealing with right now and its quest to overcome the US restrictions will determine if the Chinese telecom giant reclaim its position as the world’s biggest smartphone vendor.",,,

The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

What Makes Art Appealing to Billionaire Investors?

Art investment holds a strong appeal for billionaires due to several critical factors:

Wealth Preservation: Art as demonstrated by the works of iconic artists such as Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat embodies enduring value providing a dependable means of safeguarding wealth across generations. Diversification: Unlike conventional financial assets art frequently operates independently of stock markets. This independence offers stability during times of market turbulence making art an attractive component of diversified investment portfolios. Privacy: The discretion of the art market enables investors to execute transactions without the public disclosure requirements associated with securities trading. This confidentiality adds an extra layer of privacy to their financial activities appealing to those who value discretion in their investment strategies.

Can Individual Investors See The Same Returns As The Ultra-Wealthy?

According to the UBS Billionaires Report 2022 30% of billionaires possess art collections averaging $300 million in value. Despite these impressive figures many wonder why more people don’t invest in art.

Beginning on May 31 Season 1 of the animated sci-fi drama will begin streaming on Netflix in the U.S. the U.K. Ireland and New Zealand. The Netflix deal is non-exclusive meaning the episodes will remain available on Max. Sources tell Variety that Netflix is considering picking up “Scavengers Reign” for a second season but a decision won’t be made until after Season 1’s debut on the streamer.

The series is set on an alien planet where a damaged interstellar freighter ship gets stranded and follows the remaining crew as they struggle to locate their ship and missing crewmates while navigating a hostile world that has thrived without human interference.

Variety named “Scavengers Reign” one of the top 19 shows of 2023 with critic Alison Herman writing that it “pairs the engrossing ambience of a nature documentary with the propulsive thrust of narrative. Its characters are fully realized and flawed but their main scene partners are an environment they need to intuit the workings of alongside the audience. The 12-episode season is a deep cut worth seeking out (or renewing if you’re the powers that be and Warner Bros. Discovery).”

Popular on Variety

“Scavengers Reign” was created Joseph Bennett and Charles Huettner who executive produce alongside Chris Prynoski. Sean Buckelew and James Merrill serve as co-executive producers with Benjy Brooke as supervising director. The series was produced by Green Street Pictures in partnership with Titmouse Inc.

“We are beyond thrilled that ‘Scavengers Reign’ will be joining the incredible animation lineup on Netflix” said Bennett Buckelew Merrill and Brooke on behalf of Green Street. “We’re immensely grateful to everyone who has watched the show already and to Netflix for giving it an opportunity to be discovered by a wider audience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTY4OTcyODU10gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNjg5NzI4NTUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Test-at-home kit for cancer patients approved for use,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bbc.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/technology-68972855 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225EA6980>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTY4OTcyODU10gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNjg5NzI4NTUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The natural gas distributor calls for energy conservation while .

Friday morning several Atmos Energy customers reported little to no natural gas pressure at their homes. In Central Texas Atmos serves the area north of Austin.

So far Atmos Energy has not provided an update on how many people total are affected.

Lisa Zolidis resides in Cedar Park. Around 9:15 in the morning she noticed that her gas supply was out. CBS Austin spoke with Zolidis before noon.

“I noticed that both of our heaters had just gone off and our furnaces are gas-powered so maybe wondered whether we had a gas outage or not” said Zolidis.

Melissa Taylor also resides in Cedar Park. Around 6 in the morning her husband noticed their gas pressure was down. They tried to see if it was a problem on their end but realized it was a bigger issue. Taylor found several social media posts from residents in the surrounding neighborhoods that were also experiencing an outage.

“We have not gone completely without gas but other people close to us have and my son that lives in Georgetown has no gas” said Taylor.

Several people that are experiencing issues are growing frustrated by Atmos Energy’s lack of communication. They’ve made infrequent social media posts calling for energy conservation. Meanwhile it took more than an hour for Zolidis and Taylor to connect with an operator at Atmos while their thermostats continued to drop.

“As I was getting off the phone with the Atmos Energy operator which apparently had just been called in to start answering phones because there had been so many she said it was an outage they were having problems from Cedar Park to Hutto” said Taylor.

The operators informed both Cedar Park residents that they were waiting for a technician to come to their houses. By 2:30 p.m. both reported having their gas back.



CBS Austin requested an interview with Atmos Energy. They responded with this information:

Thank you for reaching out. Please let your audience know that we are experiencing high call volumes due to colder than normal temperatures and there may be a significant wait time to speak with an agent. If this is not an emergency or if they are calling about the status of a previous order we are working as quickly as possible to get a service technician to their home. If this is an emergency please hold and an agent will answer their call as quickly as possible.

Due to extreme temperatures and high natural gas usage Atmos Energy is urging residents to conserve natural gas usage during these extreme winter temperatures to help maintain gas service. Atmos Energy is closely monitoring the weather and staging its employees across the system.

“It’s kind of difficult to take those precautions when it's super super cold like it is right now” said Zolidis.

CBS Austin responded to Atmos Energy’s statement with these questions:

We’re hearing that people are experiencing outages ranging from Cedar Park to Round Rock to Hutto. How widespread is the outage and how many customers are impacted? Some customers have been without power since 6 in the morning. What are the wait times like to get a technician to them? What are you doing to prevent outages? Customers are frustrated they can’t see where Atmos is experiencing demand/troubles making it hard for them to prepare. Will you release more information on your website? Are rolling outages planned?

So far Atmos Energy has not responded to CBS Austin’s questions. While some residents are getting their gas back many are still waiting for answers.

“What is the solution what can we do as people in this area so nobody goes without gas for 5 days” said Taylor “is it going to be like the power grid thing again?”

CBS Austin reached out to the Railroad Commission of Texas. They responded with this statement at 1 p.m.:

The Railroad Commission is aware of some localized low-pressure issues due to extremely high demand in areas served by Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division. Atmos is working to increase pressure in the system and to continue to work tickets for customers who experienced low-pressure issues. Atmos’ customer call center is open. Additional resources have been added to handle the call volumes and work customer tickets. Atmos Mid-Tex reported there is no gas supply issues overall in the system at this time. The Commission remains in close communication with Atmos and will provide updates as we get them.

The City of Leander at Life Church located at 1393 E. Woodview Drive for people needing a place to go. The warming shelter will be open all night on Friday.

Due to Atmos Energy experiencing all-time high gas demands as a result of inclement weather multiple customers in northwest and southwest Leander are experiencing outages. The City of Leander is working with Atmos officials to assist where possible and communicate with affected residents.

The City of Cedar Park is posting updates on its social media channels. The latest saying that Atmos Energy informed the city there was a drop in pressure and their system is in recovery.

The City of Cedar Park is monitoring the issue for Atmos Energy customers. Atmos shared with us that there was a drop in pressure and their system is in recovery. For those who have made reports to Atmos they shared that they plan to send a technician to their address. Atmos encourages customers to call their emergency number at 866-322-8667 so that they may send a tech to the affected address. Please refer to Atmos' website www.atmosenergy.com and social media Atmos Energy on Facebook and https://twitter.com/atmosenergy for any additional updates and information about their issue.

If it is determined that there is a need later today Cedar Park Homeland Security and Emergency Management is prepared to open warming centers and will update social media and news media accordingly.

Atmos gave the following tips to help save energy:



Do not use your natural gas fireplace.

Lower your thermostat to at least 68 degrees. Consider wearing additional layers of clothing and turning down the thermostat even lower.

Businesses should minimize energy usage as much as possible.

Lower the water heater temperature to 120 degrees because it can account for as much as 25 percent of the energy consumed in your home.

Unplug electronic devices and turn off lights that are not in use. By conserving electricity you are also helping to conserve natural gas which keeps the power on.

Reduce shower time and avoid baths. Showering accounts for about 40 percent of your home’s hot water use.

Refrain from using large appliances like your washer dryer oven and dishwasher for the next few days. When in use limit opening the oven door to prevent wasted energy.

If you have a pool do not use the pool heater. Instead run your pool pump during the coldest part of the day to circulate the water and prevent freezing.

The Railroad Commission of Texas sent an update saying the following:

""Gas pressure for Atmos Energy has improved in affected areas. Atmos brought in CNG for its systems. The company is maintaining employees in the area overnight.""

FOX 7 Austin received numerous calls and emails early Friday morning from customers without heat who have no hot water and are unable to use their stoves.

A water freeze up along a Cedar Park roadway caused by an irrigation system is an indication of just how cold it got Friday morning. Another was the thermostat in the Hutto home of Ryan Pugh.

""Well woke up to a house that was 58 degrees. Immediately came over to the range turned it on. We had zero to none gas pressure so I knew the furnace was basically turned off at that point. I immediately called Atmos Energy and couldn't get a hold of anybody even through the hotline"" said Pugh.

Those who did get through got a long wait. Ryan Pugh isn’t the only one with a low thermostat. Other residents reported low flow rates into their home. HVAC repairmen say that also prevents furnaces from working properly.

On social media the mayor of Leander posted: ""This is unfortunately a widespread issue. Parts of Leander Cedar Park Lago Vista Round Rock Hutto & Sun City are all impacted. We have set up a warming center at Life Church.""

Atmos Energy on its website urged customers to conserve energy. In a statement sent to FOX 7 a company spokesperson said: ""Atmos Energy is closely monitoring the weather and staging its employees across the system.""

An Atmos worker was seen at a gas connection site in Cedar Park. Gas could be heard flowing through it apparently thanks to a large wrench connected to a valve. Officials in Cedar Park indicated the problem was caused by a drop in pressure.

Atmos Energy like other natural gas providers in Texas is regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission. In a statement sent to FOX 7 an agency spokesperson said: ""Atmos is working to increase pressure in the system.""

The Railroad Commission was also told that Atmos had brought in extra personnel to handle the calls. As for what caused the pressure problem state officials only said the company ""reported there is no gas supply issues overall in the system at this time.""

The shortage has only fueled doubts in the state utility system. As for Ryan Pugh that includes the electrical back-up system he got for his home.

""When we lost electricity in the ice apocalypse I basically purchased the generator thinking you know if it happened again you know we would be safe. I bought a bunch of you know heaters for the floor in case we did for whatever reason to lose it. But obviously if you know we don't have an abundant supply of natural gas I mean that's a useless $10000 that I just spent"" said Pugh.

The Texas Railroad Commission which oversees oil and natural gas production in the state released a statement to FOX 7 Austin:

""The Railroad Commission is aware of some localized low-pressure issues due to extremely high demand in areas served by Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division. Atmos is working to increase pressure in the system and to continue to work tickets for customers who experienced low-pressure issues. Atmos’ customer call center is open. Additional resources have been added to handle the call volumes and work customer tickets. Atmos Mid-Tex reported there is no gas supply issues overall in the system at this time. The Commission remains in close communication with Atmos and will provide updates as we get them.""

Atmos Energy is urging customers to conserve natural gas usage during these extreme winter temperatures to help maintain gas service:

Do not use your natural gas fireplace.

Lower your thermostat to at least 68 degrees. Consider wearing additional layers of clothing and turning down the thermostat even lower.

Businesses should minimize energy usage as much as possible.

Lower the water heater temperature to 120 degrees because it can account for as much as 25 percent of the energy consumed in your home.

Unplug electronic devices and turn off lights that are not in use. By conserving electricity you are also helping to conserve natural gas which keeps the power on.

The joint research effort produced this metal 3D-printed turbine center frame (TCF) casing using direct metal laser melting (DMLM) technology. Image courtesy of GE Aerospace.

Last summer Kylie Jenner’s 17-minute private jet trip sparked social media outrage. Private jets and fuel waste are increasingly under scrutiny from the public at large. A recent report from Yard provided a who’s-who of celebrity Private jet carbon footprints — from Taylor Swift to Blake Shelton Oprah Steven Spielberg and Jay-Z.

Private jets are just one component of a huge carbon emissions challenge with the aviation industry. We’re all part of it every time we travel. Celebrities—they’re just like us. (Well sort of…)

Global travel and shipping have reached new heights. According to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) commercial aviation alone produces approximately 2.4% of global carbon emissions. To put that in perspective this number ranks the industry in between the entire emissions of Germany and Japan.

Finding a solution is paramount and the European Union’s Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking is taking action. It has issued approximately €4 billion in grants to research projects aimed at increasing aircraft fuel efficiency. The goal is to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% by 2030.

Joint research for the metal 3D-printed turbine center frame

One part of Clean Aviation’s research effort is MOnACO (short for “manufacturing of a large-scale additive manufacturing component”) with participants including GE Aerospace’s Advanced Technology team in Munich the Dresden University of Technology Hamburg University of Technology and the Autodesk UK team. Their goal? Reimagine the design optimization and validation of a large-scale aircraft engine’s turbine center frame and use additive manufacturing. And the hard part? The turbine center frame consists of 100 parts.

“What we ultimately set out to do was merge those parts into one” says Andy Harris a senior principal research engineer at Autodesk Research in London in a recent Redshift article. “Streamlining the turbine center frame makes the component easier to manufacture and most important lighter. By reducing the weight of the turbine center frame you use less fuel and therefore produce fewer carbon emissions. Also using less fuel makes the aircraft cheaper to operate. So there’s an economic benefit as well as an environmental benefit.”

Using generative design in Fusion 360 to find a solution

After defining design parameters and performance requirements in Fusion 360 MOnACO used generative design to evaluate and explore the options. The team rigorously tested structural fluid and manufacturing simulations for ideal parts. This was followed by prototyping to understand the behavior and inform the next iterations to improve stiffness mass reduction and pressure drop. Autodesk Volumetric Kernel for aerothermal management was a key component for the final iteration. The team also turned to additive manufacturing to find even further efficiencies in the manufacturing process.

With the final design a full-scale prototype was manufactured in a GE additive manufacturing facility with additional post-processing completed at an Autodesk facility for verification. The results were eye-popping mass savings of more than 30%.

While this is just the very beginning it’s one step toward helping bring a new level of fuel and carbon emission savings to the aviation industry.

In our digital age the animation is a significant component of multimedia. So if you’re a digital artist this best face animation software might be handy for you.

Don’t be confused this type of software is different than face blurring software and it’s intended for digital artists and today we’ll show you the best tools to choose from.

What is the best face animation software out there?

By now Adobe has cemented its position as one of the top software companies.

Animate makes no exception. Formerly known as Flash Animate is a new and more intuitive iteration of the same basic principle.

Ease of use and a nice learning curve are some of the reasons why Animate can be a great option. On the downside you will have to draw your characters by hand which will require some time.

An alternative to this would be Adobe’s Character Animator which relies on motion capture to generate a character. So if you lack the drawing skills or the time Character Animator is worth considering.

But on the other side if you are more into drawing then know that with Animator you can save and reuse your puppets/characters and automatically animate them through video performance capture.

Being part of the Adobe family it’s not surprising that Animate can communicate with other programs from the Adobe suite.

Integration with tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator is in fact one of Animator’s strongest points.

Key features that make Character Animator worth considering:

Easy to pick up even without previous experience with other animation software

Frame-by-frame animation feature

Integration with Photoshop Illustrator and After Effects for quick file transfer

Vector drawing tools far crisp animation

Video performance capture for automated animation

Adobe Animate To take your facial animation skills to the next level a tool like Adobe Animate can make a huge difference. Check price Visit Website

Autodesk Maya or simply Maya is one of the market’s complete 3D computer animation and rendering software.

Maya’s overall complexity definitely makes it one of the best face animation software out there but it also makes it more challenging to learn.

But if you are looking to animate a face for a more complex project such as a short animated movie then Maya is your answer. It’s perfectly compatible with Adobe Illustrator meaning you can easily transfer your vectors.

This paired with an extensive library of dynamic effects (the interactive hair grooming effect is just one of the jaw-dropping possibilities) will allow you to create close-to-life animations.

Maya comes with a generous 30-day free trial and supports an Educational Version. This means students can apply for a 3-year valid license.

Autodesk Maya also supports a geometry conversion option. Translated this option means you can transform any complex geometrical layout into a topology.

Just be aware before stepping in that Maya doesn’t support the most friendly and modern UI. That’s partly what makes it more difficult to learn than other options in this list.

But if you are willing to put in the time and the effort then Maya is definitely one of the best choices.

Key features of Maya:

Create realistic close-to-life characters

A library of preexisting templates to get your project started

Multiple viewing angles for more granular control over your character

3D environments to put your character into a world

Various animation effects to turn 3D models into moving objects

Different tools and brushes for drawing or sketching detail

Autodesk Maya A complete solution for animating your ideas and rendering them into reality. Free trial Visit Website

Blender is a free open-source software that has gradually become one of the leading programs for anything related to computer graphics.

The free aspect is not the only appealing thing about Blender. Apart from being one of the best face animation software to date you can do pretty much everything with it.

Unlike Adobe’s Character Animator Blender also supports its drawing tool. Therefore you won’t have to bother with installing other third-party apps for this.

The current version further simplifies the learning process by adding dozens of new nodes you can discover with a simple search inside the program.

Blender is especially great for creating animated characters. What makes Blender stand out from its competition are its lighting effects textures and different materials.

Speaking of materials there is an immense library out there so you can make your pick.

What’s also great is that Blender’s UI is customizable. This is excellent news for those who felt slightly intimidated by Maya.

For those with programming skills Blender supports a Python API which can run scripts that can further customize your layout colors interface etc.

In summary because of its free open-source nature we can safely say Blender is easily one of the best face animation software to date.

Here are some of Blender’s key features:

Create poses for your character that you can store in your own library

Advanced sound synchronization

Sculpting with masks and dynamic topology

Motion tracking

Real-time preview of the tracked footage

Extensive node library to enhance your compositions

A titan amongst 3D animation software applications Houdini is used by companies such as Disney Pixar and DreamWorks just to name a few.

When deciding which is the best face animation software a strong case can be made for Houdini. Why is that?

For starters their character animation options are close to unparalleled. Not only can you animate your face but you also have complete control over details such as muscles flesh fibers hair and others.

Also their new patch introduced an additional feature called KineFX. So if motion detection is your thing then your character’s place is definitely in Houdini’s Studio.

If you think Houdini is your answer then you should know that a free option is also available. It’s not as potent as the paid one but it’s enough to give a sense of how this software works.

Houdini is best for creating simulations of anything fluid. Some prime examples include smoke fire particle movement hair and everything that entails natural movement.

In a nutshell Houdini is a fantastic tool for creating effects for a scene. Although you can make the whole scene in Houdini most of the time the modeling and rigging of the character are done with other tools.

In a sense Houdini is the best face animation out there as it’s primarily used for creating effects and animating a scene or a character.

Some of Houdini’s key features include:

Advanced facial rigging software

Motion capture support

Keyframes for controlling your animations and geometric modeling

Advanced body dynamics

Powerful volumetric systems

⇒ Get Houdini

Cinema 4D is one of the leading software programs for 3D modeling and animation.

What makes Cinema 4D an amazing product is its optimization protocol. New features are added gradually every year making Cinema one of the best face animation software programs to date.

The learning isn’t as steep as with Houdini making it an ideal option even for beginners. In addition there is also an unrestricted free trial for you to try out all the features Cinema 4D offers.

Cinema 4D is best for photorealistic renders and 3D animations. What sets it apart from Blender and Maya is its user interface.

There is no denying that Cinema 4D sports one of the most intuitive and friendly interfaces in the 3D modeling industry.

It’s fast flexible and incredibly robust making it a fantastic choice especially if you are just starting your journey into visual effects.

Another highlight is its procedural and polygonal modeling. This granular node-based control allows for precise control in creating demanding video game graphics complex architectural landscapes or motion graphics.

Talking about motion graphics Cinema also has a built-in tool called Mograph. What Mograph does is speed up or accelerate your animations to the desired degree.

This is an incredible feature that further adds to Cinema’s flexibility and rationality. What do we mean by rationality? Mainly that Cinema is intuitive and very logically structured.

Cinema 4D key features:

Lens distortion support

Houdini engine integration

SketchUp integration

Easy-to-use flexible interface great for beginners

Timeline view and filtering

Advanced pose library for creating dynamic characters

⇒ Get Cinema 4D

Choosing the best face animation software will largely depend on your goals. Another thing to take into consideration is time as some of them have a pretty steep learning curve.

In terms of overall performance features and cost there is no denying that Houdini is a top choice. Although not as easy to learn as Cinema 4D and Adobe Character Animator the result will be worth the effort.

And that’s about all from us. If you’re looking to get into the world of animation consider using whiteboard animation software as well.

Feel free to leave us a comment and let us know what is your favorite software for animation.",,,,,,

Considering that the available spectra from our own experiments are not enough for training a deep learning model we built a spectrum database containing 250000 simulated spectra which are synthesized based on real ionization edges obtained from experiments/literature. The various physical phenomena in experiments are embedded into the synthesized spectra by convolving the broadening effects and simulating the instability with randomness. In addition edges from different experiments can have different quality and energy resolutions which help to further diversify the database. The simulated spectra are in close resemblance to the real EELS spectra and are suitable for our CNN-BiLSTM network training.

Edge modeling

We digitized around 400 core-loss edges covering 20 different elements from journal papers. The edges are then fitted by using the multi-gaussian model to locate the coordinates of the peaks and smooth out the noise effects as shown in Fig. 1a13. Figure 1b presents some examples of the fitted edges for different elements. We can notice that the fitted curves round off the noise fluctuations well with the near edge fine features well preserved.

In the real case when a spectrum is recorded by the detector the instrument broadening is also convolved in it. Therefore we further processed the modeled edges by convolving them with the corresponding broadening function i.e. the point spread function (PSF). The intensity with scattering effect can be expressed as I r :

$${I}_{r}\left(E\right)={I}_{u}(E)\otimes {PSF}_{ZLP}$$

where I u is the original intensity without the broadening effect and E is the energy loss.

The scattering effect is composed of amonochromaticity of the beam and broadening due to the detectors. Thus PSF is constructed by two terms:

$${PSF}_{ZLP}\propto {PSF}_{amono}\otimes {PSF}_{detector}$$

where PSF amono represents the energy spread of the incoming electron beam and PSF detector represents the broadening in the detectors. For the amonochromaticity effect the form of the Gaussian distribution function is used:

$${PSF}_{amono}\propto {e}^{-\frac{{E}^{2}}{2{\sigma }^{2}}}$$

where σ is the standard deviation and can be expressed by:

$$\sigma = \frac{{FWHM}_{g}}{2\sqrt{2\mathrm{ln}2}}$$

FWHM g is the full-width half-maximum of the Gaussian distribution. In our data augmentation it ranges from 0.1 to 1.6.

For the detector broadening effect the Lorentzian distribution function is commonly used to describe the diffused tail (caused by light diffusion in the scintillator and the optical fiber coupler) which is expressed by:

$${PSF}_{detector}\propto \frac{{HWHM}_{l}}{{E}^{2}+{HWHM}_{l}^{2}}$$

HWHM l is the full width at half maximum of the Lorentzian distribution. In our data augmentation it ranges from 0.1 to 0.6.

With the broadening effects convolved the synthesized edges will be comparable to those obtained from the different instruments. Figure 1c shows the Mn–L edge before and after convolving the PSF. We can observe that the broadening effect of the point spread functions (PSFs) has been successfully embedded into the modeled edge. It is worth mentioning that the Lorentzian broadening is often neglected by researchers in the field but it is a critical broadening effect that shall be included to reproduce an experimental EELS spectrum.

Background and jump ratio

In the core-loss region of the spectrum it has been commonly accepted that the background can be modeled by using the inverse power law equation:

$$J(E)\propto {E}^{-r}$$

where r can vary across the specimen as a result of changes in thickness and composition. Typically the value of r fluctuates around 1.88. In our case we assign the value based on a normal distribution with a mean of 1.88 and a standard deviation of 0.2. The values less than 0.1 in the normal distribution are cut off to guarantee that the background remains realistic.

To embed the modeled edges into the background the jump ratios of the edges must be assigned. The jump ratio is defined as the ratio of the intensity difference between the peak intensity and the background I p and the intensity of the edge start point I o  which is shown in Fig. 2. In our synthesized spectrum the minimum jump ratio of the edges is set to 0.15. Because using data with too low a SNR for training would result in overfitting and high false positive rate we choose a noticeable minimum jump ratio (> 0.15) to insure low false positive rate. Based on the digitized experimental data we use the maximum jump ratios from experimental spectrum to set the upper limit of the jump ratios for the corresponding element. We summarized the edges of 20 elements and their edge types collected from the literature and the jump ratio range in Table 1. In our supplementary material Table S1 lists the exact substances where these edges are collected.

Spectrum synthesize and data augmentation

The spectrum synthesis process is summarized in Fig. 3. The first step is to randomly pick 1 to 6 edges from the edge library and convolve them with the PSFs. Figure 3a shows the 6 convolved edges we used in the example. Figure 3b lists the augmentation operations before obtaining the final spectrum shown in Fig. 3c.

Figure 3 Spectrum synthesize steps and process. Full size image

Since we only consider the core-loss region on spectra the energy loss range is set from 50 to 1100 eV. The background J(E)is normalized to J n (E):

$${J}_{n}\left(E\right)=\frac{{E}^{-r}}{{50}^{-r}}$$

Before adding the edges to the background to simulate the long tail of the core-loss edges and obtain a smooth merged spectrum we extend the edges using another inverse power law where the range of the power is from − 3.8 to − 1.8.

With the jump ratio randomly selected from the corresponding range for the element the extended edge can be added to the background which is shown in Fig. 3d.

In the real case distortions and translational shifts of the spectra can be introduced due to multiple reasons including the hysteresis of the prism and the magnifying lenses the spectrometer alignment stray magnetic fields and even temperature etc. As a result the spectra collected at different times can vary for the same instrument. To simulate these phenomena we allocate a maximum of 1.5% of the contraction or expansion ratio to the modeled spectrum. A random shift of the spectrum is also implemented to the spectrum with a maximum shift of 15 eV. Figure 3b and e show the expanded spectrum. The spectrum that is further shifted is shown in Fig. 3b and f.

The last step of the spectrum synthesis is to add correct noise to it. Firstly Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.0012 is generated. Afterward the Savitzky–Golay filter is applied to smooth the noise to low-frequency noise where the polynomial order of the filter is set to 1 and the frame length is an odd positive integer in the range of 30 to 60. Figure 4 shows the raw Gaussian noise and the filtered noise. The filtered low-frequency noise is also called fixed-pattern noise. It is frequently seen in experimental EELS spectra primarily due to the non-uniform gain on the scintillator. To augment the noise level a random coefficient C that is in the range from 1 to 2 is further assigned to the noise. Figure 3g presents the spectrum with noise added which is also the input spectrum for our deep learning network. Table 2 summarizes the data augmentation operations in the process of spectrum synthesis. We generated 250000 spectra in total where the percentage of the spectra containing 1 to 6 edges are 20% 20% 20% 15% 15% and 10% respectively.

Network construction

CNN-BiLSTM network

CNN is a type of network developed for conducting image recognition and has been widely implemented in image classification. A typical CNN structure is constructed by connecting a few convolutional layers and dense layers (fully connected layers). The convolutional layers can extract the features from the input data and the dense layers classify the features to achieve classification. The recognition of the ionization edges on a spectrum is also a type of image recognition task. In the meanwhile the onset ionization edge carries the information of the target element. The edge’s energy position relative to others plays a critical role in the classification process. However a pure CNN structure is insensitive to the positional/sequential information. Given that the long short-term memory network (LSTM) enables the network to memorize the information in sequence by selectively keeping the important data and deleting less important data to pass to the next layer we proposed a CNN-BiLSTM combined network for ionization edge recognition and classification in the core loss region of the spectrum. Figure 5b shows the architecture of our CNN-BiLSTM network where the BiLSTM network is plotted in an unwrapped way. The real LSTM cell is described in Fig. 5c and is constructed with 100 hidden units. In our case the input layer carries the information of a spectrum that is a 1D vector (spectrum of energy loss range from 90 to 1000 eV with interval 0.2 eV). A filter of size 11 is implemented in each convolutional layer. Batch normalization operation66 is carried out following each convolutional layer and 20% of node dropout regularization is utilized after each dense layer to avoid overfitting. Activation functions ReLU and LeakyReLU of scale 0.01 are implemented to connect different layers as shown in the Fig. 5b. The network is built and trained using MATLAB. The training parameter settings are listed in Table 3. 80% of the spectra in the database are randomly picked for the training set and the remaining 20% are for the validation set.

(WCVB) - A Massachusetts woman is accused of killing her boyfriend by poisoning him with antifreeze.

Judy Church a 64-year-old former teacher appeared briefly in court on Friday.

Prosecutors say Leroy Fowler went into convulsions on his 55th birthday on Nov. 11.

An autopsy found deadly levels of ethylene glycol in his body a compound commonly found in antifreeze and windshield deicing fluid.

Prosecutors alleged Church mixed it with a sports drink.

According to the police report the victim’s family told investigators that Fowler had another girlfriend that Church was jealous of and that he suspected she was poisoning him.

Police say Church appeared to document the crime on her own cell phone.

That’s where investigators found 13 videos of the victim in medical distress thrashing about in Church’s room.

Police also found a screenshot of a recent purchase from AutoZone and photos from Church’s phone of a bottle of deicing fluid among the items in her kitchen and near Fowler’s bed.

Church was arraigned on a murder charge. She is being held pending a probable cause hearing set for Jan. 23.

There are some extremely high-potential companies on the market that could generate 5x returns over the next decade. But they aren't without their own risks.

What I wanted to do is ask whether a high-risk high-reward company like Virgin Galactic (SPCE -7.53%) is more likely to 5x before Axon (AXON -1.83%) a stock that is up 542% in the last five years. Let's dig into how both stocks could go up big over the next decade.

Risk versus reward

First I want to outline what these companies do and why their risk profiles are very different. Virgin Galactic is building a space tourism company charging $400000 or more for the privilege of flying into space for a short time. But it has yet to launch commercial operations which you can see in its revenue and free-cash-flow numbers.

Axon is an established company making tasers body cameras and cloud services for law enforcement. Not only is this now a company with $1 billion in revenue but it also has $3.73 billion of future contracted revenue extending as far as a decade into the future.

This is a speculative company versus a company that needs to continue executing at a high level.

The risk at Virgin Galactic is going to zero

Virgin Galactic's market cap is $1.1 billion and the company currently has $1.1 billion in cash on hand with no debt. But the problem is that the company is burning about $100 million per quarter in operations which will likely continue until commercial operations get off the ground.

The downside for this company is zero but I also think the upside is well over 5x given its potential to generate $1 billion in revenue from a single spaceport. If Virgin Galactic gets commercial operations off the ground next year it could start a decade-long growth phase for the company.

The space tourism business is completely unproven and we don't even know if the company's rockets are reliable. With high reward comes very high risk.

Axon isn't without risk

For Axon the picture seems much clearer but there are questions to answer long-term. As much as I like Axon's growth you can see above that the company isn't generating much free cash flow or reporting a consistent net income.

There's also the valuation risk we need to consider. Axon's $12.2 billion market cap is about 12x sales and if net margins long-term aren't as high as investors hope the stock could fall back to earth. I don't think the risk is zero but it will be hard to 5x from here if profits don't show up soon.

Virgin Galactic is more likely to 5x but there are risks

Axon is clearly the more proven company here but its size and valuation make me think it will be tough for the stock to 5x from here.

Virgin Galactic is a much higher-risk stock but the company's valuation going up 5x or even 10x is plausible if it gets operations off the ground. That's not a guarantee but management says commercial operations are ""on track to launch"" in Q2 2023 and next-generation spaceships that can carry six passengers are due to arrive in 2025. In the next five to 10 years the stock could easily jump 5x if touring space becomes common.

US energy firms this week added oil and natural gas rigs for the first time in four weeks energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely-followed report on Thursday.The oil and gas rig count an early indicator of future output rose by three to 779 in the week to Dec. 22. Baker Hughes released the report a day early due to the upcoming Christmas holiday weekend.Baker Hughes said that puts the total rig count up 193 rigs or 33 per cent over this time last year.US oil rigs rose by two to 622 this week while gas rigs rose one to 155.US oil futures were up about 3 per cent so far this year after soaring 55 per cent in 2021.Even though several energy firms have boosted spending for a second year in a row in 2022 after cutting drilling and completion expenditures in 2019 and 2020 crude production has remained below record levels seen in 2019.That's because many energy companies are focusing more on returning money to investors and paying down debt rather than boosting output.In addition analysts said some energy firms did not use this year's capital spending increase to boost production but instead spent the money on more expensive equipment and rising labor costs due to soaring inflation and supply disruptions.US crude production was on track to rise from 11.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.87 million bpd in 2022 and 12.34 million bpd in 2023 according to federal energy data. That compares with a record 12.32 million bpd in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9mZnNob3JlLWVuZXJneS5iaXovcGV0cm9icmFzLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1zYWxlLW9mLXBhcGEtdGVycmEtZmllbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petrobras completes sale of Papa-Terra field,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2h5ZGVyYWJhZC9hemFkLWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLXRvLXNldC11cC0yMG0tY3JpdGljYWwtcGFydHMtdW5pdC1mb3ItbWl0c3ViaXNoaS1oZWF2eS1pbmR1c3RyaWVzLWluLWh5ZGVyYWJhZC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjQ0MTk1Ni5jbXPSAa8BaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9oeWRlcmFiYWQvYXphZC1lbmdpbmVlcmluZy10by1zZXQtdXAtMjBtLWNyaXRpY2FsLXBhcnRzLXVuaXQtZm9yLW1pdHN1YmlzaGktaGVhdnktaW5kdXN0cmllcy1pbi1oeWRlcmFiYWQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NDQxOTU2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Azad Engineering to set up $20m critical parts unit for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Hyderabad,"HYDERABAD: Precision engineering player Azad Engineering is investing $20 million (approx. 166 crore) in setting up an exclusive facility to manufacture critical and complex parts for Japanese giant Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) on Hyderabad's outskirts.The 11800 sq mt facility which is coming up at Tuniki Bollaram in Medak district and is slated to become operational by mid-2024 will generate about 300 jobs Hyderabad-based Azad Engineering said.The new unit will be part of its upcoming centre for excellence and innovation and will make airfoils for their gas and steam turbines.While Azad Engineering managing director Rakesh Chopdar termed the collaboration as a high-point in the company's decade-long association with Mitsubishi MHI deputy CEO K Tanaka said Azad Engineering provides components of high quality and accuracy for their gas and steam turbines.Pointing out that Mitsubishi's quality requirements are among the highest in the world Raja Ram Reddy engineering head MHI Japan said Azad is the only partner outside Japan for few critical components that can meet MHI's demanding standards.""They are wedded to customer centric approach and rate high on cost competitiveness making them extremely attractive partners in our supply chain.

BALL,Ball Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jaGlsbGluZy13ZWVrZW5kcy1wbGF5aW5nLWJhbGwtdGVuY2VudC0xMDMwMTcyOTYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'You're chilling on the weekends playing ball': Tencent CEO Pony Ma blasts employees for being lazy after a tough 18 ...,"Tencent CEO Ma Huateng also known as Pony Ma had harsh words for his employees at a town hall meeting last week attacking them for inefficiency laziness and a lack of attentiveness to cost-cutting.

“You can’t even survive as a business yet you’re chilling on the weekends playing ball” Ma told his employees reports Bloomberg.

The harsh words come at the end of a tough year-and-a-half for Tencent the world’s largest video-game developer.

Tencent is one of China’s largest tech companies owning the ubiquitous WeChat platform used for messaging and payments throughout the country. It is also the developer behind some of the world’s most popular games like smartphone game Honor of Kings and has one of the industry’s largest investment portfolios with stakes in Fortnite developer Epic Games and Elden Ring developer FromSoftware (among many others).

In his town hall Ma criticized almost every part of Tencent’s giant business. He accused the company’s gaming division of focusing on quantity over quality and complained about the company’s social media products losing ground to competitors like Bytedance’s Douyin.

He suggested Tencent was too focused on expansion rather than focusing on its core businesses. “What we added was just fat and we were still unable to defeat others” he said reports the South China Morning Post.

Ma even warned that longstanding services like Tencent’s news portal could be shut down. “If they still have a lot of problems then their time is limited” he said according to the South China Morning Post.

The Tencent CEO’s only kind words were for the company’s short video service offered through the WeChat platform which he reportedly described as the ""hope"" for Tencent.

Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Game over?

Tencent’s troubles began last summer when Chinese authorities ordered strict playtime limits for children. Minors were allowed to play for just three hours each week in a bid to prevent gaming addiction. Regulators also reportedly told gaming companies like Tencent and its competitor NetEase to clamp down on content censors deemed “obscene and violent” such as “money-worship and effeminacy.”

Beijing then blocked Tencent from releasing a new video game for 15 months denying the company’s products the approval needed for release in China. The pause upended Tencent’s plans to release blockbuster games like Fortnite in the country. (Beijing finally approved a small health-focused game from a Tencent subsidiary in September ending the drought.)

Story continues

There may be some light at the end of the tunnel for Tencent. In late November a research firm affiliated with China’s gaming regulator stated that China’s problem with gaming addiction had “achieved a step toward resolution” implying that the gaming crackdown may be coming to a close according to CNBC.

Yet Tencent now faces a slowing gaming market both domestically and globally. Gaming sales skyrocketed during the COVID pandemic as customers stayed home due to social distancing but a move to post-COVID life and a slowing economy are dragging down revenues across the industry.

Tencent reported $19.7 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter a 2% decrease year-on-year. Shares in Tencent are down 57.7% from their peak in Feb. 2021.

Fear fun and chaos in the crazy world of quant ...,"A surprising number of seemingly unrelated fields have a similar proverb – it’s the notes that you don’t play which make a jazz solo. The hands that you don’t bet on are the ones that drive the flow of money at the poker table. And the balls that you don’t swing at will determine your long term performance as a baseball hitter. According to a profile of Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan it’s true in banking too. Moynihan has spent years trying to engrain a culture in which the deals that you don’t get are as important as the ones which you do.

At BoA they apparently call it “responsible growth” the idea being that someone has to ensure that the instincts of aggressive bankers are reined in and deals which might be excessively risky are passed by even if this means losing the business to the competition and thereby missing out on the top league table places. The idea seems to be that there’s a kind of “winner’s curse” in a competitive industry – since deals go to the most aggressive player rather than the smartest being the runaway number one in market share is usually an indication that you’re writing bad business.

With hung deals in the leveraged loan market overshadowing the year-end results people today are likely to be significantly more receptive to this kind of sermon than they would have been a year ago. But there’s a real question here and it speaks to the core strategic direction of a number of big banks.

The dilemma for a publicly owned investment bank is that your shareholders like profits but they don’t like risk. Generating stable and consistent earnings from a volatile and cyclical industry is basically impossible. So what do you do? David Solomon’s Goldman Sachs has been wrestling with this question for years; trying to develop more stable revenue sources to tame the volatility of revenues was the basis for the “Operation Main Street” project that’s dominated the Goldman story for the last five years.

At Goldman that project appears to be reducing its scope and ambitions; the Marcus brand is likely to see significant layoffs in the New Year and Goldman now seems to want to provide the back end while letting Apple take care of the consumer-facing business. It’s interesting that Bank of America which is hardly lacking in retail and payments revenues still thinks that the way to tame investment banking is simply to take less risk.

On the other hand maybe the real lesson here is that banks should be proud of what they are and lean in to it. Although the Moynihan profile is full of praise from analysts and endorsements from Warren Buffet it does acknowledge that BoA hasn’t actually seen any benefit in share price terms from its safety-first strategy. It could be that the correct thing for banks like Goldman to do is just embrace the feast-and-famine nature of investment banking keep sufficient capital and a flexible cost base and try to find some shareholders with strong nerves.

Elsewhere as Alex Morrell of Business Insider puts it “No special education or accreditation is required to run [a headhunting firm] and the overhead is minimal. As a result the caliber and culture of such firms can vary dramatically”. Never was anything so true or so diplomatically understated said about this widely misunderstood and not always popular industry.

The context is a scandal at a rapidly growing London-based firm that’s just opened up on Wall Street. It’s also recently parted company with its head of data science recruitment and the ensuing quarrels have dragged out dirty linen in quantities usually only seen in student residences at the end of term.

There is … quite a lot … in the article. Most of the key allegations are denied except the ones that are supported by text and WhatsApp evidence which are “deeply regretted” by the alleged perpetrator. There are so many of them that it’s almost impossible to summarise but along with the accusations of atrocious behaviour and language there’s a picture drawn of an aggressive work and party culture that looks like a parody of the worst excesses of the Street itself. Which may be the underlying truth; recruiters tend to see a subset of the industry’s workers and to meet them only during periods of extreme stress. They might get a distorted picture of what bankers are really like.

The pay increases varied by bank and geography with the nation's largest banks paying the highest hourly wages to recruit and retain employees on the lower end of the pay scale. Still the turnover rate for frontline bank employees soared this year according to one survey.

Whether the favorable conditions for workers will persist into 2023 is an open question as many banks are preparing for a possible recession next year. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said earlier this month that the Charlotte North Carolina-based company is pulling back on some but not all of its hiring.

""We seek talent all the time"" Moynihan told Bloomberg Television on Dec. 6. ""We're just more careful about it in times like this.""

First it was the announcement of the naira redesign and then there was the limits placed on cash withdrawals. Just this week the CBN also announced an upward review of the earlier limits placed on cash withdrawals. This again got people talking on social media.

As a Deputy Governor at the apex Bank Aishah Ahmad is not far from the trending discussions as well. Recently she had to represent CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele before a senate hearing a development that got her name trending.

This week’s profile will be on the woman who is in charge of leading the effort to promote a sound financial system in the country.

Birth and education: A native of Niger State Aishah Ahmad was born in Lagos sometime in the 1970s. She attended St. Catherine’s Primary School Surulere Lagos and Zarumai Primary School Minna Niger State before heading on to Federal Government Girls’ College Bida for secondary schooling.

Aishah went on to graduate with a BSc degree in Accounting from the University of Abuja and obtained an MBA (Finance) from the University of Lagos and an M.Sc. Finance and Management from the Cranﬁeld School of Management (UK). She is a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) and she holds the prestigious Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation.

Her career trajectory: Ahmad has had what one might call a very rich career in the banking and finance industry for over two decades even before she joined the apex bank. Right before joining CBN she was in retail banking at Diamond Bank Plc. She was also the Head of Consumer and Privilege Banking a Deputy General Manager and the Head of the Retail Financial Services Division overseeing Privilege Banking Consumer Banking Group Retail Assets Cards and Customer Engagement & Insight for about four years.

Before Diamond Bank Aishah Ahmad worked with Stanbic IBTC Holdings (a member of Standard Bank Group SA) between 2009 and 2014 holding different critical positions like Head Private Client Services and Deputy Head Private Client Services and Head High Net-worth Individuals.

Her two decades of banking experience also include Zenith Capital Limited where she was Head of Business Development Bank of New York Mellon (UK) Synesix Financial Limited (UK) and Zenith Bank Plc where she was Head Retail Banking Unit.

She equally worked with NAL Bank Plc as Head of Private Banking; as well as the First Interstate Bank Plc as Executive Assistant Treasury Group Manstructs Group Nigeria Limited as Group Accountant and Z. O. Ososanya & Co.

Appointment as CBN Deputy Governor: By the time the CBN announcement came stakeholders in the industry could well agree that she had a well-rounded background in the space and was prepared to assume the role. In 2018 she succeeded two-time Acting Governor of the Central Bank and Deputy Governor Dr Sarah Alade who retired in March of the same year.

Her profile on the CBN board profile page says that as Deputy Governor in charge of Financial System Stability she is responsible for leading the effort to promote a sound financial system in Nigeria. Aishah Ahmad is a member of the Governing Board and Committee of Governors at the CBN and Chairman of the Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC) – a not-for-profit organization offering training consulting and research services for the financial services sector.

Other roles and engagements: As one who has achieved impressive success in her career path it naturally follows that Ahmad would now become a role model of some sort to other women. She was the former Chairperson of Women in Business and Public Service (WIMBIZ); a leading women-focused NGO in Sub-Saharan Africa. Aishah is a member of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Association and the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) Association.",,,,,,,,,
BBWI,Bath & Body Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vbGlmZS9zdHlsZS1hZHZpc29yL2FydGljbGUtaW4tYmF0aC13ZWVrZW5kLXRyYXZlbGxlcnMtZ2V0LWEtZG9zZS1vZi1icml0aXNoLWRlc2lnbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Bath weekend travellers get a dose of British design,"Bath the UNESCO World Heritage Site in southwest England’s Somerset countryside is named for its top tourist attraction. The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvcnVnYnktdW5pb24vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3cwdmxlMW41cnJv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS11bmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9jdzB2bGUxbjVycm8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Premiership: Newcastle Falcons 17-28 Bath,"It was a fast start by Bath who went over for the first time inside five minutes. Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuY29tL3J1Z2J5L2dhbGxhZ2hlci1wcmVtaWVyc2hpcC1zYWxlLWNsaW1iLWludG8tdG9wLWZvdXItd2l0aC1ib251cy1wb2ludC13aW4tb3Zlci1sZWljZXN0ZXItYmF0aC1icnVzaC1uZXdjYXNfc3RvMTAxMzk0NjIvc3Rvcnkuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gallagher Premiership: Sale beat Leicester to climb into top four Bath close in on playoffs with Newcastle win,"Sam James of Sale Sharks celebrates scoring a try during the Gallagher Premiership Rugby match between Sale Sharks and Leicester Tigers at AJ Bell Stadium on May 10 2024 in Salford England.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in a tweet shared guidelines to ensure the power grid remains stable as power outage continues. They have asked businesses and the public to help reduce electric power usage without sacrificing safety.TVA and local power companies are also taking steps to temporarily reduce power supplies to certain local areas which may create intermittent power outages in homes and businesses. The authority is actively working with local power companies to minimize the duration of outages. In the tweet they also mentioned these are necessary precautions to prevent far greater power interruptions which might affect the entire area.Until the power has stabilized intermittent power outages for about 10 minutes every 90 minutes to 2 hours can be expected said NES.Jack Baxter vice president NES operations said TVA’s power generation system is being challenged by the swift-moving cold front that moved into the area overnight. The duration of these dangerously low temperatures also plays a part in system performance. He further added that their ability to proactively manage the grid during this time will help them continue to provide safe and reliable power to Middle Tennessee.NES also reported on Friday morning that four of their utility poles were damaged or broken because of Thursday night’s freezing precipitation and high winds. The extreme cold conditions damaged other equipment as well. Early Friday morning 1600 customers were without power but by 10 a.m. the number jumped to 24000.

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) today released the latest yearly editions of its Toxic 100 lists of the top corporate air and water polluters and top greenhouse gas emitters in the United States based on the most recent data available from the Environmental Protection Agency.

New this year is the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by the amount that their distribution of fossil fuels contributes to global climate change. This new list joins the Greenhouse 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their emissions responsible for global climate change according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the Toxic 100 Air and Toxic 100 Water Indexes which rank U.S. industrial polluters using the EPA Toxics Release Inventory. The indexes created as part of PERI’s Corporate Toxics Information Project once again include environmental justice indicators to assess impacts on low-income people and minorities.

“The Toxic 100 and Greenhouse 100 inform consumers shareholders regulators lawmakers and communities which large corporations release toxic and climate-altering pollutants into our environment” says Michael Ash professor of economics at UMass Amherst and co-director of the Corporate Toxics Information Project. “We assess not just how many pounds of pollutants are released but which are the most toxic and who is exposed. People have a right to know about toxic hazards to which they are exposed. Legislators need to understand the effects of pollution on their constituents.”

For the first time PERI has published a Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their 2020 supply of products that result in greenhouse gas emissions when the products are released combusted or oxidized. The top five companies on this year’s inaugural list in order are Marathon Petroleum Phillips 66 Valero Energy Exxon Mobil and Peabody Energy. The first four of these are primarily on the list because of their petroleum refining operations although the top two also conduct natural gas extraction. Fifth-ranked Peabody Energy is on the list due to its coal mining ventures. The top four each produced fossil fuels that resulted in 280 million metric tons or more of CO2-equivalent emissions. Rounding out the top 10 greenhouse suppliers are Enterprise Products Partners Chevron BP Arch Resources and Shell PLC.

The Greenhouse 100 Index ranks companies by 2020 direct emissions of greenhouse gasses from large sources. The top three companies are Vistra Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company the fourth year in a row in which these companies were in the top three spots. They each released more than 75 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Together these three companies released 4% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from all sources including non-energy sources.

The rest of the top 10 in the Greenhouse 100 are Berkshire Hathaway American Electric Power Energy Capital Partners NextEra Energy Xcel Energy the U.S government and Exxon Mobil the top company whose direct emissions are not dominated by electric power plants. Among the top 10 Energy Capital Partners has the highest weighted share of minorities living within 10 miles of its facilities.

In order LyondellBasell BASF Becton Dickinson Salzgitter Huntsman Dow Inc Canopus International Celanese Berkshire Hathaway and NOV Inc. lead the Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index which reports the top companies in 2020 in terms of total potential chronic human health risk from toxic chemical air pollutants. Five of these companies are in the top 10 almost entirely because of chromium or ethylene oxide released from one of their facilities. The Toxic 100 Air Index covers both publicly traded and privately held companies such as Koch Industries (No. 58) that appear on Forbes Fortune or S&P lists. The index includes environmental justice indicators that denote for example while minorities make up just under 40% of the U.S. population they bear 68% of the air-toxics risk from facilities owned by LyondellBasell.

The Toxic 100 Water Polluters Index which ranks the pounds of toxics released into surface water or sent to water-treatment systems in 2020 adjusted for chemical toxicity is led this year by Northrop Grumman LyondellBasell NextEra Industries Dow Inc. and Cargill. The Toxic 100 Water Polluters list also once again includes environmental justice indicators that show for example minorities bear 63% of the toxic hazard created by Dow from water releases and transfers to water treatment facilities.

In addition to the top 100 lists search functions for toxic air toxic water and greenhouse gas polluters provide information on all companies reporting releases or production to the Toxics Release Inventory the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program or the EIA-7A coal mine survey. Data related to Air Toxics at School and the Coal Producers Index is also searchable through the Corporate Toxics Information Project.

“In making this information available we are building on the achievements of the right-to-know movement” Ash notes. “Our goal is to engender public participation in environmental decision-making and to help residents translate the right to know into the right to clean air clean water and a livable planet.”

Nearly half of it will come from three stocks.

As much as 2021 might have led you to believe that the stock market only goes up 2022 has served as an abrupt reminder that this path to prosperity isn't a straight line. All three major U.S. stock indexes have plunged into a bear market with growth stocks really taking it on the chin.

But don't tell that to Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) CEO Warren Buffett. When the closing bell rang last week shares of the Oracle of Omaha's company were outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 by 20 percentage points and were higher on the year by 1%.

One of Buffett's keys to outperforming in turbulent environments is to lean on the safety of dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend are almost always profitable and have stood the test of time.

Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is on track to collect more than $6 billion in dividend income. The shocker is that $2.8 billion of this annual dividend income is slated to come from just three stocks.

Chevron: $964107966 in annual dividend income

The leading dividend stock for Berkshire Hathaway is none other than global energy giant Chevron (CVX 0.22%). Chevron is a dividend stock that has increased its base annual payout for 35 consecutive years and is currently doling out $5.68 a share which is good enough for a market-topping yield of almost 3.4%. Including the Chevron shares owned by Buffett's secret portfolio New England Asset Management this position is generating more than $964 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway.

Let's be clear: Buffett and his investment team wouldn't have plowed into energy stocks in 2022 if they didn't strongly believe that energy commodity prices would remain above their historic averages for the coming years. Certain global dynamics do support this thesis although a U.S. recession would likely weigh on near-term oil and gas demand.

The biggest positive for crude oil and natural gas prices has been the underinvestment in drilling exploration and infrastructure by most energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Paring back capital expenditures means it'll be difficult to quickly increase energy commodity supply anytime soon. When coupled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine which has cast doubt on Europe's energy supply needs there's a real likelihood that crude oil and natural gas prices will stick above their historic norms.

Buffett's fascination with Chevron probably also involves its integrated operating model. ""Integrated"" oil and gas companies operate midstream assets such as pipelines and downstream assets like chemical plants and refineries. These midstream and downstream assets help provide predictable cash flow and can be used to hedge against energy commodity price weakness.

Big oil is also known for its hefty capital-return programs. In addition to its juicy dividend Chevron has pledged to repurchase up to $15 billion worth of its common stock this year.

Occidental Petroleum: $901062858 in annual dividend income

Have I mentioned that energy stocks are playing a big role in anchoring Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in 2022 and bolstering its dividend income?

Since the year began the Oracle of Omaha and his team have purchased more than 194 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%). This common stock is providing more than $101 million in annual income. However Berkshire Hathaway also owns $10 billion worth of Occidental Petroleum preferred stock that doles out an 8% yield ($800 million a year). Altogether Buffett is collecting north of $901 million in annual dividend income from Occidental.

As you can probably imagine the catalysts fueling Occidental Petroleum are really similar to Chevron. Years of underinvestment in drilling and infrastructure (for the energy sector when examined as a whole) combined with Russia's actions in Ukraine create a scenario where higher energy prices can significantly boost operating cash flow. But there are some differences between the two companies.

For example even though Occidental is an integrated operator like Chevron more of its annual revenue is tied to its higher-margin drilling operations. If crude oil and natural gas remain elevated Occidental can reap the rewards even more so than Chevron.

But there's a flip side to this benefit. Whereas Chevron has what can arguably be described as the best balance sheet among large oil and gas companies Occidental was sitting on more than $35 billion in net debt less than two years ago. The good news is the company has whittled away $15 billion in net debt and reignited its share repurchase program as oil prices soared. Whether a tidier balance sheet allows for earnings multiple expansion remains to be seen.

Bank of America: $908909765 in annual dividend income

The third high-octane income stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio is Bank of America (BAC 0.44%). Including shares owned by New England Asset Management the more than 1.03 billion shares of BofA held by Berkshire will help Buffett and his team rake in close to $909 million in annual dividend income.

Usually bank stocks perform poorly during bear markets and struggle when U.S. economic growth slows or shifts into reverse. But this time could really be different. Whereas the Federal Reserve often comes to Wall Street's rescue by lowering interest rates to spur lending the nation's central bank is instead raising interest rates at the fastest pace in decades to combat historically high inflation. Even if a recession were to occur in the U.S. the benefit of rapidly rising rates on Bank of America's outstanding variable-rate loans should more than offset loan losses.

Among money-center banks Bank of America is the most interest-sensitive. Not only did its net interest income jump 24% to $13.9 billion during the third quarter but BofA has estimated that a 100-basis-point parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve will produce $4.2 billion in added net interest income over the next 12 months.

Despite its size Bank of America is making headway with its digital transformation as well. More than 70% of its 56 million verified digital users are active customers. As a result 48% of total sales were completed online or via mobile app and 51 million more transactions were completed via digital peer-to-peer app Zelle (167 million) than traditional check (116 million) in the September-ended quarter. Digital transactions cost banks just a fraction of what in-person interactions run.

And to keep with the theme of this list bank stocks like BofA have a storied history of sizable capital-return programs. When the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders Bank of America can often be counted on to return well in excess of $20 billion to its shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc3RvY2tuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BnLWFiYnYtYmlpYi1rci00LXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXN0b2Nrcy10by1ob2xkLWludG8tdGhlLW5leHQtZGVjYWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG: 4 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy and Never Sell,"Warren Buffett also known as the “Oracle of Omaha” is one of the most influential and successful investors of all time with a net worth of $104.10 billion. He is the chairman and CEO of a diversified holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B). He primarily follows a long-term value investing strategy.

Buffett primarily invests in ably managed businesses with sound dividend records and pricing power. He has accumulated a fortune through his successful investment strategy which has guided investors for decades.

Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has significantly outperformed the broader market. Over the past six months BRK.B has returned 12.2% outpacing the broader S&P 500 index’s 3.2% gains. Also the stock has gained 2.8% over the past year versus the S&P 500’s 17.4% decline.

Despite the inflation showing signs of cooling the Fed indicated to keep raising interest rates and predicted the terminal rate to reach as high as 5.1% next year higher than the September projection of 4.6%. The Fed’s hawkish stance sparked recession fears recently. With the markets expected to witness heightened volatility in the upcoming months investors should consider top Buffett’s holdings for solid returns over the long run.

To that end it could be wise to buy fundamentally sound Warren Buffett stocks The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) Biogen Inc. (BIIB) and The Kroger Co. (KR) and hold them into the next decade.

Designed as the evolution of the Best Buy Beta rewards program — which was as the name suggests a Beta version — Totaltech combines the best of the rewards program with several other added benefits including those offered through Best Guy's Geek Squad.

I try to buy from Best Buy instead of Amazon because of Totaltech.

At first I took no notice of the giant banner. However while waiting for the rep to ring up my order I saw something interesting: Totaltech includes free installation of most common items bought at Best Buy including thermostats TVs appliances and more. There are also discounts on advanced services. I was already spending $5000 per year with Best Buy to hit the top-tier Elite Plus level but it didn't really come with many benefits aside from rewards. Fast forward to today 18 months later and I'm a Best Buy Totaltech advocate. I will deliberately buy things from Best Buy instead of Amazon if I can for many reasons. It's the best $200 I spent this year and I'll continue to pay. Here's why.

60-day returns on almost everything

My most-used benefit with Best Buy Totaltech is now the 60-day returns on almost everything. My primary place to buy tech has usually been Amazon or wireless carriers directly but as I rose through the Elite membership tiers Best Buy kept extending the returns period. With Totaltech I now get 60-day returns on most products although that doesn't apply to things like cell phones or anything that needs service activation.

Best Buy Totaltech is perfect for people who always want the latest tech.

This 60-day returns policy saved me hundreds in the first 12 months of my membership. Last year I bought a new 48-inch OLED TV for my bedroom — the LG C1 OLED which is a great purchase — and about six weeks later the price was reduced by $300. I was just outside the regular returns window but still inside the 60-day extended returns period under Best Buy Totaltech. Best Buy support via Twitter quickly refunded the difference. That's not all — yesterday I wrote about how much I love the Dell U3223QE 32-inch 4k monitor. While waiting for that to go on sale at the beginning of this year I bought four of the older model. When I noticed that the newer model was finally available I processed a return with Best Buy for all four of older ones; again I was outside the standard return period. If you often get buyer's remorse or just like to try out the latest tech Best Buy Totaltech is the membership for you. 24 months of coverage including AppleCare Plus

When you decide to keep something you buy from Best Buy it typically comes with two years of Geek Squad protection. This covers drops and spills for portable items although what's covered depends on the exact category. You can find out more about what's covered here.

I buy my Apple products from Best Buy because Totaltech includes AppleCare+.

One of the best reasons to buy Totaltech is the coverage provided on Apple products; for as long as your membership is active any Apple product you buy from Best Buy comes with AppleCare+ included. Aside from the iPhone or anything you need to customize it's worth buying your Apple products from Best Buy if you're a Totaltech member. The cost of AppleCare+ on my Mac alone is $99 per year and you can save hundreds with Totaltech depending upon what you buy. Free same-day or fast delivery

If you live near a Best Buy store Totaltech is even more valuable. A lot of the time I'll make impulse purchases but these often mean needing to go to a store. Best Buy Totaltech changes this in a really good way. The success of Amazon has been the ability to get same next or two-day shipping on most items and Totaltech offers the same from the Best Buy inventory near you.

Best Buy set Amazon in its sights with super fast delivery.

If you live within the range of a Best Buy you'll find that your local store offers same-day shipping on many items. I've ordered plenty of things for same-day delivery and if I order before 3 pm they're typically delivered before 11 pm. Best Buy partnered with Roadie to offer this service which is present in both Pennsylvania and California although I'm not sure about its availability in every state. Whether you have same-day delivery available or not you get one- or two-day delivery on virtually everything. I say virtually because it depends on inventory location and some things take a few days longer. Regardless it's fast. I ordered many large and small things that all arrived the next day. If I had paid consumer rates for all of these deliveries which are handled by FedEx and UPS if not Roadie it would have cost over $1000 in the past 18 months. Better customer service

You won't see this on the Totaltech page but a side benefit of Totaltech is better overall customer service. I say better because Best Buy leaves much to be desired regarding customer service but Totaltech gets you better service than without. Whether through Twitter support in-store help or over-the-phone discussions being a Totaltech member gets you better support. That's to be expected as Totaltech is for Best Buy customers willing to pay a premium and it's another reason to have a Totaltech membership. Free installation on most products

It's funny but the reason I bought Totaltech has become one of the benefits I use the least. As it turns out it can take a while to get products installed and I need the instant gratification of buying and installing something immediately. That said theoretically Totaltech could have saved me more than $500 in installation costs over the past year had I not known what I was doing or used a handyman. Consider the table below which shows the various items I purchased and installed that someone may have had to pay a handyman over the past 12 months. You can see all the included services here.

Service Best Buy cost Smart thermostat installation $129.99 55"" and below TV connect and mount $249.99 56"" and above TV connect and mount $249.99 Soundbar connect and mount $129.99 Video doorbell install $149.99

Assuming you purchased a TV thermostat soundbar and video doorbell from Best Buy the total separate cost of installation would be $659.96. You would save $459.97 with a Totaltech membership let alone all the other benefits. How much has Best Buy Totaltech actually saved me?

According to the Best Buy website my Totaltech savings are $334.19 since I renewed on July 18 2022. That's broken down as $7 on purchases and $327.19 on protection plans. There are plenty of Totaltech-exclusive sales — especially every Monday — so your purchase savings could be much higher depending upon your purchase habits.

Totaltech saves money on the protection I would have paid for anyway.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtiYi5jb20vY2FyLW5ld3MvYm13LXgxLXdpbnMtb3VyLXN1YmNvbXBhY3QtbHV4dXJ5LXN1di1iZXN0LWJ1eS1hd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BMW X1 Wins Our Subcompact Luxury SUV Best Buy Award,"Subcompact luxury SUVs are a great gateway into the world of luxury cars. They offer the added power crisp handling luxurious surfaces and high-tech cabins of luxury vehicles. But they keep prices reasonable with their small size.

If you’re considering buying one in 2023 our editors think the BMX X1 is the best buy on the market. This year it took home our Best Buy Award in the Subcompact Luxury SUV class.

Bold New Look Refined Personality

The X1 is all-new for 2023. BMW gave it a more rugged square-jawed look and the interior makeover includes a beautiful curved display. It’s two screens — one for the driver’s instruments and a central touchscreen housing the infotainment display — but they look like one wide unit.

One feature is you don’t have to touch it. Just saying “Hey BMW” activates a robust voice command system that can handle almost every need.

But this is a BMW and you don’t buy a BMW for the technology. You buy it for how it feels when you put the pedal down on a twisty road.

The X1 doesn’t disappoint. Munich’s engineers have given it a 241-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission tuned to offer a lot of pep at neighborhood speeds. That combined with grippy standard all-wheel drive (AWD) helps the X1 turn a casual commute into a fun part of the day.

With prices starting at $39100 (plus a $995 destination fee) the X1 is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy the luxury vehicle experience.

But we don’t give out Best Buy Awards just because a car is great. Our editors run the numbers to find great long-term values too.

How We Decide

Our editors spend all year evaluating cars for our annual Best Buy Awards.

We test drive more than 300 vehicles yearly to write our detailed reviews.

We flag those that combine affordability dependability reliability and low ownership and operating costs as possible award winners. Our data analysts then take a detailed look at the financial aspects of owning each. They calculate the 5-Year Cost to Own factoring in depreciation insurance maintenance financing fuel fees and taxes.

Finally we bring the best contenders in for head-to-head testing.

When it was all over the X1 stood out for its balance of performance and value. Rivals like the Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA are also fun to drive. But the X1 is the better buy this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9iZXN0LWJ1eS1zdHVkZW50LWRpc2NvdW50LTQ2ODQ0ODXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Get the Best Buy Student Discount,"What to Know Go to the Best Buy Student Deals site click Sign Up for Deal  sign in to your Best Buy account enter your student info and click Sign Up .

Signing up for the Best Buy student discount isn't much more difficult than signing up for a regular Best Buy account. The only difference is that you need to provide some extra information like where you go to school and you may also need to upload proof.

Navigate to the Best Buy Student Deals site and click Sign Up for Deals. Enter your Best Buy email address and password and click Sign In. If you don't already have a Best Buy account click Google to sign in with your Google account or Create one to make a new account. Enter your information and click Sign Up. If the system isn't able to verify your enrollment it may ask you to manually verify. In that case upload your supporting documents and wait for the manual verification. Click Get Your Student Deals. Your account is now ready to start using Best Buy student discount offers. Either wait for your first student discount email or check out your member rewards page on the Best Buy website.

How to Use Your Best Buy Student Discount

Unlike a lot of student discounts the Best Buy student discount isn't automatic. It only applies to specific items and it functions more like a coupon that you have to clip and turn in than a regular discount.

The basic process requires you to use the Member Offers page to find an item that's eligible for the discount add that item to your cart and then click the Apply button during checkout to actually receive the discount.

Here's what the process looks like from start to finish:

Navigate to the Best Buy Membership Offers site. Locate a product you want to buy and click Shop Now. Make sure the offer has the Student Deals icon. Other offers are just sale items that are available to all members. Verify that the item has the Student Deals tag and click Add to Cart. Click Go to Cart if you're done shopping. Verify the items in your cart choose whether to pick up your item or have it shipped and click Checkout when you're ready. Your student discount will not appear on this page. Enter your address and click Continue to Payment Information. Look for the My Best Buy Offers and Rewards section and click Apply. If you skip this step you won't receive your student discount. Verify that your discount has been applied and click Place Your Order. Return to the Best Buy Membership Offers site the next time you want to use your student discount.

Who Is Eligible for the Best Buy Student Discount?

The requirements for the Best Buy student discount are specific so it's easy to tell if you qualify or not. If you are currently enrolled at a U.S. Title IV accredited college or university and you're at least 18 years old then you qualify.

Four year universities community colleges and other accredited institutions all count as long as they are U.S. Title IV accredited. If you aren't sure whether your school qualifies you can use the Federal Student Aid site to check if it is Title IV accredited.

What Does the Best Buy Student Discount Get You?

The Best Buy student discount provides you with access to deep discounts on computers televisions and a variety of other electronics. There is no standard discount amount but you can typically expect to save hundreds of dollars on big-ticket items like computers and televisions.

The other difference between the Best Buy student discount program and other student discounts is that you don't receive a discount on everything. To take advantage of your discount you can either look through a list of offers on the Best Buy Member Offers site or wait for the monthly Student Deals email.

How Does Best Buy Verify Student Enrollment?

Best Buy uses an identity verification service called SheerID to verify that you're enrolled where you say you're enrolled. This is the same service that's used by Amazon Spotify Nike and a lot of other big names. If you've signed up for an Amazon or Spotify student discount already you're ready to go for a Best Buy student discount.

When SheerID isn't able to automatically verify your enrollment it allows you to upload supporting documentation. For this process to work you need to scan your student ID or have access to documents such as your current class schedule or an official enrollment letter if you haven't started school yet.

What to Do When Automatic Verification Fails

When we tested Best Buy's student discount program we found that it automatically provided access to student discounts as soon as we signed up. In the event that the system is unable to verify your enrollment at a qualifying college or university you will have to provide proof of your enrollment.

Best Buy uses SheerID for enrollment verification so if the site prompts you to provide additional information to SheerID that's normal. All you have to do is upload supporting documents to prove your enrollment and then wait for the manual verification.

Here are some of the types of proof that SheerID accepts:

Current student ID card

Current class schedule

An official enrollment letter

A registration receipt

Any official document from the school that states your name and verifies that you are currently enrolled

If you still aren't able to access the student discount even after providing documentation manually contact Best Buy customer support for additional assistance. Someone may need to manually process your application.

What Happens to Your Student Discount When You Graduate?

The Best Buy student discount is only available if you're enrolled at an accredited school. If you graduate or leave school for any reason you're no longer eligible for the discount.

Unlike other companies that provide student discounts Best Buy doesn't have a specific procedure in place to force you to reverify your eligibility on a regular schedule.

If Best Buy does ask you to reverify and you are no longer enrolled at a qualifying college or university your account will be downgraded to a regular member account. Best Buy members still receive special deals and offers each month but they are not eligible for additional student discounts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8xMi9jaHJpc3RtYXMtZXZlLTIwMjItc3RvcmUtaG91cnMtZm9yLXdhbG1hcnQtdGFyZ2V0LWJlc3QtYnV5LW1hY3lzLWhvbWUtZGVwb3QtbG93ZXMtY3ZzLWlrZWEtbW9yZS5odG1s0gGXAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzEyL2NocmlzdG1hcy1ldmUtMjAyMi1zdG9yZS1ob3Vycy1mb3Itd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQtYmVzdC1idXktbWFjeXMtaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1sb3dlcy1jdnMtaWtlYS1tb3JlLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas Eve 2022 store hours for Walmart Target Best Buy Macy’s Home Depot Lowe’s CVS Ikea more,"Christmas Eve 2022 is on Saturday Dec. 24.

Medicare coverage will soon be made available for the drug according to the CMS.

Lecanemab Eisai and Biogen’s experimental anti-amyloid Alzheimer’s drug which recently wrapped its Phase 3 clinical trials continues to make the news. Some of these headlines discuss the deaths of clinical trial participants who were taking the drug. So how safe is the drug and how do the benefits for people living with Alzheimer’s disease stand up to the risks?

Here’s a little background: In early December 2022 at the annual Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference on Alzheimer’s research Eisai and Biogen presented data about their monoclonal anti-amyloid drug lecanemab concurrently publishing the results in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial showed that lecanemab slowed the rate of cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia.

“They’ve been successful when others have not with how a company should approach disease modification trials.” said Sharon Rogers CEO of AmyriAD who led the development of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (Aricept) while at Eisai in the 1990s.

The key findings of the trial lecanemab slowed cognitive decline by 27 percent. This is repeated over and over again across different media outlets after the presentation at CTAD. From the sounds of it 27 percent seems like a lot. But what does “slowing cognitive decline by 27 percent” actually mean for an individual living with Alzheimer’s?

“What is underreported in the press discussions is that both treatment and control groups declined and it was just slower with the drug” Karl Herrup an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Pittsburgh told Being Patient.

In the lecanemab trial participants in both the control and lecanemab group started off scoring 3.2 out of a total of 18 points on the Clinical Dementia Rating–Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scale. This is a validated measure of cognitive decline where larger numbers indicate more impairment. During the trial both the placebo and treatment groups experienced cognitive decline over the course of 18 months. At the end of the trial the lecanemab group declined 1.21 points down to a score of 4.41 while the placebo group declined 1.66 points to 4.86.

This means that the participants that received lecanemab had a slower rate of decline over 18 months by 0.45 points. This is equivalent to slowing cognitive decline by 27 percent. For reference a score between 3.0 and 4.0 indicates very mild dementia while a score between 4.5 and 9.0 indicates mild dementia.

Another way to think about the results is to compare them to the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil (Aricept). It is estimated that people taking the drug compared to a placebo group may slow their cognitive decline by 0.6 points over the course of 12 months.

Are the lecanemab findings clinically meaningful for individual patients?

Being Patient asked Eisai to explain whether their results were clinically meaningful — whether they would actually make a difference in an individual patient’s life.

“The degree of worsening in daily functioning and cognition experienced by an individual in the placebo group at 18 months might not be experienced by an individual treated with lecanemab until almost 7 months later” a spokesperson told Being Patient. “Essentially 0.5 represents clinically notable decline in a key domain of Alzheimer’s Disease symptomatology by physicians and care-partners.”

Some advocacy groups including the Alzheimer’s Association also made definitive statements emphasizing that “lecanemab will provide patients more time to participate in daily life and live independently” in a written statement. “It could mean many months more of recognizing their spouse children and grandchildren.”

But what do scientists unaffiliated with the trials say about this important question?

Some researchers believe lecanemab will make a small but meaningful difference for people with Alzheimer’s disease.

Rogers explained that the results showed a six month slowing in the progression of mild-cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer’s. This could potentially slow the course of the disease by months delaying the later stages of dementia.

The image below modified from Eisai’s press release shows that we can draw a horizontal line between the lecanemab datapoint at 18 months and the placebo data point at 12 months. On the graph this indicates that the changes in cognition between these two data points are equivalent.

John Hardy and Bart De Strooper professors working at the UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London called the trial “impressive” and “remarkable” in comments provided to the Science Media Center. However neither researcher discussed the clinical significance of the findings in their comments.

Other researchers believe the meaning of the difference lecanemab will make for Alzheimer’s patients is still unclear.

“It is difficult to know if this will be noticeable for patients and their families” Donald Weaver a clinician and senior scientist at the Krembil Research Institute told Being Patient. He was uncertain whether the results would be clinically significant but added that “some families would argue that even a day or two would be progress.”

Tara Spires-Jones a professor involved in the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh also provided a comment to the Science Media Center. “There is not an accepted definition of clinically meaningful effects in the cognitive test they used and it is not clear yet whether the modest reduction in decline will make a big difference to people living with dementia.”

Similarly Nick Fox who is the director at University College London’s Dementia Research Center wrote that he was unsure whether slowing the disease 27 percent was meaningful.

“A really key question is whether clinical benefits are progressive if they continue beyond the 18 months if they are sustained and cumulative.”

Yet other scientists believe the the difference in cognition that lecanemab will bring about is not clinically meaningful for patients.

Rob Howard professor of old age psychiatry at University College London Institute of Mental Health is among them. “This is below what is considered the minimum clinically important difference of 1.0 point” Howard wrote to Being Patient. “So it isn’t clinically significant or noticeable in an individual patient.” He added that he does not believe the cognitive benefits outweigh the risks and was unconvinced by some of the analysis predicting patients’ response past 18 months.

“If you set the bar low enough you can achieve almost anything” Herrup said referring to the trial’s success. “Everything I know suggests that that slowing is probably undetectable by the patient or their families” Herrup said. Though he is a skeptic of the amyloid hypothesis he did note that removing amyloid plaques with lecanemab provided some evidence linking it to cognition.

Matthew Schrag a clinician-scientist at Vanderbilt University said: “I doubt that most individual patients would be able to detect this difference.”

These positions are supported by a 2019 study that asked when these results are clinically meaningful. The authors suggested that a minimum difference of 0.98 is noticeable for those with mild cognitive impairment while for mild Alzheimer’s the clinically meaningful threshold is closer to 1.6 points.

A Lancet editorial written by a commission of prominent Alzheimer’s researchers also raised these concerns. They also cautioned that adverse events seen in more than one if five patients taking on lecanemab could accidentally unblind participants in the trial. Since they may know that they are getting a treatment it introduces additional bias into the results. The authors emphasized that “the immediate impact of lecanemab should not be overstated.”

What else did the trial show?

The trial also took several other measures of cognition. Here is a quick summary of those findings.

The trial also found that lecanemab led to a significant reduction in brain amyloid compared to placebo where the levels of brain amyloid remained high. The average reduction in brain amyloid moved lecanemab patients below the threshold of a positive amyloid PET scan.

The researchers also performed some exploratory analysis to understand whether some groups benefited more from lecanemab. Though the sample was small the researchers found that people with two copies of the ApoE4 gene and received lecanemab actually showed faster rates of cognitive decline than carriers assigned to the placebo group. Although women are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s they benefited substantially less from lecanemab than the men.

How safe is lecanemab?

Serious adverse events occurred in 14 percent of people receiving lecanemab and 11.3 percent in the placebo group. In addition 6.9 percent of people in the lecanemab group left the study due to the side effects compared to 2.9 percent in the placebo group.

More than one in four people in the lecanemab group received an infusion-related reaction compared to less than one in thirteen people in the placebo group.

But the biggest flurry of discussion about lecanemab’s safety in the media has revolved around deaths that occurred among participants during the drug’s clinical trial.

Prior to the presentation at CTAD STAT News and Science reported on two deaths linked to lecanemab. These deaths occurred in the open-label extension of the study where some participants were observed as they continued taking lecanemab after the 18-month randomized Phase 3 trial concluded.

Eisai did not attribute the deaths to lecanemab. “The two cases on lecanemab occurred in the open-label extension study” an Eisai spokesperson told Being Patient. “Both cases had significant comorbidities and risk factors including anticoagulation contributing to macrohemorrhage or death.”

A third death occurred during open-label extension in mid-September that was not discussed at CTAD. The media learned abotu this death in December 2022. According to reporting by Science the woman who died had no other underlying medical issues. Regarding this third death Eisai shared comments with Science magazine and Being Patient. “As a general comment on the unfortunate occurrences of participants in clinical trials who pass away any evaluation of a death or deaths must consider the age of the population and their other medical conditions as well as the length of the study.]” a spokesperson for Eisai wrote. “The rates of deaths and causes of deaths that we are observing in the lecanemab studies are consistent with those expected in people this age as well as what was observed in our long-term ARICEPT experience” the spokesperson added. “Of course the best source of information is the double-blind placebo-controlled studies which were presented at CTAD and in the NEJM publication. The reports of deaths in the lecanemab treated patients is similar to the placebo group and does not suggest an increase in deaths overall or from any individual cause.” The details regarding the cause of the individual deaths during the trial was not shared in the publication or in the conference making it difficult for scientists who aren’t involved in the trial to make any other determination about lecanemab-related deaths versus other causes.

Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities

Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are a side effect of experimental anti-amyloid treatments. While they are usually asymptomatic it is unclear whether ARIA is associated with harmful outcomes in the long-run.

Around one in eight people who received lecanemab experienced ARIA-E which refers to swelling of the brain. Among them only 3 percent were symptomatic. One in seven participants developed ARIA-H which refers to brain bleeding. These reactions occurred most often in participants who carried two copies of the ApoE4 gene.

Do the benefits outweigh the risks?

Do Leqembi’s risks to a patient outweigh its cognitive health benefits? This is the million-dollar question that patients and caregivers must consider if the drug becomes available.

An Eisai spokesperson did not answer the question directly writing that the company “believes this evidence is sufficient to obtain traditional approval” and that they will review the findings with the FDA by the end of the year.

Many of the scientific experts that provided comments to the Science Media Center did not explicitly state whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Instead they mentioned that rigorous monitoring and further study of who is at risk of developing serious side effects is required. Those that did weigh in clearly did not believe the benefits outweighed the risks.

Rogers believes that if the drug is approved the decision to take the drug will be individual. In addition she believes it is important for emergency physicians treating stroke patients to know whether they are currently taking or have taken anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody drugs in the past. It may require strokes to be treated differently than usual.

“I would say to a patient group that I recommend against it” Herrup said. He added that we don’t know the long term impact of ARIA. He worries that the price point may create more disparities in treatment.

“This is still a relatively small trial so it is going to take additional trials with more patients to settle the issue of whether the benefits outweigh the risks” Weaver said. “Additional use of the agent for longer periods of time will be crucial before any definitive conclusions can be reached regarding the ultimate safety and use of this agent.”

Howard also does not think that the benefits outweigh the risks even though lecanemab may be safer than Aduhelm. (In February 2024 Biogen took Aduhelm off the market indefinitely.) Similarly Schrag was concerned about the drug’s safety profile believing it “washes out any marginal cognitive benefits.”

Answering the other frequently asked questions about lecanemab

If you’re just catching the news about lecanemab or need a quick reminder we answer some of the other questions people frequently ask about the drug.

Was lecanemab tested across all stages of Alzheimer’s disease?

The clinical trial tested lecanemab in people who had amyloid plaques in their brain and were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease.

What kind of drug is lecanemab?

Lecanemab isn’t like the drugs you might keep in your bathroom cabinet. It is an antibody created by scientists to target a specific type of toxic amyloid protein. Since it “sticks” to one particular spot on the amyloid it is called monoclonal.

How is lecanemab administered?

Lecanemab is delivered intravenously to patients via an infusion. This requires a specialty facility and staff to oversee the process and ensure patient safety.

What’s the difference between Leqembi and Aduhelm?

Aduhelm targets beta-amyloid plaques for clearance while lecanemab targets toxic beta-amyloid proteins before they form plaques.

What happens when people stop taking a monoclonal antibody anti-amyloid drug for Alzheimer’s like Leqembi?

According to the data amyloid plaques are cleared below the Alzheimer’s threshold after 18 months. An Eisai spokesperson explained that participants who discontinued lecanemab after 18 months in their open label study experienced a gradual accumulation of beta-amyloid and decline similar to what the untreated group experienced.

“Continued treatment is required although we are exploring less frequent maintenance dosing after amyloid clearance” the spokesperson added.

The takeaway on Leqembi (lecanemab)

While experts think it is likely that lecanemab is approved by the FDA few experts have stated that the benefits unequivocally outweigh the risks. The majority of scientists Being Patient interviewed who weren’t involved in the clinical trial either don’t think the results are clinically meaningful or unsure. Many of them worry about the adverse effects and some bring up the possibility of bias in the clinical trial.

We will continue to provide updates as we receive comments from other experts.

UPDATE: 3 March 2024 9:21 P.M. ET. In February 2024 Biogen took Aduhelm off the market citing financial concerns. Although the drug did receive accelerated conditional FDA approval for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease in 2021 it is no longer available to new patients. The company announced it would sunset trials in May 2024 and cease supplying the drug to current patients in November 2024.",,,,,,

AT&T* (NYSE:T) and BlackRock Alternatives (BlackRock) through a fund managed by its Diversified Infrastructure business have signed a definitive agreement to form a joint venture that will operate a commercial fiber platform. The newly formed joint venture — Gigapower LLC — expects to provide a best-in-class fiber network to internet service providers (ISPs) and other businesses across the United States.

Gigapower will serve customers outside of AT&T’s traditional 21-state wireline service footprint with fiber access technologies in innovative and efficient ways. And AT&T will leverage its nationwide wireless sales capabilities to sell fiber to customers in Gigapower territories.

“Now more than ever people are recognizing that connecting changes everything” said John Stankey CEO of AT&T. “With this joint venture more customers and communities outside of our traditional service areas will receive the social and economic benefits of the world’s most durable and capable technology to access all the internet has to offer.”

“We are excited to form the Gigapower joint venture in partnership with AT&T which will be serving as not only a joint owner but also the first wholesale tenant. We believe Gigapower’s fiber infrastructure designed as a commercial open access platform will more efficiently connect communities across the United States with critical broadband services” said Mark Florian Global Head of Diversified Infrastructure BlackRock. “We look forward to partnering with Gigapower’s highly experienced management team to support the company’s fiber deployment plans and shared infrastructure business model.”

Gigapower plans to deploy a reliable multi-gig fiber network to an initial 1.5 million customer locations across the nation using a commercial open access platform. The Gigapower fiber deployment will be incremental to AT&T’s existing target of 30 million-plus fiber locations including business locations by the end of 2025. Combined with existing efforts within AT&T’s 21-state footprint this capital efficient network deployment will advance efforts to bridge the digital divide ultimately helping to provide the fast and highly secure internet people need. This network expansion will also help spur local economies in each of the communities in which Gigapower operates.

“Fiber is the lifeblood of digital commerce” said Bill Hogg CEO of Gigapower. “We have a proven team of professionals building this scalable commercial open access wireline fiber network. Our goal is to help local service providers provide fiber connectivity create the communications infrastructure needed to power the next generation of services and bring multi-gig capabilities to help close the gap for those who currently are without multi-gig service.”

Following close AT&T and BlackRock will jointly own and govern Gigapower. AT&T does not expect to consolidate Gigapower’s financial results but does expect to report its consumer subscribers served through Gigapower in Consumer Wireline business unit operational results. Any impacts to AT&T’s 2023 capital investment or free cash flow forecast will be included in AT&T’s 2023 financial guidance when it announces fourth-quarter 2022 results in January 2023.

The terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

The joint venture named Gigapower will service customers outside of AT&T's 21-state wireline network that primarily covers the southern and midwestern US as well as California Florida and Texas. The multi-gig fiber network will deploy to an initial 1.5 million customers. AT&T says that it's committed to serve fiber to 30 million locations by the end of 2025. The press release didn't say to which states or communities Gigapower's service would be expanding.

""We believe Gigapower's fiber infrastructure designed as a commercial open access platform will more efficiently connect communities across the United States with critical broadband services"" said Mark Florian BlackRock's global head of diversified infrastructure in a statement.

Locating local internet providers

AT&T didn't provide additional comment. BlackRock declined to comment further.

Gigapower's formation comes as fiber internet continues to expand across the US. Last year President Joe Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law which included $65 billion for broadband and was praised by industry trade groups such as the Fiber Broadband Association.

Locating local internet providers

It's also a necessary step in crossing the broadband divide which has left millions of Americans in more rural areas without access to high-speed internet. This includes ISPs historically redlining low-income neighborhoods high costs and a dismissal of tribal lands.

AT&T Fiber which can deliver speeds as high as 5 gigabits per second is becoming an important line of revenue for the telecom company. Earlier this year AT&T said it had 6.6 million fiber subscribers with consumer wireline revenue of $3.2 billion in Q2 2022.

The rules were supposed to be effective in the 2023 tax filing year in accordance with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in November 2021.

The new law requires that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) develop a standard definition of what a “cryptocurrency broker” is and any business that falls under this definition is required to issue a Form 1099-B to every customer detailing their profits and losses from trades. It also requires these firms to provide this same information to the IRS so that it will be aware of customers’ incomes from trading.

However more than 12 months have passed since the infrastructure bill became law but the IRS has still not published a definition of what a “crypto broker” is or created standard forms for these firms to use in making the reports.

In a Dec. 23 statement the Treasury Department says that it intends to craft such rules soon as it explains:

“The Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the IRS intend to implement section 80603 of the Infrastructure Act by publishing regulations specifically addressing the application of sections 6045 and 6045A to digital assets and providing forms and instructions for broker reporting […] After careful consideration of all public comments received and all testimony at the public hearing final regulations will be published.”

In the meantime the department says that brokers will not be required to comply with the new crypto tax provisions stating:

“Brokers will not be required to report or furnish additional information with respect to dispositions of digital assets under section 6045 or issue additional statements under section 6045A or file any returns with the IRS on transfers of digital assets under section 6045A(d) until those new final regulations under sections 6045 and 6045A are issued.”

However taxpayers (customers) will still be required to comply with the crypto tax provisions.

The crypto tax provisions have been controversial within the blockchain industry ever since they were first proposed. Critics have argued that the broad definition of “broker” under the law could be used to attack Bitcoin miners who will likely be unable to comply with reporting provisions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtaGFzLTExMGItZm9yLWhvbWVidXlpbmctc3ByZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street Has $110B Available for Homebuying Spree,"Wall Street has amassed a considerable war chest to take advantage of the shifting housing market.

Institutional investors have earmarked up to $110 billion to purchase or build single-family rentals Insider reported. The estimate comes from Zelman & Associates which hailed the amount as the most ever accumulated by investors to acquire U.S. homes. Of the $110 billion $30 billion has already been committed to properties being leased or developed a Zelman investment banker added.

The money is enough for roughly 400000 homes. Institutional investors already own about 700000. That is only 3 percent of the nation’s 20 million single-family rentals according to Roofstock but MetLife Investment Management predicts it will grow to 40 percent by 2030.

The players gearing up for a homebuying spree in the $4.4 trillion single-family rental market run the gamut but include major names. Invitation Homes Tricon Residential Blackstone and KKR are among them as are wealth managers and pension funds such as CalPERS and Invesco.

Investors are looking for a better bet than their traditional property holdings including office buildings which are struggling. In addition to single-family rentals they have been drawn to multifamily buildings and industrial assets.

Institutions pumped $50 billion into the single-family rental market during the first two years of the pandemic John Burns Real Estate Consulting estimated. But the market has shifted in recent months as rising mortgage rates sidelined not only individuals but institutions.

Single-family rental transaction volume was down 70 percent year-over-year through November according to an estimate by Adam Stern the CEO of Strata SFR.

The housing market is presenting an opportunity for investors though as many individuals want to live in houses but don’t want to buy at the moment because prices and mortgage rates have jumped — or they expect to move in the near future.

Prices could decline in 2023 as more homes are listed for sale. Investors are also working with builders on built-to-rent communities allowing investors to score deals and builders to ease inventory crunches.

The message imparted by Boeing officials then was simple: A software fix which would be available in months was all that was needed to right the system.

At the time Air Force officials vehemently and publicly disagreed and it turned out Boeing was wrong. The issue was more severe and would take far longer to rectify. After two more years of sometimes heated disputes with the Air Force including a stern letter from the service’s top general to Boeing’s chief executive the company agreed in May 2020 to completely redesign the KC-46’s Remote Vision System on its own dime.

Now the company is ready to show off an early prototype of what it’s calling the Remote Vision System 2.0 giving a glimpse of it to a handful of reporters who were invited back to Everett on Dec. 20. And although the technology on view exhibited a major step up from the legacy system the visit also highlighted a defrosting in the relationship between the Air Force and Boeing with officials from the Air Force’s KC-46 program office and the operational community taking part in the tour to share their overwhelmingly positive thoughts on RVS 2.0.

RVS 2.0 provides a “quantum leap” in camera technology said Lt. Col. Joshua Renfro of the Air Force’s KC-46 cross functional team. “We’re very confident in the product. We like where it’s going and we really like what this is going to deliver to us down the road” he told reporters during the visit. (Breaking Defense accepted travel and hotel accommodations from Boeing.)

James Burgess Boeing’s vice president for the KC-46 program acknowledged that the relationship between Boeing and the Air Force hit a rough spot after numerous technical problems were identified during testing with the disagreement over how to fix RVS emerging as “most significant” source of friction between the two. However “I think the approach that the company has taken with RVS 2.0 has really helped to restore it back to a very healthy productive partnership” he said.

Renfro agreed stating that the parties have moved from an “adversarial relationship” to “more collaboration more partnership.” Throughout the visit Renfro and other Air Force officials underscored the service’s role in helping to design RVS 2.0 and expressed confidence in the ability of the KC-46 to conduct its missions even with the more limited vision system. Meanwhile at multiple times Boeing officials deferred to the airmen present when asked about the capabilities of both the old and new versions of RVS requesting that the servicemembers provide their views instead.

Although the agreement on RVS 2.0 appears to have healed the rift between Boeing and the Air Force the new system has already hit some snags and has a long road ahead of it.

Supply Chain Woes

In October the Air Force disclosed a 19-month delay to the program with the projected date for “operational military flight release” slipping from March 2024 to October 2025. The service linked that setback to supply chain problems and projected delays associated with the Federal Aviation Administration certification process.

RELATED: Boeing Defense racks up $2.8B in costs this quarter with losses from KC-46 and new Air Force One

Burgess attributed much of the delay to the “[lack of] availability of the hardware to build up the cameras and display boxes that are required for lab testing.” When asked whether Boeing was concerned that RVS 2.0 supply chain issues could slow down KC-46 production in the future he said “it’s something we’re going to have to manage for sure” but declined to give further details.

Dave Schreck who oversees the Collins Aerospace’s avionics business which produces both versions of the RVS said he anticipates electronics and chips to become more widely available in mid-2023.

Meanwhile the Air Force has yet to sign off on a critical design review of the RVS 2.0 system — a necessary milestone for solidifying the design of the system before a production-representative prototype is built and assessed. Kyle Ford Boeing’s KC-46 RVS program manager said Boeing was in “active discussions” with the Air Force on finalizing the CDR but declined to provide a timeline on when the review would officially be closed out.

After CDR Boeing and Collins will create the first prototype RVS 2.0 that will be installed on an airplane and go through developmental testing said Lt. Col. Zachary Schaffer of the KC-46 Program Office.

When that’s finished the system will begin the process of obtaining a supplemental type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration as well as go through additional tests to meet requirements for the operational military flight release milestone he said. Only then will the Air Force will be ready to integrate RVS 2.0 on the production line and start retrofitting operational KC-46s with the technology.

While the initial RVS 2.0 tech looks promising Renfro acknowledged that the Air Force won’t be able to definitively say what it delivers in terms of combat capability until it moves through developmental and operational tests.

“But we’ll put it through the paces and I have every confidence it’ll bring us quite a bit” he said.

A ‘More Immersive’ Vision System

In legacy tankers like the KC-135 and KC-10 the boom operators look out a window at the back of the tanker as they refuel aircraft relying on their eyesight as they steer the tanker’s boom into a receiver aircraft. The KC-46 alters that paradigm moving boom operators to a refueling station near the cockpit where they receive visual cues from the Remote Vision System — a series of optical cameras and infrared sensors that provide imagery to the boom operator.

While the RVS is more technically complicated than simply looking out a window there are operational benefits that come with the sensor suite. For example the KC-46 will be able to conduct “covert” refueling operations in pitch black darkness with the tanker using its longwave infrared cameras to see the boom and guide it into a receiver aircraft and the pilot in a receiver aircraft donning night vision goggles to be able to see the tanker. (Currently the Air Force does not use the KC-46 for covert refueling operations due to limitations with the vision system.)

However for the KC-46’s legacy RVS certain lighting or weather conditions can actually make it more difficult to refuel a receiver. If the sun is at a high angle or if the tanker is flying over water or a thick blanket of clouds light or shadows can reflect onto the receiver aircraft and partially obstruct a boom operator’s view said Ernest Burns Boeing’s test and evaluation chief boom operator.

“You don’t have the option and the luxury in an operational environment to keep going in a heading which will be best conducive to mitigating those environments. If you do that in a combat environment you could be flying into bad territory and you really don’t want a tanker to do that” he said.

The new RVS 2.0 aims to rectify those problems by swapping out the current RVS’s black and white boom cameras with two color 4K cameras and switching out its infrared sensors with more powerful versions. Instead of setting those cameras on an angle as in the original RVS system — a position the Air Force later found caused distortion to the imagery — the cameras will be placed flush against the aircraft.

The panoramic camera system which provides imagery of incoming aircraft will also have its cameras replaced with the new visual and infrared tech used for the RVS 2.0 boom camera system.

Over the summer Boeing and the Air Force outfitted a KC-46 with the new cameras that will be used as part of the RVS 2.0 sensor suite while at the same time retaining its legacy cameras Burns said. It then flew that tanker from the Pacific Northwest down to California giving a split-screen comparison between imagery from the old and new camera suite.

“Everyone really wanted to stress those cameras and see what they look like. And as you can see looking at the baseline system and the new RVS 2.0 cameras the dynamic range of these cameras is phenomenal” he said as the video played for reporters. Burns pointed to footage where blown-out imagery from RVS 1.0 looks crisp and clear with the new camera suite. “They’re able to adapt to that changing environment” he said.

Beyond the cameras themselves RVS 2.0 will feature a more powerful video processing unit and graphics processing unit — a necessary upgrade to ensure the imagery remains crisp and clear as it is processed and sent to the boom operator Ford said. Additional fiber optic cables will also be added to the aircraft to satisfy the greater bandwidth requirements.

One of the biggest changes in RVS 2.0 is the overhaul of the displays the boom operators look at during the refueling process. Currently boom operators wear 3D glasses and “[look] directly at an LCD monitor which is projecting in 3D” Ford said. But after evaluating multiple ways to display the camera imagery the Air Force and Boeing coalesced around an “indirect view” display where an LCD monitor projects 3D imagery to a curved mirror which provides more depth perception to the user.

“Part of that I think was because of the legacy experience of looking at a window” Burgess said. “So we wanted to do something that that provided more immersive experience for the boom operator something that felt more true to life than just looking at a flat panel display.”

Reporters on the tour donned 3D glasses to try out the new display system staring into an angled mirror from which an image of an F-16 appeared to jut out from the screen making contact with a KC-46 boom. The picture was clear with the 3D depiction appearing true to life and no distracting shadows or reflections of light.

And while not as operationally important to the refueling mission as new cameras and displays Burns and Ford noted the new RVS station includes some small upgraded creature comforts — most notably in the form of a center console where 3D glasses can be stored as well as cupholders.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWlyY3VycmVudC5jb20vYWlyY3JhZnQtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQvYm9laW5nLWV4aXRzLTIwMjItd2l0aC1jb25ncmVzc2lvbmFsLWV4ZW1wdGlvbi1mb3ItbWF4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing exits 2022 with congressional exemption for Max,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='theaircurrent.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /aircraft-development/boeing-exits-2022-with-congressional-exemption-for-max/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227841480>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWlyY3VycmVudC5jb20vYWlyY3JhZnQtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQvYm9laW5nLWV4aXRzLTIwMjItd2l0aC1jb25ncmVzc2lvbmFsLWV4ZW1wdGlvbi1mb3ItbWF4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbHlubndvb2R0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9ib2VpbmctbWF4LTIyMTIyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,House passes $1.7 trillion Omnibus bill saving Boeing 737 MAX program,"WASHINGTON D.C. December 23 2022—The House of Representatives passed the $1.7 trillion Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill today that in addition to funding federal agencies through September 30 2023 waives an approaching deadline for the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to meet new FAA safety requirements.

The House passed the bill with a vote of 225-201 which now lands on President Joe Biden’s desk for final signature. The U.S. Senate passed the bill on Thursday with a large bipartisan majority 68-29.

“Safety must always drive the day” Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) who chairs the Commerce Science and Transportation Committee told the Lynnwood Times regarding Boeing 737 Max new FAA safety requirements. “We should not rush the FAA’s safety approval process. The safety-first alternative is much stronger than the no-strings-attached approach that was first offered. Passengers need to know that the entire MAX fleet will be uniform and safer.”

Congress imposed a December 27 deadline for Boeing’s best-selling 737 MAX aircrafts after two separate crashes unfortunately killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. In response Senator Maria Cantwell with the support of Rep. Rick Larsen proposed existing Boeing MAX aircrafts require new safety enhancements including enhanced angle of attack (AOA) and the ability to cease stall warnings and overspeed alerts.

Dave Calhoun

Incorrect data from a single sensor was known to cause a software function called MCAS according to flight data recordings playing a leading role in these 737 crashes. The FAA retrofit requirements would require MCAS only to trigger after receiving data from two AOA sensors. These requirements do not apply to already in-service previously FAA certified aircrafts.

If the legislation had failed to pass Boeing’s Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told Aviation Week there was a possibility the 737 MAX could be shelved leaving thousands of workers without jobs and affecting the future of the U.S. aerospace industry as a whole.

Boeing has already taken orders for approximately 1000 of the MAX 7 and MAX 10 jets worth as much as $50 billion according to FOX News. Boeing declined the Lynnwood Times’ request for comment on the bill’s passage. United Airlines recently announced a $43 billion list price order of 200 Boeing aircraft to update its fleet that includes 80 737 MAX 10 airplanes.

Under Title 5 Section 501 of the Omnibus spending package that refers to Safety Enhancements “an Administrator may not issue a type certificate for a transport category airplane unless it incorporates a flight crew alerting system” beginning December 27 2022. One year after that an “Administrator will not be able to issue a type certificate for any Boeing 737 MAX aircraft unless the Administrator finds that the type design for the aircraft includes approved safety enhancements.”

An additional three years after the date in which a type certificate is issued “no person may operate a 737 MAX aircraft unless the aircraft includes approved safety enhancements and produced and altered in conformance with approved type designs” the bill states.

The Omnibus makes an exception for this December 27 deadline in that it re-codifies the mandate to only apply to FAA certification projects submitted after December 27 2020 (the date in which the Safety Reform Act was enacted). The Boeing MAX 7 and MAX 10 certification applications were submitted in 2017 prior to the Safety Reform Act which allows them to be effectively unaffected by this mandate.

A summary of the FY23 Omnibus funding package can be found here.

Many Republicans voiced their opposition to the Omnibus spending package leading up into today’s vote. Representative Randy Feenstra (IA-04) took to Twitter to criticize the package as “reckless spending” and “government waste.”

On Wednesday 31 House GOP lawmakers and lawmakers-elect signed a letter pledging they would “do everything in our power to thwart even the smallest legislative and policy efforts.”

Current House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA-22) tweeted today that “The omnibus will damage our country & the blatant disregard for Article I Section 5 of our Constitution will forever stain this Congress” noting that “for the first time in history a bill in the House was passed without a physical quorum present – more people voted by proxy than in person.”

McCarthy also criticized the lack of time lawmakers had to efficiently review the 4200-page document before a vote was needed to avoid a temporary government shutdown. He also voiced opposition for the bill funding “wokeness” as it allocates $8.6 million for “gender advisory programs” at the Pentagon $200 million for a Gender Equity Fund & gender programs in Pakistan and $575 million for “family planning where population growth threatens biodiversity.”

Rep. Dan Bishop (NC-09) also criticized the bill for allocating $410 million towards border security for Jordan Lebanon Egypt Tunisia and Oman while prohibiting CBP funding from being used to improve border security here in the United States.

From the opulent to the out there the wildest listings to hit New England's market this year.

This Gloucester Cape-style abode was unassuming enough on the outside but inside was a whole different story. The previous owners transformed their living room space into a tropical getaway complete with teak wood furniture tall tropical trees reaching up to the tips of the cathedral ceilings and an actual working tiki bar. All of which added a bit of flair making the property feel like it was on the shores of the Pacific rather than the Atlantic. Ultimately the place sold for $955000 a little under its original $1100000 asking price—which is really a steal when you consider its a professionally landscaped yard has a Koi pond and a fire pit.

Really everything about this home screams “cozy” from the natural wood features to the 20-foot living-room windows with views of your own private beach off Merrymeeting Lake. But the thing that gives the place the ultimate “treehouse” feel is “The Birdhouse” a second-story room with a private balcony overlooking the water and a literal tree trunk running through it so you feel like you’re actually among the treetops. Sadly this unique find already sold for $2.1 million to some lucky owners who will enjoy this multi-season getaway.

A house with its own equestrian set-up is unique enough on its own: How many people can say they have a 2000 square-foot barn where they can board and exercise multiple horses? But what makes this property a treat for anyone is its location in the middle of Blue Hills Reservation. The house comes with a private equestrian entrance to the park allowing easy access to 7000 acres of land for hiking skiing or riding. This place is still up for grabs for just under $10 million if you’re interested.

Why take a vacation when you can simply buy a home that rivals a fancy hotel? This New Hampshire beauty on the shores of the Cocheco River fits that bill most memorable for its infinity pool overlooking the water. If that is somehow underwhelming the property’s private fishing pond home spa and deep-water dock should sway the most discerning buyers assuming they’ve got $11.9 million to cover its asking price.

Even after a year of historically high home prices this Weston listing which hit the market in November is notable. If it goes for its $38 million price tag it’ll be the town’s most expensive home to date. In exchange buyers will get a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired home with folding glass doors that open up the lower level to the outside for the ultimate indoor-outdoor living situation. Oh and there’s a few sculptures from noted American artists sprinkled throughout the grounds. NBD.

Sometimes a little bit goes a long way as this P-Town condo proves. Yes it’s only 410 square feet but Provincetown’s famous Commercial Street serves as its front yard and the beach as its backyard marrying the best the seaside community has to offer. And you can still do a lot with the limited interior space: The previous owners renovated and made such good use of this itsy bitsy living space that it was used in a Pottery Barn campaign. No wonder it quickly sold for over a million dollars (and $10 thousand over asking).

Boston has a few homes that cause a frenzy when they hit the market (the legendary skinny house comes to mind) and the Ayer Mansion is no exception prompting a stir when it hit the market this past spring. Designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany (the son of the man who founded Tiffany & Co.) the home is one of only three surviving residential commissions he crafted. Tiffany broke the mold creating a sleek pale granite building that stood out among the red brick of Commonwealth Ave. Inside examples of his famous mosaic work survives in tile designs. The home has had a variety of uses of the years and is now being sold as a single-family abode available for a cool $14.9 million (a veritable discount compared to its original listing price of $17 million).

What’s more desirable than a home with outdoor living space? A home with outdoor living space that consists of a custom roof deck. This Hingham home’s personalized perch was especially eye-catching for its unique design having been cut into the sloping roof of this otherwise typical suburban home. The views don’t hurt either: From this perch you can spy the harbor and World’s End park. This home ended up being temporarily withdrawn for the market so keep an eye out if you’d someday like the chance to purchase this space and have your own fireplaced rooftop hangout.

This Norfolk County Colonial comes with all the luxury home basics: A two-story foyer a primary suite with three walk-in closets and a $100000 2023 Jeep Wagoneer. The seller of this grand home is a car dealership owner who decided to throw in a brand-new automobile to sweeten the deal on this home. “I’ve been in the business 22 years. I’ve never had a car added to a property” says Tammy DeWolfe the real estate agent listing the home with Gibson Sotheby’s International Realty. They’ve further upped the ante by dropping the price because this abode is still available and the price was ever lowered from $4.1 million to $3.9 million.

We’d be remiss to talk about Massachusetts real estate this year without mentioning the home become known as the “Yankee Candle house.” The Internet practically exploded when the home of late Yankee Candle founder Michael James Kittredge II hit the market. Priced at $23 million the western Massachusetts compound comes with…literally just about everything. Notable highlights include an indoor water park a three-lane bowling alley a two-story arcade and a home stage where artists like Hall & Oates have played. The home is still for sale should you want to have a lifestyle there like Kittredge’s daughter described.

There were winners (landlords) and losers (mostly tenants surprise!) when it came to Boston-area rents this year.

Sign up for our weekly home and property newsletter featuring homes for sale neighborhood happenings and more.

Ah 2022 a year many hoped the Boston area real estate market would give them a break especially when it came to rentals. Instead it was the perfect storm of low inventory a high number of apartment seekers and a city on the rise that led to city councillors unable to find an affordable room in their own backyards and landlords offering tenants lower payments in exchange for their silence. According to numbers from Zumper Boston’s rental prices continued to climb this year to the point where we’re now tied with San Francisco with the median one-bedroom going for $3000 a month. Very cool! (/Sarcasm.)

Let’s scroll down memory lane to remember this year’s highs (rents) and lows (uh not many monetarily) when it came to local market trends.

Boston’s Post-Covid Recovery Continued

This time last year high rents returned after a year of Covid-related-omg-everyone-is-leaving-the-city-please-take-this-apartment deals. But when we left 2021 landlords were easily filling their units once more as reflected in these numbers: The median price for a one-bedroom was hovering just under $2600 a nearly $600 spike from January 2021 when you could theoretically rent the same place for a little over $2000 (ah the good old days). Despite the winter being a slower time of year Boston-area rents were on the rise after essentially free-falling for most of 2020. And by January 2022 Zumper reported Boston’s median one-bedroom rent hit an all-time high at $2720 a month (only the first of many rent-related records we’d break this year).

Tenants Went to Extreme Measures to Get Deals

As we waded into spring rent growth began to outpace 2021’s increases truly dashing any hopes of lasting changes from 2020’s dip. Instead Boston’s median one-bedroom rent hovered in the mid-to-upper $2000 zone representing a year-over-year growth of 15 to 25 percent according to data from Zumper. City living was desirable again but housing inventory was just as sparse as it was before Covid if not somehow worse. The competitive buying market kept some people locked into their rentals for another year meaning there was less turnover of units than there may have been at other times. At many points vacancy rates in the city were under one percent.

So what did people do? They got…a little desperate. With apartments getting dozens of applicants people were even offering to pay more rent just to get a place as Burhan Azeem a Cambridge city councilor found when he was trying find a place to rent earlier this year. On the flip side while on his own house hunt Azeem found rooms for rent without heat windows or any sort of storage space which says a lot about the types of living conditions landlords will try to rent.

Our National Rent Rank Fell… and Then Quickly Rebounded

How quickly the mighty fall. Despite the median one-bedroom rent prices holding strong Boston lost its long-held title as “the city with the third most expensive median one-bedroom rent in the country” (say that five times fast) to Miami in April. Sadly this was not a reflection of how prices were dropping: Turns out the rest of the country was finally catching up to our post-Covid rebound. Then in October we tied with San Francisco for the second most expensive city for median one-bedroom rents. As the seasons changed so did the prices and Boston’s surpassed $3000 for a one-bedroom (yikes).

We Ended on a High Note… For Prices

If you’re looking to rent a one-bedroom now expect to pay up to $3000 as the median price is now $2990 a month per Zumper’s latest rent report up 16 percent from this time last year. Boston is still tied with San Francisco for the nation’s number two spot. Only time will tell what lies ahead in 2023: While the housing market looks more promising for first-time buyers—suggesting more rentals will open up—the area still severely lacks the inventory needed to keep up with demand. But on the bright side…at least we’re still not the most expensive. (That honor still belongs to New York City.) However it remains to be seen what housing horrors 2023 will bring.",,,

A reader asks: ""Can I use an electric blanket or heated jacket if I have a pacemaker?""

Chloe MacArthur Senior Cardiac Nurse at the BHF says:

Many people are looking for ways to stay warm in winter and with rising energy bills there has been new interest in heated blankets and clothing. If you have a pacemaker or an ICD (implanted cardioverter defibrillator) you might be wondering whether these can cause problems for you.

Many heating devices are safe to use if you have a pacemaker or an ICD. If in doubt check your manufacturer’s guidance or ask your pacing clinic. Most cardiac device manufacturers have guidance online about which items could cause a problem for your device.



For example two of the largest device manufacturers Boston Scientific and Medtronic list electric blankets and heating pads as “safe under normal use” or “no known risk”. Boston Scientific also lists heated motorcycle vests as “safe to use” (Medtronic does not include guidance about heated clothing).

If you’re thinking of using something that sits directly over your pacemaker or ICD such as a heated jacket check with your pacing clinic to make sure.

Remember that your implanted device will return to the settings that your doctor chose as soon as you step away from any electronic equipment that affects its function.

Climate change is set to take a massive toll on Massachusetts’ public health ecosystems infrastructure and economy before the century’s end according to a recent state report.

INTO THE RED: Climate and the fight of our lives

According to Paul Kirshen who served as a consultant on the analysis things are looking dire.

“I was just blown away by how bad the impacts are” said Kirshen a professor of climate adaptation at the University of Massachusetts Boston and research director of the climate adaptation organization Stone Living Lab.

The new study will directly inform the first five-year update to the 2018 State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan set to be released in fall 2023.

“Massachusetts continues to take a leadership role in climate action and this assessment serves as another important tool that will guide the state as we improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change” Governor Charlie Baker said in a statement.

Here are four of the biggest takeaways from the assessment.

Summers in Mass. could eventually feel like summers in Georgia

It’s no surprise that climate change is making Massachusetts hotter but the extent of warming the study projects is stunning.

Future Massachusetts summers are forecast to be so warm that they’ll become unrecognizable for the Commonwealth.

By 2030 the average summertime temperature in Massachusetts will feel more like current New York summer. By 2050 Massachusetts summers will feel like Maryland’s. By 2070 they’ll feel like North Carolina’s and by 2090 summer in Massachusetts could feel like the average summer in Georgia today.

Humidity in Massachusetts could also increase making it feel even hotter. The hottest daily temperatures on summer days statewide from 1950 to 2013 felt like 81 degrees Fahrenheit when taking humidity into account. But by 2050 the hottest days could feel like 94 degrees Fahrenheit and by 2070 it could feel like 99 degrees Fahrenheit.

Unless the Commonwealth makes serious changes to prepare for the coming heat temperature increases will unleash cascading effects. By 2090 the state could see over 400 additional deaths per year across the state the report says. Without efforts to adapt the heat could also inhibit children’s ability to pay attention in school and lead to an increased rate of workplace injuries.

“The consequences of increased extreme heat are projected to be extreme due to the severity of those effects” the report says.

The air will get dirtier and could make us sicker

As the climate crisis persists it will degrade air quality.

Higher air temperatures can make pollution worse by speeding up the formation of ground-level ozone — a pollutant created when volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides both produced by industrial activities react with oxygen.

Changes in precipitation could exacerbate the problem. Though the Commonwealth is expected to get wetter on average it could see that rainfall on fewer days meaning we could see more dry summers in the future. During those dryer periods particulate pollution like from dust soot and smoke gets flushed out of the air less often.

As summers get hotter and dryer wildfires could also become more common and severe in Massachusetts spewing more pollution into the air. Wildfires are expected to become a larger problem in other parts of North America too and sometimes fine particulate matter can travel long distances — such as from the western United States — and have a large impact on air quality in the Commonwealth.

This is expected to take a major toll on human health including by making asthma more common. Unless the state works to clean up the air it could see over 100 additional asthma diagnoses annually by 2030. And by 2090 it could see over 900 additional asthma cases and 200 more asthma-related deaths.

We’re not all in this together

All of Massachusetts will be impacted by climate change but some people will be disproportionately affected.

For instance the report says that “racial minorities” are concentrated in regions of the Commonwealth expected to be most impacted by increased extreme heat. That’s due in large part to the creation of heat islands — areas where there is abundant concrete that absorbs heat and a lack of greenery for shade — and also because air conditioning may be less available and affordable for these populations the report says.

Black Massachusetts residents are 40 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma diagnoses.

Areas where most households face linguistic isolation — defined by the state as homes where all members 14 years old and over speak a language other than English and have difficulty with English — are also more likely to be affected by extreme heat. In fact they are a shocking 28 percent more likely to die from extreme heat.

One simple but effective way to combat these disproportionate impacts the report says is to increase tree canopy cover in the Commonwealth’s hottest urban areas to provide more potentially life-saving shade.

Infrastructure could buckle under extreme heat

Climate-related changes could weaken Massachusetts’ infrastructure making residents more vulnerable.

For instance extreme coastal storm surge events and inland flooding which are both projected to become more common could flood evacuation routes. This could trap more residents the report says and lead to increased loss of life and injuries.

The authors also say Commonwealth residents should expect the electricity grid to be damaged by heat stress and heavy rainfall. Public transit could be affected too: Bus routes could get flooded and train tracks could buckle under extreme heat.

The report suggests that officials must take climate change into account when preparing emergency response plans and deciding how to undertake infrastructure repairs.

The COMMAND VTE (COntemporary ManageMent AND outcomes in patients with Venous ThromboEmbolism) Registry is a physician-initiated retrospective multicenter cohort study in which consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTE among 29 centers in Japan were included between January 2010 and August 2014. The design of the registry was previously reported in detail1112. We searched the hospital databases for clinical diagnosis and imaging examinations and enrolled consecutive patients who met the definition of acute symptomatic VTE diagnosed within 31 days from symptom onset during the study period13.

We enrolled 3027 consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTE after screening of the consecutive 19634 patients with suspected VTE for eligibility through chart review by the physicians at each institution. According to the occurrence of recurrent VTE during the entire follow-up period and the status of anticoagulation therapy at the time of the recurrent VTE event the current study population was divided into the following 3 groups; (1) First recurrent VTE during anticoagulation therapy; (2) First recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy; and (3) No recurrent VTE during the follow-up period (Fig. 1). Recurrent VTE was defined as PE and/or DVT with symptoms accompanied by confirmation of new thrombus or exacerbation of the thrombus by objective imaging examinations or autopsy14.

Ethics approval and consent to participate

The ethics committee of primary institution; Kyoto University Hospital Ethics Committee approved the research protocol (Approval number R0493). The relevant review boards or ethics committees in all other 28 participating centers (Supplementary Appendix 1) also approved the research protocol. All procedures followed were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent from each patient was waived because we used clinical information obtained in routine clinical practice and none of the patients refused to participate in the study when contacted for follow-up which was approved by the ethics committee of the principal institution (Kyoto University Hospital Ethics Committee; the approval number R0493). This method is concordant with the guidelines for epidemiological studies issued by the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare in Japan.

Data collection and definitions for patient characteristics

Detailed methodology of data collection in the COMMAND VTE Registry was previously reported11. Just briefly data were collected from the hospital charts or hospital databases according to the pre-specified definitions. The physicians at each institution were responsible for data entry into an electronic case report form with additional monitoring for the quality of data at the general office of the registry. Patients with active cancer were defined as those on treatment for cancer such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy those scheduled to undergo cancer-surgery those with metastasis to other organs and/or those with terminal cancer (expected life expectancy of 6 months or less) at the time of the diagnosis. Data for prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) during follow-up in patients receiving warfarin were collected from the hospital charts of the centers where the index VTE was diagnosed. The presumed stable PT-INR values for warfarin users was evaluated as the first PT-INR between 1 and 6 months after VTE diagnosis. The detailed definitions of patient characteristics are described in Supplementary Appendix 2.

Clinical follow-up and endpoints

Detailed methodology of clinical follow-up in the COMMAND VTE Registry was previously reported11. In the current study we evaluated the clinical outcomes at 90 days after the first recurrent VTE events and all the clinical outcomes were evaluated irrespective of the status of anticoagulation therapy after the first recurrent VTE.

The primary outcome measure in the current study was all-cause death at 90 days after the first recurrent VTE. The independent clinical event committee (Supplementary Appendix 3) unaware of the patient characteristics reviewed all the death events and classified the causes of death as due to PE due to bleeding events due to cancers due to cardiac causes due to other non-cardiac causes or due to unknown causes15. Death was judged to be due to PE (fatal PE) if it was confirmed by autopsy or if death followed a clinically severe PE after first recurrent PE events. Death was judged to be bleeding related if it followed an intracranial hemorrhage or a bleeding episode leading to hemodynamic deterioration. Death in patients with the end-stage cancer without a specific cause of death was regarded as cancer in origin. Death was judged to be due to cardiac events if it followed acute myocardial infarction heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia. Final classifications for the causes of deaths were made on the basis of the full consensus of the independent clinical event committee.

The secondary outcome measures in the current study were recurrent VTE and major bleeding at 90 days after the first recurrent VTE. Recurrent VTE was defined as PE and/or DVT with symptoms accompanied by objective imaging examinations or autopsy14. Major bleeding was defined as International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding which consisted of a reduction in the hemoglobin level by at least 2 g/dL transfusion of at least 2 units of blood or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ16.

Statistical analysis

In the current study we evaluated the baseline characteristics among the 3 groups. Characteristics management strategies and outcomes of the first recurrent VTE were compared between the 2 groups of patients who had recurrent VTE during and after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. Moreover we conducted an exploratory analysis for first recurrent VTE during anticoagulation therapy comparing patients with and without active cancer. Categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages and continuous variables are presented as the mean and standard deviation or the median and interquartile range (IQR) based on their distributions. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test when appropriate; otherwise Fisher’s exact test was used. Continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon’s rank sum test between the 2 groups and one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal–Wallis test based on their distributions among the 3 groups. The 90-day clinical outcomes after the first recurrent VTE are presented as the number of events and incidences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All statistical analyses were conducted using JMP version 14.0.0 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC USA; https://www.jmp.com/en_gb/software/new-release/preview-jmp14.html). All reported P-values were 2-tailed and P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",,,,,,,,,

Her coworker has confessed to the killing,"Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was shot and killed in Tennessee last month and a coworker has reportedly confessed to the crime.

Police in Memphis say Brown was murdered in the early morning hours of April 19 after she finished her work shift at Checkers a drive-thru fast-food establishment according to local CBS affiliate WREG. She was seen on video driving away in her Pontiac G3 with coworker Alexander Williamson 20 just after 2:30 a.m. Brown’s body was discovered in her car several hours later in a wooded area on Rolling Woods Drive. She suffered a single gunshot wound to her left side.

On April 28 Williamson voluntarily walked into a police station and confessed to the crime local Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV reported. He reportedly gave a full confession but police provided no information about a possible motive or why he decided to confess.

Alexander Williamson Shelby County Sheriff's Office

Brown is the 11th known trans individual to die violently this year and the second known Black trans woman to be killed according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of WeCare Tennesse which supports trans women of color in the state decried violence against Black trans women and called for greater efforts on behalf of the trans community.

“It saddens me that we are living in a time where black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” Tasaki said in a statement. “Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on. It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

Brown was a victim of violence last year when shot while waiting for an Uber after work on October 18. She was accosted by two men around 3 a.m. She was able to use mace on the man with a gun but he wiped his face and shot her in the leg. She later told local ABC affiliate WATN-TV she felt lucky that the man didn’t shoot her in the back as she fled.

This is not the first time Williamson has been charged with murder. He was arrested in 2022 along with his brothers Artavious 23 and Ajaylin. 22 for the shooting death of a man who had been in an earlier dispute with Artvavious. He reportedly returned with his brothers to the man’s Memphis home where he shot and killed him after challenging him to a fist fight WHBQ-TV reported at the time. Williamson then 19 was charged with second-degree murder."

And several other countries which may not be traditionally thought of as whisky strongholds released more than one great expression this year.

So don’t take this heavily truncated list of 12 best whiskies from around the world to mean that other countries outside of the United States weren’t up to par in 2022.

These are outstanding bottles but some are admittedly hard to find domestically. Which is why you should do what I’m doing — typing this as I fly to Ireland for a 10-day whisky-soaked sojourn (if you really want a best-of in that category we have 40 bottles to choose from). Until that happens however consider this a tasting menu of the world’s best whiskey outside of our borders.

M&H Apex Dead Sea The Milk & Honey Distillery

What happens when you craft a whisky at the lowest (and one of the hottest) places on Earth? The Israeli distillery M&H was aged in the Dead Sea area resulting in notes ranging from spearmint to black tea leaves to candied ginger notes with a dry smoky tobacco undertone.

Ardbeg Fermutation Ardbeg

Most Ardbeg is only fermented for 72 hours. But this 13-year-old Islay expression underwent a three-week fermentation (due to a boiler accident) resulting in a still-peaty single malt that’s also wonderfully fruity and malty (“smoky jammy biscuit” was my professional tasting note).

Compass Box Vellichor Compass Box

The first Limited Edition of 2022 from these Scotch whisky mavericks was (as they note) “inspired by the experience emotion and aroma of old bookshops.” We tried it and yep it does fit that profile — a bit leathery but also fruity smoky and great for those who like Sherry-matured whisky (and if you have many leather-bound books). It’s a combination of rare Sherry-matured blends with malt whiskies from the Highland Park and Macallan distilleries (both 23 years or older) together with a small amount of old whisky from the Caol Ila Distillery.

The Glenrothes 36 Year Old Single Cask Scotch The Glenrothes

This Speyside distillery only released 168 bottles of this 36-year-old single malt — but it’s worth hunting down. You’ll get a lot of tropical fruit oak almonds and vanilla with the liquid. If you like older Scotch that’s spent its life in sherry-seasoned casks this is an ideal sipper.

Redbreast Kentucky Oak Edition Irish Distillers

A new 101-proof limited release from the Irish whiskey brand’s new American Oak Series the whiskey here is matured in American Oak bourbon barrels and Spanish Oloroso sherry butts before being finished for a period of 3-7 months in naturally air-dried PEFC-certified American Oak 1 sourced from the Taylor Family’s Elk Cave Farm in Kentucky. The combo certainly enhances the wood and vanilla notes while the hints of dark fruit nutmeg and cinnamon still wonderfully linger. An ideal Irish pick for the American whiskey drinker.

Starward Octave Barrels Starward Whisky

A limited-edition release from our favorite Australian distillery — here their single malt is aged in Yalumba’s The Octavius Old Vine Shiraz barrels. The wine and dark fruit notes here are powerful and there’s a nice hint of salinity.

Gordon & MacPhail 1949 from Milton Distillery Gordon & MacPhail

These century-old family-owned whisky creators match their own casks with spirits from 100 Scottish distilleries creating unique or one-of-a-kind bottlings. This one is the last cask laid down in the 1940s from Milton Distillery (today known as Strathisla). The 72-year-old expression (!) was matured in a first-fill Sherry puncheon and if you have a spare $65000 you might be able to pick up one of the 180 bottles. Heavy tobacco on the nose plus notes of pear lemon apple nutmeg. From the two sips we were able to have this is sublime.

The Legendary Midnight Silkie Sliabh Liag Distillers

The core release from Sliabh Liag Distillers was a previous Ultimate Spirits Challenge winner for best blended Irish whiskey. Midnight is a tripled distilled peated single malt matured in an array of casks (sherry bourbon oloroso red wine virgin oak and imperial stout). Here orange zest tobacco dried fruits baking spices and a very creamy and lush mouthfeel combine together for an ideal winter sipper.

Benriach Smoke Season Brown-Forman

The second edition of the annual Smoke Season expression (52.8% ABV) is crafted with Highland peat and matured in first-fill bourbon barrels combined with a high proportion of charred and toasted American virgin oak casks. It’s creamy fruity and peaty with hints of caramel.

Indri-Trini Single Malt Indian Whisky: The Three Wood Piccadily Distilleries

The first Indian whisky to be produced in three different wooden barrels: Ex-bourbon French red wine and PX Sherry casks. At 46% ABV this single malt made from indigenous six-row barley grown for hundreds of years in Rajasthan takes on elements of each barrel and offers up tropical pineapple and raisin notes.

Octomore 13.3 Bruichladdich

This annual release from Bruichladdich found a standout close to home. Aged in a combination of first-fill American Oak whisky and second-fill European oak casks 13.3 is crafted from 100% Islay barley and comes in at a whopping 129.3 PPM and 61.1% ABV. It was distilled from the 2015 harvest of Octomore Farm Concerto barley and later undergoes two cask different cask maturations. The mouthfeel here is creamy and everything feels a bit bolder than the other 13 releases — the maltiness the overripe fruit the dry finish the minerality. Meanwhile the peat is certainly present but not overpowering.

Teeling Wonders of Wood Single Malt Chinkapin Oak Teeling

This Best Single Pot Still winner at the 2022 World Whiskies Awards is 50% malted barley and 50% unmalted barley and comes in at 50% ABV. There’s a coffee flavor and a definite earthiness here with lots of wood spice ginger and dark chocolate; a drop or two of water opens it up to a gingerbread note. Fantastic and unique.",,,,,,,,,

After the pop star encouraged fans to vote in the 2018 midterm elections Ms. Smith registered. The 23-year-old’s most recent rite of passage — getting her first credit card — was also prompted by the singer.

When the 11-time Grammy winner announced her Eras Tour her first in five years Ms. Smith said she knew she had to “do everything in my power to be able to get tickets.” So she signed up for a card through Capital One which partnered with Ms. Swift to promote the tour and offered fans preferential access to presale tickets.

“Taylor Swift was once again that push” said Ms. Smith who lives in Pittsburgh. In addition to getting concert tickets she hoped the card would help her to build good credit. “As I signed up because of the Taylor presale I realized the importance of financial literacy and maybe it should be pushed more in schools and colleges” she said. Ms. Smith who has cerebral palsy was able to get four accessible seats for her and her friends for about $1013 though she used her debit card because the total exceeded her credit card’s limit.

Still getting a credit card was already a goal of Ms. Smith’s partially because her mother had encouraged her to start building credit so that she would have a good credit score when she moved into her own apartment and Ms. Swift’s concert deal led Ms. Smith to take that financial step.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZGNpc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5LzIyLzEyLzIzLzIwMjMtZGMtYmlnLWNvbmNlcnQtcHJldmlldy1jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS1maWxsbW9yZS1iaXJjaG1lcmUtbWVycml3ZWF0aGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2023 DC Concert Agenda: Big Acts Coming Through Town,"Privacy Overview

Please email Travel Tech Reporter Justin Dawes at [email protected] if you have funding news.

Skift kept an eye through much of 2022 on which travel tech startups raised money documented in this weekly startup funding roundup.

Anything related to short-term rentals got the most frequent funding but there was a wide variety of other startups that raise venture capital throughout the year despite a declining economic forecast.

Below is an outline of some of the most interesting travel tech startups in alphabetical order that received funding in 2022.

>>Deal Engine raised $5.3 million — not a lot compared to some of the others in this list — but the Miami-based startup is tackling a problem that’s a notorious headache for airlines and their customers: post-booking flight changes. Historically airlines contract expensive call centers to deal with many of the change requests by customers an issue that became unbearable during the pandemic.

Volaris told Skift that it starts the process with software by Sabre but that only covers about half of the issues and the rest historically were transferred to call centers. With the supplemental Deal Engine software fewer than 10 percent of post-booking calls have to be sent to a call center now.

>>Gordian a Y Combinator grad raised $25 million to help airlines with upselling. The tech is used to help push travelers buying airline tickets into paying for extras like seating assignments and checked baggage.

Because airlines often weren’t getting any upsells in online channels because the agencies weren’t offering them any gain is flowing directly to their bottom line. As a result ordinarily bureaucratic carriers found ways to prioritize the integration.

Gordian in July reported it had more than 100 online travel companies and sites as customers. It also said at that time that it was operating at 15 times its 2019 revenue.

>>Hopper added $96 million to an investment from Capital One and announced a long-term partnership with the bank. The online travel agency has raised a total of $730 million.

Hopper powers Capital One Travel and Hopper also offers an array of fintech products such as price freezes on flights and hotels for an array of other partners. Hopper has said that much of its revenue comes from its unique fintech products.

Hopper claims to be the third largest online travel agency in North America commanding 11.2 percent of third-party flight bookings in the U.S. citing Marketing Information Data Tapes figures.

>>Mews a U.K.-based hotel tech startup raised $185 million led by Kinnevik and Goldman Sachs. It was a number high above typical venture capital fundraises in that industry especially impressive during the economic uncertainty that’s causing venture capital firms to hold onto money a bit tighter.

Mews offers a wide variety of cloud-based solutions for hotels — including property management guest management and a new payments system — all designed on an open system that allows hotels to connect the products with others they may use.

The company plans to focus more on the mid-market segment and expand geographically. Mews also plans to continue acquiring other hotel tech companies.

>>Rapido a taxi service that uses motorbikes instead of cars raised $180 million. The company operates in 100 cities across India. Investors included Swiggy an Indian online food ordering and delivery platform.

The platform in April reported having 450000 monthly active drivers and a total of more than 300 million orders.

>>ResortPass raised $26 million from investors including celebrities Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow for a platform that can help hotels access an entirely new revenue stream.

The ResortPass customer software platform can market availability of a hotel’s amenities — spas pools fitness centers meeting rooms and more — and allow guests to use them during the day without needing to book an overnight stay. The company also offers hotel clients a software platform to manage that business on the backend.

The startup partners with more than 900 hotels including brands like Ritz Carlton Four Seasons Westin Fairmont W Hotels and Hyatt Hotels. Before the pandemic the startup had about 100 hotel partners.

>>TravelPerk a Barcelona-based travel management agency focused on business travelers raised $115 million.

Founded by a Booking.com veteran the startup’s board also includes Gillian Tans former chair and CEO of the online travel agency giant.

TravePerk said it offers an all-in-one platform for business travelers from booking to trip management. The agency is focusing on offering more sustainable travel options and it’s also enhancing an events tool to help connect remote and hybrid teams.

Bonuses

Kyte raised $60 million in venture capital as well as $200 million in asset-backed credit financing from Goldman Sachs and Ares Global Management for an on-demand car rental service that includes doorstep delivery.

Volantio an optimization startup focused on airlines raised $6 million from firms like DiamondStream Partners Alaska Airlines JetBlue and Amadeus.

Sensible Weather raised $4 million for a platform focused on reimbursing travelers for in-trip experiences that are negatively affected specifically for bad weather.

Of course there were a bunch of short-term rental platforms and software companies that raised capital this year including:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy9waG90b3MvcGhvdG9zLXdpemFyZHMtYXQtamF6ei1kZWMtMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Wizards at Jazz // Dec. 22 Photo Gallery,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nba.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /wizards/photos/photos-wizards-at-jazz-dec-22 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224F845B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy9waG90b3MvcGhvdG9zLXdpemFyZHMtYXQtamF6ei1kZWMtMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9hbGV4LW92ZWNoa2luLTgwMi1nb2Fscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alex Ovechkin scores 802nd goal passing Gordie Howe for second all-time,"Alex Ovechkin took the next step in his pursuit of hockey history Friday night scoring his 801st and 802nd career goals to pass Gordie Howe for No. 2 on the NHL’s all-time list.

The milestone goal was an empty-netter inside the blue line with 1:00 left in the Washington Capitals’ 4-1 win over the Winnipeg Jets at Capital One Arena. The home crowd erupted into a frenzy then watched the longtime captain celebrate in exuberant glee with his teammates on the ice. The Russian star’s first goal of the night came off the rush from the circle near the end of the first period."

The put-call ratio is a simple calculation comparing the number of outstanding puts versus calls. Investors use it as a sentiment gauge especially at extreme levels. A high ratio signifies that put volume well exceeds call volume meaning that investors are excessively bearish. Often such a circumstance is construed as a bullish contrarian indicator.

Today as shown in the All-Star Charts graph below the ratio is off the chart at 2.03. We have yet to hear a reasonable explanation for the recent spate of highly positive readings. Our best guess is that one-day expiry options are grossly distorting the ratio. As we shared in our Commentary from December 16: “Almost half of the volume on S&P 500 options is occurring in options that expire in less than a day. Given the extremely short time frame of said option trades these are binary roulette-like bets on the markets.”

These short-term directional market bets are skewing the markets and are likely responsible for the historic put-call ratio. Please don’t ignore the put-call ratio but be careful of reading too much into it.

Market Trading Update

So far “Santa Claus” has been hard to find as the year begins to close. With the market fairly negative for the month it will take a substantial rally next week to keep it from ending in the red. Yesterday despite the Senate passing another $1.7 Trillion in spending that we will have to issue a lot of debt to cover the late afternoon rally failed to get the market into the green. The failure at the 50-DMA keeps short-term downward pressure on the markets along with the MACD sell signal.

The good news if you want to call it that is the market didn’t violate Tuesday’s lows keeping a minor level of support intact. As shown the market is oversold enough for a technical rally. However as we have been cautioning over the last month use any rally to reduce risk heading into year-end.

CarMax Shares Plunge

CarMax shares are down about 15% as its EPS fell well short of expectations (.24 cents vs. estimates of .65). As we wrote in Carvana Goes Kerplop the used car industry is reeling from the hangover resulting from the massive demand and price hikes in 2020 and 2021. Per CarMax: “Vehicle affordability challenges continued to impact our third quarter unit sales performance climbing interest rates and low consumer confidence.” As a result of its financial difficulties the company is suspending share repurchases to retain capital. It fears more pain to come especially if the economy weakens. A lack of inventory was a problem in 2020 and 2021. CarMax Carvana and other used car dealers will have to deal with excess inventory. Such should further pressure used car prices lower.

The graph below shows that CarMax is trading well off its 2021 highs and closing in on the pandemic lows.

GDP Revised Higher

Q3 GDP was revised from 2.9% to 3.2%. The bulk of the revision is due to personal consumption expenditures which rose from 1.7% to 2.3%. The core PCE price index was revised by .1% to 4.7%. Judging by the strength of consumer expenditures and yesterday’s very low jobless claims data the consumer is doing just fine. Assuming such strength continues it will be hard for prices to fall as rapidly as the Fed prefers. The data further affirms the Fed’s projections for no pivot in 2023.

2008 vs. Today

Many analysts have compared this year’s price activity with 2007/2008. The graph below shows that the price activity in the two periods looks very similar. The obvious concern with the analog is that the market fell considerably in late August and early September 2008 setting up the Lehman failure. Will the analog continue to prove a viable road map?

Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson shares the table below to help us compare today with August 2008. For starters valuations are decently higher today as shown by the P/E ratio and the Equity Risk Premium. Those thinking the market is now cheap may want to rethink their logic. Equally important in August 2008 the Fed was already cutting interest rates aggressively and the yield curve was steepening. Then the Fed already cut interest rates by 3.25%. Today they are still raising rates and want to keep them elevated for the entirety of 2023.

While the economy and financial market environments are vastly different between the two periods we mustn’t discount the experience of 2008. The table and graphs are not a reason to sell everything and run to cash. But they should provide a warning that despite 2022 losses there is a lot more potential downside in the markets especially if the Fed continues to promote hawkish policy and the economy weakens rapidly.

Tesla – This Year’s Most Profitable Short

Data from S3 Partners published Thursday showed that through Wednesday’s close Tesla was the year’s most profitable short — or stock traders were betting against — with mark-to-market profits totaling $15.03 billion this year. And these figures don’t reflect Thursday’s decline.

“In December TSLA shorts are up $4.54 billion in month-to-date mark-to-market profits up +33.2% on an average short interest of $13.67 billion” S3 Partners said in its report. “Since Elon Musk’s Twitter bid on 4/14/22 TSLA shorts are up $13.74 billion in mark-to-market profits up 77.5% on an average short internet of $17.74 billion.”

The company operates several well-known brands in various global markets including North America the U.K. Germany Australia and Italy and has long relied on its strong brand presence in these markets to drive business and generate profits.

However the uneven reopening of cruise travel in the wake of COVID-19 in Asia and Australia in particular and the direct impact of the conflict in Ukraine on European countries have had a significant effect on the company’s results.

Carnival’s Strongest Suit Now Working Against Them

Carnival Corporation’s brand strategy has long been one where it operates several brands that are location specific. Think Costa Cruises and Italy AIDA and Germany P&O in the UK and Australia and so forth.

This strategy has long been one of the strong points of Carnival Corporation and propelled it to be to world’s largest cruise operator.

In Carnival Corporations’ fourth quarter earnings call CEO Josh Weinstein explained: “We believe that having the No. 1 or No. 2 brand in each of the largest cruise markets such as North America the U.K. Germany Australia Italy France and Spain is the foundation of our portfolio strategy and allows us to tailor our experiences and offerings to those specific source markets enabling us to generate stronger brand loyalty and gain greater penetration and profit.“

One of the main challenges facing Carnival Corporation has been the lagging reopening of specific markets particularly Australia Asia and the Baltics.

These markets have been extremely important and the main base for drawing in non-North American guests for the company in 2019.

The markets that are now lagging behind accounted for around 2 million people or one-third of its total non-North American guests and were particularly reliant on the company’s Costa and Princess brands representing 40% of Costa’s guests and 25% of Princess’ guests.

Costa Cruises in particular had been betting heavily on expanding its operations in China. For the Chinese market the cruise line developed several new cruise ships aimed solely at the Asian market. However these vessels are now either not sailing or being transferred to Carnival Cruise Line under the ‘Carnival Fun Italian Style‘ program.

With Australia currently in a similar position to North America a year ago and Japan further behind the recovery has been slower than expected leading to those changes in deployment and guest-sourcing approaches as Carnival anticipates ongoing impacts particularly in the first half of 2023.

In addition to the challenges posed by the slow reopening of these markets Carnival Corporation has also been affected by the conflict in Ukraine. This has weighed heavily on consumer confidence in regions served by the company’s Costa and AIDA brands leading to greater uncertainty and closer-in booking patterns.

What’s the Solution?

To help mitigate these impacts Carnival has made strategic deployment decisions focusing on solutions that reduce the friction of air travel lower overall costs and facilitate closer-in bookings.

This strategy aims to attract more new-to-cruise guests and position the company as a more attractive value proposition than land-based alternatives.

Due to the challenges mentioned above Carnival Corporation has taken steps to optimize its fleet and transform its business to position itself for long-term growth.

The company has disposed of 26 ships since the pandemic’s start while also introducing larger more efficient ships such as the Excel-class Carnival Celebration Mardi Gras Costa Toscana Costa Smeralda AIDAnova and AIDAcosma and Iona and Arvia for P&O Cruises.

On top of the 26 ships it has already disposed of Carnival is also planning to offload at least three smaller less efficient cruise ships in the near future. Some rumors even include selling off various parts of the business such as Seabourn Cruise Line.

The new ships have resulted in nearly a quarter of the company’s fleet consisting of new capacity with an 8-percentage-point increase in balcony cabins and a significant increase and variety of onboard experiences that generate additional revenues.

Having a fleet of ships that is fast becoming one of the youngest in the industry Carnival’s problems remain though. How to draw 2 million guests back to those ships and fill them up?

Bringing ships back to the Caribbean and North America will only work to a point especially since Carnival Cruise Line already has a large chunk of the market.

By contrast a company such as the Royal Caribbean Group does not have this problem at all focusing primarily on the US middle-class market with Royal Caribbean International and the premium North American and European market through Celebrity Cruises and Silverseas.

Whether the plans will work out for Weinstein and his nine cruise brands remains to be seen. One thing is certain investors are not seeing the recent numbers as positive. Carnival Corporation is suffering from extremely high debt and continues to post losses something it will need to address as soon as possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2Nhcm5pdmFsLTIwMjMtdHJpbmlkYWQtc2FpbnQtbHVjaWEtamFtYWljYS1ncmVuYWRhLTY4MzE1NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to Celebrate Caribbean Carnival in 2023,"You've heard of Carnival — the epic fêtes intoxicating soca music and costumes adorned with feathers and jewels. This celebration of freedom created by enslaved Africans in the 18th century and enshrined after Emancipation is a must for any traveler looking to explore Caribbean culture.

Next year Carnival will be back in full force after a pandemic hiatus. Tourism booms around the events so book early — and check out our mini-guide to the most unmissable parties. Working with a Carnival concierge company like Carnival Jumpers is highly recommended. They can secure party tickets costumes and hotel rooms which often sell out months in advance.

Trinidad and Tobago

February 15–22 2023

In the birthplace of the celebration as we know it today Trinidad Carnival — known locally as the Greatest Show on Earth — is the biggest event of the year and was the only major Caribbean Carnival to happen in 2020 before the world shut down. Build your stamina for nonstop parties like the popular MC Boat Experience and Soca Brainwash and sign up early for popular Mas bands (parade groups) like Tribe to ensure you have the best costume of the season.

Where to stay: Port of Spain is the center of the action; the Hyatt Regency Trinidad downtown is close to both the airport and the hottest fêtes.



Jamaica

April 12-18 2023



Jamaica has cemented its reputation as one of the top travel destinations in the Caribbean but it’s newer to the annual Carnival calendar — recently attracting soca artists in addition to its iconic reggae and dancehall scene. It's a great place to experience all the events that dedicated attendees know and love but at a more affordable price point. Work with a concierge to secure your costume from local Mas band Xodus and book tickets to popular parties like SunKissed and Duck Work.



Where to stay: The centrally located (and affordable) Courtyard Kingston is a great base for party-hopping and exploring local sites like the Bob Marley Museum.

St. Lucia

July 12–19 2023

Best known as a destination for romance and luxury St. Lucia turns euphoric when the summer heat turns up and Carnival takes over. Visitors flock to the island for its local music (Dennery Segment) and to join Mas bands like Legends. It’s the perfect place to “get on bad” with stunning views of mountains and sea.

Where to stay: Most events take place in the Rodney Bay–Gros Islet areas and the Harbor Club Curio Collection is in the heart of it all.

Grenada

August 10–15 2023

One of the most distinctive events in the region Grenada’s Carnival — called Spicemas — is a celebration of culture local food and the colorful pageantry of Mas bands like Oro. But to get the true Spicemas experience head to the island’s one-of-a-kind Jab Jab J’Ouvert which signals the unofficial start of the events. Jab is Creole derived from the French diable (“devil”); revelers mock the island’s former colonizers by donning devil horns covering themselves in black oil blowing conch shells and dancing until dawn.

Where to stay: The luxurious Silversands Grenada on Grand Anse Beach is close to the excitement and offers a discounted Spicemas package.

We performed WES on 395 healthy individuals who were the parents (176 couples of which 21 were consanguineous and 43 single parents Supplementary Table S1) of children referred to the pediatric genetics clinic for a variety of indications (developmental delay/intellectual disability malformations dysmorphisms etc). None of the children had a clinically suspected ciliopathy disorder. To rule out a selection bias we performed the same analysis on WES data from 999 individuals from the UK1958 birth cohort. Average coverage was 286.9 reads/basepair for the local cohort and 57.2 reads/basepair for the UK1958 cohort (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Variants in 118 recessive ciliopathy genes

We filtered the WES data for variants in 118 genes associated with a range of ciliopathies (Supplementary Table S2) selected based on OMIM literature searches and specialized reference websites (http://www.syscilia.org/goldstandard.shtml) and identified 5928 variants. After manual pre-processing excluding variants that were calling artefacts (Supplementary methods) 4420 variants were retained. By training a support vector machine (Supplementary methods Supplementary Fig. S1) we excluded 718 variants as false calls leaving 3702 high confidence variants for further analysis (Fig. 1). The average number of high-confidence variants was 9.32 per individual (range 1–24 variants/individual) (Supplementary Table S3). We performed the same analysis for the UK1958 cohort and found similar results identifying a total of 7377 high-confidence variants (average 7.38 variants/individual range 1–19 variants/individual; Supplementary Table S3). The slightly lower numbers in the UK1958 cohort may be explained by the lower WES coverage yielding fewer high confidence variants.

The blue area indicates the filtering of variants to retain only high quality variants (“true calls”). SVM stands for support vector machine. The pink area describes filtering steps to determine pathogenicity of very rare variants (MAF ≤ 0.1%). Pathogenic variants are determined according to ACMG/AMP criteria. “Strong VUS” were determined as variants that are possibly damaging based on prediction tools: CADD > 20 M-CAP > 0.025 and 4 of the remaining 7 tools (SIFT Polyphen2 FATHHM MutationTaster MutationAssessor PROVEAN LRT) predicting deleteriousness and/or previous classification in HGMD as DM or in ClinVar as LP with limited supporting information disclosed. For details please see methods. Full size image

Reportable pathogenic variants following ACMG/AMP criteria

The next step focused on retaining pathogenic variants according to ACMG/AMP criteria [10]. These included all very rare variants (PM2 - minor allele frequency MAF ≤ 0.1%) that were either predicted to result in loss-of-function (LOF: nonsense frameshift canonical splice site – PVS1) AND were previously reported and classified as pathogenic (P) in ClinVar AND/OR disease causing in HGMD (DM) OR rare missense variants that were classified as P in ClinVar AND DM in HGMD with sufficient supporting information. We also retained two known recurring alleles in ciliopathy genes which have allele frequencies >0.1% in GnomAD: BBS1 (NM_024649.4) c.1169 T > G p.M309R [15] and KIAA0586 (NM_001244189.1) c.428delG p.R143Kfs*4 [16 17]. Applying these criteria 48 pathogenic variants were found in 43 individuals of which 26 were predicted to be LOF and 22 missense in-frame indels or non-coding variants (Table 1 Fig. 1 Supplementary Table S4). The carrier frequency for pathogenic variants in one of 118 ciliopathy genes in this cohort of healthy individuals lies at ~11% (43/395). One individual carried 2 variants in the same gene but segregation analysis revealed that the two variants were in cis. For one consanguineous couple both partners were carriers of a pathogenic missense variant in DYNC2H1 where the offspring had not inherited both variant alleles (Supplementary Table S5). Interestingly for several genes we observed much higher carrier frequencies than expected based on estimated disease prevalence. The well-known recurrent pathogenic variants KIAA0586 (NM_001244189.1) c.428delG p.R143Kfs*4 or BBS1 (NM_024649.4) c.1169 T > G p.M309R variants whose disease-association is supported by a large body of literature and/or functional studies [15161718] were each identified in three unrelated individuals in our cohort (0.75%). Moreover for CEP290 we identified previously described pathogenic LOF variants in four individuals (0.75%).

Table 1 Number of variants identified in our local cohort: reportable variants (light grey) and “strong” VUS (darker grey). Full size table

Novel predicted loss-of-function alleles

The advantage of performing WES rather than using a pre-set variant detection panel is that novel variants can also be identified. We detected in addition 38 predicted LOF variants that have not been previously classified in ClinVar or HGMD in 36 individuals. These variants should be formally classified as likely pathogenic based on ACMG/AMP criteria PVS1 (truncating variant) and PM2 (allele frequency-very rare). Since loss-of-function is the most common genetic disease mechanism in ciliopathies for all the genes analyzed the majority of these variants will be disease-causing and it remains open for discussion whether they should be reported in the context of carrier screening. According to Tavtigian et al. who analyzed the ACMG/AMP criteria in a bayesian framework the “likely pathogenic rule” PVS1 + one moderate evidence of pathogenicity (i.e. rarity PM2) yielded a posterior probability of 0.994 for pathogenicity similar to other “pathogenic rules” in this classification [19]. Following this rationale novel very rare truncating variants in a known ciliopathy gene should probably be reported even in the context of carrier screening. If such variants are included this raises the overall carrier frequency for ciliopathies in our cohort to 20% (80/395 individuals). For some genes such as KIAA0586 CEP290 or ALMS1 the carrier frequency would rise to 1.7 respectively 1.3% which is substantially higher than expected based on disease prevalence which is estimated at between ~1:50’000 and 1:1’000’000 [20212223]. Including novel LOF variants one additional consanguineous couple in our cohort would be at risk for having an affected child (total 2/21 consanguineous couples = 10% or 2/176 couples = 1%).

To rule out a selection bias in our local cohort we applied the same filtering steps to the UK1958 cohort and found results within the same order of magnitude: 8% of the individuals in the UK1958 cohort were carriers for a P variant in a ciliopathy gene and up to 15% when including very rare novel LOF variants (Supplementary Table S3). The slightly higher proportion of variants in the local cohort compared to the UK1958 cohort may be explained by the poorer sequencing coverage in the latter which led to higher exclusion rates of variants of poor quality (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)

Ideally a screening test should have a high positive predictive value identifying (almost) all true carriers but also a high negative predictive value where a negative test excludes with sufficient confidence that someone is a carrier. While the technical reliability of NGS is now excellent and all variants that are present are likely to be detected the question focuses more on how many variants which cannot be certainly classified as pathogenic or benign each individual carries.

To quantify this problem we further analyzed our WES data for missense variants which we deemed to be “strong” VUS. As VUS these variants are not to be reported in the context of carrier screening – the purpose of this analysis was rather to define the amount of variants that might contain disease alleles which would decrease the negative predictive value of the test. Such variants would be retained by automatic filtering pipelines based on previous classifications in ClinVar or HGMD or based on allele frequency (MAF ≤ 0.1%) AND strict combination of deleteriousness prediction from multiple algorithms (criteria chosen: CADD > 20 AND MCAP > 0.025 AND ≥ 4 of remaining 7 algorithms predicting a deleterious effect). The reasoning behind this selection of criteria is that the interpretations often differ between prediction tools. Indeed analyzing the correlation between the different tools using the numerical scores they provide we found the Pearson correlation coefficient to range between ~−0.1 and ~0.7 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Variants retained in this part of the analysis therefore required deleteriousness prediction by 6/9 algorithms (CADD and MCAP being accounted for separately since they in part rely on the other tools). Four variants classified as LP in ClinVar with limited supporting information were considered as VUS.

This analysis led to the detection of 262 additional missense/in-frame variants. Interestingly the number of missense VUS differed between genes with the largest increase for USH2A ADGRV1/GPR98 and DYNC2H1 (Fig. 2). 23 missense variants recurred in more than one individual (Supplementary Table S6) such that there were a total of 239 unique missense variants. 197/395 (50%) individuals carried between 1–5 “strong” VUS of which an unknown proportion may be disease-causing alleles in the 118 analyzed ciliopathy genes. Six individuals had two VUS in the same gene but segregation analysis in their offspring demonstrated that they were in cis in all but one case. VUS were found in both partners in 7 non-consanguineous couples (7/176 = 4%). The offspring inherited both variants in two cases: one child was homozygous for a missense variant in IFT81 and one was compound heterozygous for two USH2A missense variants. Neither child displayed phenotypes consistent with the associated disorders indicating that at least some of these variants are not disease-causing. Similar results were found in the UK1958 cohort with 45% of individuals carrying between 1 and 5 VUS (Supplementary Table S3).

Among the missense variants retained as “strong” VUS 42 had been previously classified as DM in HGMD and sometimes as P/LP by some providers in ClinVar (but with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity mostly VUS vs P/LP). We judged these previous classifications to be insufficient to definitely retain these variants as pathogenic based for example on the fact that 20 DM variants in HGMD were benign in ClinVar (Supplementary Fig. S4). This underscores the limitations of these commonly used databases. One could expect their performance to increase with time as the global sequencing experience increases. To analyze this we compared the ClinVar classification for 400 missense variants from our dataset between 2018 and 2020. While we did observe an increase in the proportion of missense variants that had a ClinVar entry (from 52% to 60%) it was mostly variants with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity that increased (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S4). One variant changed from pathogenic to benign. These data illustrate how difficult it remains to determine variant pathogenicity in particular when several ACMG/AMP criteria cannot be used for classification as is the case for healthy individuals.

Taken together these results show that ~50% of this healthy population carries a “strong” VUS in a ciliopathy gene and that a reproductive risk for a ciliopathy remains possible in 4% of couples. While it is not advisable to report variants that are not unequivocally pathogenic not reporting all these VUS will decrease the negative predictive value of the screening test. On the other hand the higher-than-expected carrier frequencies even for LOF alleles and the database limitations suggest that determining what is a “clearly” pathogenic variant remains a moving target.

Approaches for further evaluation of VUS in healthy individuals

The crux of the problem lies in the classification of the variants. Indeed the large majority of missense variants identified in healthy individuals will not be disease alleles foremost because ciliopathies are rare disorders. To identify which VUS are most likely disease-causing we sought to leverage existing knowledge on ciliopathies by comparing the identified variants with known disease alleles from patient cohorts.

We focused on the well-studied Joubert syndrome (JBTS) [23 24] which is characterized by a specific hindbrain malformation and which can be caused by bi-allelic mutations in one of ~40 different ciliopathy genes [25 26]. The five genes most commonly mutated in individuals with JBTS are AHI1 CC2D2A CEP290 C5orf42/CPLANE1 and TMEM67 and the disease alleles are predominantly truncating/LOF variants [25 27]. In comparison variants in these genes identified in our healthy local population were mostly missense variants most abundant in CEP290 KIF7 and IFT172. Since IFT172 and KIF7 are only uncommonly mutated in patients the true carrier frequency for disease alleles for these genes is expected to be very low suggesting that most IFT172 or KIF7 variants identified in our healthy cohort are benign. For CEP290 or KIF7 the majority of variants in our cohort were missense variants while virtually all described disease alleles in patients are LOF [25 28293031] (Fig. 3). For other genes such as INPP5E however the majority of known disease alleles are missense variants [25 32]. The missense variants identified in our cohort in INPP5E are therefore more likely to represent disease alleles than those in CEP290 or KIF7. Taken together these data illustrate how knowledge of the mutation pattern in patients can help to interpret pathogenicity of novel variants. To capture this knowledge we determined a simple “missense score” for each gene based on the “clinical statistics” table in varsome [33] by calculating the ratio of missense P/LP variants over all P/LP variants (Supplementary Table S7).

Fig. 3: Comparison of variants per gene and variant type in Joubert syndrome-associated genes in a patient cohort compared to healthy individuals (this cohort). Bar graph showing all Joubert-associated genes in which variants discussed here (reportable or “strong” VUS) were found in this healthy cohort. The percentage of variants in each gene (over the total number of variants in each cohort) is shown for both cohorts: for each gene the left bar consisting of light red (truncating) and light blue (missense/nc/inframe variants) variants shows results from a large Joubert-patient cohort [25] as a comparison while the right bar (darker red for truncating darker blue for reportable missense/nc/inframe and grey for “strong” VUS) shows the results from the current study in healthy individuals. Note the substantial differences for instance for CEP290 where affected individuals have mostly truncating variants while healthy individuals in this cohort have predominantly missense variants or for IFT172 where pathogenic alleles rarely cause JBTS while many “strong” VUS were identified in this healthy cohort. Such a difference is not present for all genes (for example variants in INPP5E show a similar distribution between affected and healthy individuals). Full size image

Incorporating structural protein information for further variant prioritization

We next sought to include structural protein information where available. We performed in silico protein modeling using HOPE [34] for those protein regions for which structural data was available. As an illustration the HOPE report for the missense variants identified in INPP5E which are located in the phosphatase domain suggests that they may disrupt protein function (Fig. 4). To incorporate structural protein information into our pipeline in an automated manner we turned to VIPUR a Rosetta-based scoring system that relies on structural information in addition to classical sequence-based predictions [35]. VIPUR allots each variant a score between 0 and 1 where a score > 0.5 suggests deleteriousness and a score > 0.7 strongly suggests deleteriousness. Of 249 unique missense VUS from our dataset VIPUR called 102 deleterious 78 neutral and was unable to classify 66 due to lacking structural information. Integrating the VIPUR score and the “missense score” (ms-score) with the previously described criteria we could classify 32 unique variants as first priority based on ms-scores> 0.1 (meaning > 10% of described patient-variants are missense) and VIPUR scores > 0.7 (Supplementary Table S4). Despite this prioritization these variants remain VUS and would require additional information (identification in affected individuals or functional testing) to be reportable. However adding expert knowledge from the literature and structural protein information allowed prioritization and reduction of the number of variants to a manageable amount a step that will be required for future functional testing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aHlzc2Vua3J1cHAuY29tL2VuL3N0b3JpZXMvc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktYW5kLWNsaW1hdGUtcHJvdGVjdGlvbi9ncmVlbi1hbW1vbmlhLXJldm9sdXRpb25pemVzLXRoZS10cmFuc3BvcnQtb2YtaHlkcm9nZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green ammonia revolutionizes the transport of hydrogen,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aHlzc2Vua3J1cHAuY29tL2VuL3N0b3JpZXMvc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktYW5kLWNsaW1hdGUtcHJvdGVjdGlvbi9ncmVlbi1hbW1vbmlhLXJldm9sdXRpb25pemVzLXRoZS10cmFuc3BvcnQtb2YtaHlkcm9nZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212273DED70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The ITF is saying that it believes the livestock sector is in trouble with an increasing number of complaints and insolvencies.

Built in 2005 in China as a containership the vessel has a checkered history having at least five different names and a long list of managers and registered owners. The 4800 dwt ship operated carrying livestock between Australia and China with a crew of approximately 30. During its most recent trip it was expected to load 5200 head of cattle for transport to China.

The vessel has a long list of deficiencies identified during port state inspections dating back to 2013. However it avoided detentions for the most part except in Australia briefly in 2020 and that was regarding its operating plan as opposed to structural issues. In July 2022 an initial inspection in Ningbo China however found issues with the stowage of rescue boats and the launching arrangements for survival craft.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority reports the vessel arrived at Portland near Melbourne in southern Australia on September 28 and remained at anchor. AMSA reports it has been monitoring the situation with the vessel which is registered in Liberia paying attention to the crew welfare and is now working with the Admiralty Marshall to ensure the crew welfare and entitlements are maintained now that the vessel is in the hands of the court.

The courts became involved when Australian Global Exports Pty issued a writ against the ship in Western Australia with claims of damages of US$2.3 million plus A$1 million for breach of a September booking. Dan-Bunkering moved to have the ship arrested for non-payment of bills and subsequently Singapore ship chandlers also filed against the ship.

The court reports that the vessel is deteriorating while no maintenance and it has not received a reply from the owners. The Marshall ordered the ship moved to the dock and later paid for the purchase of fuel because the owners had not supplied fuel. Further the Marshal reports that the vessel undertook a temporary repair for the crack in its hull which appears to be holding at this time.

Saying that the vessel is all but abandoned by the registered owners Soar Harmony Shipping of China the judge concluded in a December 20 hearing “Clearly the vultures are circling. I see little to no prospect that the judicial sale of the vessel can be avoided.” He noted that neither the shipowner nor any bareboat charterer or mortgagee has intervened to maintain the vessel. The court highlights that the clock is ticking as the Marshall reports from documentation provided by the master that it appears that the vessel’s marine hull and machinery insurance is set to expire on December 31 2022. If that occurs the judge said all claimants’ security will be imperiled.

The International Labor Organization reports that it has also received an abandonment notice for the crew. The court reports that there are 36 crewmembers aboard but that it could be reduced to 16. The crew however is unwilling to leave the ship until they are paid their back wages.

According to inspectors from the ITF that boarded the ship and interviewed the crew who are Philippine nationals shipboard documentation shows the crew received only one-third of its wages in October. Several of the crew members have been aboard the ship for eight or nine months. The ITF reports it is providing support for the crew as their provisions run low but it is concerned because collectively the crew is owed a quarter of a million dollars in unpaid wages. The crew can not leave the ship because they would forfeit their claims but faces few prospects of recovering all of their back pay.

The ITF reports that AMSA and the court are working together for the crew. The judge concluded after the December 20 hearing that “In the circumstances I am satisfied that there should be orders for the sale of the vessel. I see no other available course” but ITF is concerned that the monies raised are unlikely to cover all the owner’s debt meaning the crew might still not get paid. They are also involving the flag state for its obligations to the crew and to provide for reparation if necessary.

The ITF Australian Inspectorate Coordinator Ian Bray however said that he sees a broader problem in the livestock shipping industry. “We believe there is an epidemic of borderline insolvency amongst the operators of these livestock ships as they repeatedly feature among the worst cases in our inspections around Australia and internationally” said Bray. The sector is the frequent target of activists that want the livestock trade ended and the maritime unions who also highlight the working conditions aboard the ships.

For now the crew of the Yangtze Fortune remains in limbo. The court has directed the Marshall to proceed with the sale once the plaintiffs file the necessary paperwork.

For more companies head on over to 5 Biggest Dry Bulk Shipping Companies in 2022.

If there is one sector that can truly be said to form the backbone of the modern day world it is the shipping industry. Each day countless ships traverse the oceans to supply goods from one country to another. The scope of today's shipping can be gauged from the fact that in 2020 — even as the coronavirus pandemic was in full swing — a staggering 25 million twenty feet equivalents (TEUs) of cargo shipped on the Trans-Pacific routes. The Panama Canal which is perhaps the most important shipping point on the planet because it serves as the only link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans sees a whopping 14000 ships pass through it every year. Another important shipping point is the Suez Canal which accounts for 12% of global trade. In fact when the Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine Corporation (Taiwan) Ltd. (LSE:EGMD.L)'s Ever Given blocked the canal for a mere six days in 2021 an estimated $400 million of goods were delayed each hour.

One crucial subsegment of the shipping industry is the dry bulk segment. While goods and products are transported in containers hence the twenty feet equivalent (TEU) designation commodities such as coal iron and others are transported via special ships called bulk carriers. These are also some of the most complex vessels to operate since cargo such as grain shifts position easily within the ship which then ends up affecting the vessel's balance. Additionally if the air within the vessel is not controlled then cargo such as coal can catch fire as well. These vessels also form a big chunk of the global maritime shipping industry with some estimates laying down that up to 20% of all the freight is carried by them.

The growth in global computing power and the continued integration of business processes with computers is also making its mark on dry bulk shipping. For instance The Signal Group's Signal Ocean Platform allows dry bulk shipping companies to bring together a myriad of different data points such as port locations tonnage and cargo lists real time vessel locations and costs to feed algorithms and artificial intelligence models and generate action plans. Another dry bulk technology company S.A. MALLIAROUDAKIS MARITIME (UK) Ltd provides a wide variety of software for dry bulk operators that allow them to determine the ship's under keel clearances squat dead weight tonnage (DWT) gain or loss floating position stability and crew rest hours among others. These are some of the most important aspects of a dry bulk carrier since they need to be closely monitored during the loading and unloading of a vessel which as we mentioned above is prone to capsizing due to the nature of its cargo.

Story continues

In terms of overall size Valuates Reports estimates that the industry was worth $35 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% to sit at $101 billion in 2027. The research firm believes that growth in global populations and rising economic conditions alongside a growing demand for coal as a power generation source will drive the dry bulk shipping industry's growth. In terms of the commodities shipped iron ore is the largest segment of the industry and will remain so as well as higher industrialization drives the global steel demand.

Some top dry bulk shipping companies on our list are Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) Oldendorff Carriers GmbH & Co. and Golden Ocean Group Limited (NASDAQ:GOGL).

And yet another tale of possible skulduggery relating to a freighter operator for you to get stuck into over the holiday period. The full fascinating version is from the Washington Post (and apparently free-to-read).

The paper’s investigation centres on the relationship between the US military and Azerbaijan – and its freighter airline Silk Way which won $369m in defence contracts from the US in the period the story relates to. It is then claimed that two Air Force generals who headed US Transcom at the time then cashed in on their relationships with Azerbaijan. They both won generous contracts to consult for the airline according to documents obtained by Wapo under the Freedom of Information Act. One of the generals was reportedly set to earn a healthy $5000 a day.

We can thoroughly recommend reading through the whole Wapo story (particularly if you are bored at work during the holiday period). It covers supply chains to Afghanistan Azerbaijan’s government and relationship to Silk Way and the “thriving job market for American veterans trying to profit from their overseas deployments”.

Alternatively if you want a more Silk Way-focused and shorter take we can recommend CH Aviation’s abridged version of the story. Either way it’s a good read…"

December 23 2022

I thought I knew all about monarch caterpillars turning into chrysalises and then into butterflies. We all do right? From the start of books read to us as children like “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” we all know that caterpillars turn into butterflies. Many of us myself included have collected monarch caterpillars from our yard put them into “butterfly habitats” and fed them milkweed (their host plant) until they make a hard green chrysalis and then in a couple of weeks come out of this shell as an adult butterfly.

This year I was disturbed that I saw few butterflies of any species in my yard despite the many milkweed plants I was proud of that reseeded and spread throughout my yard and the various other flowering plants that attract the adult butterflies. Usually by the fall I have recorded a handful or more caterpillars and found a few chrysalises scattered around. But this year was different. I asked around and yes other people did see the usual amount of butterflies. It must have been something about the location of my yard or who knows what.

But a couple of weeks ago well past the usual monarch migration season Susan Gallion and I spotted an adult monarch butterfly resting on a bush and we went outside to further inspect it. And then we spotted a monarch caterpillar and another and another. There were maybe 10 caterpillars scattered around my butterfly garden. Some were munching on the last leaves of my milkweeds and others were on the garden floor heading somewhere.

Susan was the first to notice one caterpillar in an unusual hanging position and we both started watching it. And right in front of us it turned into a chrysalis! It was a most amazing natural phenomena to watch in person. The caterpillar started turning black then a bright green part started forming and spreading from the bottom until it covered the caterpillar. This critter vibrated rapidly making it difficult to focus on then it squeezed out the remaining black parts of the original skin and all that remained affixed to the branch was a solid green chrysalis. It only took maybe 15 minutes for this creature to totally change its shape and coloration from a black and yellow striped worm-like organism to a vivid green enclosed sac! We were very lucky to see it just at the right time. Susan and I had never actually seen this happen although we were both familiar with caterpillars and chrysalises. We both thought it took hours for this to happen in some mysterious process that happened overnight. But no it happens in mere minutes! If you want to watch this yourself check out this real-time video of the process and more details here.

I was transfixed at how well the chrysalis blended in to the bush it had decided to metamorphose on and as a joke sent a Facebook photo asking people if they could find the chrysalis on the bush and only a few could. For a while I pondered the thought that maybe the caterpillar could somehow see the color in various plants and picked one with good camouflaging potential to settle on. When I found a couple of other caterpillars crawling around on the ground I carefully lifted them on a stick and moved them to this “perfect bush” hoping to give them some help.

But that was proven wrong. Although I searched the bush carefully for more chrysalises I never found another. But I did find one quite a distance from the milkweed plants hanging totally exposed on the gray metal of a lawn chair. So much for the color recognition hypothesis.

So now I am watching two chrysalises in my backyard one in the bush and one on the lawn chair. They are due to become butterflies any day now. But it is also a very cold time outside now maybe too cold for them to survive. We will see.

There is an ongoing controversy about the possible harm of planting tropical non-native milkweeds (like mine are) here in Florida since it may be that the presence of milkweed here at the wrong season could confuse the monarchs and impede their migration south. I’ve also recently learned that allowing milkweed to continue growing year round magnifies the load of a parasitic disease that harms butterflies from year to year thus weakening or ultimately killing the monarchs that feed on these plants. You can find out more at this link.

I now am worried about all my reseeded tropical milkweed plants that I was so proud of just weeks ago. Live and learn is my motto. I always seem to learn something new even about caterpillars chrysalises and now milkweed. Who would have thought?

But the teacher at his school in north Melbourne gave him and his 21 other classmates a surprise he'll likely never forget.





Kit drew 'GooGoo'; a yellow green and grey caterpillar-looking creature with spikes and wrote his name next to his artwork.





About two months later during the last week of the school term he was handed GooGoo in all its glory - spikes and all - as a Christmas gift from his teacher.

""Kit said he was so so excited and was pulling all of his excited faces as he said that.""



Kit 6 named his toy monster GooGoo and brought him along to his grandparents' house for the Christmas break. Source: Supplied / Michelle ""He said 'I love my monster and now I get to keep it to remember prep and [my teacher]'.""





Kit told his mother that the sentimental gift showed him just how much his teacher loves him.



Reid Parker whose son Oscar also attends the school said he was ""spellbound"" by the creativity and time given to each of the 22 students.





""I took a photo of [Oscar's] toy alongside the drawing he'd done. When I posted in a group chat with other parents from his class they replied with their own toys and drawings"" he said.





With their permission and in a bid to show appreciation for the teacher Reid created a thread on Twitter this week to share the drawings along with the real-life monsters.





It has since gone viral with nearly four million views and more than 100000 likes from people around the world.



""The kids absolutely love them. We've gone home to New Zealand to visit family for Christmas and the as-yet-unnamed toy has come with us"" Reid told SBS News via Twitter.





""It's apparently a Therizinosaurus which he saw recently in [the film] Jurassic Park Dominion.""



Reid Parker's son Oscar is yet to name his monster who was inspired by the Therizinosaurus in the Jurassic Park movie. Source: Twitter / Reid Parker Reid and Michelle said they were both in awe of their children's teacher spending her own personal time creating the toys.





""She's done it all in her own time and at her own expense; it's not part of the curriculum"" Michelle said.





Reid said he'd heard the teacher had made the toys for students in previous years.





""Apparently during [the COVID-19] lockdown she rode around the neighbourhood and dropped off the toys to each child's house"" he said.





He said it was an example of why teachers should be paid more for their work.



""Teachers are the people our children spend half of their waking hours with.""





""They help to create the people those children are going to become. There are countless stories of people who credit inspirational teachers for their own success.""





The average primary school teacher salary in Australia is $83448 according to Talent.com.



SBS News tried to contact the teacher behind the toys.





She said she felt ""very appreciated"" by the overwhelming response on social media but didn't want any further attention.



Reid posted on Twitter that someone had attempted to impersonate him in order to raise money around the story. The account has been taken down.





He encouraged people who felt inspired by the teacher's act to donate to a school in their local area.

The term mining services is deliberate – because it is no longer enough to describe Thiess as a contractor with many of its client relationships equating to long term alliances. Plus Thiess’ role usually goes way beyond load and haul – its remit can and does include everything from mine planning through to rehabilitation. On the technology side Thiess is one of the most experienced integrators of autonomous haulage and drilling technology – both with the established OEM offerings but also the new and upcoming open autonomy offerings. Its fleet size is larger than some of the mining companies it works for. That and the fact that Thiess is OEM-agnostic and the global nature of its activities give it a uniquely important place in helping the mining industry reach its net zero targets across everything from battery and hybrid trucks to trolley assist and IPCC. IM Editorial Director Paul Moore sat down with Michael Wright (pictured) the Executive Chair and CEO at the November 2022 IMARC event in Sydney– to talk through the company’s reach and capabilities and how it is helping to build the mine of the future today.

How would you summarise the scope of the Thiess offering to today’s mining industry?

MW: We are a truly global mining services provider. That means we do everything from turnkey mining where we undertake mine planning development and resource modelling through to mine work execution including equipment supply equipment operation right through to loading the commodity onto trains to the client’s specification. We also handle other requirements such as capacity expansions and mine rehabilitation for which we recently established our standalone Thiess Rehabilitation business. We also have technology and technical services capability in-house and are looking at how we can commercialise that into a client offering. In fact we just signed a deal with Tata Steel to help them plan and run their mines more efficiently and as well as jointly pursuing technologies that we can together offer to the mining industry. We’ve got 15000 people in seven countries with over 2000 units of large mining equipment which includes over 1200 haul trucks with a payload of over 100 t. So we have strong asset management and maintenance capability with a fleet size larger than many of the mining customers we work with.

You are best known for your operations in Australia and Indonesia – how are you growing your business in other major mining hubs?

MW: Towards the end of 2021 we expanded our operations into the North American market based on a clear strategy to diversify our commodities and services aligned with ensuring Thiess is at the forefront of sustainable mining. We established a new office in Salt Lake City and secured our first mining operation at a hard rock operation in Colorado. The mining works began as a mining services contract but after a year has already evolved into a relationship based alliance style contract – where the client sees it as an opportunity to work together to drive mine efficiency and safety and introduce contemporary mining practices and the latest technology into their operations. We are pleased to have recently secured a further two-year extension to this mining partnership.

We expanded into Chile in 2015 with Antofagasta Minerals (AMSA) at their Encuentro Oxides project which forms part of the Centinela copper operation. Since then we’ve continued expanding our service offering working with various clients in copper in Chile. We still return to AMSA as an important client of ours and one that is very open to working with us on advancing mining efficiency and sustainability through partnership.

And while well established in Australia and Indonesia we continue to grow and diversify our business in those countries through new contracts and new services as well as extending very long term relationships. To give a few examples in June 2022 we were awarded a life-of-mine contract to provide mining rehabilitation and port management services by PT Kapuas Tunggal Persada and PT Tempirai Inti Energi in Central Kalimantan Indonesia. In August Rex Minerals notified us of their intention to enter into exclusive negotiations to finalise the terms of a long term mining contract at their greenfields mine in South Australia. Subject to a contract being concluded Thiess is expected to deliver mining services and help position this greenfield copper operation at the cutting edge of sustainable mining. Earlier in 2022 we were also appointed mining services provider for Fortescue Metals Group’s new Iron Bridge Project in Western Australia. Under the initial three-year contract Thiess will deliver mining and maintenance services and asset management services working with Fortescue and other external stakeholders at this showcase mining operation.

Has your underlying strategy in services provision evolved and changed as well? Does that include bringing the latest technologies to customers to help them achieve their goals including autonomy?

MW: We set in motion a new strategy about 18 months ago which is focused squarely on sustainable mining and how we can align our activities with the future of mining and the energy transition. From a technology perspective we started some years ago in Western Australia where we helped Fortescue take the Solomon Hub to a fully autonomous fleet operation. We worked with them to build and run the mine and then worked closely with Fortescue and Caterpillar to integrate the Command for hauling technology and transition the operations over time. That success led to us working again with Fortescue at their Chichester Hub Christmas Creek operation on a large autonomous retrofit program. We then continued to be involved with asset management at Solomon over many years including providing the technical upgrades.

And we’ve continued our focus on autonomy and technology since then. On the east coast of Australia we have autonomous drills running at two sites – at the Lake Vermont mine in Central Queensland working with Epiroc Pit Viper drills; and at the Mount Pleasant mine in NSW working with Caterpillar MD-series drills. We are successfully proving these autonomous operations and they are today running as part of the production fleets after successful trials. We also have six semi-autonomous dozers running using Cat D11 machines operated from two side-by-side remote operator stations. From Caterpillar’s perspective we are one of their most advanced users when it comes to drill and dozer automation globally working with them to help develop their technology.

On the dozers there is still a transition needed to get them to fully autonomous operation however progress is being made. We are also looking to bring that autonomous dozing capability into our Thiess Rehabilitation business as well. We are already using technology as a differentiator to reduce the volume of material movement for rehabilitation – using algorithms in the rehabilitation earthworks design that can be used directly by the autonomous dozers. This builds on the focus we have using operational data in our business to drive performance – driven by the fact that our revenue is based not on selling the mined commodity but from the performance and efficiency of our operations.

While global supply chains are somewhat challenging presently we have very good and long term relationships with all the OEMs and global suppliers. That helps us in being able to source parts and equipment on a timely basis at the right cost base. We have very close and strong relationships with the Japanese trading companies which dates all the way back to Thiess Peabody Mitsui Coal and the start of mining in the Bowen Basin in 1962 opening up the export of first coking coal to Japan. We are also close to Mitsubishi and Marubeni through their ownership in some of the mines in which we operate. These relationships are both from a client perspective and also as long term partnerships. I can say we are working closely with two of the companies mentioned on potential JVs on mining technology. This would include developing technology not just for Thiess but also possibly for the wider global mining market.

How does your approach to autonomy from a cost advantage point of view differ to that of owner operator miners based on the fact you are normally working with fixed period contracts?

MW: On the back of our focus on operational delivery technology and sustainability we have secured the mining services contract for a greenfield coal mining project in Queensland with operations set to start in 2023. We are initially signed up for eight years which includes the planning and development of the mine taking it into full production. This includes the implementation and operation of autonomous fleets for overburden haulage and drilling. We are designing and building all the necessary infrastructure including the mine LTE network which is a first for us at this level. We have a strong team of autonomy and technology experts both office and field based that have already been involved in deploying drills and dozers at our projects. The opportunity that we’ve got and we are talking to other clients about this as well is in helping them integrate autonomy into their operations – whether we are actually running the mine or not. We are providing autonomy integration as a way of helping them with their mining practices of the future – which change substantially when you go to autonomous mining. Making sure that transition is done safely that the integration is seamless and that production outcomes are optimised is critical to the investment.

Does open autonomy also play a role in your offering?

MW: We can help clients select the right technology for the operation and integrate it for them. And that means if they want to go with the established Caterpillar and Komatsu AHS we can do that or if they want to opt for one of the newer open autonomy/technology options being developed like those from Liebherr/ASI or Hitachi/Wenco or indeed SafeAI or others we have the teams of people who can lead this also. And talking to several of the big Tier 1 miners it is clear that they see the potential in using a third party to fulfil the autonomy integrator role. On open autonomy we recently finalised our acquisition of MACA and they are working with Position Partners on the opportunity to retrofit a large number of mining trucks with SafeAI’s open autonomy. Position Partners is majority owned by Mitsui with whom we have a 60-year relationship. So that is the start of something really strong that we can work on together with Mitsui across multiple sites.

We have the fleet and the operational depth globally to really roll this capability out worldwide. In Chile Antofagasta Minerals have significant sustainability and emissions reduction targets and are looking at technology and autonomy which we see as a great opportunity to work with them to help them reach their targets. And Fortescue through FFI are in the process of developing their own battery and FCEV mining trucks in partnership with Liebherr and Williams Engineering and autonomy will form an important part of that and of course we remain a close partner of both Fortescue and Liebherr.

How are you helping clients achieve shorter term sustainability wins and is hydrogen a part of that mix?

MW: While we believe battery mining trucks will come before hydrogen – we are actively looking at hydrogen potential as well. This includes the use of hydrogen injection; hydrogen through the air intake to enhance diesel combustion resulting in lower emissions in the order of 10% as a starting point – we are trialling this at one of our sites. We also already have dual fuel truck trials underway part of an agreement with Australia-based Mine Energy Solutions (MES) to look at the use of locally-sourced compressed gas to displace diesel in large mining trucks and get more efficiency and lower emissions. We are also developing options which incorporates diesel and methane. This could involve tapping the coal seam for methane ahead of the open cut mining operation cleaning and compressing it and using it as part of the technology. We are looking to take these technologies elsewhere as well including to Chile where we have interested parties. In Chile we are also part of the HYDRA Consortium along with Liebherr and others. A stationary HYDRA powertrain is already being tested at Antofagasta Minerals’ Centinela and they are also a key HYDRA member.

Are you also partnering with the major OEMs directly on access to early prototypes of battery electric trucks?

MW: As with many of the major miners yes we are working with OEMs on access to early prototype battery trucks this includes Caterpillar’s Early Learner Program and Komatsu’s Power Agnostic truck alliance. But this is unlikely to be the only solution for us as a mining services provider. We are also looking at putting our resources into working with industrial partner companies on a whole of life battery solution for customers. MACA is already partnering with AVL Engineering Mitsui and Forsee Power to potentially create a modular style of battery which means that we will be able to change the battery chemistry depending on the infrastructure that is available at our client sites. This agnostic approach to battery chemistry as well as being able to utilise a flexible energy mix potentially including hydrogen/ammonia-based solar natural gas and wind power but also other clean power sources may be crucial to succeeding in the new mining market. It is also worth remembering that there is also going to be a big interplay between your battery mining trucks and your fleet management energy management and autonomy systems. No-one has that in place yet but some major miners including Fortescue are working on it. As an example we are working with them at Iron Bridge with a mining services agreement using Liebherr trucks and this mine will be one of the first operations to use some of this zero emissions technology with a vision to supply green magnetite iron ore to produce green steel. It’s important to know not only when the truck needs to recharge but the optimal charge level to recharge the truck based on the mining circuit’s haul cycles. We are looking at partnerships to enable this. We are also looking at emissions reduction opportunities working closely with clients on how we can achieve a true mine of the future.

Is there a place for trolley assist and IPCC in your mine of the future vision and to what extent are you offering these as options for customers?

MW: Yes trolley assist haulage systems have a lot of potential and all of the major miners are looking to this due to the potential to charge battery trucks. The OEMs see it as a faster way to get battery trucks commercially running as they will recharge on the ramp. For Thiess this wouldn’t be viable under a short term contract. That said most of our contracts are long term – at least eight years and some more than 20 years. For us this system would mean taking a partnership approach with the client as part of helping them position themselves at the forefront of sustainable mining. And as the largest surface mining services provider we need to be able to offer trolley systems as an option working with the OEMs and other partners.

The application of IPCC (in pit crushing and conveying) as well also has potential. We had a JV with RWE called Thiess RWE (TRWE) which was formed in 2013 to provide to provide a full suite of in-house design engineering operation and maintenance services for continuous mining and IPCC. We did look at some projects and undertook major studies as part of that. While the JV lies dormant these projects mean that we do now have significant in-house IPCC expertise plus we still maintain a relationship with RWE. We very much see IPCC as playing its part in the mine of the future and are looking at establishing other partnerships as well in that regard. And we have our own direct IPCC experience in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria in the lignite mines where we are the major shareholder in a JV RTL Mining and Earthworks – those mines use continuous mining methods including bucketwheel excavators though of course they will gradually wind down in the next 20 or so years. By way of example we pioneered the dozer push mining method that replaced bucketwheel mining at the Yallourn operation. A fleet of highly modified Caterpillar D11 Dozers pushes coal to high volume throughput feeder breakers which feed coal onto a face conveyor system. Since purchasing the State Electricity Commission’s mobile plant fleet in 1992 RTL has also been providing mobile plant hire and earthworks to AGL’s Loy Yang Mine. Lastly the fact that the Latrobe operations are winding down also means there is huge rehabilitation potential there for Thiess Rehabilitation and we have the large installed base of dozers ADTs and rigid trucks to be able to meet that demand in due course. And of course we have a great team of people in the Latrobe Valley.

You also have a growing underground mining business – can you give an example of your activities there?

MW: Our underground business is small by comparison to others however we do have great capability. The best example we have currently is in Mongolia through our longstanding majority owned Joint Venture Thiess Khishig Arvin (TKAJV). We has secured additional underground works as part of a contract extension at the Rio Tinto-operated Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia’s southern Gobi Desert. Following the twin 6.5km underground declines the Thiess Joint Venture will now construct the concrete conveyor decline road conveyor hangers and change house as part of the ongoing development at the mine. The works follow the team’s safe and successful delivery of the twin decline tunnels connecting the C2S conveyor to surface tunnel to the existing underground mine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wdWxzZWxpdmUuY28ua2UvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2V2ZW50cy9jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1kZWxpY2FjeS1hbmQtNS1vdGhlci1jaHJpc3RtYXMtdHJhZGl0aW9ucy1mcm9tLWFyb3VuZC10aGUtd29ybGQvdzl3aHZsMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caterpillar delicacy & 5 other Christmas traditions from around the world,"The festivity started as a religious holiday and is still celebrated as such by most people. However other communities have added their traditions and culture along the way to make it 'interesting'.

Some of these traditions include:-

1. Bad Santa (Austria)

In Austria there is no Father Christmas or Santa Claus. Instead they have a creature called ‘Krampus’ who is said to be the evil accomplice of St Nicholas.

Krampus is an aid to wander around the streets looking for kids who are badly behaved.

Pulse Live Kenya

The citizens have adopted this tradition to date. They wear tarrying masks and throw ghostly pranks on children and adults along the roads and the streets sending them on heels with screams!

2. Christmas Sauna (Finland)

For many homes in Finland there is a specific spot considered a sacred space for the long-dead ancestors.

On Christmas Eve they are expected to strip naked and take a long respectful stint in the sauna.

After the long tint session they head out for the evening celebrations and it is believed that the spirits of the ancestors take their rightful space in the bubbling water.

3. Setting a shoe 'schoentje zetten' (Netherlands)

They eagerly place one shoe filled with carrots near the fire with hopes that 'Sinterklaas' will take them and then fill them with small gifts and treats in the night.

4. La Befana the Christmaswitch (Italy)

This is the last festivity of Christmas time in Italy. Befana which is a Greek word loosely translated as 'manifestation of divinity' is represented by an old woman who rides on a broomstick through the air to bring candies and sweets to well-behaved kids.

David Howson ▬ December 23 2022

To our Cboe community

I hope many of you are well in the midst of holiday celebrations and enjoying the season with friends and loved ones. I myself am gearing up for my first Chicago winter and quickly learning the true value of a warm set of gloves. It’s been seven months since I assumed the role of Global President at Cboe and I cannot believe how productive 2022 was for Cboe and our industry across the globe.

Many of our business line leaders will be reaching out to you in January but I wanted to provide a quick overview of all we achieved at Cboe before we ring in the new year. 2022 was another transformative year filled with problems solved and ideas come to life. We continued to grow our business integrate our acquired companies and connect with each of you across the globe.

This was also the first full year since the start of the pandemic where we could gather in-person more easily and more often and what a difference it made. We held our first Cboe RMC since 2020 in Reykjavik Iceland—bringing back an important opportunity to connect in-person to solve industry challenges and discuss the latest risk management strategies. It was terrific to see so many familiar faces at RMC and several other industry conferences throughout the year.

In 2022 connection also remained a key part of our business strategy perhaps most tangibly through the opening of our new state-of-the-art trading floor. I began my career on a trading floor in London in the late 90s delivering data and trading system solutions to run a derivatives open-outcry exchange. It’s always been exciting to see that liquidity formation and open-outcry flow and now I can once again call the trading floor home – this time in Chicago.

Our trading floor houses six multi-listed equity options pits and four index options pits including our largest the S&P 500 Index (SPX) options pit which was expanded to meet increased demand and accommodate more trading spots. We also significantly grew our suite of S&P 500 options throughout the year adding new daily expirations in SPX Weeklys options and Mini-SPX options (XSP) offering 24/5 trading for both SPX and XSP options and launching Nanos and FLEX Micro options. Making our S&P 500 options suite more accessible through expanded trading hours new expirations and different contract sizes has helped enable us to meet customer demand at every turn especially as participation in trading shorter-dated options grows to new heights.

Importantly with the launch of those products we remained steadfast in our focus on investor education led by the Options Institute (OI). The OI revamped its website and course offering this year to provide a welcoming unintimidating place for new investors to learn about our markets.

We were once again reminded in 2022 how important data is to our education efforts and the operation of our markets. Our launch of a new data cloud platform is enabling our teams to better handle increasing amounts of data with greater speed and efficiency improving our capabilities for managing mining and analyzing that data internally across our global business and sharing those insights with our customers. Cboe also became Morningstar’s preferred index distributor and joined the Pyth network to bring some of our equities market data to blockchain.

As we rebranded Chi-X Asia Pacific to Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan in February we kicked off the migration of the Chi-X platform to Cboe technology which is on track for completion in early 2023 in Australia and by year end in Japan. Most recently we rebranded EuroCCP to Cboe Clear Europe once again further unifying our businesses and laying the foundation for continued growth and expansion of our clearing services.

In May we officially completed the acquisition of ErisX then rebranded the business to Cboe Digital in October to signal to the industry the growth and strength of our network. While the digital asset industry is still in the midst of uncertainty Cboe Digital is well-prepared to step in as the stable leader that will help the industry rebuild.

In Canada we completed the acquisition of NEO growing our North American equities offering and global listings business. We also completed the migration of MATCHNow to Cboe technology and launched BIDS Canada an excellent example of our long-term vision for fully integrating our acquired businesses to deliver new solutions. Not even a year since its launch Cboe BIDS Canada continues to flourish hitting a record volume of 28.2 million shares traded in November.

Across the pond Cboe Europe Equities remained the largest pan-European stock exchange by market share for the fifth successive month as of November. This achievement was driven in part by the expansion of our data and analytics services to help clients improve the quality of their executions and enhance their overall trading experience across our lit and dark order books periodic auctions and Cboe BIDS Europe. Our new Cboe Europe Derivatives Exchange (CEDX) continued to build momentum with new market participants and increasing volume.

Finally through our FX markets investors could enhance yields with currencies as nations around the world responded to geopolitical tensions supply chain issues inflation and potential recessions. Investors turning to one of our asset classes to hedge new uncertainty encapsulates why we do what we do at Cboe. Our exchanges and platforms across 26 markets reliably provided a forum for investors to express their views and manage their risk.

But why does this scale matter? It is to meet you where you are. Operating our trusted markets in more areas expands our reach and enables our clients to pursue global growth opportunities. Our customer base is increasingly global seeking coherent offerings across time zones that better enable them to optimize their services for their own clients. Cboe has transformed into a major global market operator. Our local expertise connected by a global network allows us to deeply understand where we operate our markets and provide customizable harmonized solutions that leverage our global breadth.

Our work this year laid the foundation for a strong 2023 our 50th year in business. In the year ahead we’ll build on the momentum we’ve gained to imagine what’s possible for the next 50 years. As always we very much welcome your thoughts and feedback as we work to create innovate and develop unique solutions that address your needs.

Thank you all for a fantastic year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbnRlY2hmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyL21hcmtldC1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS1maXJtLWNib2UtZXVyb3BlLWhpcmVzLXZpa2VzaC1wYXRlbC1hcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cboe Clear Europe hires Vikesh Patel as president,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fintechfutures.com/2022/12/market-infrastructure-firm-cboe-europe-hires-vikesh-patel-as-president/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbnRlY2hmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyL21hcmtldC1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS1maXJtLWNib2UtZXVyb3BlLWhpcmVzLXZpa2VzaC1wYXRlbC1hcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

CBRE Group the commercial real estate services and investment firm has come out with an outlook on real estate sector for 2023 which forecasts the strong momentum in residential sector continuing.

By Telangana Today Updated On - 23 December 2022 05:24 PM

Anshuman Magazine

Hyderabad: As the year 2022 inches towards a closure it ushers in new hopes and newer aspirations for 2023. The past year indeed has been a mixed bag with some dreams achieved some kept in abeyance and some chucked as not feasible.

For most the dream to weave a nest of one’s own continues to be the most precious one and as real estate scenario recovered from the impact of Covid and flourished many had their property aspirations fulfilled in the year 2022. And those who could not look forward to the arriving year to turn their dream for a home into a reality.

CBRE Group the commercial real estate services and investment firm has come out with an outlook on real estate sector for 2023 which forecasts the strong momentum in residential sector continuing.

The CBRE real estate outlook for Hyderabad on residential front says “The strong momentum would continue in new launches and sales. However steady supply infusion may impact delivery timelines and execution capabilities leading to a rise in unsold inventory.”

In terms of sales mid-end followed by high-end segments are likely to continue to drive demand with a higher focus on larger unit sizes.

Anshuman Magazine Chairman & CEO – India South-East Asia Middle East & Africa CBRE says “While Western Hyderabad would continue to be the key driver of new launches and sales government policy initiatives to distribute growth towards other directions of the city would propel residential activity in newer locations of North East and South Hyderabad. Strong momentum in land acquisition is likely to continue.”

On the office front CBRE outlook for Hyderabad says the tech firms would continue to drive leasing activity followed by flexible space operators engineering and manufacturing firms BFSI companies and life sciences firms.

“Medium- to large-sized deals (>50000 sq ft) are expected to continue to dominate absorption in 2023. IT Corridor II and Extended IT Corridor are likely to dominate supply with the completion of quality investment-grade developments” says Magazine.

Meanwhile the CBRE outlook for retail has the global/domestic brands entering the city continuing to diversify their store formats to enhance the experience quotient. “Fashion and apparel stores are likely to drive leasing in malls and high streets; entertainment and food and beverage stores are also expected to remain active in retail expansions” he adds.

Pop-up outlets flagship stores and concept stores are expected to gain prominence especially in Central and West Hyderabad.

Chicago Trading is growing its office footprint in the 40-story building by more than 46000 square feet diverging from the recent tenant tendency to cut back on commercial real estate as many employers settle into allowing work from home at least part of the week Crain’s reported.

Building owner CIM Group said Chicago Trading signed a lease for the seventh and eighth floors which adds to the company’s existing office on the sixth fifth and fourth floors. The firm which is the largest tenant in the office building now leases almost 160000 square feet in the tower.

CBRE’s Mark Keebler and Brad Serot represented Chicago Trading in the lease negotiation and Kelsey Scheuve and Kelsey Morgan with the same firm oversee leasing for the Financial Place office tower.

The expansion continues to boost the building’s occupancy as investment firm Loop Capital Markets also relocated its headquarters this year to the CIM-owned property from an office about the same size in a Central Loop building at 111 West Jackson Boulevard.

Chicago Trading spokesman Melvin Williams said the firm needed the extra space because more of its workers have been returning to the office recently.

The firm considered moving to other neighborhoods but ultimately decided to stay in the Loop and bet on the district’s future.

Los Angeles-based CIM Group has owned the 40-story office tower which previously had an address of 440 South LaSalle Street since 2016. The company paid $189 million for the building which was 72 percent leased at the time.

CIM Group’s renovation of the building’s lobby relocated the main entrance to Financial Place and it was about 77 percent leased prior to the deals with Loop Capital and Chicago Trading meaning it’s likely now outperforming the Loop’s average vacancy rate of 23.5 percent as of the third quarter according to CBRE.

Nationwide the office market is still struggling though South Florida has proven to be a brightspot. The Real Estate Roundtable recently urged the Biden Administration to bring federal employees back to the office arguing that it was setting a bad example by adopting permanent remote work strategies.

In Miami-Dade office asking rents rose 8 percent in the third quarter year-over-year to $47.85 per square foot from $44.35 per square foot according to a Cushman & Wakefield report.

Vacancies dropped to 17.4 percent in the third quarter from 18.2 percent in the same time period of last year the report found.

CLAYTON Mo. — The U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday bypassed Centene Corp. (NYSE: CNC) in awarding $136 billion in contracts for the health insurance provided to active-duty military members a blow to the Clayton giant and St. Louis' largest public company by revenue which has long held some of the work.

The Defense Health Agency said it was awarding the TRICARE contract for its west region to TriWest Healthcare Alliance of Phoenix owned by Blue Cross Blue Shield nonprofits including Blue Shield of California Regence Blue Shield and BCBS of Arizona along with the University of Colorado Hospital Authority and the University of New Mexico Hospital.

The $65.1 billion contract held by Centene for years through its Health Net Federal Services subsidiary includes a 12-month transition-in period plus eight one-year option periods a Defense Department spokesman said. The west includes 1.5 million beneficiaries in Arkansas Illinois Louisiana Oklahoma Texas and Wisconsin.

Centene said in a statement that ""we are disappointed by the DHA's decision.""

""We have a debriefing scheduled with the DHA in early January and have requested details to which we are entitled under the government's procedure rules"" it said. ""Following receipt of this information we will be in a position to determine our options regarding the Agency's decision.""

Centene this year lost another major award when the California Department of Health Care Services announced in August its intent to award contracts for Medicaid managed care contracts to Centene’s subsidiary Health Net of California Inc. in nine counties but not in others including Los Angeles and Sacramento counties. Centene is preparing to take legal action if a California state agency rejects its protest over how bidders were chosen. And Centene which has had a stagnant stock price this year has grappled with allegations of improper Medicaid billing to states. It's set aside $1.1 billion to resolve the claims which are now also the subject of a shareholder lawsuit against ex-Centene executives.

Responding to Thursday's decision TriWest said in a statement that several entities were also assisting it with the work: Accenture Blue Health Intelligence BizFlow Cognitive Medical Systems eviCore EXL FindHelp HealthSparq IBM MDLIVE MyRevelations Omada PsychArmor PGBA Signature Performance and Wells Fargo.

It also said it previously held TRICARE contracts with the Defense Department for 17 years beginning in 1996 through 2013 also in the western U.S.

Another freeze is in the forecast for Saturday night.

More than 10000 homes in the Houston area were without electricity early Friday afternoon as the region remained in the grips of an arctic blast.

Temperatures throughout Southeast Texas dropped below freezing on Thursday and are expected to remain below 32 degrees until Saturday afternoon according to the National Weather Service’s Houston-Galveston office. Meteorologist Jimmy Fowler said wind gusts between 20-30 mph are making it feel even colder with wind chill values in the teens or lower expected through Saturday which is Christmas Eve.

Fowler said wind chill values were around zero and in some cases below in the northern parts of the region early Friday morning.

“This is where it gets pretty dangerous” he said. “These wind chill values will not be rising above freezing until potentially briefly (Saturday) afternoon then go right back down into the teens through Christmas morning. So this is going to be a pretty prolonged cold that Southeast Texas might be dealing with.”

As of Friday afternoon the Houston region had not experienced sustained widespread power outages like the ones associated with the winter storm in February 2021 which brought large amounts of snow and ice. This week’s arctic front has not produced any precipitation and is not expected to during the coming days according to the National Weather Service meaning roadways should remain dry.

CenterPoint Energy said in a 4 p.m. email that it had been made aware of a text message going out to Houston-area customers claiming to be from the electricity provider saying rotating power outages were to take place Friday night and asking recipients to click on a link in the text for more information.

“This message is fraudulent and customers should not click on this malicious link” CenterPoint said. “CenterPoint Energy continues to work closely with ERCOT and monitor grid conditions and will continue to provide updates through our official social media channels and website.”

About 7400 customers within Houston and 11000 around the region were without electricity as of 1 p.m. Friday according to the online outage tracker operated by CenterPoint Energy. Per the tracker more than 225000 customers had lost power and had it restored during the previous 24 hours.

An ongoing power outage at the Memorial Heights at Washington apartments 201 S. Heights Blvd. is not weather-related according to CenterPoint which said in an email Friday that two utility poles were struck by a vehicle Thursday night near the intersection of Washington Avenue and Studemont Street. A spokesperson for METRO confirmed that one of its buses was the vehicle involved adding that no injuries were reported in the crash.

“Crews have been on site since the outage was reported early (Friday) morning replacing damaged equipment in order to safely restore service as quickly as possible” CenterPoint said.

With a high temperature around 30 expected Friday and nighttime low of 21 Fowler of the National Weather Service encouraged residents without power to stay near the middle of a room as opposed to an exterior wall or take advantage of one of the many warming centers and shelters that are open across the Houston area. Because of the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning he also said Houstonians should not operate generators indoors or run vehicles in a closed garage in an attempt to stay warm.

A hard freeze warning is in effect until noon Saturday. The projected high temperature for Saturday is 39 with a low of 25 at night.

Much the same will happen Sunday when there is an expected high of 44 degrees during the day and a low of 29 at night. The freezing-weather snap is expected to end Monday when the forecasted low is 36.

“If you have power and everything like that make sure you stay inside” Fowler said. “If you do go outside bundle up — layers layers layers. Also make sure that you're not leaving any pets outside for an extended period of time. Make sure they're inside warm and well-fed.”

The city's five warming centers opened Thursday night for residents like Archie Maywall who need a place to stay warm. He came to the Acres Homes Multi-Service Center because he says he didn't have a place to go and he's grateful for the center being open.

""I appreciate it I really do” he said. “Getting out of that wind and cold it's hard out there.""

The city's five warming centers will be open through noon Saturday. The centers are supplying residents with a bite to eat blankets chairs and more to help get them through the freeze. The Acres Homes Multi-Service Center was one place residents could go and according to the city as of Friday morning 41 Houstonians checked in at the center.

Among them was Arnez Henderson. He said he was trying to get back to Bryan northwest of Houston but came to the center instead.

""It was pretty good came in and got a nice hot meal blanket somewhere to lay your head and get out the cold"" he said.

There were about 3.464 million deaths in the U.S. in 2021 805000 more than the total reported in 2020 according to the Mortality in the United States 2021 report from the CDC National Center for Health Statistics.



The death rate for the U.S. increased by 5.3% from 835.4 deaths per 100000 people in 2020 to 879.7 in 2021 data showed. As a result life expectancy at birth for the U.S. population decreased from 77 years in 2020 to 76.4 years in 2021.



COVID-19 was a major factor in the change in mortality rates ranking as the third most prevalent cause of death after heart disease and cancer. A rise in drug overdoses also contributed accounting for more than one third of all accidental deaths in the U.S. according to the CDC. The rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl increased 22% from 17.8 in 2020 to 21.8 in 2021.



Despite the decrease in life expectancy actuarial tables that influence retirement planning and services may not see significant change according to Christian Veenstra co-president of Watkins Ross a retirement plan consultant actuary and administrator.



“Today’s headlines while interesting are likely based on averages of current data—that is the earlier than expected deaths caused by COVID[-19] created [an] average age at death lower than expected” Veenstra says in an emailed response. “But extrapolating that to future experience isn’t so cut and dried.”



Veenstra says that if deaths due to COVID-19 mostly impacted the elderly that would have brought the actual age of death down but would not necessarily provide information for the future mortality of survivors.



Mortality forecasts are used in the retirement and insurance industries for a number of purposes ranging from determining funding for defined benefit plans to valuing annuities and life estates.



Veenstra says there are two schools of thought about how to measure the long-term impact of COVID-19 on mortality. The first is that COVID-19 caused the death of people who may have died at a younger age from a different cause (i.e. those with underlying medical conditions) thereby leaving behind more people with longer life expectancy. If that is true Veenstra writes then “some models actually project longer average lifespan by several months to a couple of years.”



In the second scenario the long-term negative health issues for those who contracted COVID-19 may mean earlier death pushing down the overall mortality rate.



Veenstra says his firm Grand Rapids Michigan-based Watkins Ross is “eagerly awaiting” updates to mortality improvement tables that the Internal Revenue Service and Society of Actuaries usually publish in October which have been delayed due to uncertainty forced by COVID-19.



He notes that when retirement advice is given on the individual level many other factors enter the equation for decisions on asset distribution and associated costs including family history current health and past medical experience. Now that list will include exposure to COVID-19 and vaccination status.



“When we see decisions made by individuals in defined benefit pension plans—such as whether or not to take a lump sum a type of joint and survivor or other annuity option benefit commencement date etc.—participants can become quite honest in order to maximize the benefit for themselves” Veenstra says.

News reports say cold weather has shut down several U.S. oil refineries causing crude prices to spike.

LyondellBasell Industries shutdown the large crude distillation unit and two hydrotreaters on Friday at its 268000-barrel-per-day Houston refinery due to extreme cold and the winter storm impacting much of the U.S. and Gulf Coast Reuters reported citing sources.

The global chemical company says Houston Refining is one of the largest refineries in the U.S. designed to process heavy-sulfur crude oil.

Data compiled by the U.S. National Weather Service showed temperatures in Houston fell 45 degrees on Thursday from a high of 63 degrees Fahrenheit to a low of 18 degrees Fahrenheit.

BRUTAL WINTER STORM KNOCKS OUT POWER FOR OVER A MILLION AMERICANS

A spokesperson for the Houston-based refinery told FOX News on Friday ""Our LyondellBasell U.S. Gulf Coast sites continue to conduct detailed assessments stemming from Winter Storm Elliott but for competitive reasons we do not provide specific details about units their operational status production figures or supply.""

""Our focus remains on ensuring the health and safety of our people and the communities where we operate. We may need to conduct some flaring to ensure safe operations"" the spokesperson continued. ""Flares are a safety feature designed to burn excess material resulting from certain routine operations as well as some non-routine situations such as power loss or equipment failure.""

""We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our community neighbors.""

The number of Triple A companies fell from 14 last year.

Around 330 global companies out of the 15000 scored were awarded at least one A for their environmental disclosures in 2022. Approximately 280 companies scored an A for their climate change disclosures – a 34% increase from 2021. Yet there was only a 4% increase in the number achieving an A for their forests disclosures (just one more company than last year) and a 12.7% decrease in the number awarded an A for water security.

In addition many companies are still failing to disclose. More than 29500 companies worth at least $24.5trn in market capitalisation – including Aramco Berkshire Hathaway Chevron ExxonMobil and Tesla – scored an F for failing to respond to disclosure requests from their investors and clients or providing insufficient information in their responses. In fact according to a recent report by consultancy South Pole a quarter of companies with science-based net-zero targets are choosing not to publicise them or “green hushing”.

“Environmental disclosure is the first vital step towards a net-zero and nature-positive future so A List companies should be commended for the level of transparency in their CDP responses” said Dexter Galvin global director of corporations and supply chains at CDP in a statement.

“But we cannot ignore that these companies are in the minority. Most are still not managing all environmental issues holistically and far too many are remaining complacent or failing to respond at all. Companies must step up to the challenge as CDP continues to lift the bar for what qualifies as environmental leadership and since there is no route to 1.5°C without nature they must speed and scale up their progress in addressing deforestation and water impacts dependencies and risks too.”

Premiums loss ratio rise

The direct incurred loss ratio for U.S. homeowners lines rose to 98.0% in 2022 from 90.2% in the prior year as widespread inflationary pressures and the impact of Hurricane Ian contributed to the financial woes felt by the property and casualty insurance market.

Direct premiums written for the 10 largest U.S. homeowners insurers came in at $23.77 billion in the third quarter rising 11.65% in the period from $21.29 billion a year earlier.

Progressive posts largest loss ratio

Despite having the smallest market share among the 10 largest U.S. homeowners insurers The Progressive Corp. recorded the largest direct loss ratio by far totaling 236.2% for the third quarter. Progressive unlike most other large U.S. homeowners insurers underwrites in Florida where damage from Hurricane Ian was the most severe.

In its third-quarter earnings release Progressive cited $175 million of net property losses after reflecting the catastrophe reinsurance coverage on its property business which writes residential property insurance for homeowners other property owners and renters.

According to the company's Nov. 1 Form 10-Q filing Progressive retained $25 million of allocated loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance. On a gross basis prior to reinsurance Progressive estimated property catastrophe losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses from Hurricane Ian were $1.4 billion.

Because Progressive ""heavily"" reinsures its catastrophe exposure in its property business the insurer retained ""only $200 million of loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses from Hurricane Ian"" according to the report.

Progressive reported $760 million in losses for the quarter related to the hurricane with its property business incurring 23% of the losses net of reinsurance and vehicle losses accounting for $585 million including boats and recreational vehicles.

Among the 10 largest U.S. homeowners insurers only Progressive and USAA Casualty Insurance Co. logged loss ratios above 100%. Chubb Ltd. logged the lowest loss ratio among the largest U.S. homeowners writers at 55.7%.

Double-digit premium change

More than half of the 10 largest homeowners insurers in the U.S. — The Allstate Corp. Liberty Mutual Group Inc. USAA Casualty Insurance Co. The Travelers Cos. Inc. and American Family Insurance Group — posted double-digit premium increases year over year.

During a November earnings call Mario Rizzo Allstate's president of property-liability said the insurer is increasing homeowners prices through both rates and the inflationary adjustment factor embedded in Allstate's homeowners product to improve underlying margins going forward.

American Family rose by the largest percentage growing by 17.4% to $1.66 billion in direct premiums written.

The weather could be as big a factor as trying to stop running back Alvin Kamara or blocking linebacker Demario Davis. High winds snow and brutal cold will test both teams’ ability to adapt and find a way to win.

The Saints had very high hopes entering the 2022 season but things have just not panned out. Their best offensive player Kamara has been limited to just three total touchdowns on the season. Andy Dalton though having a solid year does not appear to be the quarterback of the future for New Orleans. Taysom Hill has also been solid but needs a high-level quarterback to maximize his abilities.

Beside the versatile Kamara and Hill rookie receiver Chris Olave and third-year tight end Juwan Johnson have had really solid seasons. Olave the former Ohio State star has 63 receptions for 940 yards and has been targeted 102 times but has been ruled out of Saturday’s game due to injury. Johnson has 35 receptions and an impressive seven receiving touchdowns.

On defense the Saints are led by Davis and Pete Werner. The two linebackers have combined for 167 total tackles and are the emotional leaders of the defense. Werner has been ruled out with a hamstring injury and his loss will be huge as the Saints attempt to stop Nick Chubb and the Browns’ run game.

Cameron Jordan has 5.5 sacks on the season and is always someone an opposing offense must account for. The secondary is led by former Kansas City Chief Tyrann Mathieu. Though still a playmaker Mathieu has been susceptible in man coverage. Look for the Browns to isolate both Amari Cooper and Donovan People-Jones in the slot and challenge Mathieu’s ability to cover.

Recommended Browns stories

Here are three keys for the Browns to beat the Saints:

1. Press the edge in the run game

The Browns should look to attack the edge like the Falcons did last weekend. Atlanta running back Tyler Allgeier rushed for 139 yards on 17 carries. As a team the Falcons rushed for 231 yards and averaged a robust 5.9 yards per carry. The majority of their success was on the edge with outside zone concepts with variations.

At first the Saints had issues setting the edge allowing the Falcons running backs to get outside for big runs. That led to the Saints to overset the edge or overrun the ball carrier creating huge cutback lanes. With the expected weather look for the Browns to establish their outside zone scheme with Chubb. A zone concept allows a running back to hit the hole fast without having to change direction much which is important with a snow-covered field.

Below is a great cutback run from Falcons running back Cordarrelle Patterson.

The left tackle and tight end will trey double team block Tanoh Kpassagnon. The left guard and center will ace double team block David Onyemata to the #1 linebacker Demario Davis. The right guard and right tackle will deuce double team block their defensive tackle to the #2 linebacker Pete Werner.

Davis Kpassagnon and Onyemata are too wide and overrun the play creating a huge cutback lane and a 10-yard run for Patterson.

2. Account for Kamara and Hill on every snap

On film the Saints do a really good job of putting Kamara and Hill in multiple positions to create touches for them in space. They will put them both at quarterback and use the quarterback run game. By directly snapping the football to them they create an extra blocker in their run game.

Look for the Browns to crowd the line of scrimmage with safeties Grant Delpit and John Johnson III when these two are at quarterback or lined up anywhere where they can touch it in the run game.

3. Force left tackle James Hurst to block Myles Garrett one on one

If the Browns can control the run game Garrett will have a sizable advantage over left tackle James Hurst. The Falcons did a really nice job of consistently covering the left guard and forcing a one-on-one match with Hurst and Atlanta edge rusher Lorenzo Carter. If the Falcons are forced to pass and don’t help Hurst Garrett will have a huge day.

Below is a look at how Atlanta created a one on one with Carter and Hurst.

Defensive tackle Grady Jarrett will angle to his right and force left guard Andrus Peat to block him. Linebacker Rashaan Evans blitzes on the opposite side forcing running back Adam Prentice to pick him.

All of this forces Hurst to block Carter without any help. Carter uses speed combined with a stab move and a rip to beat Hurst for an 8-yard sack.

What we learned

The Saints are as just as disappointed with their season as the Browns. With the weather that is expected both teams will look to establish the run game.

The Browns will look to follow the blueprint set by the Falcons and attack the edge of the New Orleans defense. Chubb will have a huge day if the Saints defense has not rectified its issues with the edge run.

With Olave out the pressure is even greater on Kamara and Hill to make plays for the Saints. In both the run and pass Myles Garrett should have a big day against Hurst. The weather will make this game ugly and should emphasize the run game which favors Cleveland.

Lance Reisland is the former coach at Garfield Heights High School where he spent 18 seasons as an assistant for his father Chuck and four as head coach from 2014 to 2018. In 2018 his team finished 11-1 and appeared in the OHSAA Division II regional semifinals. That team went 10-0 and made history as the first Garfield Heights team in 41 years to have an undefeated regular season along with beating Warren G.

Construction is nearing completion on the St. Charbel Maronite Church in Doha Qatar with plans to open its doors to worshippers in 2025 coinciding with the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year according to Father Charbel Mhanna from Qatar’s Maronite parish.

In an interview with ACI Mena CNA’s Arabic-language news partner Mhanna explained that with a capacity of about 3000 people St. Charbel will be the country’s largest church open to all Catholics.

Updated May 10 2024

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is sending humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent rains in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.

In what authorities consider the state’s worst-ever crisis caused by natural disasters the extreme flooding has forced 200000 people out of their homes and at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing.

The Brazil Area Presidency has assembled staff and resources to assist those affected by the floods. A letter sent to bishops and stake presidents from Elder Joni L. Koch Brazil Area President and his counselors Elder Arnulfo Valenzuela and Elder Mark D. Eddy all General Authority Seventies states that 21 meetinghouses are now being used as shelters for evacuated people and thousands of basic food packages provided by the Church to the state Civil Defense have already begun to be distributed to the population.

Other humanitarian aid initiatives are underway in close coordination with the government to help the community. The Church’s Welfare and Self-Reliance and Family Services departments are coordinating support and efforts to meet the needs of members as well.

On Wednesday May 8 missionaries from the Church helped unload emergency supplies from an Azul airplane at the military airport in the city of Canoas.

In Saõ Paulo on Thursday May 9 Elder Koch and Elder Valenzuela closely monitored the loading onto an Azul aircraft of 6 tons of supplies purchased by the Church for flood victims bound for the Canoas Air Base. In a social media post on the Church’s official Brazil account the leaders stated that in addition to the donations was “an immeasurable amount of love and sincere prayers for the people of Rio Grande do Sul.” On Friday May 10 Brazil’s first lady Rosângela Lula da Silva wrote her Instagram page: “I want to thank Azul [Airlines] and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who performed alongside FAB [Brazilian Air Force] and were able to get the donations we received to Canoas. ... There were mattresses vacuum cleaners toilet kits blankets among other items.” She said Brazil is united in its support of Rio Grande do Sul.

News reports say some 80% of the population is without running water right now a week into the flooding. Many also do not have telephone or internet services.

The airport bus station and main roads are all blocked or closed going into the capital of Porto Alegre — and more than two-thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state are affected by the flood waters. Field hospitals have been set up to help those affected.

Social media posts on the Church’s Autossuficiência Brasil and Brazil Area accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints further explain how the Church is responding to the disaster which include the following list of donated goods and services:

5000-plus basic food baskets

5000-plus mattresses pillows bedding and blankets

48000 liters of drinking water

5000 hygiene and cleaning kits

400 water filters

Additional humanitarian funds

These donations are being coordinated in collaboration with the State Civil Defense. Local church leaders are also coordinating efforts to help the community.

“[T]he Brazil Area office is mobilized to do everything possible to help and help the population of Rio Grande do Sul our dear brothers and sisters and friends at this time of great sorrow” the post said in Portuguese.

The post states that Church members who want to make donations to those affected by the calamity can do so through official government organizations that are coordinating donations through civil defense and social funds.

In addition the Church’s Family Services department is coordinating a support network of volunteer psychologists to provide emotional support to those affected. And wards and stakes across the country have joined the Church’s Helping Hands volunteer program and are raising donations.

A statement from the Brazil Area presidency said “We pray that as we follow the perfect example of Jesus Christ ‘our hands may become His hands; our eyes His eyes and our hearts His heart’ at this time when our brothers and sisters need us so much.”

Some of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul — roughly the size Ecuador — were already suffering from at least three previous major floods in less than eight months.

The rains are expected to continue in the area along with high winds.

Neighbours at war after couple builds 10ft 'church' window that looks right into bedroom of,"Neighbours in a quaint market town are at war after a couple built a 10ft 'church-style' window that looks right into the bedroom of the family next door.

Mark Waddilove 62 and his partner Helen Fitt 49 received few complaints after they applied for planning permission for the huge widow on the first floor of their home in Wimbourne Dorset

But once the window was put in for the calming room - where Miss Fitt planned to do her yoga - the complaints from neighbours - who dubbed it a 'monstrosity' - soon arrived with many upset the new installation allowed the couple to see into their properties.

Rob Langdown a church celebrant and his wife Margaret said the new window looks right into their bedroom - and that they were blindsided by the development accusing officials of failing to put up planning notices in their road ahead of granting it permission.

The married couple added that they would have objected to the development on the grounds of it breaching their privacy and being out of touch with the area if they were aware of it.

Wimbourne residents Tim and Deborah James who live next door complained that as well as overlooking their property the development has blocked out sunlight into their back garden.

Mark Waddilove and Helen Fitt (pictured) didn't receive many complaints after they launched planning permission for the window

Neighbours dubbed the giant window a 'monstrosity'

The James' also say Mr Waddilove and Miss Fitt have sent them legal letters about giving access to their property while the work is carried out.

Both sets of homeowners have branded the extension a 'monstrosity' and fear it has reduced the value of their properties. They also slammed Dorset Council for allowing it to go ahead.

The local authority said it stands by its decision to grant planning consent for the extension to the back of the semi-detached house in the pretty market town of Wimborne Minster.

It is the second similar case where council planners have faced criticism over a controversial development that overlooks neighbouring homes in recent months.

In nearby Corfe Mullen Terry Selby has taken his case to the Local Government Ombudsman.

He and wife Margaret were shocked when permission was granted to replace their nextdoor neighbours' bungalow with a two-storey building that now towers over their home.

Mr Selby believes Dorset Council made a 'massive mistake' and partly blames the work from home culture for a lack of cohesion that led to the decision.

In Colehill Mr Langdown also believes the council has made a mistake. He said: 'We were not informed of this planning application.

'A notice went up in our cul-de-sac but not in the private lane where the three bungalows most directly affected by this extension are.

'They could have posted us a letter there are only three houses. But we didn't see the notice and didn't have the chance to object and the next thing we have this bloody great big window looking straight at us.

'It looks like a church window that is twice the size of the one that was there and is now much further forward. It looks straight into our property. It is a monstrosity and not in keeping with the area at all.

Picture shows an aerial view of the window which neighbours said they would have complained about had they known about the planning application

A next door neighbour complained that the extension blocks light from reaching his property

'It is quite concerning to think that this has been passed without anybody being approached about it. It is going to devalue our property.'

The Colehill Parish Council did not object to the proposals but did express concern that local residents were not aware of them due to the lack of notices.

Next door neighbour Tim James 63 said: 'I'm not happy about it it blocks our light out and the extension overlooks us we have no privacy in our garden.

'It's been an absolute nightmare from the start. We've had six months of continual hammering and drilling from eight in the morning since October and it's making it a nightmare to live here.

'They were sending us letters about the agreement which were quite threatening saying you must sign this within X number of days.

'They said we had to let a surveyor who worked for them into our property otherwise if there were any cracks in our building we wouldn't be able to claim anything.

'I'm not worried by their threats but it doesn't make it a nice place to live.

'We have appealed against it the whole way through but nobody has taken a blind but of notice. The council doesn't care.

'Living in a semi-detached house with all that going on every day is just ridiculous.'

Mr Waddilove and Ms Fitt declined to comment on the matter.

Mr Waddilove is company director of an IT solutions business and according to Linkedin works as a senior programme manager at Solent University in Southampton.

A spokesperson for Dorset Council said: 'The application was advertised by means of site notices erected by the case officer on September 8 2022.

'This included a lamppost notice on Farriers Close near to the entrance of the road. There was no suitable street furniture on which to erect a site notice closer to the properties in question.

Picture shows the 'church-style' window is clearly visible from the road

In nearby Corfe Mullen Terry Selby has taken his case to the Local Government Ombudsman in a similar case

'The case officer visited the site and judged that the proposed new window would not overlook the complainants' property any more than their previous window.

'We stand by our decision but the neighbour is free to make a formal complaint as we haven't had any other complaints about this development to date. House values are not a material consideration when assessing planning applications.'

The spokesperson denied that working from home had any impact on the council's decision making.'

They said: 'Flexible working from home arrangements in recent years have had no negative impact on our planning processes including this application.

'Modern networking technology means officers can access the same information and tools at home as in the office. They work in the same capacity and to the same requirements as before and still carry out site visits when needed and other due diligence regardless of where their desk-based work takes place.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvdXMvbW9ybW9uLWNodXJjaC1sYXR0ZXItZGF5LXNhaW50cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Modern Mormon Missionaries: Facebook Evangelizing Women in Pants,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nytimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2024/05/10/us/mormon-church-latter-day-saints.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227391270>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvdXMvbW9ybW9uLWNodXJjaC1sYXR0ZXItZGF5LXNhaW50cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYmwuY29tL25ld3MvcnVzc2VsbC1jb3VudHktY2h1cmNoLWRlc3Ryb3llZC1pbi1maXJlLWZyb20tc3VzcGVjdGVkLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1zdHJpa2Uv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3JibC5jb20vbmV3cy9ydXNzZWxsLWNvdW50eS1jaHVyY2gtZGVzdHJveWVkLWluLWZpcmUtZnJvbS1zdXNwZWN0ZWQtbGlnaHRuaW5nLXN0cmlrZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russell County church destroyed in fire from suspected lightning strike,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wrbl.com/news/russell-county-church-destroyed-in-fire-from-suspected-lightning-strike/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYmwuY29tL25ld3MvcnVzc2VsbC1jb3VudHktY2h1cmNoLWRlc3Ryb3llZC1pbi1maXJlLWZyb20tc3VzcGVjdGVkLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1zdHJpa2Uv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3JibC5jb20vbmV3cy9ydXNzZWxsLWNvdW50eS1jaHVyY2gtZGVzdHJveWVkLWluLWZpcmUtZnJvbS1zdXNwZWN0ZWQtbGlnaHRuaW5nLXN0cmlrZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

While this might not raise any eyebrows if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.

Cigna hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn around. You'd really hope so otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile.

How Is Cigna's Growth Trending?

The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/E like Cigna's is when the company's growth is tracking the market closely.

If we review the last year of earnings dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 14%. Even so admirably EPS has lifted 76% in aggregate from three years ago notwithstanding the last 12 months. Although it's been a bumpy ride it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.

Looking ahead now EPS is anticipated to climb by 4.0% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.3% per year which is noticeably more attractive.

In light of this it's curious that Cigna's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.

What We Can Learn From Cigna's P/E?

Typically we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

We've established that Cigna currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth we suspect the share price is at risk of declining sending the moderate P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.

Before you settle on your opinion we've discovered 1 warning sign for Cigna that you should be aware of.

Of course you might also be able to find a better stock than Cigna. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.

Following a year of unprecedented funding skyrocketing valuations and a record number of IPOs the digital health sector experienced a pullback amid shaky economic waters in 2022. Investor confidence across public and private markets was impacted by global conflict rising inflation and recession concerns leading to a weakened funding environment. Contemporaneously our nation’s health system faced its own set of hurdles including rising rates of COVID-19 flu and RSV staffing shortages cyberattacks and financial difficulties.

Despite these challenges 2022 was still a year of landmark innovation disruptive partnerships and continued value creation for industry stakeholders and healthcare consumers alike. Corporate giants further entrenched their positions as healthcare heavyweights through their multi-billion-dollar investments in consumer-centric healthcare delivery models. The year also saw leading digital health companies step up in the face of new public health threats including 7wireVentures portfolio company FOLX Health which quickly mobilized to launch a virtual care offering addressing the country’s mpox outbreak.

At 7wireVentures we believe consumer-focused digital technologies play an endemic role in transforming our healthcare system. 2023 will represent a continuation of this belief as the demand for improved care experiences shows no sign of abating. Our predictions for the new year include:

#1 Consolidation is The Name of the Game – Saturated sectors will experience consolidation as mature players seek to satiate investor and market expectations for growth in 2023

2020 and 2021 saw digital health startups raise $43.8B in venture financing across 1217 deals. This record-breaking flurry of investment in the space was fertile breeding ground for new market entrants to pour into the digital health sector. However as public and private capital markets have grown less friendly over the past year many companies will enter the new year in search of alternative paths to support runway. Simultaneously more mature market players still fueled by massive funding rounds in 2021 will be seeking new ways to jumpstart their next phase of growth and gain scale. The combination of these forces sets the stage for meaningful market consolidation.

While 2022’s M&A market was not immune to the macroeconomic forces that impacted the funding markets increased activity in Q3 suggests companies are finding their footing amidst the shaky economic environment and are reprioritizing business building. Newly hired corporate development leaders who took a back seat in 2022 will have their sights set on 2023 as a landmark year for strategic investments that further expand their customer base and bolster offerings. In the new year crowded sectors such as mental health will experience a significant volume of M&A activity. Headspace’s merger with Ginger last year and their more recent acquisition of inclusive mental health and wellness company Shine are prime examples of the type of consolidation the market is ready for.

#2 The Digital Health Arms Race Heats Up – In order to counter growing pressure from retailers leading health systems will expand and deepen their digital health partnerships to broaden their reach improve the continuity of care and enhance the patient experience

Competition to own healthcare’s front door is steadily growing. 2022 saw the likes of CVS Walgreens Walmart and Amazon make headlines through their market disrupting acquisitions – each company attempting to further entrench themselves as dominant care delivery players. Through these acquisitions retail giants are rushing to meet the growing unmet needs of consumers for more accessible convenient easy to navigate and transparent care. With footprints in local communities across the country retailers have the food the medicine the pharmacist and now even the access to local and convenient care consumers need.

As it stands only 7% of traditional providers are considered top performers in terms of their digital strategy and infrastructure for supporting healthcare consumerism. As pressure from retailers continues to mount and the healthcare industry faces continued financial challenges hospitals and health systems will increasingly partner with digital health companies to strengthen patient loyalty while protecting and expanding revenue. Accelerated investment in key technologies and partnerships that personalize care delivery and meet consumer needs for a superior experience will be top priorities for providers in the coming years. Innovative health systems are leading the charge through collaborations with digital front door and navigation platforms. Memorial Sloan Kettering is partnering with Jasper Health to augment their specialized expertise and treatments through Jasper’s digitally enhanced and personalized cancer care support. UTMB is working with PayZen to offer their patients affordable payment options while also remaining competitive in the future of shoppable healthcare services. Although no clear winner in the retail healthcare revolution has been crowned retail players’ continued foray into care delivery will turn the heat on traditional stakeholders and has potential to usher in a step change towards a more consumer-centric and tech-enabled healthcare ecosystem.

#3 From Assessment to Action – Social determinants of health will continue to expand as a way to not only understand barriers to care but to directly address consumers’ unique health needs

The importance of social determinants of health (SDOH) has been widely documented. Driven by regulatory pressures advancements in technology and an increasingly sicker and aging population 2023 will be a breakthrough year for healthcare stakeholders to take action on addressing SDOH needs and health equity gaps. To meet this need at scale healthcare organizations will increasingly partner with healthcare technology platforms enabling a greater shift towards standardized SDOH data. Many such efforts are already underway including Lyft Health’s integration with Epic and Cerner’s partnership with Jvion.

Ultimately healthcare stakeholders will leverage rich datasets of non-medical information to design and implement interventions with the primary goal of closing equity gaps. For example SameSky Health partners with health plans to uncover SDOH needs and delivers an insight driven personalized member experience through culturally and linguistically aligned member engagement. MedArrive delivers a highly trained network of field providers to give patients the hands-on care they need at home solving access challenges by meeting patients where they are. Further companies like NourishedRx support health plans in directly closing gaps in health equity by making culturally relevant and nutritious meals accessible for vulnerable populations.

#4 Hold Your Headsets – The Metaverse will remain in the starting blocks in 2023 as most of the focus for VR/AR technologies will initially be limited to mental health applications

Stakeholders and industry watchers across the industry have expressed excitement around the role the metaverse will play in reshaping healthcare in the coming years – 81% of healthcare executives expect it will have a positive impact on their organizations. However like most new technologies the metaverse comes with its own hurdles that will initially deter its widespread application and use within healthcare. High technology costs interoperability and concerns surrounding privacy and security in particular present significant headwinds. These challenges will likely take time to be resolved suggesting healthcare’s embrace of the metaverse will be a cautious one that is initially deployed across select use cases that are buttressed by meaningful outcomes research.

Mental health presents a unique and large opportunity for the technology to flourish. The need for novel therapies is becoming increasingly crucial as recent estimates indicate that by 2030 depression will be the leading cause of disease burden globally. Although research in the area continues to grow studies have long shown the effectiveness VR/AR can have in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. In fact OxfordVR an early pioneer in the space is a product of two decades of research conducted at Oxford University. The company recently merged with BehaVR to build and commercialize a suite of solutions across the mental health acuity spectrum. As demand for mental health services continues to exceed our nation’s available resources VR/AR technologies have been hailed as a timely saving grace and will play a meaningful role in the new year. Success found with mental health will encourage continued research and commercial application across other promising condition areas including pain management and stroke rehabilitation.

#5 The Future of Health – As Gen-Z increasingly enters the workforce there will be increased demand for healthcare benefits that meet their unique expectations for how healthcare should be delivered

Next year employers plan to hire 14.7% more 2023 graduates compared to the class of 2022 and by 2025 Gen-Z will make up 27% of the workforce. Facing a highly competitive labor market forward-looking employers will move to take a more tailored approach in designing their health and wellness benefits aligning offerings closely with the needs of this emerging generation. Gen-Z employees will expect their employer to fill gaps in care they feel are not adequately addressed by traditional offerings – and if employers fail to do so they are not afraid to vote with their feet. As Gen-Z is the most diverse U.S. generation to date and the most likely to identify as LGBTQIA+ we will see increased demand for more personalized solutions that support their lived experiences and identities.

#6 Shifting Strategies – D2C digital health companies will be forced to accelerate shifts to B2B models as consumers tighten their belts amid high inflation

Financial pressure from rising prices is beginning to squeeze household budgets with consumer spending pulling back across various market categories. Already burdened by rising out-of-pocket healthcare costs consumers will be increasingly unwilling and unable to absorb healthcare costs that are outside of their existing benefits. Reduced demand for cash-pay offerings will drive an increased number of D2C companies to pivot to B2B models to survive.

Likely in response to the changing macroeconomic environment digital health companies that have traditionally experienced success as D2C businesses such as wearable developer Oura and weight loss company Noom have started rolling out enterprise offerings in earnest this year. Jasper Health launched as a D2C business has found success in its shift to serve enterprise clients. After supporting nearly 12000 cancer patients and their caregivers through the company’s D2C offering Jasper expanded its platform to a wide variety of healthcare organizations including health plans self-insured employers and health systems that provide cancer care. The company has inked partnerships with Employer Direct Healthcare Walgreens and Cigna’s Evernorth among others.

#7 Not For the Faint of Heart – Following the year’s slowed funding environment specialist investors will continue to find success in the market due to the meaningful value and expertise they bring

Digital health funding was dominated by the veteran investor in 2022. In the first half of the year 70% of investors were experienced investors relative to 55% in the prior year. Shaken by volatility in the public and private markets non-specialist investors that poured capital into digital health in 2021 took a step back this year to re-evaluate their portfolios. With weak economic conditions expected to extend through 2023 industry veterans will continue to rise to the top as companies seek support navigating uncertain waters.

Investing in healthcare is not for the faint of heart and during difficult market conditions doing so becomes an acute challenge for the non-specialist investor. Healthcare is a complicated industry characterized by numerous public and private stakeholders competing incentives and a dizzying array of federal and state regulations. Over a lifetime healthcare specialists develop a tremendous network and a wealth of institutional knowledge that creates real value and drives outsized growth for companies. Deep industry expertise a strong network and boots-on-the-ground support will continue to deliver meaningful value for companies in 2023 and beyond.

Digital health is a market characterized by sustainable business models a supportive regulatory environment and outsized market need. Despite the year’s challenges 7wireVentures remains excited about the future of the sector and the opportunities that exist for the industry to empower Informed Connected Health Consumers. As we look towards 2023 we are eager to continue working alongside passionate healthcare entrepreneurs to build category-defining companies that reimagine our healthcare system.",,,

CTAS,Cintas,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9jaW50YXMtYmVhdHMtaW5mbGF0aW9uLXdpdGgtb3BlcmF0aW5nLWxldmVyYWdlLzQ0MTc1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cintas Beats Inflation With Operating Leverage,"Cintas is a Dividend Aristocrat with a long track record of capital growth as well as share repurchases and it just raised guidance for the year.

This story originally appeared on MarketBeat

Cintas Corporation (NYSE: CTAS) has something every business in the S&P 500 wishes it had right now; the operating leverage to improve margins despite the ongoing impact of inflation. The company just reported double-digit increases at all levels of operations driven by a story that has been unfolding for years within the labor-market-related business services industry.

That story is one of growing customer counts and deepening penetration due to expanding workforces and added services. This means a double tailwind for the industry that Cintas is on the cusp of hitting new all times highs once again.

""Our financial performance is the result of the exceptional execution of our employee-partners in providing businesses with the image safety cleanliness and compliance they need to get Ready for the Workday®. Each of our operating segments again grew revenue at a double-digit rate. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services generated operating leverage"" said Todd M. Schneider Cintas' President and Chief Executive Officer.

Dividend Aristocrat Cintas Proves Its Worth … Again

Anyone that's kept track of Cintas over the past several decades knows that is a high-quality company with some of the best-run operations you can buy. The company has been working diligently to expand on an organic and acquisitional basis and has done so with aplomb. The Q2 results are a testament to those efforts as much as anything else and have the revenue up 13% versus last year and up 18% versus pre-pandemic levels.

The revenue beat the consensus by 190 basis points as well and strength was able to carry through to the bottom line. Revenue growth was supported by double-digit gains in both operations segments as well.

Regarding the margin the gross profit increased by 15% on a 100 basis point increase in margin. This drove a 16.7% increase in operating income aided by a 70 basis point improvement in margin percentage. The net income came in at a lesser 10% due to rising costs and the company's ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders.

The key takeaway is that GAAP earnings of $3.12 are $0.09 or 300 basis points above the consensus estimate and 60 basis points more outperformance than shown on the top line. Earnings by the way are up more than 53% versus pre-pandemic levels.

Turning to the guidance the news is good but the specter of inflation can still be seen. The company upped its targets for revenue and earnings but upped the top end more than the bottom. The new guidance has revenue in a range above the previous and the current Marketbeat.com consensus. At the same time the earnings are expected to be higher but bracketing the consensus (with ample room for outperformance).

Cintas On Track For Capital Returns

Cintas is among the highest-quality dividend growth stocks and many other groupings and has increased its payout for nearly 40 years. The current yield isn't all that attractive by itself at 1.0% but it is a safe and growing distribution coupled with share repurchases and a solid track record of company growth. Repurchases reduced the share count by about 2.0% over the last year and should continue on into the future.

The company's balance sheet is a fortress and its cash flow can sustain repurchases and dividend increases for many years. At the current payout level the company is only distributing about 37% of its earnings so investors might expect the double-digit growth pace to continue for at least another year or two.

The Technical Outlook: Cintas Hits Resistance But Techs Are Bullish

The price action in Cintas stock popped in the wake of the earnings release but hit resistance the next day. The takeaway is that support at the short-term EMA appears to be strong so the battle at $460 could be fierce. Assuming the market follows through on the early signals being given the bulls should win the fight and drive the stock to a new high. The question is if they can hold it and then start another rally. If so this stock could hit the $500 level in early 2023. If not Cintas stock will be range bound at or near current levels until there is some change in the general outlook.

They are the last two of six individuals who were charged in October for such offences related to confiscated vape products. The other four have already pleaded guilty and been sentenced.

On Friday Mohan Raj Akilan a 31-year-old Malaysian was sentenced to three months’ jail and to pay a fine of S$800 after he pleaded guilty to one charge of dishonestly receiving stolen property and one charge of possessing prohibited products under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act.

Another charge of possessing such prohibited products was taken into consideration in sentencing.

Mohamad Nor Amali Halmi a 35-year-old Malaysian was sentenced to three weeks’ jail for forgery with another similar charge taken into consideration in sentencing.

This was in relation to forms he handled when documenting prohibited tobacco products that he had confiscated from trainee officers.

AN ‘OPEN SECRET’

The court heard on Friday that Mohan had been employed by Certis Cisco as an enforcement officer since April 2011.

From May 2021 he was deployed to the enforcement unit of the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) under the Tobacco Regulation Branch.

Such officers are given the authority to conduct searches and confiscate prohibited tobacco-related products. They are also deemed to be public servants.

Sometime between June and July 2021 Mohan received among other things 40 packs of vape pods and seven vape devices from another Certis officer named Muhammad Faddley Abdul Wahid from the Tobacco Regulation Branch. These products were estimated to be worth about S$1400.

Faddley along with some other officers had allegedly misappropriated these products from a pool of items confiscated from travellers coming into Singapore via the Changi Airport.

Court documents did not indicate whether Faddley and the officers have been dealt with what they did. He was not among the six charged in October.

The misappropriation of such contraband confiscated tobacco products began sometime in 2021 and 2022 and they were shared among enforcement officers court documents stated.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Hsiao Tien said: “Gradually the sharing of misappropriated items among the Certis officers from the Tobacco Regulation Branch became an 'open secret' or 'unspoken rule' among them.""

She added: “The accused was never deployed to perform the collection duties described above. However he was among the officers who received the misappropriated items.”

FORGED SIGNATURES TO AVOID ‘OFFENDING’ SUPERVISOR

As for Amali — who was also an officer from the Tobacco Regulation Branch under Certis Cisco during the time of his offence — he and a colleague discovered two trainees from Certis Cisco smoking the vape devices on March 7.

Amali and his fellow officer confiscated the items and instructed the trainees to each complete and sign on an offence reporting form acknowledging the forfeiture of the vape devices.

Amali then submitted the forms to his supervisor on the same day. However the forms were mistakenly compiled together with a separate batch of forms and sent to HSA.

When the supervisor could not find the trainees’ forms later she asked for the forms from Amali and sent a few reminders thinking he had not done so.

Amali thought that his supervisor had misplaced the forms that he submitted on March 7 but decided to submit new ones because he ""did not want to offend her” DPP Tan said.

He did this based on the soft copy records he had. However he could not get the trainees to sign them in time for the submission deadline so he forged their signatures instead.

Amali’s offence was uncovered when the four copies of the form were found with the duplicate ones bearing different signatures.

The offence of receiving or retaining stolen property is punishable with a prison term of up to five years or with fine or with both.

For possessing the vape and vape pods Mohan could have been fined up to S$2000.

For forgery Amali could have been punished with a jail term of up to four years or fined or both.

The other four people charged in October received jail sentences ranging from two weeks to three months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvZ2hvc3QtY21zLXZ1bG5lcmFibGUtdG8tY3JpdGljYWwtYXV0aGVudGljYXRpb24tYnlwYXNzLWZsYXcv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxlZXBpbmdjb21wdXRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9zZWN1cml0eS9naG9zdC1jbXMtdnVsbmVyYWJsZS10by1jcml0aWNhbC1hdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbi1ieXBhc3MtZmxhdy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ghost CMS vulnerable to critical authentication bypass flaw,"A critical vulnerability in the Ghost CMS newsletter subscription system could allow external users to create newsletters or modify existing ones so that they contain malicious JavaScript.

Such an action could allow threat actors to perform large-scale phishing attacks from normally harmless sites. Furthermore the injection of JavaScript has been shown to allow XSS vulnerabilities that could enable threat actors to gain full access to a site.

Ghost is a free and open-source CMS for building websites publishing content and sending newsletters used as a speedier and simpler alternative to WordPress.

According to BuiltWith Ghost is used by approximately 126k websites with most of them based in the United States the United Kingdom and Germany.

Targeted remotely

The Cisco Talos team discovered the authentication bypass flaw on October 2022 which they tested and confirmed impacted Ghost version 5.9.4. However it likely affects more versions before and after it.

The flaw is tracked as CVE-2022-41654 and has a CVSS v3 severity score of 9.6 rating it critical.

Newsletter subscribers (members) are external users with no special privileges on the site so they are only required to provide an email address and become members without administrator approval.

However Cisco Talos discovered that an exposed API with an incorrect inclusion of the ""newsletter"" relationship could give subscribers access to that subsystem allowing them to modify or create newsletters.

This includes the system-wide default newsletter that all members are subscribed to by default essentially giving the attackers the power to send out any content they wish to all subscribers.

Post-exploitation user object (Cisco Talos)

A second problem arising from the same flaw is the ability to inject JavaScript into the newsletter which Ghost permits by default assuming only administrators can access this powerful function.

For example the Cisco Talos team leveraged this flaw to inject an XSS (cross-site scripting) object to create an administrator account triggered when the admin attempts to edit the default newsletter.

Example of XSS that creates a new admin account (Cisco Talos)

Along with the above flaw the Talos researchers also discovered CVE-2022-41697 a medium severity user enumeration vulnerability in the login functionality of Ghost allowing an attacker to verify if an email address is associated with a user on the site.

The two vulnerabilities have been addressed by Ghost on the latest version of the CMS so all admins of websites built on Ghost are recommended to apply the available security update as soon as possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vaG93LXRvL2NoYW5nZS1kbnMtc2VydmVyLXdpbmRvd3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Change Your DNS Server in Windows,"The Internet has been our window to the world for many decades now. But as times change we need to ensure that we stay safe online and get the best performance possible from our equipment. So how does DNS (Domain Name Server) play a part in this? By moving away from our ISP-provided DNS server we can gain extra features such as phishing protection DDoS prevention and in many cases a welcome burst of speed.

In this how-to we’ll guide you though changing your DNS server in Windows 10 or 11 and provide you with a list of alternative DNS providers to try out.

What is DNS?

A DNS (Domain Name System) server translates domain names into IP addresses. For example when you navigate your browser to tomshardware.com your request goes out to a DNS server which tells your computer to grab data from 199.232.194.114. There are many different DNS servers and by default you’re likely using one that’s provided by your ISP. However changing which DNS server you use is simple provides additional services such as security and speed and many third-party DNS servers are free to use.

Alternative DNS Servers

The majority of users stick to the DNS server provided by their ISP. This may suit you just fine but there are many alternative DNS services out there. The best approach is to try a few out each having its pros and cons. Your need for greater online security may outweigh the need for blistering speed.

How To Change DNS via the Command Line

Sometimes it is necessary or more convenient to change settings from the Command Prompt. DNS can be easily changed via the netsh (Network Shell) prompt which provides an interactive shell to make changes to wired and wireless interfaces. We’re going to use netsh to change the DNS of our Ethernet interface so that it uses Google’s Public DNS.

1. Open the command prompt as administrator. You can get there by searching for command prompt right clicking and selecting “Run as administrator.”

2. Use the Network Shell command netsh to enter a prompt where the DNS can be changed.

3. List all the interfaces present by entering the following command.

interface show interface

4. Use this command to set the primary DNS server for the interface. Press Enter to make the change. In our example we are setting the Ethernet interface to use the Google Public DNS.

interface ip set dns name=""Ethernet"" source=""static"" address=""8.8.8.8""

5. Type exit and press Enter to close the netsh session. The DNS server has now been successfully updated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9yaG9kZWlzbGFuZC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvbmV3LWJlZGZvcmQtc3RhdGUtcGllci10YWJlcnMtd2hhcmYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taber's Wharf Partners chosen to redevelop New Bedford State Pier - Providence Business First,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/rhodeisland/news/2022/12/23/new-bedford-state-pier-tabers-wharf.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9yaG9kZWlzbGFuZC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvbmV3LWJlZGZvcmQtc3RhdGUtcGllci10YWJlcnMtd2hhcmYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Credit: Photo by K8 on Unsplash.

Singapore’s DBS has secured regulatory approval to buy Citigroup’s retail banking operations in Taiwan reported Focus Taiwan citing the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).

The deal which was first announced in January this year includes the retail banking credit card mortgage and unsecured lending businesses of Citi.

According to the initial announcement subject to customary closing adjustments DBS agreed to pay Citi cash consideration for the net assets of the acquired businesses and a premium of about TWD19.8bn ($617m).

Approximately 3500 consumer bank workers and support staff are anticipated to transfer to DBS Taiwan once the acquisition is complete which is anticipated to happen by August 2023.

In a press briefing FSC Banking Bureau deputy director Lin Chih-chi said that by adding Citi’s 45 locations the deal will increase DBS’s branch network to 74 with around 60% of them being located in northern Taiwan.

Additionally DBS will remove the 66 ATMs currently operated by Citi once the takeover is complete as it does not offer ATM services in Taiwan.

The divesture is part of Citi’s plans to close retail banking business across 14 markets in Asia Europe the Middle East and Africa and Mexico to focus on institutional business.

Last week the US-based banking group said it will close its Chinese retail banking business and the exit is expected to impact some 1200 employees.

It was around 2012 and the man was George Santos a son of Brazilian immigrants who more than a decade later would win a crucial election to Congress.

But on the campaign trail Mr. Santos 34 told a different story about his life: Around the same time that Dish Network records show he was working there he was rising through the ranks at Citigroup in the first step of a lucrative Wall Street career that included a stint at Goldman Sachs.

Neither company could find a record of Mr. Santos’s employment The New York Times reported on Monday in an article that raised other questions about the life and dealings of the new Republican congressman-elect.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvYmFua2Vycy1ob3Blcy1mb3ItMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What bankers hope for and fear in 2023,"Danger looms in 2023 but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to look forward to either.

The 1500 of you who responded to our survey answered questions about your bonus expectations job security fears and even your inflation worries. But these were your big sources of excitement and trepidation for the next 12 months.

Will the Fed pivot?

This is the key question both for markets and for deals. A fed pivot on rate rises could be good for both in the short term.

A JPMorgan vice president in debt capital markets spoke for a lot of people in finance when he said his biggest hope for next year is a “Fed pivot with rate cuts starting late 2023.”

Equally though one macro MD at Morgan Stanley pointed out that the febrile move surrounding Fed decisions has been pretty good for macro traders this year and expressed some apprehension about it possibly coming to an end.

Will my bonus fall? Will I ever be able to buy a house?

Plenty of people were fearful of diminished bonuses and its impact on their spending power in an inflationary world.

A London asset manager who ""saved well through [his] early years"" said he was worried about a ""prolonged recession and house prices."" A Swiss private equity associate told us he was rather hopeful of joining the property ladder but fears ""for friends in less secure well paid industries.""

Some felt they were being unfairly persecuted. A Spanish VP at Citibank was worried about """"banker bashing"" and ""protestors ruining everything"" as he now ""cannot afford to pay rent.

Going back to the office

There were some concerns about being summoned back into the office. One private equity associate earning over $300k was worried about ""not being able to travel enough"" as his days in office rose from one to five.

Others are taking it slow and steady. “I am happy with my job and my lifestyle. I want to improve exposure to other aspects of my role and rise up to leadership position” said one asset management analyst who added that he recently began taking public transport due to rising costs.

Not everyone is so happy. One Credit Suisse director says their greatest hope is that their US business has a “controlled unwind”. His greatest fear? that it ""implodes completely."" A snarkier director this one from technology hopes for the bank won't be ""run by idiots anymore.""

Will we start World War 3?

For as much as bankers spoke of worries regarding monetary and social matters the geopolitical climate was far and away the biggest fear.

Echoing Nouriel Roubini who's been cautioning about the impact of nuclear war on New York City one HSBC VP got straight to the point simply saying his big fear is ""WW3"". A female director in London said she fears ""geopolitical risk"" while a New York VP fears ""escalating wars.""

Others aren't as dramatic. One RBC director declared his hope that Europe will ""stabilize."" A BNP director in Italy said it will be ""difficult to keep up with the politics in a lower revenue world"" but sees 2023 being ""slower""

Beyond looming war COVID is still an issue. A NY MD said he's worried about a ""resurgence.""

First in the “New Member Pictorial Directory” parts of which were obtained by Newsday Opinion comes “Residence” which is listed for Santos as “Long Island.”

It’s a relatively uncommon way for a Nassau or Suffolk County local to explain where they live. Santos’ fellow incoming Long Island members of Congress cite more specific locations in their entries: Island Park for Anthony D’Esposito and Amityville for Nick LaLota.

But that generic location follows a pattern of evasiveness for Santos who has rarely been clear about his Queens or Island addresses.

Next is a line for “Education” which the Santos entry lists as “Baruch College B.S.” a school he has said he graduated from in 2010. The college however has confirmed to multiple media outlets that it was unable to find records of Santos graduating in that year.

Finally Santos’ entry in the directory cites his occupation as “Investor; Businessman.”

It is a relatively broad catch-all that tracks with the vague descriptions he has long given about his work history. His campaign biographies have described him as a “seasoned Wall Street financier and investor with extensive work in capital introduction real estate capital markets bio-tech and ETC.”

He has said he worked at Goldman Sachs and at Citigroup “as an associate and quickly advanced to become an associate asset manager in the real asset division of the firm” though both companies told The New York Times they couldn’t locate records of Santos’ employment.

In a 2020 interview during his first run for Congress Santos told Newsday Opinion that he came from “an investment private equity world” and at the time was on leave from serving as regional director at Harbor City Capital a company which was later accused by the SEC of operating as a Ponzi scheme.

“We were able to fund startup companies we were able to work with entrepreneurs and seed fund projects that would have never seen $1 from anybody” Santos said then.

The unspecific — and sometimes discredited — descriptions of Santos’ work history make it difficult to know exactly what he actually did and what professional requirements those roles would have. But what is clear is that he does not appear to have passed qualification exams administered by FINRA a regulator for securities firms.

The BrokerCheck database for the independent regulator does not include any entries for Santos under various combinations of his names.

Santos did not respond to requests for comment about these biographical details. But he has discussed the exams before according to an individual who worked in the financial and life insurance fields and spoke with Santos in the summer of 2021. The individual told Newsday Opinion that Santos claimed a firm he had worked for had “fudged his credentials” and that “he didn’t need to take any of the Series exams.”

Under fire over various biographical issues the victorious CD3 candidate said this week that “I have my story to tell and it will be told next week.” But more questions continue cropping even about the most basic realities such as if he is a U.S. citizen a constitutional requirement to serve in the House of Representatives. Asked if Democrats had confirmed Santos’ claims that he was born in Queens state Democratic Party chairman Jay Jacobs said they were checking.

“We are trying to verify” he said. “Everything else about him is false.”

Most regions globally experienced a significant increase in citizen access to and adoption of digital government services. The GCC region ranks comparatively high as a digital society with penetration of digital government services among citizens (63%). Asia Pacific citizens continue to increase their uptake of digital services but at a lower rate than GCC while Europe experienced a 4% increase in digital service adoption but still trails behind GCC and Asia Pacific.

The usage levels of digital government services in GCC countries echo global patterns with COVID-related services ranking #1 both regionally and globally in 2022. COVID-related services have emerged as a benchmark for citizen expectations with their fast go-to-market times frequent new feature updates and advanced/mobile functionality (e.g. QR code scanning Bluetooth tracking).

Similar to other regions the GCC offers increasingly sophisticated digital government services with more complex transactions – including registering or conducting a job search accessing COVID services and processing visa residency or work permits. These are increasingly at the top of digital services used by GCC citizens.

High GCC Citizen Expectations Met by Increasingly Strong Government Service Delivery

GCC governments offer superior digital services that broadly meet the high expectations set by their citizens. A net experience (positive experience minus negative experience) score of 79% suggests that the region is succeeding at delivering quality digital government services to its citizens. All three GCC countries surveyed place in the top ten of global net experience scores (Qatar ranks 1st UAE 3rd and KSA 7th). The majority of GCC citizens perceive digital government services as better than those of the private sector in their countries. When asked to compare current government digital services to private organizations 72% in GCC reported government services to be better followed by 42% in Asia Pacific 24% in North America and 21% in Europe. The GCC has a considerable number of state-owned enterprises notably leading to less difference between the public and private sectors given harmonized delivery approach and aligned with quality goals.

This level of satisfaction is particularly significant in light of people’s high expectations. The vast majority of GCC citizens expect their government to provide services comparable to the best private companies in the world or global digital leaders. The finding that a significant portion of the population (41% in GCC) measures digital government service against leaders like Apple Google and Uber means that the GCC governments will need to improve and innovate at pace with global digital leaders to keep up with citizen expectations. We see expectations matched by citizens’ actual experience where the net experience is in the green territory (Exhibit 2).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW5jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2ZveGJvcm9fcmVwb3J0ZXIvbmV3cy9sb2NhbF9uZXdzL2ZveGJvcm8tYmFuay1yb2JiZXJ5LXN1c3BlY3QtaW5kaWN0ZWQtYnktbm9yZm9say1jb3VudHktZ3JhbmQtanVyeS9hcnRpY2xlXzc3MjNhODBmLTlmZWYtNWUxNC05NWE5LTkxNDNjOWZlODRjNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Foxboro bank robbery suspect indicted by Norfolk County grand jury,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Star Correspondent

TA Dugger 45 Hampton 30

After TA Dugger lost to the Sullivan Central MS Cougars an all-Carter County game was set for third place. TA Dugger was able to jump out to a 9-0 early lead in the contest. Molly Wallin was able to do damage inside to jump-start the contest for the Cyclones and Rylee May would hit 3 of 4 free throws in the early going. Hampton would get on the board when McClain would hit a short jumper to put the score at 12-2 at the end of the first.

The Lady Cyclones would continue to find the open person off the Bulldogs press. Londyn Taylor would hit a big three and Molly Wallin would continue her aggressive play inside to push the lead up to 22 at the half. The Lady Bulldogs would show some fight in the second half as they would get their full-court pressure working taking advantage of Lady Cyclone turnovers. Birchfield would get things started for the Bulldogs hitting a running lay-up through a crowd. Daisy Parks would hit a long-distance three-pointer at the 4:32 mark of the third period allowing TA Dugger’s Coach Matt Fox to make a mass substitution. The Lady Bulldogs would take advantage closing the lead down to 10 off a Natalie Nickels jumper. Coach Fox would respond by putting his starters back in at the 1:01 mark of the third period. Lady Bulldogs coach Courtney Hayward would talk about her team’s fight in closing the lead down to 10. “We can’t fold; I told them we are better than this we played the best D we have played in a while; we are small and have to have those traps.”

The fourth period would see the Cyclone push the lead back to 14 as Wallin would grab the offensive rebound and go up through a crowd for the bucket. Hamptons Birchfield would hit an overhand layup to close the Cyclone lead back to 12 but they could get no closer. Shooting/point guard Rylee May would talk about her team’s attitude throughout the game “we passed the ball well and played together well we are always encouraging one another.”

Looking to close the game out Dixie Hartley would hit a bank shot and Molly Wallin a reverse lay-up to push the lead to 16 at 5:06 of the 4th period. Taylor would then hit an 18-foot jumper at 2:21 of the final period to close the door. Jr. Lady Cyclones Molly Wallin would lead the way with 16 while Rylee Ray would chip in 12 while the team would go an impressive 18 of 35 shooting from the field. Reagan May would lead do a lot of the dirty work defensively for her team. For the gritty Lady Bulldogs Mackenzie McClain would help keep her team in it scoring 12 on the night while Danielle Hartley would chip in six. Postgame Coach Fox would speak about his team’s ability to close the door tonight and walk away with the hard-fought win “we got out our wits a little bit but it starts with everybody for the sixth grade to the eighth grade we settled down and settled down we have to play at our level and have confidence in each other.”"

It is not a secret that Lexi Thompson made a career in golf because of her father Scott Thompson. Yes her hard work and passion for golf made her one of the world’s best female players but if not for her father she would have never known about the sport in the first place. And the American had these thoughts in her mind when she penned a sweet message for her dad on a special day.

Father’s Day is special. And who would know it better than the 27-year-old golfer who according to her LPGA Tour profile has won 11 championships with the training she got from her dad. Hence she took her invaluable time to appreciate him last year with a meaningful social media message.

A heartfelt message from Lexi Thompson to her father

People in America among some other countries celebrate Father’s day on the third Sunday of every June. And it fell on June 19 last year. Although Lexi Thompson couldn’t post on the same day she didn’t forget to tweet a day later.

“Happy Father’s Day to my #1 supporter alongside my mom ❤️” the LPGA Tour player wrote on Twitter. “Thank you for everything you’ve done for me and always being there for me!” her tweet further read.

Lexi began golfing at the age of 5and she started playing in competitions a year later. Notably in a Q&A video from her sponsor Bridgestone Golf she revealed that she considers her first-ever win and her major as the most enjoyable victories. And according to her she finds them special because her dad was carrying her bag.

The Thompson men enjoy caddying for the LPGA star

From 2010 when she turned professional the 1-time major champion has changed her caddie more than a few times. And three of them were family.

Scott Thompson used to carry her bag since she was 9 and continued to do so till she got two years of experience as a professional player. “My dad has been there for us as support when we’ve needed it” she once said about Scott according to an LPGA article from 2015. “…encouragement when we’ve needed it; help when we’ve needed it.”

Moreover her two elder brothers Nicholas and Curtis both professional golfers have also caddied for her multiple times. In fact Curtis was on her bag when Lexi won the 2018 CME Group Tour Championship.

The bankruptcy court approved a resolution plan by the Swan Energy-Hazel Mercantile team consortium for Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd (RNEL).The Ahmedabad court Friday gave an oral order approving the resolution plan but a detailed written order is not yet uploaded on the tribunal's website.In March 95% of lenders of RNEL had approved the duo's resolution plan.The winning bidder Swan Energy - Hazel Mercantile team offered a staggered payment of ₹2040 crore while on the net present value (NPV) basis it was ₹1218 crore.Of the ₹2040 crore offered by the duo a sum of ₹1640 crore will be paid over the next five years and the remaining payment will be made from the recovery of certain pending dues. Naveen Jindal owned Jindal Steel and Power was also in the fray to acquire RNEL.On Friday the tribunal also ruled that two separate petitions filed by Reliance Infrastructure and Jindal Steel and Power objecting to the plan submitted by the winning bidder were rejected.Reliance Infrastructure a sister concern of RNEL and Jindal Steel petitioned that the Swan- Hazel team needed to be 29(A) compliant.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) under Section 29 (A) prohibits defaulting promoters or their related parties from submitting a resolution plan. Reliance Infra and Jindal Power had petitioned that Nikhil Merchant who is managing director of Swan Energy had been director till recently of Navi Mumbai Smart City Infrastructure  a company promoted by defaulter Nikhil Gandhi.Separately Reliance Infrastructure submitted a settlement plan under section 12A of IBC which Ahmedabad NCLT rejected in August. Reliance Infra has appealed against the tribunal's order at National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.As per the proposal made by Reliance Infrastructure an ADAG group company lenders would receive ₹25 crore as upfront payment ₹25 crore at the end of the first year ₹50 crore at the end of the second year ₹50 crore at the end of the third year ₹75 crore at the end of the fourth year and ₹2300 crore at the end of the fifth year.Any offer given under section 12 (A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) gives tribunals power to permit withdrawal of an application from insolvency proceedings provided 90% of lenders by value agree to it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2d1cmdhb24vd29yay1vbi13YXN0ZS10by1lbmVyZ3ktcGxhbnQtaW4tZ3VydWdyYW1zLWJhbmRod2FyaS1maW5hbGx5LWtpY2tzLW9mZi9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjQ2ODM4MC5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9ndXJnYW9uL3dvcmstb24td2FzdGUtdG8tZW5lcmd5LXBsYW50LWluLWd1cnVncmFtcy1iYW5kaHdhcmktZmluYWxseS1raWNrcy1vZmYvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NDY4MzgwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Work on waste-to-energy plant in Gurugram's Bandhwari finally kicks off,"GURUGRAM : The construction of a waste-to-energy plant at Bandhwari finally began on Friday in the presence of state urban local bodies minister Kamal Gupta who was in the city for the inaugural ceremony of the project.MCG's waste concessionaire Ecogreen Energy will set up the 25 MW waste-to-energy plant on 10 acres of land in Bandhwari. The first phase will see the building of a boundary wall and a retaining wall to stop sliding of legacy waste and to avoid any hindrance in the construction work.In fact the state government signed an agreement with Ecogreen for setting up the plant for solid waste management for Gurgaon and Faridabad in August 2017.And in December last year Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar laid its foundation stone and set December 2023 as the deadline for the project.Now expected to be operational within two years officials said the plant will use state-of-the-art technology to manage solid waste via two boilers of 750 TPD capacity each and a turbo generator of 25 MW.Emphasising on the importance of solid waste management the ULB minister said ""This plant will prove to be a milestone for proper disposal of waste generated from both the cities of Gurgaon and Faridabad. The waste generated daily will be disposed of in this plant and 25 MW electricity will be generated daily from the waste.""On an average both the cities generate 2100 metric tonnes of solid waste per day which is collected by the company through door-to-door collection and transported to the landfill.Touting this as the country's largest waste-to-energy plant MCG officials said that it will be set up in compliance with the guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board State Pollution Control Board and Solid Waste Management Rules 2016.Ecogreen officials said that the construction got delayed due to unavailability of land and late environmental clearance. ""As per the direction of the nine-member committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal we have started the construction work of the plant"" said Sanjay Sharma deputy CEO Ecogreen.Later in the day Gupta visited the land identified by HSVP in Gurgaon for housing under the Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana to homeless poor families identified through parivar pehchaan patra (PPP).

Beware it’s not for kids,"Bhopal: Amit Jain often buys sugar-free aerated drinks for the family particularly as his daughter is fond of carbonated drinks and takes the “no calories” form of it to keep her weight in check. But a couple of days ago Jain was surprised to read on the can of the drink a warning from the manufacturing company that it’s not recommended for children pregnant and lactating women because the carbonated water contains an admixture of sucralose and acesulfame potassium.“I have been buying cans of sugar-free carbonated drinks for quite some time I never read it myself nor anyone else including the shopkeepers told me about the warning written by the manufacturing company in bold letters"" said Jain who happened to read warning by chance. He checked in other brands of carbonated drinks and found similar results.When he asked shopkeeper whether he knew that the drink is not for consumption of children he said “We thought energy drinks should not be given to children and we do ask children below 14-15 years not to take energy drinks but we didn't have an idea that carbonated drinks should not be given to children.”After reading minutely the text on the energy drinks Jain said that energy drinks have no such warning that it should not be given to children.“Having read the warning now I still don't know whether my 14-year-old can take it or not. I would like her to abstain from drinking it for a few more years but she may continue using it because all her friends drink it and none have any problem with it. I think the age should also be specified when you say children should not be given this drink” said Amit.District food safety officer Devendra Dubey  when asked on the issue said “It's for the consumers to read everything written on the pack of an edible good before using it. The manufacturing company has done its job by warning you and the shopkeeper is not expected to read health warnings and inform all the customers. It is for customers to take safety precautions. It is not only zero calories aerated drinks but a lot many things which are recommended not to be used by a particular group of people. Many people have allergies from soya products or even eggs. It is for them to see that they do not eat these things. It is like checking for the expiry date whether there is a health warning on the pack. It's more important with medicines but in the case of edibles too people should take care to read the text on the pack” he said.He added “The warning is inscribed on the pack in a particular form using a particular font size and it can’t be changed. If it says children the companies must write children. If I am not mistaken medically the age is 14 years till we treat a child as a child for such purposes. But it's for the parents to decide the age of children who are not to be served a particular thing not recommended for children. As far as I am concerned I would only say that if something is injurious to a child it would best not be consumed till the age of 18.”"
KO,Coca-Cola Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpZXIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvd2hhdC1pZi1uZXctY29rZS1oYWQtYmVlbi1hLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtcHJvZ3JhbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What if New Coke Had Been a Government Program?,"On April 23 1985 the Coca-Cola Company made one of the biggest mistakes in American business history: it changed the formula for Coca-Cola. Outraged consumers sent hate mail to Coca-Cola executives and hoarded “The Real Thing.” Coca-Cola executives had done their homework: taste tests revealed that people preferred the taste of “New Coke” and the results suggested the new formula would better position Coke relative to its closest competitor Pepsi. They corrected their mistake pretty quickly and reintroduced the original formula as “Coca-Cola Classic.” New Coke was rebranded as Coke II and ultimately discontinued.

Business history is littered with products like New Coke. The Ford Edsel flopped. Crystal Pepsi comes back in limited-edition runs periodically but all that’s really left of it is its clever use of Van Halen’s song “Right Now” and a memory. No amount of clown-powered corporate muscle could make McPizza the McDLT onion nuggets the Arch Deluxe McCrab McSpaghetti McHotDog chicken fajitas or any of McDonald’s other failed menu items work. People criticize McDonald’s and other fast food outlets for not offering healthier options but it isn’t for lack of trying.

Of course McDonald’s failures have largely been overwhelmed by its successes. One of the company’s most auspicious failures was the Hula Burger. Catholic abstention from meat on Fridays presented a problem for burger restaurant franchisees in areas where there are a lot of Catholics. Eat This Not That reports that McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc put his idea for a meatless Friday option–the Hula Burger which replaced the meat patty with a slice of pineapple–up against Cincinnati franchisee Lou Groen’s idea the Filet-O-Fish in a sales contest. The Filet-O-Fish won handily and took a spot on the menu while the Hula Burger quietly disappeared and was relegated to a long future of “failed fast food menu items” listicles.

The story of the Filet-O-Fish highlights an important truth about a commercial society. It wasn’t a referendum on Catholicism. Entrepreneurs are constrained to serve people based on whatever their preferences happen to be even if they disagree or disapprove. There are Kosher McDonald’s restaurants in Israel and one in Argentina. There are halal McDonald’s restaurants across the Muslim world. McDonald’s dropped halal items in the United States in 2013 after they were sued. Were enough people in the United States to start following Islamic and Jewish dietary guidelines I suspect we would see kosher McDonald’s and the reintroduction of halal McDonald’s items.

All of this has me wondering: what if New Coke Crystal Pepsi and failed McDonald’s menu items had been government programs? The reaction might have been swift (people took to the streets after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade for example) but it probably would have taken a lot longer for these companies to correct their mistakes if they did at all. In the meantime valuable land labor and capital would have been tied up in producing products hardly anybody wanted. They would have been difficult to get rid of because each would have had a vocal constituency trying to protect it (I have fond memories of McDonald’s chicken fajitas and would love to see them return). The government regulators would have been poorly positioned to decide because they would not have faced direct costs or enjoyed direct benefits. In a market economy profits and losses give us pretty reliable guidance as to when we’re using resources wisely or wastefully.

Markets get things very wrong very frequently but they make effective use of decentralized “knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place” and provide very swift easy-to-interpret feedback in the form of profits and losses. There is no analog to a share price or an earnings report to discipline governments and thus “temporary” agencies like the Small Business Administration live on while unambiguous incursions against liberty and wastes of resources like the Transportation Security Administration it seems we will always have with us.

During one of his presidential runs Bernie Sanders asked why we need so many different kinds of underarm deodorant. I suspect that were he to walk around a city like Birmingham or Memphis he might ask “do we really need all these barbecue restaurants?” He might lament the ongoing Chicken Sandwich War launched by Popeye’s in 2019 when the company decided to go head-to-head with Chick-fil-a. Other restaurants like KFC Zaxby’s and now Panera joined the fray and McDonald’s Burger King and Wendy’s reformulated their chicken sandwiches to compete. I can imagine Bernie Sanders lamenting the variety and the resources “wasted” developing and advertising all these new chicken sandwiches. Why not have just one kind of chicken sandwich? Then we could take the resources we’re currently “wasting” making chicken sandwiches and use them to provide universal health care.

This assumes there’s one well-defined “chicken sandwich.” Or soft drink. Or style of barbecue. Or kind of pizza (“why do we need all these different pizza toppings?” I hear Bernie asking). Maybe we’re overwhelmed and stuck in a paradox of choice but this can be solved pretty easily with online shopping and subscription services that delegate the shopping and choosing to other people.

A competitive market rewards people for producing goods and services consumers want at prices that meet or exceed the highest-value alternative uses of everything used to produce them. As of 2022 consumers have voted for various chicken sandwiches and against things like New Coke and Crystal Pepsi. Would our lives be better were land labor and capital still tied up making New Coke and Crystal Pepsi? People have voted pretty overwhelmingly and answered “no.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5kZW1vY3JhY3kubmV0L2VuL2FtYXpvbi1jb2NhLWNvbGEtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWRvbmF0aW9ucy1zY3Jvb2dlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola and Amazon among top firms donating ‘pennies’ to charity at Christmas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5kZW1vY3JhY3kubmV0L2VuL2FtYXpvbi1jb2NhLWNvbGEtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWRvbmF0aW9ucy1zY3Jvb2dlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212250FCA00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

When Fruitopia was introduced in 1994 Coca-Cola shook up its marketing tactics to please a crowd of baby boomers and Generation Xers who were moving away from the fizz of Coke. The carbonated beverage industry was coming undone and alternative drinks were booming in the early '90s (via The New York Times). Coca-Cola launched Fruitopia to milk the trend.

Consumers were exposed to flavors named Citrus Consciousness and Strawberry Passion Awareness through ads that had kaleidoscopic images of fruits moving to the rhythm of trippy new-age music. But despite the $30 million effort to establish Fruitopia in the first year per The New York Times the beverage didn't seemed to perform well. When the scenario didn't improve in the following years Coca-Cola decided that Fruitopia wasn't worth fighting for.

Though phased out from U.S. markets in 2003 as per Atlas Obscura Fruitopia is still available up north in Canada.

JWS’ 10th-ranked recruit in the Class of 2023 Ogden is confident focused and patient. She values her coaches mentors and teammates. She puts in a tremendous amount of work both on the court and in the classroom.

The Stanford-bound guard has everything it takes to become a franchise player at the college level and beyond.

Ogden’s basketball journey began in elementary school. As a third grader she was the only girl to attend the annual Dell Curry Camp in Charlotte N.C. In an interview with Jr. NBA’s Elevate Series she said that despite her best efforts at the camp none of the boys would pass her the ball. Ogden’s parents Christopher and Carla and Dell Curry himself encouraged her to keep working. If she persisted they said she would improve.

The term “Basketball IQ” is regularly thrown around in today’s game to describe athletes who have an elite ability to see plays develop before they unfold and to adapt at a moment’s notice.

Courtney Ogden exemplifies Basketball IQ. As with her commitment to the game she has polished and developed that skill over time.

Sacrifices are never easy but Courtney knows what it takes to be great. @UAbasketball @CourtneyP_Ogden

One influential teacher in Ogden’s life is trainer Dorian Lee the CEO of B’Ball 101 who specializes in player development at all levels. Ogden began working with Lee in elementary school. The talented guard is one of thousands of players who have trained with Lee and his impact is evident in her adaptability on the court.

While training with Lee Ogden also joined an AAU team before she entered fifth grade.

In the state of Georgia there’s a clear choice for young girls looking to improve their game on the AAU circuit: Atlanta-based program Finest Basketball Club. Creator and coach Alfred “Mo” Motton has helped catapult young basketball players to the next level for nearly two decades.

FBC teams have collected hundreds of wins over the years. To play for a program of that caliber and to shine while doing so attracts attention no matter how old you are.

So in the sixth grade just three years after nobody would pass her the ball at the Dell Curry Camp Ogden picked up her first Division I offer from then-coach MaChelle Joseph at Georgia Tech.

That same year she enrolled at the Westminster School in Atlanta where she played for the JV team as an eighth grader and moved up to varsity as a freshman. That season she averaged a double-double while shooting 42 percent from the field. As a sophomore she increased her field goal percentage to nearly 50 percent.

Ogden also excels in her community and in the classroom prioritizing her education off the court. In 2021 she earned her a spot on the inaugural Jr. NBA Court of Leaders a youth leadership council that connects student-athletes with opportunities to develop. In school the senior has studied Mandarin since around the same time she got that first DI offer.

When she gets to college next year Ogden can continue to grow at one of the world’s top universities and on a team that excels at developing guards while regularly vying for titles.

“Courtney is plain and simple a pure and excellent scorer” Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer said after Ogden signed with the program. “She’s a very physical player on both sides of the ball loves to look for her 3-point shot and can knock them down.”

Ogden committed to Stanford in December of her junior year of high school just months after breaking her ankle during the summer. The injury required surgery causing her to miss the beginning of the Westminster season. After making a full recovery Ogden exceeded expectations averaging 18.4 points 6.5 rebounds 2.5 assists 2.3 steals and 1.2 blocks per game that season.

She was named a 2022 GHSA All-Georgia Honorable Mention and GHSA Class AAA First Team selection in addition to leading Westminster to the state semifinals.

Around the same time she was also invited to her first USA Basketball roster tryout. Ogden earned a spot on the roster for the U18 Women’s Americas Championship in Argentina despite being a year younger than most of the other players on the team.

Playing for Team USA is a unique learning experience due to the specific style of play the coaching staff demands. Those who make the roster must demonstrate their adaptability and talent to stick around.

U.S. U18 assistant coach DeLisha Milton-Jones also currently the head coach at Old Dominion describes Ogden as a skilled player with good size at the guard spot.

“Courtney is a triple-level scorer with good handles that allow her to penetrate the rim and finish through traffic” she said.

Ogden and the U18 team entering the Championship on a nine-tournament gold-medal streak won gold again in Buenos Aires. Ogden averaged 2.4 points 3.6 rebounds 2.2 assists and 1.0 steals in 14.5 minutes across five games as the U.S. went 6-0.

She returned to the States and wrapped up her club career this July at the GUAA U17 Championship marking the culmination of more than a decade with FBC.

Though Ogden’s squad fell in the title game after four overtime periods she and her teammates — including Alabama signee Essence Cody UNC signee Reniya Kelly and 2024 standouts Jaloni Cambridge and Zamareya Jones — demonstrated just how effectively FBC prepares and develops its players for the next level.

Ogden continued to shine at the Elite 24 game in Chicago where she put on a show alongside other dynamic five-star recruits.

She was also selected as one of nine athletes — and the only girls’ basketball player — to participate in UA Next’s The Workout. The Workout is an annual performance development weekend at Under Armour’s headquarters designed to push invited participants from a variety of sports through different workouts and activities demonstrating what college athletics has in store.

And now the 1000-point scorer has begun her final season in a Westminster jersey as one of 10 student-athletes named to the 2022-23 Naismith Girls’ High School Player of the Year Preseason Watchlist.

The Westminster Wildcats have started the 2022-23 season 8-4 and resume play in the New Year. Ogden leads the team in scoring (21.3 points per game) rebounds (10.7) and steals (2.5).

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is warning the public to be cognizant of the bad actors this holiday season.

“Know that how we do business with you doesn’t change because it’s the holidays. We may email or text you about programs and services but we will never ask for personal information via email or text” stated the administration in an email on Dec. 18.

The SSA warns that over the holidays scammers tend to target seniors more frequently.

Scammers often pretend to be from social security or other government agencies to gain access to an individual’s personal information.

The SSA notes that the 2023 cost-of-living adjustment is an automatic adjustment and the beneficiary does not need to verify any personal information.

Additionally SSA won’t ask you to provide information or money to make changes to your benefits.

The administration reports that the majority of scams are primarily being conducted over the phone. However email text social media and U.S. mail have also been used.

Here are a few warning signs that you may be dealing with a scammer:

The individual claims there is a problem with your account

They put pressure you to act immediately

They instruct you to pay in a new specific way

Stay aware and keep your finances and personal information safe this holiday season. If you receive a questionable call text or email hang up or don’t respond and report it at oig.ssa.gov/report.

""When you are in those months playing meaningful football it is something unlike any other style of football that exists"" McDaniel said. ""The beginning of the season pales in comparison to that environment.""

The Dolphins and the Green Bay Packers will have that type of experience when they meet on Christmas. Both teams are eyeing the postseason but their scenarios to get there are quite different.

The Dolphins (8-6) will make the playoffs if they win their last three games — or just their last two against division foes New England and the New York Jets. Miami has lost three straight though and wants to begin its playoff push by beating Green Bay.

Standing in their way is four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers.

""We're about to play Aaron Rodgers who has been in the league for years and arguably one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play"" safety Jevon Holland said. ""So what more do you have to focus on? This is a huge challenge especially for me. ... Playoffs are playoffs. I've never been to the playoffs so I wouldn’t know.""

The Packers (6-8) likely need to win their last three games to make the postseason. Even if they win out they're not guaranteed to make it.

""This is a really good football team that we're going against"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. ""Obviously they're very hungry. They've got a lot at stake. We've got a lot at stake and it should be a playoff-type game.""

McDaniel and LaFleur know each other well having worked together as assistants with Houston Washington and Atlanta.

LaFleur said he sees some advantage in playing against a familiar coach.

""I think it leads to some creativity quite honestly"" he said ""because you might see the same concept that you have that gets ran and it's like OK what wrinkle can I throw off of this so I think there's pluses and minuses to everything.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL25jc3RhdGUvZm9vdGJhbGwvY29tbWVudGFyeS1kcmFrZS10aG9tYXMtYW4tbmMtc3RhdGUtYWxsLXRpbWUtZ3JlYXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COMMENTARY: Drake Thomas An NC State Great,"Drake Thomas has produced a college career that merits him being listed among the all-time great linebackers at NC State.

The lineage at the linebacker position runs deep at NC State.

Bill Cowher Robert Abraham Vaughan Johnson Frank Bush Bobby Houston David Merritt Damien Covington Levar Fisher Pat Thomas Manny Lawson Stephen Tulloch Nate Irving Audie Cole Terrell Manning and Germaine Pratt are some of the outstanding linebackers in NC State history since 1980 -- and that is not a complete list of greats during a span that is now into its fifth decade.

Being a Wolfpack linebacker is a serious responsibility. The backer often directs the defense but it also runs deeper. It is about being cognizant of the greats that have worn the red and white (and sometimes black and gray) of NC State.

It is about understanding that there is a high standard for that position group at NCSU but not shying away from trying to lift it to another level and ultimately leaving it in a better place for the successor.

There is a great linebacking heritage at North Carolina State University. Perhaps it is fitting that one of its legends graduated from Heritage High School.

When Drake Thomas made the trek from Wake Forest North Carolina to NC State as a college freshman there was no real way of knowing quite how his college career would turn out. He clearly had the drive and desire but would he have enough of the 'measurables' and could he compensate for any of his perceived size shortcomings no pun intended to play at the ACC?

The answer was yes resoundingly. The motor Drake Thomas possesses has manifested itself not in just the physical or psychological traits of his position but also the mental aspects. Thomas never seems to be misaligned or drifting away from where he is supposed to be and that usually is where the play is to be made.

Obviously Thomas has earned accolades. He has helped the Wolfpack win games.

In the process he has also won the hearts of NC State's fan base.

In what must be the neatest portion of his legacy Thomas gets to share in the maintaining and lifting of the NC State linebacking lineage with his teammates Isaiah Moore and Payton Wilson who also have earned their spots in the Wolfpack linebacker antiquity.

He will also share the experience of being a part of the NCSU football family with members of his own family -- which will be a way of strengthening the link they have together as time goes by.

Thomas is in a Wolfpack brotherhood with his two brothers an NC State family with his own family and a great NCSU linebacking legacy with his linebacker teammates. That must be a fulfillment that words cannot properly express.

With his college career in its final week words can express what he has made of himself at NC State.

Drake Thomas is an all-time great Wolfpacker.

Following the bypass the attackers are able to use the compromised accounts to try and take over cryptocurrency exchange accounts and cloud storage services.

On December 19 Xfinity email users started getting notified of changes to their account information but their passwords were already changed so they couldn’t enter. Those that managed to get back into the account found that a secondary email address was added to the account from a disposable domain yopmail.com.

Bypassing 2FA

The secondary email address is a security measure used by some email providers that help with password resets account notifications and similar.

Many of the victims took to Twitter Reddit and Xfinity forums to discuss what had happened and said that they had 2FA enabled. So whoever was behind the attack managed to guess the password with credential stuffing and then managed to bypass the two-factor authentication security measure. BleepingComputer’s report states the attackers used a “privately circulated OTP (one-time password) bypass” which allowed them to generate working 2FA verification codes.

That gave them access to the account and adding the secondary disposable email account allowed them to perform the password reset process.

After gaining complete control over the compromised email accounts the threat actors then proceeded to breach further online services assuming people's identities to request email resets. Dropbox Evernote Coinbase and Gemini are just some of the services that the threat actors tried to breach.

Xfinity is keeping silent on the matter for the time being but a customer said on Reddit that the firm is aware of the incident and is currently investigating. The same source also said that according to a customer support employee they spoke to the issue seems to be quite widespread.

The National Football League had a streaming service in mind when it was looking for a new home for the rights to its ""Sunday Ticket"" subscription game package. The league got its desired outcome in a deal with Google 's YouTube. Traditional TV networks got what they wanted out of it too. Beginning next season ""Sunday Ticket"" will be offered in two ways through YouTube: either as an add-on to its YouTube TV service a digital TV bundle that mirrors the traditional pay-TV package or a la carte through YouTube's Primetime Channels. YouTube is paying about $2 billion annually for residential rights over the next seven years CNBC reported. The process concluded this week after months of negotiations with potential winners like Apple Amazon and Disney which operates ESPN streaming service ESPN+. While pricing hasn't been determined consumers will likely get more bang for their buck by subscribing to YouTubeTV and adding on ""Sunday Ticket"" which shows out-of-market NFL games on Sunday afternoons. It'll also give them access to nearly all NFL games in one place. Google's YouTube TV bundle includes broadcast stations like CBS Fox and NBC. Fellow tech giants Apple and Amazon don't provide a similar bundle offering with broadcast or pay-TV networks such as ESPN and NFL Network. Sports and particularly the NFL have long been considered the glue holding the traditional TV bundle together. Sports networks and those that offer live games attract some of the highest fees from pay-TV operators and they score some of the highest ratings. The NFL makes large sums for the airing of live games. For this reason executives at longstanding broadcast and pay-TV networks who declined to to be named because they weren't permitted to talk publicly found the deal with YouTube a favorable outcome over Apple or Amazon getting the package. YouTube and the NFL didn't immediately comment.

Long live the bundle

Paramount 's CBS and Fox broadcast weekly Sunday afternoon games. Comcast 's NBC is the home of ""Sunday Night Football"" and Disney  which owns ESPN and ABC holds the rights to ""Monday Night Football."" Each has paid hefty sums for those rights. Last year collectively the four agreed to pay more than $100 billion over the course of 11-year-long packages to air NFL games. For networks like NBC CBS and ESPN they are simultaneously airing NFL games on their fledgling streaming platforms for the audience that has turned away from the pay-TV bundle. All of those games are available through Google's YouTube TV package with the exception of ""Thursday Night Football"" which now streams exclusively on Amazon Prime. ""YouTube in many ways is a very unique and interesting platform"" Dhruv Prasad the NFL's senior vice president of media strategy and strategic investments said on a call with media this week ""because we have chosen a partner that actually supports in many ways our existing distribution with Sunday afternoon and night and Monday night. We actually think this is a model where this will result in a real benefit with existing partners.""

While deals with traditional operators are wildly lucrative for the NFL the league has been open about wanting more streaming partners. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said long before the outcome of the negotiations the league saw a streaming partner as the future of ""Sunday Ticket"" which has only been offered through satellite-TV operator DirecTV since 1994. Although YouTube is streaming only it offers a package that keeps the TV bundle alive – by paying similar rates as typical distributors which has in turn caused a spike in the price of subscriptions. YouTube TV had more than 5.3 million subscribers as of the third quarter putting it above its competitors like Disney's Hulu Live TV+ Fubo TV and Dish's Sling according to data from MoffettNathanson. ""This is a win for YouTube TV as it serves a larger goal for them getting more subscribers. And in the end it helps a package of linear channels"" said sports media consultant Pat Crakes noting YouTube also secured the rights ""at a good price"" to help them bolster their streaming service. Adding another NFL property to the equation to make a TV bundle stickier with customers is a positive for networks executives told CNBC. The streaming business particularly for legacy media companies has most recently been under pressure. While companies raced to form and bulk up their own services trailing Netflix  rabid competition is now weighing on subscriber counts and content costs are soaring. Although streaming remains a priority some media CEOs are rethinking how much content to take away from the traditional bundle and put on streaming.

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.

In an ideal world companies would be supported by the general population. After all the economy of a country defines its standard of living and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all companies provide innovation ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?

Many corporations in the world and especially the bigger ones are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost. Even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more. This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders. Meanwhile employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid not to mention made to work in harsh conditions. Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so they are actually a detriment.

You might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company this is an important fact to consider. However Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier they often compromise on their beliefs.

Another reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.

Story continues

It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns data leaks and its influence on everyone but it still has 2 billion active monthly users and so is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business) public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).

Of course this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed or even increase it. According to PwC itself one of the largest firms in the world mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC it ""describes the stocks of knowledge skills experience health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships institutions shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus it will achieve success quickly. Of course this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.

Speaking of audit firms the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms while taking steps in some countries should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.

You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.

For our rankings of the most hated companies we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street TheStreet.com Bloomberg Business Insider and Fast Company giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America companies which need to work hard to regain public trust starting with number 15:

15. American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG)

American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG) with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.

14. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.

13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.

Number of times mentioned: 2

Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time growing massively over a short period of time. However hatred for Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.

11. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER)

Number of times mentioned: 2

The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.

10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.

9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.

Overall though we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.

8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)

Number of times mentioned: 2

One of the largest banking institutions in America Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes we know it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.

In 2018 Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.

7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)

Number of times mentioned: 2

BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world and in 2010 was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years but we don't think it is material anymore.

6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)

Number of times mentioned: 2

Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.

Those two matchups consisted of seven scoreless innings with six strikeouts May 11 at Comerica Park and six innings of three-run (one unearned) ball with four strikeouts July 21 at Oakland Coliseum; in all he had a 1.38 ERA with 10 strikeouts and one walk over 13 innings against the Tigers.

On Friday the Tigers claimed Logue — a 2017 ninth-round draft pick from Kentucky — off waivers from the Athletics. In a corresponding move right-handed reliever Ángel De Jesus was designated for assignment.

UPDATE:Looking at what's left for Tigers as free-agent market runs dry

Logue was called up for his MLB debut in April 2022 and pitched 14 games (10 starts) for the Athletics producing a 6.79 ERA with 20 walks and 42 strikeouts in 57 innings. He had a 6.20 ERA in 49⅓ innings as a starter and a 10.57 ERA in 7⅔ innings as a reliever.

He also pitched for Triple-A Las Vegas last season registering an 8.12 ERA with 38 walks and 59 strikeouts in 78⅔ innings across 17 starts.

Logue threw four pitches in the majors last season: a four-seam fastball (49.2% of the time) a cutter (21.4%) a curveball (15.8%) and a changeup (13.6%). His fastball averaged 90.1 mph and was crushed by most opponents.

""We didn't respond well to his (arm) angle"" Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said May 11 after Logue twirled his gem at Comerica Park. ""We didn't have multiple at-bats in a row that were productive. It looked like we could get a few things going and then he was in complete control. He did a good job of pitching with the lead by continuing to throw strikes.""

That 9-0 loss was the Tigers' 15th in 18 games at the time dropping them to 9-22 overall. They ended the season with a 66-96 record for fourth place in the American League Central.

""We should be better and we will be better"" Hinch said May 11. ""It feels like it's never going to end because of how long this has lasted. These guys have a track record. I know it's the same questions every night. It's the same curiosities. We have not found solutions. Rather than talk about problems we got to try to find some solutions. The energy was good to start the game and then you could feel a little bit of frustration sink in as we fell behind and then this kid was having his way with us.""

Logue began his professional career with the Toronto Blue Jays.

He was traded to the Athletics in March 2022 with Gunnar Hoglund Kevin Smith and Kirby Snead in exchange for three-time Gold Glove-winning third baseman Matt Chapman.

The Athletics designated Logue for assignment Wednesday upon signing right-hander Drew Rucinski — who spent the past four seasons as one of the best starters in the Korea Baseball Organization — to a one-year $3 million contract.

The Tigers claimed catcher Mario Feliciano off waivers Wednesday from the Milwaukee Brewers. Infielder Andy Ibáñez another member of the Tigers' roster was claimed off waivers in mid-November from the Texas Rangers.

The 40-man roster is full.

It is on track with price increases to wean the ongoing cost pressures. This led to sales growth of 15.2% and 20.2% on a reported and currency-adjusted basis in third-quarter 2022.



Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gained 15.7% in the past three months outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.2%.



Let’s delve deeper

Factors Narrating MNST’s Growth Story

Monster Beverage has been witnessing continued strength in its energy drinks category for a long time. In third-quarter 2022 the Monster Energy Drinks segment's net sales advanced 13% year over year to $1.5 billion. On a currency-adjusted basis net sales for the segment rose 18%. Sales for the company's energy brands including Reign rose 2.9% in the 13-week period ended Oct 22 2022. Sales for the Monster brand improved 11.2% year over year in the quarter.



Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Management is optimistic about strength in the global energy drinks category. It is poised to gain from growth in the Monster Energy family of brands and strength in Strategic and Affordable energy brands.



The company remains committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. In third-quarter 2022 the company launched many products and expanded distribution in international markets. In the quarter it launched Predator in Kazakhstan Malaysia and Jordan along with the continued rollout of Predator in India.



Consequently MNST intends to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the last quarter of 2022 and the first half of 2023.



The company launched Monster Super Cola in a can in Japan in August and Monster Rehab Tea Plus Lemonade in October. In EMEA it launched Monster Assault and Monster Reserve White Pineapple in certain countries. Also MNST introduced Juiced Monarch Juiced Chaotic Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon in a few countries.



The company launched additional SKUs of Burn Predator and Rain in certain countries in the said quarter. In July it introduced its first 16-ounce 12-pack ultra-variety packs in Puerto Rico. In August the company launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and Reserve White Pineapple.



Monster Dragon Tea Lemon was launched in Honduras and El Salvador in August while the same was launched in Guatemala in September. Monster Juice Monarch was launched in August. Its juice portfolio witnessed an expansion in Mexico in August. In Australia the company expanded its Mother portfolio and launched Mother Lava Guava.



The company is on track to launch Monster Energy Zero Sugar in fourth-quarter 2022 initially in the United States. Monster Energy Zero Sugar is developed to provide a zero-sugar variant of its original Monster Energy Green flavor.



MNST revealed plans to launch pure unflavored water namely Monster Tour Water in the United States in still and sparkling variants in the first half of 2023. The company intends to launch Rainstorm in 4 flavors in the first half of 2023. Also Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar Energy Drink is likely to enter select EMEA markets in the fourth quarter of 2022 with a rollout to 20 additional markets in the first quarter of 2023.



The company remained optimistic about the launch of its first flavored malt beverage alcohol product known as ‘The Beast Unleashed.’ Gains from the CANarchy acquisition and a robust line-up of product launches for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks make it well-placed for long-term growth.



MNST has been making efforts to overcome supply-chain challenges. Some of the notable actions taken to navigate through the challenges are decreasing its reliance on imported cans. The company is purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in the United States and EMEA. MNST also rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long-distance freight to meet consumer demand. It is returning to its orbit strategy of producing closer to customers.



Meanwhile Monster Beverage is implementing pricing actions to overcome the ongoing cost pressures. In third-quarter 2022 the company was on track with the mitigation of higher production and distribution costs through pricing actions and lowered promotional expenses. It implemented price increases for its products in the United States on Sep 1 2022. It also brought effective price increases in certain international markets in the third quarter.

Headwinds to Overcome

However the company continues to grapple with inflationary operational costs for aluminum cans shipping freight and other inputs. This along with elevated ingredients and other input costs comprising secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees hurt the margins. The company’s third-quarter 2022 gross margin contracted 460 basis points (bps) to 51.3%.



Operating expenses grew 20.6% year over year to $415.8 million due to higher warehousing and other logistical expenses elevated payroll expenses increased selling and marketing expenses and increased general and administrative expenses. Also operating income of $417.9 million declined 6% year over year driven by a decrease in the gross margin as well as higher operating expenses. The operating margin contracted 580 bps to 25.7% in the reported quarter. Consequently third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of 60 cents per share declined 3.9% year over year.

Conclusion

Monster Beverages appears to be in good shape despite the industry challenges driven by the introduction of innovative products across the Monster family to suit consumers’ needs as well as strength in its energy drinks category. Topping it a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.4% raises optimism about the stock. Also the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has moved up 0.9% in the past 60 days.

Further the leading upstream energy firm carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is likely to record earnings growth of 134.4% in 2022.

Factors Working in Favor

West Texas Intermediate crude price trading at more than $75 per barrel is extremely favorable for upstream activities. Being a leading exploration and production company globally ConocoPhillips is well-positioned to capitalize on handsome crude prices. ConocoPhillips has a strong footprint in prolific oil-rich plays like the Permian Basin Eagle Ford and Bakken brightening up the company’s production outlook. For 2022 the company expects production at 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoE/D) suggesting an improvement from 1.6 MMBoE/D for 2021

COP is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. Apart from increasing quarterly ordinary dividend by 11% ConocoPhillips also lifted its share buyback authorization by $20 billion.

Risks

Being an upstream energy player the overall operations of the company are strongly exposed to volatility in oil and natural gas prices. Moreover significantly increasing expenses related to purchased commodities are hurting its bottom line.

Stocks to Consider

Some better-ranked players in the energy space are Phillips 66 PSX Precision Drilling Corporation PDS and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. NEX. All the stocks carry a Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

To make its operations more stable Phillips 66 is giving more attention to midstream (pipelines) renewables and chemicals businesses. It also has strong refining operations.

Precision Drilling is a well-known name in the energy space for offering its clients access to an extensive fleet of Super Series drilling rigs. Its services also include offering well-service rigs. With high commodity prices demand for PDS’ drilling rigs is favorable.

NexTier Oilfield Solutionsis also a well-known U.S. land oilfield service player. With higher exploration and production by upstream companies demand for NexTier Oilfield’s diverse set of well completion and production services is handsome.

Church in Bulls Head a 9000-square-foot section of parking lot is generally inactive. Used for overflow parking and sometimes shared by several bordering schools as a port of retreat during fire drills and other emergency evacuations the space is appropriately obscure idle and undeveloped. But if a hotly debated approval process is green-lighted and a special zoning permit allowed the practically unused corner of land would be transformed into a lithium-ion battery storage facility which will accumulate electrical energy and take pressure off the local grid when it is overly stressed.

Residents school administrators and church parishioners are not taking the possible conversion lightly.

“We are proactively addressing this issue because we are not comfortable with the idea of these units -- which are not yet time-tested for fire safety and toxic emissions -- being located 100 feet from our school” noted Gina DeSantis president of Moore Catholic High School which has recently launched a campaign against the battery energy storage system (BESS) development.

DeSantis said she learned about the proposed project last month after a school security guard witnessed a woman taking pictures of the school campus.

‘WHAT I LEARNED WAS DISCONCERTING’

“She said her company was launching an energy installation project on church grounds. So I researched and called every person involved -- if it’s going to be installed next to my campus I want to know all of the details” DeSantis said. “I didn’t like that this was shrouded in secrecy and what I learned was disconcerting.”

According to information obtained by DeSantis from New Leaf Energy the company developing the project the proposed BESS facility would consist of six large-scale rechargeable lithium-ion battery systems manufactured by Tesla. The information also outlined that each can store up to 20 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity and the intent of the project is for Con Edison to store energy produced during periods of low demand (e.g. at night) and then draw power from the facility when demand peaks.

The proposed energy site would be located in a 9000-square-foot section of this parking lot. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma-Hammel)

“Between the charging and discharge cycles the stored energy would sit unprotected in a church parking lot -- not in an industrial location as required by applicable zoning” DeSantis noted in a Nov. 22 letter to Community Board 2 stating her opposition to the project.

“Although its proponents claim their project is not a threat to the community they tried to keep the neighborhood uninformed of their plans” the letter continued. “Now that the details of this project have come to light it is clear that there are numerous reasons why the application should be denied … the most important reason is the safety of the children who attend the six schools that encircle the proposed project.”

Bulls Head residents have rallied around DeSantis’ crusade to halt the endeavor. New Leaf Energy which was founded in July 2022 issued a statement to dispel their concerns.

SAFETY A ‘TOP PRIORITY’

“It is important that the community understands that the safety of local residents is our top priority for this project. This includes our neighbors in nearby schools and local businesses” noted Corina Solis project developer at New Leaf Energy. “We only work with reputable battery manufacturers who adhere to the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) code and requirements and are approved for use in New York City by the FDNY. The safety protocols involved in installing battery storage systems include third-party testing certification and FDNY review of the fire safety of the full battery system ventilation and exhaust fire alarm and detection fire suppression remote monitoring and communication ....”

Solis also noted that a dedicated technology management team within the FDNY reviews individual models of battery technologies before installation on the project even begins.

“The potential for fire is extremely low and the systems are designed and tested to fail safely” she said. “Residents can rest assured we’re working with retired and current members of the FDNY to ensure the highest level of project safety. There will be secure fencing surrounding the equipment as an additional safety measure. The system will be locked and monitored by remote and central monitoring and CCTV. The fencing will block the line of sight to the public.”

But members of the community said they are not satisfied with that response.

“They say it’s 99% safe but what about that one percent?” said Dennis Quirk who works closely with the Seton Foundation’s Bishop Patrick V. Ahern High School a private special education program for students ranging from 14 to 21 years of age that also borders the site. “This should be located on a commercial property somewhere that is not in close proximity to the children. That one percent is too much when you’re dealing with kids. The safety of our children is paramount.”

Other schools near the site include: New World Preparatory Charter School also on the Moore Catholic campus; PS 60 located at 55 Merrill Ave.; Children At Play Preschool 40 Merrill Ave.; Hellenic Classical Charter School 1641 Richmond Ave.

OUTCRY FROM PARISHIONERS

And parishioners of Our Lady of Pity said they are enraged by the church’s lack of communication regarding this matter.

“The pastor didn’t loop anyone in” one parishioner said requesting anonymity. “He brokered this deal and the parishioners and trustees were left in the dark. This is a residential area and we have all of these schools. Who needs this system to be installed here?”

Citing fire danger and air toxicity the parishioner also questioned what will happen if such systems eventually become obsolete.

“Are we stuck with these units then? Do they just sit idle and become an eyesore?”

A small group of Our Lady of Pity churchgoers has launched a grassroots initiative to combat the site handing out flyers and going door-to-door with informational sheets on the project.

“If it’s so safe then why is it a big secret?” one Bulls Head resident asked. “There is no transparency and that’s unacceptable.”

Residents parishioners and school administrators say the parking lot which borders Moore Catholic High School is an inappropriate location for such a facility. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma-Hammel)

The Advance/SILive called the rectory to inquire about parishioners’ concerns and the church declined to comment. When asked about the validity of the community’s apprehension New Leaf simply stressed the importance of the work.

“Blackouts during the hottest days of the summer have impacted this community for years and can be highly disruptive to everyday life and local business” Solis said. “Our battery storage project will improve the quality of life for residents by reducing or eliminating the frequency of brownouts and blackouts throughout the summer.”

The proposed project is not the only one of its kind in Staten Island. A lithium-ion battery storage unit is currently being built on Giffords Lane in Great Kills. Its developer NineDot Energy said it should be operational and ready to harvest energy by 2023. And according to Frank Morano chair of Community Board 3 an application seeking to install an identical BESS unit at 405 Arthur Kill Rd. adjacent to Holtermann’s Bakery was recently rejected.

“We do have major concerns about these units” Morano said. “We see on the news that litihium-ion batteries easily catch fire and we know that those particular fires are extremely hard to put out. Toxic chemicals are also at play. There are too many issues so our final decision was to deny recommendation.”

Paul Rogers and Nick Petrakis owners of Energy Safety Response Group who were hired by New Leaf to articulate the safety and compliance of this project said that many of the community’s concerns are misguided.

“Most of the fires that you see on the news are because of counterfeit consumer products” Rogers said. “These systems are an entirely different entity.”

SAFETY CHECKS

Rogers and Petrakis both retired NYC firefighters work with companies across the country doing safety checks to ensure that these battery storage sites are compliant. The pair noted that New York state and city codes for these systems are exceptionally strict.

“There are always hazards and risks associated with energy storage in general” Petrakis said. “But New York City is strict in its requirements. The number of safety measures these technologies must pass just to be installed is considerable.”

According to Rogers and Petrakis the equipment proposed for Bulls Head endured “full scale 9540A” testing in which an overcharge was simulated and normal system protections were removed to see how the BESS would fare.

“The 9540A test which measures the fire safety hazards within battery systems replicates the worst-case scenario” Rogers said indicating that the units were pushed to their limit and no fire was observed. “You can’t ever say that equipment is 100% infallible but the way this system survived this very rigorous test is strong proof of its safety.”

A spokesperson for the FDNY said the project is still under review.

“The stationary energy storage installation is the subject of a Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA) application” the spokesperson said. “The department will fully review the application and meet with the applicant before making a recommendation to the BSA.”

Con Edison which is the beneficiary of this citywide battery storage push said it has no role in choosing site locations.

“Energy storage has a huge role to play in New York’s renewable energy future” the utility company said in a statement. “Well-sited battery projects can strengthen the reliability of our electric delivery system while helping to maximize the use and value of renewables. Through our Clean Energy Commitment Con Edison has pledged to support the development of 1000 megawatts of energy storage in our service area by 2030 the vast majority of which will be owned by our customers. Aside from a handful of examples specific project locations are chosen by other parties not by Con Edison. Our focus is helping to nurture the battery storage market and providing incentives where appropriate.”

NEXT STEPS IN THE PROCESS

Concerns about this project were brought before Community Board 2 and a Land Use Public Hearing was scheduled for Jan. 3 to address the issue but has been postponed.

According to Councilman David M. Carr (R-Mid-Island) the project is currently going through a process of consideration with the BSA seeking a special permit for a Battery Energy Storage System.

“This entails a hearing before the relevant Community Board which in this case is Community Board 2” Carr explained. “The CB’s vote is advisory and not binding.”

Additionally Carr said there are reviews and sign-offs required by the New York City Department of Buildings and the New York City Fire Department. Finally there will be a hearing and vote on the project by the BSA itself.

“I believe that New Leaf which is the company that is the project developer should actually be doing additional community engagement including a presentation in Bulls Head about the project in addition to any appearance they make at the Community Board” Carr said. “Previously constructed energy storage facilities of this type have not been built in residential neighborhoods and I think it’s incumbent on New Leaf to explain why they believe this site -- which is adjacent to a residential community -- is appropriate. I have also reached out to the Fire Department which is only just beginning their review process. Given all this they have a steep burden of proof in making their case to residents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L3dpbnRlci1zdG9ybS1wb3VuZHMtYnVmZmFsby13aXRoLXJlY29yZC1zbm93ZmFsbC1hdC1sZWFzdC0zLWRlYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winter storm pounds Buffalo with record snowfall at least 3 dead,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nypost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/12/24/winter-storm-pounds-buffalo-with-record-snowfall-at-least-3-dead/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226D2CFA0>, 'Connection to nypost.com timed out.

The rapid succession of events was matched by consumer interest as retail dollar sales of energy drinks grew 10.3% to over $17.55 billion dollars in the 52-weeks ending December 3 according to NielsenIQ.

In case you lost track of time here is the year in energy.

Monster Inches Towards Alc Space and ZOA Sets the Stage

The year got off to an exciting start when Monster sent warning of its alcohol ambitions to the industry with its $330 million acquisition of CANarchy in January and although a rumored merger with alcohol conglomerate Constellation Brands never came to be the company would later make good on its “hard” interests in the fall.

Meanwhile Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Molson Coors’ plant-based energy play ZOA was busy making headlines over the first four months of 2022 landing a $10 million line of credit with Gerber Finance in February when it was sold in over 40000 stores nationwide and setting an ambitious expansion plan for the year targeting 100000 accounts by 2023. The company quickly followed that news with a string of new innovations to roll out throughout the Spring including pre-workout line ZOA+ and smaller 12 oz. slim cans for its core line.

Also in April Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) backed performance energy player A SHOC closed a $29 million Series B round which sought to bring “new blood” into the brand with a roster of pro athlete investors including this year’s MLB record breaker Aaron Judge.

GHOST Partners with FaZe Clan

GHOST a lifestyle energy and supplements brand supported by an exclusive Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB) distribution deal has been among the fastest growing energy drink brands of the year. Since its launch in 2016 much of the brand’s marketing has long centered around digital campaigns built around gaming culture and in May GHOST moved to cement its place within the esports world by signing a multi-year cross-channel sponsorship agreement with FaZe Clan.

The deal also marked the end of a 10-year relationship between FaZe Clan and gamer-focused energy brand G Fuel which had produced numerous co-branded products over the course of their sponsorship agreements. But G Fuel wasn’t left hanging – the company announced a long-term partnership with esports org Sentinels in April and made a leap to the IRL sports realm via a deal with Phoenix Suns small forward Mikal Bridges.

Bang’s Big Break-Up

Vital Pharmaceuticals (VPX) CEO Jack Owoc “brought the Bang” to the stage at in June BevNET Live Summer 2022 in New York for a stand-up interview in which he took shots at rivals like Monster and CELSIUS lamented his company’s ill-fated distribution deal with PepsiCo and urged entrepreneurs to employ “discipline effort [and] sacrifice” to win in the beverage business and overtake the established leaders.

Owoc gave the talk in light of an April court ruling ordering Bang to pay $175 million in damages to family-owned beverage brand Orange Bang and Monster as well as a 5% royalty on all future sales of Bang in a trademark infringement lawsuit. On stage Owoc dismissed the order as “the false ruling of a rogue arbitrator who has no background in science.” That ruling would soon be confirmed by an arbitration judge in July leaving the company also responsible for an additional $10 million in court and attorneys fees.

Only a week later Bang formally ended its exclusive partnership with PepsiCo after a year-and-a-half of tension lawsuits and sales declines. Owoc told BevNET at the time that he was “appreciative” of the experience and immediately set out to rebuild the brand’s DSD distribution network by seeking out past partners including multiple AB houses.

Also in June Super Coffee made a foray into the energy drink space with a test launch of its new Super ENRGY line in select stores in Texas.

Pepsi Picks Up CELSIUS

PepsiCo didn’t spend much time mourning its failed deal with Bang. On August 1 the conglomerate announced a $550 million investment and exclusive distribution agreement with performance energy brand CELSIUS. The deal sees the Florida-based brand moving nearly all of its retail and foodservice distribution over to blue trucks with some carve outs for select partners such as Big Geyser in New York.

CELSIUS CEO John Fieldly said the deal would allow for “immediate scale” and will increase its distribution footprint by 40% by August 2023. PepsiCo also received an 8.5% ownership stake in the brand in the form of convertible preferred stock.

Monster Wins False Advertising Suit

Monster dealt an even bigger blow to Bang in September when a jury found Bang had violated the Lanham Act by wrongfully marketing its “super creatine” supplement as a functional ingredient. The court ordered Bang to pay another $293 million in damages. The brand later said it will remove the phrase “Super Creatine” from its cans.

PepsiCo also made another move into the category this time via the Gatorade brand with the announcement of Fast Twitch a new hydrating energy drink launching in partnership with the NFL. Players have exclusive access to the drink during the 2022-23 season with a bigger mainstream launch expected to come in the new year.

Bankruptcy The Beast and a Pioneer’s Passing

The mounting legal fees and costs of the PepsiCo separation led Bang to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. While the brand had built its DSD network out to 269 partners nationwide distribution disruptions led to declining sales. The company received $100 million in loans to support the business during the restructuring process and Owoc projected confidence in the announcement stating “I know we will successfully emerge from this process as a stronger company.”

Meanwhile Monster made good on its alcohol ambitions with the launch of The Beast Unleashed a new malt beverage line with 6% ABV set to roll out in January.

Also in October KDP took its energy prospects international by partnering with Red Bull for a strategic partnership in Mexico. While that news represented a big opportunity for Red Bull the brand – and the beverage industry – would be struck later in the month by the announcement that co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz had died at the age of 78. The Austrian entrepreneur is widely credited with mainstreaming the modern energy drink category in western countries and helped establish a brand association with extreme sports.

KDP Partners with C4

KDP secured its foothold in the energy drink market in December through an $863 million investment and distribution agreement with C4-producer Nutrabolt taking a 30% stake in the company. C4’s ready-to-drink energy line introduced in 2018 has experienced rapid growth over the past year as retail dollar sales rose 140.4% to $299.2 million in the 52-weeks ending November 19 per NielsenIQ.

While the move locks up one of the last major beverage strategics without a stake in a major energy brand it creates a new opening for DSD distributors who once again have a void to fill. That could mean even more opportunity in 2023 for independent brands like Alani Nu – which is already one of the fastest growing performance energy products with national distribution and has helped drive more female consumers into the category – or offer an opening for smaller players and recent launches such as RYSE Fuel Rowdy Energy and Juvee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3RoZXJlYWxkZWFsLmNvbS9taWFtaS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2NyYWlnLXJvYmlucy1mb3J0LXBhcnRuZXJzLWFuZC1xYXRhcmktaG90ZWwtZmlybS1idXktYXBvbGxvLXNpdGUtaW4tbWlhbWktZGVzaWduLWRpc3RyaWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Craig Robins Fort Partners Constellation Plan Miami Project,"A powerhouse team plans a mixed-use development on a Miami Design District assemblage purchased from Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance sources told The Real Deal.

The buyers and seller declined to confirm the price but sources said it is about $170 million.

The purchasing partnership includes the Qatari firm Constellation Hotels Holding developer Nadim Ashi’s Fort Partners New York-based private equity firm Raycliff Capital and Miami Design District Associates. It is buying more than 2.5 acres in the high-end retail and dining district.

The buyers are expected to announce their plans next year. The project would likely include a hotel sources said.

The 15 buildings run along Northeast 39th and 40th streets from North Miami Avenue to Northeast First Avenue. RedSky and JZ Capital lost the portfolio to Apollo last year. Apollo along with commercial broker and developer Michael Comras planned to bring in Restoration Hardware but that deal blew up this year.

Miami Design District Associates is a partnership between Craig Robins’ company Dacra L Catterton Real Estate and Brookfield Properties. Greenwich Conn.-based L Catterton is backed by the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Fort Lauderdale and Miami-based Fort Partners owns all of the Four Seasons properties in South Florida. The firm developed the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences at The Surf Club in Surfside where a resale set a record for condo sales on a per-square-foot basis earlier this year. It also developed the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences Fort Lauderdale.

Apollo is providing seller financing ranging from about $100 million to $125 million executives said on a recent earnings call.

RedSky and JZ had spent $236 million to assemble the properties which consist of small retail buildings in 2015 and 2016.

RH the high-end home furnishings retailer previously known as Restoration Hardware had sued Apollo and Comras over a deal to lease a portion of the assemblage alleging that their landlord didn’t own up to its end of the deal and wanted to push RH out. The lawsuit was settled in September once Apollo had a sale in place to this buyer group sources said.

Robins has led the development of the Miami Design District into a luxury retail mecca that’s home to dozens of major designer brands including Chanel Tiffany & Co. Bottega Veneta Gucci Fendi Prada and Saint Laurent as well as high-end restaurants.

Earlier this year Miami Design District Associates revealed plans to develop its first Class A office building called The Ursa though others are in the works in the neighborhood. The 15-story office building is planned for the site at 30 Northeast 39th Street across the street from the Apollo assemblage.

It’s unclear if the latest project will mark the first ground-up hotel in the district.

WASHINGTON D.C. Terran Orbital has delivered 10 satellite buses for use in the Space Development Agency's mesh network in low-Earth orbit (LEO) the company announced in a statement.

Prime contractor Lockheed Martin won a $187.5 million contract from the SDA to provide 10 communications satellites for the Transport Layer Tranche 0 and Terran Orbital was subcontracted to deliver the satellite buses the statement reads. The purpose of the satellite constellation is to provide secure high-bandwidth low-latency data links for military users.

Terran Orbital will also be the bus supplies for the Transport Layer Tranche 1 ""a much larger constellation of satellites made by Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and York Space"" the statement reads.

The Tranche 0 satellites are scheduled to launch in June 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kYXJrLWNsb3Vkcy1zaWx2ZXItbGluaW5ncy1maXZlLXdheXMtd2FyLWluLXVrcmFpbmUtaXMtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLXRoZS1zcGFjZS1kb21haW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dark clouds silver linings: Five ways war in Ukraine is transforming the space domain,"Russia’s flouting of international order set in motion a realignment with near medium and long-term implications casting dark clouds over the global space community but also revealing some silver linings.

The ongoing war in Ukraine has accelerated the U.S. Defense Department and intelligence community’s embrace of commercial satellite communications and Earth observation. Nations around the world taking note of the commercial contributions have backed domestic space startups and forged relationships with existing satellite service providers.

Satellites coupled with NATO weapons systems have helped Ukraine mount a formidable defense. On the diplomatic side public dissemination of satellite imagery has stymied Russian disinformation operations and helped document war crimes and atrocities.

The war’s impact has been equally profound on the launch side.

While Russia’s self-inflicted exile has proved a nuisance for space companies depending on Russian hardware Russia’s most important space exports before the invasion were launch vehicles.

With Russia’s Soyuz sidelined possibly permanently Europe is reckoning with gaps in its ability to deploy and maintain vital space infrastructure without outside assistance. Near term that’s meant the European Space Agency and the European Union are pivoting from Russian dependence to U.S. dependence a la SpaceX.

Commercially the loss of Soyuz trade embargoes and Russian missile strikes on Dnipro’s Yuzhmash factory fed the supply chain dumpster fire that’s slowed constellation deployment.

The International Space Station is one of the few Russian-involved international endeavors to carry on business-as-usual post invasion. Other civil and commercial space programs haven’t fared as well.

The termination of Soyuz launch contracts stranded more than a dozen non-Russian satellite missions.After an eight-month pause OneWeb resumed launching satellites for its broadband constellation in October on India’s GSLV Mark 3 rocket. A second Indian launch and three SpaceX Falcon 9 flights are lined up to help OneWeb complete its first-generation global constellation.

The European Space Agency also had to find new space transportation.

ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover was scheduled to launch in September 2022 on a Russian Proton rocket and descend to the Martian surface in 2023 on a Roscosmos-built landing platform. With European and Russian cooperation severed ESA has drafted plans for a European descent vehicle making it unlikely the ExoMars mission will launch before 2028.

Other missions slated for Soyuz have had an easier time regrouping.

Two pairs of Europe’s Galileo navigation satellites have signed up for rides in 2023 on Arianespace Ariane 6 rockets.

Falcon 9 rockets are scheduled to transport ESA’s Euclid cosmology mission to Earth-sun L-2 Lagrange point next year and ESA’s Hera mission to Dimorphos the asteroid struck by NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirect Test in 2024.

Meanwhile Europe’s Vega-C rocket is now slated to launch ESA’s EarthCARE Earth science mission in early 2024.

Before the Russian invasion ESA and Roscosmos were planning a trio of lunar exploration missions which have now been scrapped.

The war and Western sanctions have forced nations to choose between partnering with the West or Russia. Lacking western partners Russia has more closely aligned itself with China and forged a pact with Iran that led to the August launch of an Iranian remote-sensing satellite on a Soyuz rocket.

2. EUROPE’S WAKE-UP CALL

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a wake-up call for Europe’s space sector.

ESA the European Union and individual nations have spent the last 10 months dismantling programs with Russian involvement and fostering domestic capabilities.

“We have to focus on ensuring full European autonomy in space as well as investing more in commercial growth areas” Géraldine Naja the European Space Agency’s director of commercialization industry and procurement said in November at the Space Tech Expo Europe in Bremen Germany.

To bolster European autonomy the ESA member states approved a 16.9 billion euro budget ($17.5 billion) over three years at the Ministerial Council Meeting in November about 16.6 percent more than the spending plan approved in 2019.

“We must take bold decisions today. As I’ve said before we must invest in the future because we are in a crisis” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said in the leadup to the budget vote.

The European Parliament and European Union member states also agreed to contribute 2.4 billion euros toward a six billion euro campaign with ESA to establish a satellite communications constellation called IRIS2 for Infrastructure for Resilience Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite.

“The efforts and energy made at [the] European level to move this initiative forward at record speed also reflect in my view the importance of IRIS² in an increasingly contested geostrategic environment” Thierry Breton European Union commissioner for the internal market said in a Nov. 17 blog.

Meanwhile efforts to bolster funding for European startups already underway before the invasion have snowballed.

The European Commission European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund have pledged to invest one billion euros over five years in early-stage European space and Earth-observation companies through the Cassini fund.

3. SATELLITES IN THE CROSSHAIRS

Just a few days into the conflict Ukraine’s Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Federov reached out via Twitter to Elon Musk asking SpaceX’s boss to provide Ukraine with Starlink satellite internet antennas which Musk shipped right away.

That did not go over well with the Russians. Konstantin Vorontsov deputy director of the Russian foreign ministry’s department for non-proliferation and arms told a United Nations committee meeting that Starlink although a commercial system providing internet services “might no longer be considered purely civilian” and would be considered a military target.

The aggressive rhetoric can’t be brushed aside given Russia’s demonstrated anti-satellite weapons capability. If Ukraine for example uses Starlink for military command and control “these satellites would become legitimate military objectives for Russian forces” noted U.S. Air Force Academy law professor Lt. Col. Timothy Goines.

Commercial remote sensing satellites that tracked Russia’s pre-invasion moves and galvanized the West in support of Ukraine also have drawn Putin’s ire.

“The Russians saying commercial space is fair game I think that’s huge” said Scott Herman a former DigitalGlobe and BlackSky executive. “We are entering uncharted waters that no one actually understands or knows what are the actual legal implications.”

Shooting a satellite down would be the extreme and less likely scenario. More plausible are cyber or jamming attacks where attributing responsibility is much harder.

In such scenarios what constitutes an act of war and how the U.S. or NATO should respond are “unanswered legal questions right now” Herman said.

These developments led the Pentagon to consider adding indemnification provisions in future contracts to compensate commercial companies if their satellites were attacked while supporting the U.S. military in a conflict.

“This has significant business implications because most satellite insurance policies do not cover acts of war” Herman said.

Commercial operators optimize their satellites for efficiency and to generate revenue not necessarily for resiliency during war. So the government providing some type of indemnification is a “a pretty good answer” Herman said.

Speaking at a recent space investment conference a top U.S. congressional appropriations staffer said he expects this issue to gain more attention.

Ukraine showed the value of commercial satellites said William Adkins professional staff member of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee.

“But the flip side of that is the degree to which commercial assets can become targets” Adkins said. “That’s both a policy issue and a technical issue to think through in the future as other conflicts are certainly going to come down the road.”

4. IMAGERY ANALYSIS GOES MAINSTREAM

One of the most searing images of Russia’s invasion — a huge military convoy stretching more than 65 kilometers northwest of Kyiv — was taken by one of Maxar’s WorldView satellites.

The use of satellite images to shape the narrative of this war is the work of the Maxar News Bureau an organization that has worked in relative obscurity for years.

Earth-observation company Maxar which operates four high-resolution imaging satellites created the news bureau in 2017 to leverage its satellite imagery and analysis for social good and global transparency. It built relationships with trusted media organizations worldwide and provided visual content at no cost to support their reporting.

“High-resolution satellite imagery and analytics are a powerful complement to good journalism providing indisputable truth at a time when credibility is critical” the company said in a 2018 news release.

Over the past few years Maxar’s imagery exposed the displacement and killing of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar; provided evidence of human trafficking and illegal fishing; monitored the growth of refugee camps in Uganda; chronicled the physical toll of wars in Iraq and Syria; and revealed the devastation of numerous natural disasters.

The bureau started monitoring the buildup of Russian forces and hardware along the Ukrainian border months before the invasion started in February 2022. Maxar’s bureau staff and news organizations every day aggregate and analyze thousands of images to identify newsworthy activities happening in Ukraine including revelations of war crimes and human rights violations.

Maxar is first and foremost a commercial business. Its Earth imaging generates about $1.1 billion a year in revenue about two-thirds of that from U.S. government contracts. But the Ukraine war cemented the role of the news bureau in promoting global transparency and combatting the spread of disinformation.

5. COMMERCIAL SPY SATELLITES SHINE

Maxar’s ubiquitous images of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine paved the way for other players in the commercial remote sensing industry to showcase their capabilities demonstrating the value of unclassified intelligence that military agencies can share globally.

Companies like BlackSky and Planet have followed in Maxar’s footsteps providing electro-optical imagery to the news media. Commercial synthetic aperture radar imagery from Capella Space and Iceye also has seen higher demand as radar penetrated heavy cloud coverage over Ukraine. Radio-frequency data providers like HawkEye 360 and Spire Global used satellites to track Russian GPS jammers.

Commercial electro-optical imagery has opened the door to these other geospatial services said Amy Hopkins Capella Space vice president and general manager of government services.

The crisis in Ukraine has helped “make us that much more capable” in figuring out how information can be collected analyzed and delivered Hopkins said.

Companies like Maxar helped the rest of the industry by making the U.S. government customer “comfortable with the concept of buying commercial capabilities” said HawkEye 360 CEO John Serafini.

Herman the former BlackSky executive said Ukraine has helped put companies on the map although that doesn’t necessarily guarantee sales or government contracts.

“A conflict like this actually helps you develop meaningful use cases and scenarios that you can then use to illustrate the value of your product” he said.

Companies that have demonstrated their capabilities in Ukraine “can take it to the market and investors and say ‘here’s all the stuff we were doing” Herman said. Wars and natural disasters are painful “but one of the silver linings is that it really helps us test our capabilities and build demonstrable use cases that help us sell in the future” he added.

Friday December 23

Let’s start the week at the top of the Messier catalog: M1 more famously known as the Crab Nebula is rising in Taurus at sunset. Wait for full dark then swing your scope just over 1° northwest of 3rd-magnitude Alheka which marks the tip of the Bull’s easternmost horn. In such a dark sky even a 3-inch scope should net the Crab for you. (Though if you can manage it larger telescopes will make this object easier to find by gathering more of its light.) Shining at magnitude 8 the Crab stretches about 6′ by 4′ oriented northwest to southeast and has a relatively high surface brightness. Despite the amazingly detailed pictures you may be used to seeing though don’t expect too much from your telescope. You’ll likely see an oval-shaped smudge of light like a faint fingerprint — but don’t let that disappoint you. This seemingly innocuous glow is the guts of a massive star whose supernova was seen in the sky in the year A.D. 1054. That supernova was so bright that it outshone Venus and was visible during the day for nearly a month. Today nestled in the center of the mess is the Crab pulsar a rapidly spinning neutron star born from the crushed core of a once-brightly shining sun. Sunrise: 7:20 A.M.

The Moon reaches perigee the closest point to Earth in its orbit at 3:27 A.M. EST. At that time our satellite will be 222619 miles (358271 kilometers) away. Although now just a thin crescent the Moon will take part this evening in a beautiful tableau. After passing 3° south of Venus at 6 A.M. EST and 4° south of Mercury at 4 P.M. EST the Moon stands east of Mercury and Venus in the southwestern sky some 30 minutes after sunset. Mercury at magnitude –0.5 is to the Moon’s upper right while Venus (magnitude –3.9) is to our satellite’s lower right; together the three form a triangle against the fading twilight. Through a telescope Mercury’s disk appears 7″ across and is nearly half (49 percent) lit. Venus by contrast is almost fully lit (97%) and stretches 10″ in width. Train your scope along the delicate lit edge of the Moon to enjoy the play of light and shadow along the rugged landscape slowly revealed by the terminator separating night and day. The trio will set around 6 P.M. local time. Sunrise: 7:20 A.M.

Sunset: 4:39 P.M.

Moonrise: 8:56 A.M.

Moonset: 6:03 P.M.

Moon Phase: Waxing crescent (3%) Sunday December 25

Tonight is the perfect night to step outside and enjoy the Christmas Tree Cluster shining in the sky. This conifer-shaped grouping of stars lies within NGC 2264 which encompasses both the cluster and the Cone Nebula. You’ll find it in northwestern Monoceros the Unicorn near the feet of Gemini the Twins. The region rises in the east around 6 P.M. local time but if possible give it an hour or two to climb above the turbulent air at the horizon before searching out our quarry. NGC 2264 sits just over 3° south-southwest of magnitude 3.4 Alzirr (Xi [ξ] Geminornum). The Christmas Tree Cluster shines at magnitude 3.9 making it a nice naked-eye target in dark skies. You’ll likely see it as a fuzzy glow to the lower right of Alzirr; binoculars or a telescope will bring out some 10 or 15 stars which through a telescope will form up into the rough shape of a triangular Christmas tree including the trunk. Note that the tree may appear upside-down through your optics with the top of the tree just meeting the trip of the Cone Nebula. Magnitude 4.6 S Monocerotis is at the base of the trunk while 7th-magnitude HD 47887 marks the sparkling “star” at the top of the tree. Sunrise: 7:20 A.M.

Sunset: 4:40 P.M.

Moonrise: 9:48 A.M.

Moon Phase: Waxing crescent (8%) Monday December 26

The Moon passes 4° south of Saturn at 11 A.M. EST. You can spot the pair located in Capricornus above the southwestern horizon after dark. Saturn now magnitude 0.8 is a gorgeous telescope target with rings stretching 36″ across. The Moon which sits to the planet’s left (southeast) in the evening is now 18 percent lit showing off more of its eastern limb (which appears west in the sky). Readily visible is the large round Sea of Crises whose dark lava-flooded floor is now fully illuminated by the Sun. Third-magnitude Deneb Algedi sits between the Moon and Saturn; the planet will appear brighter than the star helping you identify them correctly. You can easily catch a glimpse of the solar system’s other gas giant Jupiter by simply looking to the pair’s upper left (east). There magnitude –2.4 Jupiter hangs in Pisces sitting left (southeast) of the Circlet asterism. Through a telescope the gas giant spans an impressive 40″. Its four Galilean moons are on ready display with Europa (farthest) and Io to the west and Ganymede (closest) and Callisto to the east. All four will remain visible all evening as no occultations or transits are taking place right now. Sunrise: 7:21 A.M.

Sunset: 4:41 P.M.

Moonrise: 10:28 A.M.

Moonset: 8:41 P.M.

Meeting the demand for office space in the Dallas-Fort Worth region will require literally miles of office space to be built in the next decade industry forecasting suggests.

In order to keep up with its current pace the market will need to produce 15 million square feet of office space per year over the next decade one report shows. That’s a construction feat that seems unlikely and the prediction is questionable as people-to-square footage ratios are changing as a result of remote and hybrid office models.

With market forces such as corporate relocations creating job growth the DFW office market will need to add about 150 million square feet of office space in the next 10 years according to a recent report by Dallas-based commercial brokerage Whitebox that examined changes in the market over the past 20 years.

“I think it’s highly unlikely that we will have 150 million square feet of office space delivered over the next decade despite the projected 675000 new jobs coming to the metroplex” said Brian Wilson managing director of Whitebox’s Dallas division.

Job growth is expected to continue long-term but the need for real estate could be muted as companies continue to find ways to cut corners and use their office spaces more efficiently.

About 675000 office jobs are expected to be added to the metro in the next decade according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Attracting top talent to big corporations could mean offering flexible office space and remote work.

It is part of why so many companies are investing in bringing flight-to-quality to attract employees to the office while also building in places with high-end amenities and recreation.

“The mid-market companies that occupy about 3000 square feet are working in the office and coming back to a more permanent schedule” said a commercial broker from NAI Robert Lynn who wished to remain anonymous.

Those corporate headquarters relocating to Dallas would be the companies less likely to conform to the standard ratios the broker said. The actual ratio sits at about 152 square feet per worker according to CBRE. Other reports show a range of 75 to 300 square feet. Is it even possible to build 150 million square feet of office space in Dallas by 2032 assuming a ratio of 300 square feet per office worker?

That would be a sixfold increase over how much has been built in the metro in the past decade.

Reaching the 202 million mark would require delivery of about 14-15 million square feet of office space per year but the most the metro has put together in a year was 27 million all the back in 1985 according to CoStar.

Year-to-year numbers for the last decade have rarely exceeded more than 8 million square feet and as of right now the market has about 55 million square feet of inventory and 7.9 million feet in the pipeline.

While DFW has experienced a steady stream of positive office absorption and growth over this past decade that growth only brought in about 25 million square feet by 2020 according to CBRE’s 2020 Office Market Study.

“While there are signs of a recovery in the office market headwinds still remain” a recent office report from CoStar reads.

“As a result of the pressures of increased work-from-home policies and the amount of sublease space available remains stubbornly high CoStar is anticipating increased downsizing and more subdued net absorption in the long term” the report reads.

Although the DFW might come nowhere close to 15 million square feet of office space per year DFW’s office dynamics are changing said Bob Kitchens director of market analytics for the CoStar Group.

“With workplace occupancy still trending at around 45 percent per Kastle occupancy data many occupiers expect to reevaluate their space needs” he told The Real Deal.

DFW was still among the top cities in the nation leading return-to-office in October making it more important than ever for tenants to consider whether they want to commit to long-term leases and what their needs should be.

Things are likely to change in the next decade but as it stands the DFW will need all the help it can get if it must reach this goal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS80NzY0NDc2ODYvYXZhbmF0aC1leHBhbmRzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS10ZWFtLXBpbmUtdHJlZS1waWNrcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtczItY2FwaXRhbC1oaXJlcy1maW5hbmNlLWhlYWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Avanath Expands Executive Team Pine Tree Picks President S2 Capital Hires Finance Head,"Avanath Capital Appoints Executive Vice President

By comparison 2021 saw a total of 18 multifamily sales hit the triple-digit mark according to data provided by CoStar.

There were only seven deals to reach $100 million over an eight-year period from 2013 to 2020.

“We joke that every deal now is a $100 million deal” Brett Moss managing director of the brokerage firm Berkadia told GrowthSpotter. “Evaluations have risen so quickly post-COVID. Rents were increasing at a pretty good clip and with rents going up like that values tend to follow.”

However as interest rates continue to climb while pushing debt levels up industry experts expect multifamily investment activity to cool off going into 2023.

The 389-unit Radius located just north of Lake Eola was acquired in October by California-based G.W. Williams Co. International Real Estate Investments with a closing price of $155 million according to Orange County deed records. That’s the highest-priced apartment sale of 2022.

“We can expect investment sales activity during the first half of 2023 to be slower than it has been for the last two years” said Lisa McNatt Director of Market Analytics with CoStar.

Moss and his team were involved in a recent high-dollar apartment sale. The brand-new 300-unit Ascend South Creek near Lake Nona sold to California-based Versity Invest for $100 million on Nov. 21. Berkadia represented the seller DHI Communities. The affiliate of D.R. Horton finished building the asset earlier this year.

At the time of the sale Ascend South Creek was about 95 percent occupied Moss said.

“People are looking for high-growth markets and Orlando continues to be at or near the top of the list for population growth and employment growth” he said. “Even in light of heading into a big slowdown in economic activity where folks are not being as aggressive as what we saw in the beginning of the year I still think Orlando from a fundamentals perspective just jumps off the page.”

Ascend South Creek is located at 3060 Southcreek Blvd just southwest of Boggy Creek Road and the Orlando International Airport. It’s also a short drive from Lake Nona one of Central Florida’s hottest residential submarkets.

Ascend South Creek is located at 3060 Southcreek Blvd just southwest of Boggy Creek Road and the Orlando International Airport. It’s also a short drive from Lake Nona one of Central Florida’s hottest residential submarkets.

The community features a 24-hour fitness center and yoga room resort pool business and game lounge and a spacious bark park and wash station according to its website. Units are available in two or three bedrooms and come with screened-in patios and large walk-in closets.

The seller DHI Communities nor the buyer Versity Invest could be reached for comment.

Versity Invest’s portfolio includes two other assets in the Orlando market both of which were snagged in the past two years. The 340-unit Vintage Horizon West developed by TDK Construction was purchased in April for $119.6 million while the 306-unit Astoria at Celebration in Osceola County was acquired in May of 2021 for $74.5 million.

For the Ascend South Creek purchase Versity took out a $45.9 million mortgage from commercial real estate financing firm Walker & Dunlop.

Versity isn’t the only company heading into the new year with a fresh addition to its portfolio.

The apartment building is seven stories stepping down to six stories with a variety of walk-up and live-work units on the ground floor.

Dallas-based Conti Capital paid $107 million on Dec. 20 for the 285-unit Alta Health Village apartments which were completed earlier this year by Ustler Development and Wood Partners. The Greystone provided financing in the form of a $56.58 million balloon mortgage. The urban-style project across from the AdventHealth Cancer Institute on N Orange Avenue is seven stories with structured parking and a rooftop pool deck with views of downtown Orlando.

This was Conti’s second acquisition in 2022 of an Orlando Alta-branded community following its purchase in April of Alta Winter Garden — also for $107 million.

On Dec. 12 Charleston S.C.-based The Beach Company made its entry into the Florida market by buying the 260-unit Marina Landing apartments.

The garden-style community built in 1991 is located at 6413 Westgate Dr. — between S. Hiawassee Road and State Road 435 — in West Orlando.

Marina Landing Apartments built in 1991 is located at 6413 Westgate Dr. — between S. Hiawasee Road and State Road 435 — in West Orlando.

The company is planning a premium-quality interior renovation as well as an upgrade to amenities according to a post on its LinkedIn page announcing the transaction.

For this transaction The Beach Company took out a $27.8 million loan from U.S. Bank National Association.

The year draws to a close with a number of high-end apartment sales.

Here’s a list of the top three most expensive according to CoStar:

The 389-unit Radius located just north of Lake Eola was acquired Thursday by California-based G.W. Williams Co. International Real Estate Investments with a closing price of $155 million according to Orange County deed records.

The asset’s original developer Banner Real Estate Group was the seller. Newmark‘s Executive Managing Director Scott Ramey led the team that brokered the sale.

The 384-unit Jefferson Lake Howell in Casselberry sold in March for $154.1 million to Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust. That sale was also brokered by Newmark.

The 372-unit Elan Ruby Lake sold for $153.6 million in June to New York-based BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation.

According to Ramey with Newmark there are two reasons why 2022 saw so many uber-expensive apartment deals.

“The majority of these sales were all of brand new construction assets which typically are achieving the highest rents in the market causing higher prices per unit” he said.

Two: Location.

“There is a ton of demand from investors looking to enter the Orlando market which led to record levels of competition particularly during the first half of the year and buyers who were willing to pay a higher price and accept a lower return in order to buy an asset in our market” Ramey said.

The pace of growth in the next few years will remain among the fastest in the eurozone according to Oxford Economics. After the massive setback in 2020 and despite the Ukraine-Russia war the Spanish economy continues to edge toward its pre-pandemic level with gross domestic product growing by 4.6% in 2022. Real GDP is expected to continue to grow in 2023 by 1% while the eurozone economy is set to shrink by 0.12%. Most GDP components will therefore return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.

The Spanish real estate market also offers strong fundamentals especially in logistics student and senior accommodation and affordable housing. In an environment of rising yields where income return is set to be the main driver of performance the market offers opportunities to investors searching for sectors with a positive income outlook.

Urban Logistics

The market has proven to be resilient during economic downturns. Market fundamentals are strong and with vacancy at historic lows the near-term outlook remains positive.

Despite the economic situation further growth in online sales is expected to support demand for urban logistics which will keep outpacing supply.

In terms of locations opportunities are not limited to Madrid and Barcelona as confirmed by some of the latest transactions.

Mileway Blackstone's last-mile urban logistics platform in October acquired logistics platforms totalking 113000 square metres in Barcelona Valencia Pamplona Seville and Zaragoza.

Newdock Goldman Sachs' logistics platform has already invested €600 million in a year and a half in Madrid Toledo Valencia and Málaga to develop 650000 square metres. It now plans to expand to Catalonia and the Basque Country.

Investors are focusing on modern efficient and high-quality assets as occupiers are increasingly concerned with quality and environmental social and corporate governance standards. Cártama for example one of the latest Newdock projects will be the first project in Andalusia to obtain the LEED Platinum certificate and the third in Spain.

Senior and Student Accommodation

The senior housing market benefits from a favourable demographic outlook which supports a growing demand given the ageing population. According to Oxford Economics the number of people over 65 years old is forecast to increase by more than 50% in Spain over the next 20 years compared to 30% in the EU reaching 15 million people by 2041 or 30% of the total Spanish population.

Spain also benefits from a strong appeal for foreigners to retire to. Investors are therefore focusing on main cities like Madrid and Barcelona and coastal markets such as Alicante and Málaga based on the lifestyle preferences of both domestic and foreign retirees.

PineBridge Benson Elliot with the Spanish developer Layetana is planning to develop of five senior living projects in Madrid Barcelona Valencia Bilbao and Málaga totaling 80000 square metres the Spanish press said in November.

Similarly the student housing sector in Spain is also an attractive sector driven by the growth of the domestic student population and increasing international mobility. The market remains immature and fragmented in Spain and the country lacks good quality student accommodation. Given the demand from domestic and international students investors are targeting mid-range and high-end housing.

Among the big transactions the purchase this year of Resa the main Spanish student accommodation portfolio with over 11000 beds by PGGM stands out. According to the Spanish press the price paid was circa €900 million according to the Spanish press.

In November CoStar News revealed Stoneshield Capital had appointed UBS Investment Bank Park Hill and Eastdil Secured to raise €600 million to recapitalise its MiCampus student housing unit to double the platform’s size.

article 1 Min Read Stoneshield Appoints UBS and Eastdil for €600 Million Spanish PBSA Platform Recapitalisation Valued at €1 billion MiCampus is the country's second-largest student accommodation platform. Sharon Smyth Social

Affordable Housing

The Spanish multifamily sector is expected to perform well as market fundamentals have strengthened.

Within the sector affordable and social housing are especially attractive as the supply of affordable housing has failed to keep up with demand and is below EU average. Spain with less than 2% of the housing stock dedicated to social renting is the country in the OECD with the fourth lowest share of social housing.

The low and middle-rent segment is considered resilient and with low risk offering stable growth and high occupancy rates.

Key international players are therefore targeting the Spanish affordable rental market like Axa IM Alts or more recently CBRE IM which has teamed up in November with the Spanish management group Elix to develop a portfolio of 1200 residential units in Spain.

nvestment opportunities can be found in Madrid Barcelona and in the larger regional markets such as Málaga and Valencia where rental supply is stillat an early stage of development while good economic and demographic fundamentals support new developments.

The private real estate sector can play an important role in providing low-cost housing while meeting investors' risk-return requirements through partnerships with local authorities. A good example is the collaboration between Ares Real Estate Group and the Madrid regional government.

As part of its Plan VIVE the Community of Madrid awarded last year Ares a 50-year concession to invest €400 million in developing more than 3600 affordable residential units across 13 municipalities in Madrid. This year Ares and Avalon which is majority owned by the former signed a sustainable financing agreement with Caixabank for more than €300 million for the development of the project. Plan VIVE highlights the growing opportunity for introducing private capital to address critical public issues like Spain’s affordable housing shortage.

Given the context of uncertainty frequent updates on the economic and real estate landscape will be needed as 2023 unfolds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL21pYW1pLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvanYtYnV5cy1wYWxtLWJlYWNoLWdhcmRlbnMtb2ZmaWNlLWNvbXBsZXgtZm9yLTM4bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joint Venture Pays $38M For Palm Beach Gardens Office Complex,"ABS National Business Parks paid $38 million for a Palm Beach Gardens office complex.

ABS is led by founders Earle Altman Gregg Schenker Peter Burack and Steven Hornstock. The firm has a portfolio of 98 commercial properties spanning more than 14 million square feet across the country according to the company’s website. They include Datran Center a pair of office buildings in Kendall and 200 Park Avenue South an office and retail building in Manhattan.

Spinach products were grown on a farm in Victoria and shipped to several stores across the country. More than 190 potential cases were reported in New South Wales Australian Capital Territory Victoria and Queensland.

There have been several hospitalizations. Toxicological impacts are still to be confirmed but it is understood most people experienced symptoms for a short time and then recovered.

Symptoms included delirium or confusion hallucinations dilated pupils rapid heartbeat a flushed face blurred vision fever slurred speech nausea vomiting and dry mouth and skin. The onset of illness occurred within hours of eating the affected baby spinach.

In New South Wales 88 people reported symptoms after eating baby spinach and at least 33 of them sought medical attention.

​​​​​​One field and producer

Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) coordinated multiple recalls of baby spinach products because of potential contamination with unsafe plant material.​ All affected products have been identified and recalled but some have shelf life dates up to Dec. 28 so could be in consumers’ homes. Recalled spinach was sourced from a single producer and came from one field.

“The investigations have not identified any other potential chemical herbicide or other types of contaminant. As a precautionary measure neighboring crops of spinach are in the process of being destroyed” said a spokesperson for Riviera Farms.

The spokesperson said by the time it is re-introduced to the market it will be the most audited spinach supply in Australia.

“Riviera Farms is continuing to conduct our own independent audit of the farm and weed which will inform our application to obtain recertification and recommence production. Riviera Farms also thanks NSW Health Victorian Health and Food Standards Australia and New Zealand for their expert advice at what has been a difficult time for our company and staff” said the company spokesperson.

Vegetable industry body AUSVEG reassured consumers that other spinach and leafy salad products are safe.

“The past 12 months have been the most difficult in recent times for our industry. While all growers have faced significant increases to costs of production floods and consistent rain and critical labor shortages this year leafy salad and spinach growers have had it particularly tough during this period” said Michael Coote AUSVEG CEO.

“We have spoken to growers who have experienced reduced orders and drops in sales who are not even in the same state as the source of the recalled spinach which is an avoidable situation that hurts the entire industry.”

CTRA,Coterra,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjMxMjIwMjIvZGltb2NrLXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1tZXRoYW5lLWRyaWxsaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Residents Fear New Methane Contamination as Pennsylvania Lifts Its Gas-Drilling Ban in the Township of Dimock,"Residents of a Pennsylvania town famous for its flammable tap water fear another round of methane contamination after state officials lifted a 12-year ban on drilling for natural gas beneath their feet.

The state’s Department of Environmental Protection signed an agreement with Coterra Energy allowing it to restart harvesting natural gas from a nine-square-mile “box” beneath Dimock in northeastern Pennsylvania where the company’s predecessor Cabot Oil and Gas was ejected in 2010 after contaminating numerous private water wells with methane.

Victoria Switzer a long-time Dimock resident and an outspoken opponent of the gas industry said she was “depressed and disappointed” by the new consent agreement because it will end the DEP’s testing of her water every three months and replace that with testing by Coterra.

She’s also worried that plugging more than a dozen old wells in the township will result in the renewed migration of methane into people’s water wells. She argued that DEP should not have allowed a resumption of drilling in a gas-rich area of Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale field until residents were connected to the promised public water system.

“The opening of the box should not occur until water is flowing into the homes of the impacted residents and any other family that wants peace of mind when it comes to their life source: their water” she said.

The new DEP agreement with Coterra places many new restrictions on the company’s gas-harvesting plans including monitoring new wells for any methane escape evaluating drinking water wells near its operations and plugging old gas wells that were the source of water contamination. The company will not be allowed to drill vertical wells within the “box” as it did before but can sink those wells outside the area and then extend horizontal “laterals” beneath the town according to the agreement.

Coterra is also required within six months to install as an interim solution water-treatment systems to all affected residents who agree to the offer. If the new system is unable to be built for “any reason” the company must apply to the DEP for permission to operate the interim systems for 30 years the agreement says.

The document signed on Nov. 29 also requires the company to pay $16.29 million to install within five years a public water system that would remove the risk of future contamination from nearby gas drilling. That requirement was also part of a plea agreement with Coterra that was reached by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro on the same day in which the company pleaded no-contest to criminal charges stemming from violation of the state’s Clean Streams Law and agreed to pay the water bills of affected residents for 75 years.

Shapiro a Democrat who will become governor of Pennsylvania in January said the plea agreement should be seen by other energy companies as a sign that the authorities will hold them accountable for any future contamination. “Companies will take notice that we won’t allow communities like this to be taken advantage of or forgotten” he said announcing the plea deal.

George Stark a spokesman for Coterra said after the DEP agreement was disclosed that the company would use best practices and state-of-the-art technology to conduct any future drilling operations.

“This agreement resolves long-standing issues and provides for the responsible and safe development of natural resources located inside the nine-square mile area. It also satisfies the desires of many of the landowners who communicated their support for such development over the years” he said.

After initially welcoming the AG’s plea deal some residents were skeptical or outright hostile in response to the DEP’s decision to allow the resumption of gas drilling in a town that became a poster-child for the human impacts of hydraulic fracturing—or “fracking”—for natural gas when one resident memorably ignited the water from his kitchen faucet. The incident was widely broadcast in the 2010 Netflix documentary “Gasland.”

Coterra’s interest in restarting development of the Dimock “box” is driven by its rich gas reserves said Terry Engelder a Pennsylvania State University geologist who co-authored a study in 2008 that estimated the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania West Virginia and Ohio contained at least five times the 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that was produced at the time by the United States Canada and Mexico combined.

He now estimates the Dimock “box” alone contains about 1.3 trillion cubic feet of gas worth some $3.9 billion assuming a market price of $3 per thousand cubic feet. Just a small fraction was harvested by Coterra before regulators closed the box in 2010 and the prospect of renewed access explains the company’s willingness to agree to the criminal charges brought by the attorney general Engelder said.

“This is both new news for the local royalty owners inside the moratorium area and the reason why Coterra felt its pockets would become deep enough to plead ‘no contest’ and put up $16 million to supply water to the Dimock folks” he said.

Still Dimock’s abundance of gas is not unusual by the standards of the Marcellus in nearby Pennsylvania counties Engelder said. He estimated that there are about 360 square miles of the field that have similar production characteristics as the nine-square-mile “box” beneath Dimock.

“There is nothing special about the Marcellus under the Dimock area that does not apply to a larger area covering parts of Susquehanna Bradford Wyoming and Sullivan Counties” he wrote in an email.

Switzer the Dimock resident and retired schoolteacher said Shapiro and DEP signing of the two agreements with Coterra on the same day raises her suspicions of a tradeoff in which the company agreed to plead no-contest to the criminal charges in return for being allowed to resume drilling at Dimock.

“It was coming to a head with Coterra opening the box and simultaneously the AG is offering us a water line” she said. “Can any person believe that they were operating in separate rooms and no one knew about it?”

Jacklin Rhoads a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office denied that it shared information with the DEP about the investigation that led to the criminal charges.

“Our office plays no role in DEP’s regulatory decisions and we do not share confidential information about criminal investigations” Rhoads wrote in an email. “The only information our office provided about the conviction ahead of last month’s announcement was with the victims and the defendant. No exchange of this nature was ever a part of our criminal plea negotiations.”

Jamar Thrasher spokesman for the DEP said the two agencies negotiated their agreements separately but that the DEP told Shapiro’s office of its talks with Coterra in September 2022. He said DEP’s negotiations on drilling laterals in the “box” beneath Dimock were underway before DEP knew that the attorney general’s office was in talks with the company on the $16.29 million plea agreement that required building a public water supply.

Once DEP obtained details of the plea agreement it added references to the public water system and how the company would respond if the system could not be built he said.

“Our consent order complements the plea agreement by providing a short-term solution new interim treatment systems that would improve conditions for the affected homeowners while the public water system is being developed” Thrasher wrote in an email.

He said the methane contamination that led to the 2010 agreement appears to have come from the vertical portion of the older wells not from their horizontal sections that are much deeper.

Ray Kemble a 30-year resident of Dimock blasted the new agreement as “absolutely illegal” because a requirement in the 2010 document to restore all 19 contaminated water wells has not yet been met he said.

Kemble 67 a retiree who previously owned a tire shop and towing business predicted that the latest agreement will lead to renewed methane contamination of private water wells. He said his own became contaminated with the gas and four kinds of uranium in 2010 and he has since used water from a “buffalo”—a 1000-gallon portable tank—that he fills weekly from a nearby hydrant.

“I don’t want any drilling underneath my house at all” he said. “They will be drilling all these wells right underneath us.”

He called the attorney general’s plea deal “a slap on the wrist” for Coterra and accused DEP and Shapiro’s office of cooperating by completing both agreements on the same day.

“They knew exactly what was going on because DEP was signing the damn order the same day they were signing the order in court” he said. “We are just puppets and pawns for the AG’s office. We were just lied to.”

But David Hess who headed the DEP from 2001 to 2003 argued that the two documents complement each other as shown by DEP’s agreement incorporating the AG’s requirement that Coterra pays $16.29 million for a new public water system and that it is enforceable by DEP.

Still it remains to be seen whether the DEP agreement can prevent recurring contamination despite its extra restrictions and that will become a new enforcement test for the DEP statewide as well as a new requirement on Coterra at Dimock Hess said.

“This will be one of the most closely monitored drilling areas in the state as a result of this order” he said. “Does DEP have the staff resources to hold the company accountable and do everything it needs to do to regulate oil and gas in other areas? That’s a good question.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

But one makes a better buy in today's market.

With freight demand robust this year American railroad companies are taking advantage of greater volumes combined with higher rates. Although steady demand for freight transportation is expected to continue the railway industry also faces near-term supply chain disruptions labor shortages and soaring fuel prices.

Railroad companies that can endure the current economy with minimal damage stand to benefit greatly over time especially considering rail is the most economically and environmentally friendly way to transport goods and materials across the U.S.

Let's take a closer look at two major American railway players and determine which of these railroad stocks makes a better buy in today's market.

1. Union Pacific

Union Pacific (UNP 0.32%) operates 32000 miles of track across 23 states in the western two-thirds of the U.S. As a historic American railway Union Pacific has transported the country's coal agricultural products shipping containers and other freight since 1862. As a member of the prestigious Fortune 500 the Omaha-based company remains a pillar of the rail industry.

After posting third-quarter records for operating revenue operating income net income and earnings per share Union Pacific certainly seems to be on the right track. However a shift in consumer spending from goods to experiences recently triggered a 16% drop in parcel shipments for the rail carrier.

And although volumes were actually up in Q3 staffing shortages left a substantial amount of business on the table for Union Pacific. Despite crew setbacks CEO Lance Fritz is confident that hiring initiatives and enhanced training programs will dig the company out of its staffing hole. According to Fritz although 2022 hasn't exactly been ideal Union Pacific's volumes have nevertheless ""outpaced"" peers throughout the year.

Union Pacific now looks to carry its current momentum in coal autos and construction materials shipments into 2023. To improve profitability Fritz and his team pursue streamlined operations better fleet management faster train speeds and -- above all -- increased volumes.

2. CSX

Also a member of the Fortune 500 CSX (CSX -0.35%) serves every major city in the eastern U.S. In addition to energy-related industrial construction agricultural and consumer freight CSX also runs a small number of passenger trains.

Like Union Pacific CSX has struggled with crew shortages in recent quarters. The Jacksonville Florida-based railway's on-time departures fell 13% in the third quarter and on-time arrivals dropped 16% year over year. However things are improving at CSX with over 6800 crew members hired out of a 7000-hire goal. Vice President of Operations Jamie Boychuk affirmed that train speeds and capacities will continue to pick up once hiring and training are complete.

CSX's new CEO former Ford Motor Company executive Joe Hinrichs seeks to enhance existing railway operations by focusing on service and reliability. Hinrichs' simplified holistic approach centers on improving CSX's core competencies to scale operations. Once the railroad operator earns a track record of reliable predictable service CSX should attract new business organically while retaining and growing its existing accounts.

Undeterred by staffing concerns CSX grew volumes by 2% in Q3 while the railway earned 18% more revenue and 15% more profit than in 2021. As underscored by Boychuk during the Q3 earnings call CSX could stand to see substantial growth -- both in volume and profitability -- once fully operational.

Which railway stock is a better buy right now?

To determine which of these railway stocks makes a better buy in today's market let's compare their price-to-earnings ratios and dividend yields.

Metric Union Pacific CSX Market cap $129.2 billion $66.5 billion Price-to-earnings ratio 18.74 16.83 Dividend yield 2.47% 1.26%

Although it has a higher price-to-earnings ratio Union Pacific does have a greater dividend yield a benefit for income investors. In my opinion the higher yield makes Union Pacific today's winner. However both of these iconic operators stand to benefit from a railway industry poised for long-term growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9iYWx0aW1vcmUvbmV3cy9jc3gtdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24tcmVhY2hlcy1zZXR0bGVtZW50LXdpdGgtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1vZi10aGUtZW52aXJvbm1lbnQtb3Zlci0yMDIxLWNvYWwtcGxhbnQtZXhwbG9zaW9uL9IBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvYmFsdGltb3JlL25ld3MvY3N4LXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLXJlYWNoZXMtc2V0dGxlbWVudC13aXRoLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtb2YtdGhlLWVudmlyb25tZW50LW92ZXItMjAyMS1jb2FsLXBsYW50LWV4cGxvc2lvbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CSX Transportation reaches settlement with Department of the Environment over 2021 coal plant explosion,"BALTIMORE - CSX Transportation reached a settlement with the Maryland Department of the Environment over an explosion at its coal exporting plant in Curtis Bay nearly a year ago.

Under the settlement CSX Transportation is required to fund a community-led energy-efficient rehabilitation of a vacant building for use as an environmental education research and training center for the Curtis Bay community.

The company must provide $100000 to a community organization performing an environmental project to benefit the neighborhood and its residents.

The settlement also requires CSX to pay a $15000 penalty to MDE and take a series of corrective actions in response to the explosion including safety improvements to the facility and coordination with Baltimore City officials to improve emergency response and notification procedures.

""In this enforcement action the Maryland Department of the Environment took decisive steps to assign accountability for the explosion in Curtis Bay and to require actions to help prevent something like this from happening again"" said Maryland Environment Secretary Horacio Tablada. ""This enforcement action includes an important environmental project that will directly benefit the Curtis Bay community. This goes hand-in-hand with MDE's support of air monitoring in the community and our targeted compliance effort of facilities to protect and improve environmental conditions in that area.""

Residents in the Curtis Bay community also filed a class action lawsuit against CSX Transportation claiming negligence resulted in a health-harming explosion at its facility in 2021.

The explosion happened on Dec. 30 2021 at a coal silo on Benhill Avenue. It shattered windows and damaged homes.

The lawsuit states ""knowing intentional and reckless"" conduct by CSX caused the explosion that released ""poisonous and carcinogenic chemicals.""

CSX has operated out of Curtis Bay for 140 years said Brian Hammock the vice president of State Government Affairs for CSX. He said the explosion was caused by a building of methane on the conveyor belt that wasn't being ventilated.

Residents said the air pollution the explosion caused has been around for decades because of the coal plant.

The residents who filed the lawsuit said the lawsuit left them with ""potentially lethal levels of coal dust.

The CSX Transportation facility in Curtis Bay is used from incoming and outgoing rail services. It has a railyard a coal transfer yards railcar offloading infrastructure pier loading facilities and maintenance and operations buildings.

in late December 2021 an explosion happened in the North Reclaim Tunnel.

The residents in the lawsuit claim CSX Transportation failed the maintain the facility with care and they ""breached that duty by negligently and improperly operating supervising and/or maintaining the Curtis Bay Facility in such a manner that proximately caused the release of coal dust and dangerous contaminants that blanketed the Class Area.""

The 12-page lawsuit said the negligence resulted in ""unreasonable release of coal dust and other dangerous contaminants.""

The lawsuit claims CSX failed to adequately control the facility and had inadequate staffing.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lcndpbnJlY29yZC5uZXQvbmV3cy9jb21tdW5pdHkvYXV0aG9ycy1yZWNhbGwtdGhlLXRpbWUtdGhlLXJhaWxyb2FkLWFuZC1zYW50YS1jbGF1cy10b28td2VyZS1zdWVkL2FydGljbGVfMjdmMTU1NDYtODBhNC0xMWVkLWI3MTAtZGZmNTY5MTQ4NTg3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Authors recall the time the railroad – and Santa Claus too – were sued,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

We’ll count down the Top 10 stories of the year as voted on by Trains editors columnists and correspondents beginning Dec. 26. As a prelude we’ll be looking at major stories that didn’t make that list. Today: The freight rail industry.

How the mighty have fallen.

A year ago the battle between Canadian Pacific and Canadian National for ownership of Kansas City Southern was the top News Wire story of 2021. This year the ongoing developments in the CP-KCS merger didn’t even make the News Wire Top 10 list.

It came close however finishing 11th in our balloting. And there was certainly enough going on as the two railroads move toward what could be the last merger of Class I railroads that it deserves further review along with the pending BNSF takeover of Montana Rail Link CSX’s completion of its purchase of Pan Am Railways and CEO changes at three Class I roads.

CP-KCS: Ask and see what you receive

The regulatory process involved in merging KCS covered most of 2022 with other railroads lineside communities and other interested parties weighing in with regulators — generally to ask for conditions to be imposed if the Surface Transportation Board does as expected approve the deal. A decision is expected sometime in January.

Spurned KCS suitor Canadian National raised objections to the deal at every turn claiming the CP-KCS merger application was based on fatally flawed data would hurt competition and could lead to rail network meltdowns in Chicago Houston and elsewhere. CN also said it should receive the KCS Springfield Line connecting that Illinois city to St. Louis and Kansas City to create a route to Chicago Detroit Toronto and Montreal to compete with the merged company CPKC [see “Canadian National warns regulators …” Sept. 29 2022]. Relatively late in the game it offered a milder alternative of trackage rights [see “CN would accept trackage rights …” News Wire Oct. 24 2022].

The other Class I railroads had their own requests for conditions. BNSF and UP want CPKC to be prevented from increasing traffic in the Houston area until it identifies funds and completes projects to increase capacity and want guarantees protecting interchange at the important Laredo Texas gateway [see “UP BNSF say CP-KCS traffic will melt down Houston terminal” News Wire Sept. 30 2022]. Norfolk Southern and CSX both raised questions about the current KCS-NS Meridian Speedway venture with NS concerned the merger might hurt the operation and CSX wanting access to the Speedway route [see “STB gets an earful …” News Wire Oct. 3 2022].

Others seeking conditions or raising objections include Chicago commuter operator Metra which wants a host of infrastructure improvements and other conditions to avoid service disruptions and a group of Chicago suburbs who have sought to block the deal entirely over traffic increases that CP and KCS estimate will go from three to eight freight trains a day but the suburban group the Coalition to Stop CPKC has estimated could be as many as 14 trains. Failing a complete halt to the merger that group originally sought more than $9 billion to mitigate the impact of the deal but eventually scaled that back to $400 million [see “CP and KCS tout and defend …” News Wire Sept. 28 2022].

Reclaiming the Link

Montana Rail Link announced in January that it had agreed to early termination of its lease of BNSF lines in Montana Idaho and Washington allowing BNSF to regain control of the former Northern Pacific track that predecessor Burlington Northern had leased to MRL in 1987 [see “BNSF needed to end …” Jan. 21 2022]. BNSF may have paid as much as $2 billion to buy out the lease which was not set to expire until 2047 [see “BNSF Railway paid around $2 billion …” News Wire March 3 2022].

A timeline for the BNSF takeover was contingent on BNSF reaching agreement with MRL’s unions; with that completed MRL began the regulatory process in November asking the STB for permission to discontinue service. A board decision is expected in 2023’s second quarter [see “Montana Rail line seeks regulator permission …” Nov. 21 2022]

CSX completes Pan Am deal

Regulators approved CSX Transportation’s acquisition of New England regional Pan Am Railways in April with CSX taking over operation of the 1700-mile road in June. CSX had announced its intent to purchase Pan Am in November 2020 [see “CSX to acquire …” News Wire Nov. 30 2020]. After approving the deal STB Chairman Martin J. Oberman said he looked forward to “improvements in the rail network with respect to reliable service and competitive transportation options in New England and beyond.”

CSX had pledged to spend more than $100 million to upgrade Pan Am’s infrastructure and aging locomotive fleet over the first three years of ownership [see “Regulators approve CSX Transportation’s acquisition …” News Wire April 14 2022].

New faces at the top

Three Class I railroad welcomed new CEOs in 2022. The changes began in February when former Canadian Pacific executive Tracy Robinson was named Canadian National CEO. That was followed by Alan Shaw’s ascension to the top spot at Norfolk Southern effective in May but announced the previous December; and the selection of former Ford Motor Co. executive Joe Hinrichs as CSX CEO in September. The selection of Hinrichs generated the most discussion because hiring a CEO from outside the rail industry is a relatively rare move [see “Shippers railroads and analyst praise CSX’s selection …” News Wire Sept. 22 2022.]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL25ld3MvMTk5OS1zaGVsYnktc2VyaWVzLTEtY2xlYW4tc2hlZXQtbW9kZXJuaXplZC1jb2JyYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shelby Series 1: Carroll's Biggest Failure or an Underappreciated Classic?,"The Shelby name is tightly associated with Ford nowadays but there was a very short time when it was trying to be its own manufacturer. Rather than using pre-produced cars and stuffing high-powered engines in them Shelby wanted to build a sports car in-house inspired by the basic idea of the original Cobra. The result was a short-wheelbase open-top coupe with a powerful V-8 under its hood. In 1997 it showed off a concept sample that would go on to become the Shelby Series 1. It looked to be a brilliant modern-day Cobra successor on paper but the reality would prove to be a bit different.

Thanks to this Series 1 going up for auction at Mecum Kissimmee we have an opportunity to look back on the development of this car of which only 294 of the proposed 500 were built.

The Lead Up to the Series 1

Imagine sitting at the Los Angeles Auto Show in 1997 after hearing rumors that a brand-new Cobra was in the works and you were greeted by the prototype of the Series 1. It looked exciting sitting still with a clean new design short wheelbase open top fender haunches and of course a V-8 under its hood. How could it go wrong?

But things started to take a turn even before the first prototype was built. Despite much of the claim that Carroll Shelby had designed and built the Series 1 the reality was his health was deteriorating thanks to late complications with his kidney from an earlier heart transplant in 1990. He was directly involved in its initial design but the process of the prototype's manufacturing was done while Shelby was in the hospital. This left the building of the Series 1 to Shelby American with major backing andinfluence by General Motors specifically its Oldsmobile division.

The Aurora V-8

It was that Oldsmobile influence that steered the Series 1 toward using a brand-new V-8 engine from General Motors the L47 Aurora. It was a 4.0-liter engine with a double overhead cam (DOHC) valvetrain layout and could produce up to 250 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque in street guise when it was used in the rather tame-looking namesake sedan the Oldsmobile Aurora. The idea behind this push as viewed by Oldsmobile was to create a car equal to the Corvette using their new V-8 but without the Olds badge so as to not look like they were competing directly with the General's sports car—especially because a modified version of the engine was already in use in sports car and open-wheel racing by the time the two Shelby Series 1 prototypes were built. Also having a Shelby with an Oldsmobile V-8 under the hood as a pace car and leading the field of Indy Racing League cars with those racing-spec L47s during the Indy 500 was just icing on the marketing cake.

However the weak 250-hp output wasn't enough for Shelby American and their modern-day Cobra. It was going to be bumped to 350 hp and 290 lb-ft of torque and feed that power through a torque tube leading to the ZF six-speed transaxle while the engine itself was mounted directly behind the front axle for a modern front-mid-engine placement. Shelby would also plan to add on a supercharger to push it beyond 450 hp as an installed option but that would cost more than $35000 on a car that would go on to cost more than $100000 in 1997 money—nearly $186000 in today's dollars. Which also means the equivalent price of that supercharger upgrade would be nearly $65000.

Bespoke Chassis and Body Parts Bin Interior

The chassis was rather impressive and modern (even by today's standards) as it was built out of extruded and formed 6061 T4 aluminum that was all welded together. The chassis would then be heat-treated to bring its strength back into spec for strength and rigidity. Aluminum panels would then be bonded to create the floorboards and rocker panels for additional structural strength where needed.

The body was formed out of carbon fiber and fiberglass composites and fit over the massive 18x10 front and 18x12 rear wheels—three-piece Speedline units made from forged aluminum—with Goodyear Eagle F1 tires in 265/40ZR18 front and 315/40ZR18 rear. Bringing them to a stop were a set of two-piston front and single-piston rear calipers with a 13-inch front and 12-inch rear discs. Those wheel movements were controlled by a double wishbone and cantilever suspension system that transferred those motions to the centrally located coil-overs with remote reservoirs.

Every bit of that description sounds so perfect and what a modern Cobra should be but it also had modern amenities attached to it like power brakes air conditioning cruise control traction control stability control power windows and even a radio. Even with all of that the Series 1 would have only weighed 2650 pounds. (The actual curb weight would be significantly more due to late additions that added poundage.)

There were just some very glaring problems early on when it came time to create the production version of the Series 1. The first major hurdle was time. Although the prototype made its debut in 1997 production wouldn't roll out until 1998 and it was sold as a 1999 model year. This meant the Series 1 had to conform to the updated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for 1999; that increased the cost of production which trickled down to the eventual sale price. The Shelby American team building the cars were also under-resourced and overworked even before production started. There was also the trouble due to its ties to GM as the Series 1 didn't just use the Aurora V-8. The climate controls came from Pontiac it used a Camaro gauge cluster the radio is from Buick the sound system came from Delco under the Monsoon brand and a slightly modified windshield was borrowed from Corvette. The cost Shelby was demanding just didn't match the interior they were selling.

Tricky Handling

On the road and the test track the Series 1 was a bit of a mixed bag. When driven hard the car proved to be mostly predictable thanks to good front-to-rear weight balance. When we took it for adrive back in 1998 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway's interior road course (which uses part of the main oval) C. Van Tune—writer of our review at that time—said it was like ""driving a continental plate."" He continued ""The 50/50 weight balance helps give the Series 1 a very neutral feeling but the front tires can turn into pushers (such as in a Viper or Vette) given too much throttle. Lift the throttle just a bit and the rear comes out just enough to cancel the push; come off more and it'll step out further giving the indication it wants to spin but it won't unless you really get in over your head.""

Unfortunately Van Tune was encouraged to push beyond that limit by photographer Randy Lorentzen: ""Entering turn one after the straightaway at about 100 mph I blip down two gears (not easy with the current shifter) and toss the car into a mad drift that's picture-perfect for all of 2 seconds. Then she comes around. Fast. And I ain't catching it. Determined not to be remembered as the guy who put Carroll's million-dollar car into the pucker bushes I manage to gather it up just before I run out of tarmac. No harm no foul. Studying the photos later I discover the right front tire was completely off the ground just before the car let go.""

Other weaknesses were the difficulty to get the engine to properly rev-match the gear whine of the ZF transmission and heavy braking modulation with front wheel lockup (as there wasn't any ABS on that car). It took 129 feet for it to stop from 60 mph and 14.7 seconds in our 0-100-0-mph test. Unbeknownst to Van Tune it turns out the aluminum casting that supported the rear suspension cracked not once but four times before he sat down to drive it and the one on the car we tested was welded back together. Shelby didn't have time to get a fifth one because the casting was made in Toronto and we know this now thanks to Eric Davidson's book on the Series 1 calledSnake Bit.

Further production issues stemmed from the heat treating of the welded aluminum chassis. The jigs used by Shelby's team weren't strong enough and allowed the chassis to warp as it cooled pushing manufacturing behind even further to find stronger jigs. Although Oldsmobile partnered on supplying the engine it refused to give Shelby's team the computer coding that would allow it to tune the ECM. Now instead of that 350 hp Shelby originally wanted the engines were only able to muster320 hp.

The Beginning of the End

The next nail was that production had now shifted to Venture Industries (no not that one) a company that had bought out Shelby American during production of the Series 1. Venture discovered the side windows and convertible tops didn't fit properly which then had to be fixed during production and increased production costs even more. The bad news there was that the Series 1s in production had already been sold to an agreed to price so those new costs couldn't be passed down.

During painting it was discovered that the composite bodywork wasn't completely sealed which allowed paint to flow into the pores that developed. Venture's solution was to use body filler increasing the weight of the carbon body panels and pushing the car into the 3000-pound weight range. Those body panels were also hand-adjusted with shims while the cars were on the production line (which sounds oddly familiar). Finally the ZF transaxle would also have issues with faulty units shift linkage issues and oil leaks which required repair or full replacement before being shipped out.

By the time production was sorted out Oldsmobile had folded and Carroll Shelby bought the rights to the Series 1 back from Venture Industries. Worse yet those cars that weren't finished could only be sold as kit cars as Shelby could not get an extension for federal safety standard exemptions. In all only 249 of the proposed 500 units were ever sold as complete vehicles. Although production of the Series 1 did continue until 2005 cars built after 1999 were not factory complete and required sourcing of engines and transmissions.

The 1999 Shelby Series 1 at Mecum Kissimmee

With only 249 cars ever produced the 1999 Shelby Series 1 tends to commands a high price when they come up for sale despite the various issues described above. These cars have a a median value of $117700 but have gone as high as $313000 for one owned by Carroll Shelby (CSX 5001 making it the very first production Series 1) and sold in 2018. In 2022 nine Series 1s have crossed auction blocks with sale prices ranging from $105000 to $242000 and this one should be very close to that higher number.

This particular model is number 174 (chassis code CSX 5174) and only has 2275 miles on its odometer. It comes in its original Centennial Silver (a paint that is also another parts-bin item from Oldsmobile) and original black interior. And it is a great example of the promise of the car. Its early issues may have doomed the Series 1 but the late-production cars hinted at what could have been.

With a less troubled history maybe the Series 1 could have had a future providing an alternate-universe competitor to various American high-powered sports cars of today. Instead you'll have to make do with this piece of history which will cross the auction block at Mecum Kissimmee which takes place January 4 to 15 2023."

December 23 2022

Story By Mike McGlothlin

Perhaps the biggest move in the history of Dodge pickups occurred for the 1994 model year. Not only did Chrysler completely redesign its Ram trucks inside and out but it debuted the first 4x4 coil spring front suspension in the ¾-ton and larger segment the first V-10 engine ever offered in a pickup and ranked first in payload and towing. In time the ’94-’98 version of the 5.9L Cummins would go down as the holy grail of diesel engines in pickup trucks—with a vibrant aftermarket still continuing to support it today.

Little remained of the ’94 Ram’s predecessor aside from the name. The Class 8-inspired front grille made Dodge trucks stand apart from the crowd its body lines broke away from the squared off designs of the past (and the non-aerodynamic bodies still being offered by Ford and GM at the time) it boasted a modern interior with more room than any other competitor and it was all laid on top of the strongest frame in its class. It’s no wonder Dodge even overtook Chevrolet and GMC in overall sales for a time.

While the Cummins-powered ’89-’93 trucks helped revive the Dodge truck brand the ’94 version solidified Ram as a rival that was here to stay.

P-Pumped 5.9L Cummins

With Dodge able to keep up with customer demand for its 5.9L Cummins option—thanks to Cummins opening its Midrange Engine Plant in 1992 to exclusively build them for the auto maker—plenty of diesel-equipped Ram 2500 and 3500’s began circulating the country immediately. For ’94 the 5.9L Cummins—still a 12-valve all-iron direct injection inline-six with a single turbocharger and an air-to-air intercooler—was fitted with a Bosch P7100 inline injection pump rather than the previous Bosch VE rotary pump. The change provided for an increase in both horsepower and torque output so long as it was all bolted to the manual transmission option. With the latter combination peak horsepower checked in at 175 hp at 2500 rpm and 420 lb-ft of torque at 1500 rpm. Beginning in ’96 the Cummins/manual option offered a 215 hp and 440 lb-ft package.

Magnum V-10

The biggest news in the ’94 Ram’s extensive powertrain lineup was the all-new Magnum gasoline V-10. Thanks to its 4.00-inch bore and 3.88-inch stroke the 90-degree overhead valve V-10 displaced 488 cubic inches or 8.0L. It sported a cast-iron (deep “Y”) block and heads an 8.4:1 compression ratio and was billed as being “more fuel efficient than the Ford 460 or Chevy 454 V8s.” Its 300 hp at 4000 rpm and 450 lb-ft of torque produced at 2400 rpm led all pickup truck engines in America in both horsepower and torque production.

Strongest Frame

It was clear that Dodge planned to own the ¾-ton and larger segment with its ’94 trucks. The new 36000-psi steel frame featured the deepest rails of any pickup at the time and its boxed front section provided additional rigidity where it was needed. The C-channel (center) and straight channel (rear) sections of the frame were considerably thick for sufficient strength. A unique H-shaped main rear crossmember also helped to resist bending and twisting under heavy loads.

Coil Spring Front Suspension

On 4x4 models leaf spring front solid axles became a thing of the past for Dodge beginning in 1994. The Ram’s coil spring front suspension marked a first for the segment and Dodge wasted little time advertising it. “The new Dodge-exclusive Ram 4x4’s unique solid axle link-coil suspension with stabilizer bar provides a new standard of off-road ride handling travel and traction.” The Dana 60 solid front axle remained although the differential was now located on the driver side of the beam and Ram boasted the widest front track width of any truck in ’94.

Rear Dana 80

Quietly one of the toughest rear axles ever offered in a pickup truck infiltrated the Ram line in 1994. The Dana 80 housed an 11.25-inch ring gear and came standard on all 3500 model trucks. It was also used in 2500 models that were equipped with the Cummins or V-10 and backed by the manual transmission. The Dana 70 remained the standard rear axle option for 2500 models. Atop either rear axle Dodge employed 60-inch leaf spring suspension systems which worked to reduce spring stress for heavy hauling ability while also providing improved ride quality.

47RH NV4500 And NP241

Completing the powertrain package for ’94 Dodge offered the 47RH automatic transmission a four-speed with overdrive that had morphed out of the 46RH (A518) and the venerable NV4500 manual transmission. An electronically controlled lockup converter which effectively coupled the engine to the transmission in fourth gear was used in the 47RH while a 12.3-inch diameter clutch was employed with the NV4500 five-speed manual. On 4x4 models the New Process NP241 transfer case was used a unit with a low gear ratio of 2.72:1 and that could be engaged on the fly.

How Did It Stack Up?

On top of rewriting the book on styling and strength the ’94 Ram claimed top honors for towing payload horsepower and torque ratings. Ford wouldn’t be able to answer the challenge until the Super Duty arrived in 1998 and GM wouldn’t until its new HD line debuted in 2000. Upon its arrival a regular cab 2500 or 3500 configuration Ram spec’d with the V-10 boasted a best-in-class 19000-pound gross combined weight rating (GCWR). Max payload tipped the scales at 5290 pounds for 4x2 regular cab 3500s. By 1997 Cummins-powered 4x2 versions of the 2500 and 3500 models featured a 20000-pound GCWR which still handily held the lead over Ford and GM.

Perpetual Popularity

In terms of sales the ’94 Ram was an instant hit outselling the ’93 truck by roughly 137000 units. By 1995 Dodge was selling more than 400000 Rams a year. With this many Rams on the road (and also off of it…) the aftermarket rallied in support of the new platform. Cummins-powered versions of the ’94-’98 Ram 2500 and 3500’s are still coveted by tens of thousands of enthusiasts today and it enjoys strong aftermarket support for performance and suspension upgrades.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2NlbGVicml0eS1uZXdzL3BpY3R1cmVzL2hhbGxtYXJrcy13aGVuLWNhbGxzLXRoZS1oZWFydC1jYXN0cy1kYXRpbmctaGlzdG9yeS1waWNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hallmark's 'When Calls the Heart' Cast's Dating History: Pics,"Hearties rejoice! Hope Valley is full of love triangles and complex love stories but the cast of When Calls the Heart’s real-life romances aren’t quite as hard to keep track of.

Erin Krakow Chris McNally and Kevin McGarry are just some of the Hallmark Channel stars who have become family over the show’s more than nine season run. The series which got picked up in June 2022 for season 10 made its premiere in 2014.

During that time the protagonist Elizabeth Thatcher (Krakow) has found love more than once — settling down with Lucas Bouchard (McNally) during season 8 after having to choose between him and Nathan Grant (McGarry). Off screen however Krakow has been much quieter about her love life.

In fact the A Cinderella Story actress hasn’t shared much of any of her romantic liaisons with her fans via social media. McNally has been equally as hush-hush about his relationship with fellow Hallmark star Julie Gonzalo.

In January 2019 the actor confirmed he was seeing someone but didn’t reveal it was his Sweetest Heart costar. “I am mostly focusing on the puppies” McNally told My Devotional Thoughts at the time. “My girlfriend and I each adopted a puppy so I’m looking forward to being home with them when I can.”

Three years later Gonzalo surprised fans when she shared that the couple had welcomed their first child. “Our hearts are full … Welcome baby M ♥️” the Christmas With the Kranks star captioned the June 2022 snap tagging her beau in the picture.

Krakow was quick to send her well-wishes to her TV husband commenting with three smiling face with hearts emojis. Andrea Brooks who has starred alongside McNally since he joined the show in 2019 added a series of pink heart emojis.

McGarry who joined the series as the beloved Mountie in 2019 found love while appearing on the Hallmark drama. News broke in November 2020 that the Wedding Veil actor was dating When Calls the Heart’s Kayla Wallace.

The duo who also costarred in 2022’s Feeling Butterflies have since begun to show off their real-life romance to fans little by little.

“Sunshine of my life the source of 99% of my laughter: my dearest Kevin. Happy Birthday to you 💙” the Snowed in for Christmas actress wrote via Instagram in March 2022 gushing over her man.

Three months later the lovebirds celebrated their series’ renewal in Italy alongside pals Krakow and Ben Rosenbaum.

“News just reached Italy🇮🇹 Mamma Mia! Here we go again! #Season10” Wallace captioned a vacation snap with the crew in Venice. “Congrats to my When Calls the Heart family🌹 #hearties.” The three other actors reposted the image and proceeded to toast the show’s success.

MELBOURNE Australia (AP) — Last year’s Boxing Day hero Scott Boland has retained his spot in Australia’s bowling attack and will line up at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against South Africa beginning Monday.

The fast bowler will return to the scene of his test debut last December with Australia selectors opting for Boland over Josh Hazlewood who continues his recovery from a side strain.

Captain Pat Cummins confirmed Sunday that Australia would stick with the same XI that beat the Proteas by six wickets in just two days in the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane.

“We gave Joshy every chance it just got to a stage where Joshy more than anyone else probably thought he was a bit underdone” Cummins said. “It’s probably the mark of the man that he himself thought ‘I don’t feel quite right’ and pulled himself out of selection.”

Boland has taken 25 wickets in his five tests at an average of 10.36. The 33-year-old Boland ran through England batters with six wickets and allowing only seven runs at the MCG last year to secure man-of-the-match honors on debut to help Australia retain the Ashes.

Australia will be looking to secure its first test series win against South Africa on home soil since 2005-06 by going 2-0 up at the MCG. The third test is in Sydney beginning Jan. 4.

Veteran opener David Warner will become just the 14th Australian to play 100 tests when he lines up against the Proteas. The left-hander will be hoping his milestone match brings about some runs in the red-ball format -- he has not scored a test century since January 2020.

South Africa captain Dean Elgar has confirmed at least one change to his side’s batting lineup but would not say who is in or out ahead of Monday’s toss at the MCG.

While Elgar praises their pace attack as the best in the world South Africa is not making enough runs to give the bowlers a realistic chance. They have scored more than 400 only once this year against Bangladesh.

Their woes were highlighted on the Gabba green-top in the first test.

“Our build-up in Brisbane was brilliant we had two weeks that the guys were actually batting quite well” said the opener who was dismissed for three and two at the Gabba.

“It was a bit of a hiccup that we had (at) the Gabba. But both batting units had that bar one batsman (Travis Head’s 92 for Australia). Going back to the drawing board that was the biggest thing for us . . . “

Marco Jansen appears to be one player who can help South Africa maintain its strong bowling performance.

The 22-year-old Jansen has taken 40 wickets in eight tests at an average of 18 but he’s also grown three centimeters -- just over an inch -- taller than he is listed after having another growth spurt.

The 2.09 meter (6 foot 7-inch) left-armer took 3-32 in the first innings at the Gabba and will be crucial to the Proteas’ chances of hitting back to level the series.

Jansen was a two-sport star as a teen -- a provincial rugby union player in South Africa when he was 16. But the position he played is a surprise.

“I played rugby as a flyhalf” Jansen said of the position often played by smaller speedier guys. “I stopped when I was 16 or 17 and that is when I started growing. I am 209 centimeters now. That was the last time I was officially measured.”

The Proteas had earlier invited Jansen to be a net bowler to help them prepare for tests. He recalled seeing greats Vernon Philander Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel at those sessions and wanted to follow in their footsteps. Now he leans on the current trio of Kagiso Rabada Anrich Nortje and Lungi Ngidi.

“Learning off them is special for me and they have helped me quite a lot” Jansen said. “When I have a few questions they tell me to keep it simple.""

Rabada said Jansen was living up to the challenge.

“He is an X-factor bowler and so natural. Watch him bowl and it is like he could wake up at 3 a.m. and do what he did in the first innings (at the Gabba)” Rabada said. “He is extremely natural. He’s gifted. He’s got height. He’s got pace. He’s got bounce. He can swing the ball. He can nip the ball. What more do you want? And he’s a leftie. That’s pretty rare.”

Editor’s Note: CVS is redefining health care in North America. Once known as the neighborhood pharmacy CVS has grown to become one of the leading health solutions companies in the United States and is uniquely positioned to help tackle some of the country’s most pressing public health challenges. Part of this journey is reshaping what marketing means within CVS. The company has adopted the approach to connect its marketing with a purpose and is driving innovative and impactful initiatives by “putting its heart into every moment of health” for its customers. Broad vision statements like this come to life by digging into the details of the message. The Wise Marketer connected with Diego Vaccarezza VP of Enterprise Media at CVS Health to talk about how CVS is accelerating its journey towards customer centricity.

The Wise Marketer (WM): Let's set a baseline for the conversation. What is the substance and ethos behind this topic title? What in plain language should marketers and businesspeople (as well as consumers) know about what CVS Health is doing here?

Diego Vaccarezza (DV): As we at CVS Health more clearly define ourselves as a health and wellness company the products we carry the services we provide and the initiatives we drive are all inspired by our purpose: bringing our heart to every moment of health. That purpose has evolved over the years through impactful decisions that are rooted in transparency and desire for change – from becoming the first national retail pharmacy to stop selling tobacco products in 2014 to challenging the beauty industry on the negative mental health implications that photoshopped images have on young girls and women with the CVS Beauty Mark nearly 5 years ago to launching our Tested to be Trusted program that tests the vitamins and supplements we sell in 2019.

We also committed the full strength of our enterprise to address the critical needs around COVID. Additionally we remain passionate about health equity including the disparity faced by women. As there are systematic health and societal barriers that create meaningful gaps in women’s overall health and well-being we recently launched a new enterprise initiative HERe For Her and are taking bold steps to address those issues.

WM: Purpose-based marketing has gained lots of attention since the pandemic. There are many reasons for this depending on what you read and who you listen to. Common to most views is that the consumer is placing more emphasis on aligning personal values with what a brand represents. How do you frame this up and what thinking led CVS to this approach?

DV: Consumers are often selecting brands that are not only based on value but that are based on their own values as well. As a company clearly articulating our purpose and infusing those values into our campaigns is more important than ever as it differentiates us from our competitors and also drives brand choice.

We recognize the opportunity we have to reshape how consumers experience health care and we believe that our closeness to our customers in terms of proximity reach and relationships uniquely positions us to deliver solutions that meet their evolving needs. During the pandemic we had a tremendous responsibility of adapting and listening to our customers. We had a clear opportunity to deliver on our purpose – to help people with their health wherever and whenever they need us and to bring our heart to every moment of health – all while being a one-stop destination for our customers and patients. In fact during this time new audiences were introduced to us as a brand because we served as an important resource for COVID-19 testing and vaccine distribution – which served as a first-ever interaction with CVS Pharmacy for many.

What we learned during the pandemic was the importance of working and building with agility being able to pivot and flex to match the needs of the marketplace and ensuring that as a company we’re effectively delivering on those needs.

WM: Will this mission be reflected in print mail in-store promotion etc.? Will there be an omnichannel approach to delivering the message?

DV: Our mission is reflected in everything we do across CVS Health. We touch millions of lives with our in-home in-store and virtual care services as well as through our commitment to underserved communities and we continue to work to keep our customers connected to us by ensuring they are part of our ongoing communications efforts that tell the broader brand story.

Our forward-thinking marketing strategies are aimed at providing greater quality simplicity and choice – meeting people where they are with personalized solutions that are seamless connected and increasingly digital. This has been especially apparent since the start of the pandemic as there has been a shift toward online and mobile transactions. We’ve leaned heavily into our digital capabilities and are leveraging strategic partnerships to expand our offerings to address this shift and meet our customers wherever whenever and however they need.

A great example of our omnichannel approach is the CVS Media Exchange (cMx) our data-led technology-driven media network that enables advertisers (CPG brand suppliers) to reach CVS shoppers through a variety of digital platforms including CVS.com social media networks programmatic displays and off-site search engines.

WM: What points of engagement will be introduced to make sure people (customers) understand CVS? How will CVS gain consumer involvement and buy-in for this message?

DV: Our marketing team represents the voice of the customer ensuring their needs are always the focus of the work that we do. It’s our goal to make sure that the customer’s journey experience and points of engagement are clean and friction-less the message resonates and customer feedback is absorbed to better inform our strategy moving forward. As we collaborate on this cross functional level we’re constantly evolving our marketing strategies to be even more laser-focused on connecting brands with real people on their wellness journey.

For example to further our connection and engagement with customers we’re especially proud of our partnership with IBM Watson Advertising. We’re partnering with them to develop a connection with consumers that drives awareness of flu shot offerings cough cold and flu medications and to position our company as a trusted health partner. Using IBM Watson’s AI-powered tool we’re able to predict flu risk down to a U.S. ZIP code which enables us to leverage predictive illness data promote awareness and recommendations for flu prevention in at-risk communities and reach consumers with targeted messaging to help them access resources from their local pharmacy.

WM: What do you think is the biggest healthcare challenge to US consumers and how is this mission providing to address the challenges?

DV: One challenge that U.S. consumers face is health equity and we believe that everyone should have a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. To us health equity is not a series of programs. It is a way of doing business which is why we are committed to leveraging the totality of our knowledge assets and expertise to advance health equity for our colleagues consumers clients and the communities we serve.

Women face serious health care gaps from systemic barriers created by high health care costs and access issues to health challenges related to a greater risk of chronic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened these challenges. As part of our recently launched enterprise initiative HERe For Her we’re taking these steps to address these disparities:

We are reducing CVS Health brand period products by 25% or more



We are covering the cost of the tax on menstrual products in 12 states



We are taking an active stance on the ‘Pink Tax’ ensuring fair and equitable pricing for men’s and women’s like products



We are offering new menstrual and menopause services through Minute Clinic as well as launching virtual care services 7 days a week



We are providing access to mental health support through Aetna when it’s most convenient to her

WM: Anything else that we didn't mention here?

DV: Our marketing team acts partially as the coach and the quarterback of our broader team at CVS. It takes a village for an enterprise campaign that highlights the value of our integrated products and service offerings. We are a health care company with a retail pharmacy a retail clinic a health insurance offering a PBM a Specialty pharmacy at-home and virtual care and a score of other resources that can support consumers on their health journey – and we’re proud to continue building a world of health care around each and every person we serve.

To do this teams in the field and across digital legal and clinical creative media and PR are all aligned towards that common goal and I’m looking forward to all of the great work we have in store for the future as we continue working towards our purpose.

There was plenty of back-and-forth action between the pair and neither man was able to score any points in order to win a definitive decision. Instead it went to the judges and they declared Jones to be the winner a decision that the majority of fans at home seemed to agree with as well.

They then shared the podium at the event after Meregali defeated Rafael Lovato Jr in the third-place match and Jones lost the final to Kaynan Duarte on points. With Meregali training under John Danaher for ADCC 2022 and representing New Wave Jiu-Jitsu at the event there was already a built-in storyline when he came up against former Danaher student and the founder of B-Team Jiu-Jitsu in Jones. It seems as though Nicholas Meregali and Craig Jones were happy to see that story play out further when they both agreed to a rematch at the upcoming Who’s Number One event on February 25th 2023.

The match was set to serve as the co-main event underneath another rematch that fans are dying to see Gordon Ryan v Felipe Pena 4. The event itself will still go ahead as planned and the main event is unaffected although there has not yet been a new co-main event confirmed for it. The winner of the under 99kg division at ADCC 2022 Kaynan Duarte has publicly offered to replace Jones against Meregali in February but the challenge was rejected and neither Jones or Meregali will compete at the event.

The news that the Nicholas Meregali v Craig Jones rematch was being postponed was announced in a post to the official Instagram account of FloGrappling:",,,,,,

❄ As rain/snow falls New Jersey is bracing for arctic cold

❄ Chief Meteorologist Dan Zarrow is mapping out the holiday weekend weather for NJ

Severe winter weather descending on much of the country early Friday rolled into New Jersey in the form of heavy rains and strong winds leaving flood-prone areas underwater.

Hoboken was dealing with ""high water conditions"" around 9 a.m. which prompted NJ Transit train delays according to a tweet by the transit agency.

Another North Jersey community Edgewater was largely submerged early Friday as seen in a video clip tweeted by HudPost:

In Middlesex County Perth Amboy dealt with intense flooding as seen in video posted to Twitter by Collin Gross:

Atlantic County also had a fair amount of flooding issues on Friday.

A Philadelphia Inquirer reporter shared video of back bay street flooding in Ventnor Heights to Twitter:

In Egg Harbor Township police said about 30 people had to be evacuated from motels in the West Atlantic City area along the Black Horse Pike using a raised military grade vehicle.

West Atlantic City and Bargaintown Fire Departments helped in the efforts involving the Travel Inn Travel Lodge the New Sea Breeze and the Economy Inn.

The American Red Cross also responded to provide assistance for those being evacuated.

Two abandoned vehicles stuck in the flood waters along the Black Horse Pike were towed to the Egg Harbor Township Impound Lot.

No injuries were reported in that situation.

By late Friday morning flood waters had begun to recede but the Black Horse Pike remained closed in both directions between Athens Avenue and Bayport Drive.

Repeated flooding was expected Friday night with the next high tide cresting around 8:15 p.m. police said.

This will enable John Deere to accelerate the availability of 5G in its largest manufacturing facilities in North America.

Rural counties are often left behind in the race to implement broadband – even though is necessary to process large quantities of data and enable advances in smart manufacturing Internet of Things (IoT) Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other breakthrough technologies in these areas. By obtaining these licenses John Deere will boost its wireless networks by providing access to 5G in its manufacturing facilities.

“John Deere has always focused on how to empower customers to do more with less by using technology and our focus on tech goes way beyond the fields. It impacts everything single aspect of our business and we’re constantly looking at ways to improve our own efficiencies and outcomes with it” said Jahmy Hindman Chief Technology Officer. “Implementing 5G in our manufacturing facilities allows John Deere to make significant progress in our Smart Industrial strategy by turning factories into smart and connected manufacturing facilities – a critical piece of the industrial IoT.”

John Deere’s manufacturing facilities are extraordinarily complex environments that rely on automation and connectivity. With miles of embedded Ethernet cables connecting Wi-Fi drop points currently in factory ceilings the facilities are faced with limited flexibility for set up and upgrades. 5G enabled by private networks will allow John Deere to design a more flexible nimble and connected facility creating opportunity for further advancement and greater efficiency that will transform the manufacturing process.

Private 5G technology also creates the opportunity to expand factory capabilities leveraging edge computing analytics and autonomous devices and empowers a larger set of smart applications like real-time location systems asset tracking inventory management wearables building automation and robotics for operational cost savings.

(Gabriele Holtermann-Gorden/Sipa/Newscom)

In June 2019 tractors were parked on Broadway Avenue to protest the New York City Council's foie gras ban. (Gabriele Holtermann-Gorden/Sipa/Newscom)

New York City's terrible foie gras ban passed in 2019 at the urging of animal-rights groups is on life support.

In an order issued last week the state's agriculture department found the city's ban on the sale of foie gras violates state law. The order blasts ""the City's effort to use its police powers and business regulatory authority to bar the sale of a lawfully produced farm product—not for reasons of the health safety or welfare of its citizens—but to change animal husbandry practices occurring on farms outside its jurisdiction to which it objects.""

The order which characterizes the ban as ""unusual"" ""unreasonabl[e]"" and ""legislative overreach"" gives New York City 30 days to appeal. If the city fails to do so within a month—the city says it's pondering its next move—then the order will become final.

While I welcome the likely death of the city's foie gras ban—and hated the very idea of it—news of its seemingly imminent demise comes as no great surprise. That's because the city was put on notice years ago that its foie gras ban is illegal.

""[T]he state's Department of Agriculture and Markets informed New York City two years ago that its foie gras ban 'directly and unreasonably restricts Plaintiffs' farming operations in violation of' state law"" I explained in a column earlier this year that detailed the filing of a lawsuit challenging the city ban.

This month's order issued by that same state agriculture department and saying virtually the exact same thing should make that fact abundantly clear to any elected official in New York City who hasn't been paying attention. The ban is illegal.

As the agriculture department details New York State law ""protects farmers against local laws which unreasonably restrict farm operations located within an agricultural district."" The key issue in such cases the department explains is whether a local law in question protects the health and safety of its residents. If it doesn't then the local law is illegal.

In its order the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets notes that in 2020 it ""invited [New York] City to submit documentation or other evidence to support any claimed public health or safety threats related to… production of 'force-fed' livestock products.""

Instead New York City essentially sat on its hands for two years before thumbing its nose at the state.

""The City made no factual submissions to the Department"" the order notes. Instead the order says the city claimed that the state agriculture department ""lacks jurisdiction"" to ""supersede"" New York City's local ban.

The agriculture department's order is the latest (and most serious) rebuke. In the aforementioned lawsuit filed in May by two New York State foie gras farms the plaintiffs argue the ban violates state law and could cost hundreds of Upstate farming jobs—not to mention restaurant jobs in the city itself—if it were to take effect. But it didn't take effect. In September a New York state judge enjoined the city from enforcing the ban while the case makes its way through the courts. That means city restaurants have continued to sell foie gras legally despite the ban.

This month's order then likely signals the demise of a ban that never even took effect.

Sergio Saravia of La Belle Farm one of the plaintiffs told The New York Times the order is ""a weight off our shoulders.""

""[T]he order stops local municipalities from establishing a dangerous precedent of dictating to us what farmers can grow and what people can eat"" said Marcus Henley of Hudson Valley Foie Gras another of the plaintiffs. ""It's great news for farmers and fine diners everywhere.""

While New York City Mayor Eric Adams hasn't yet said whether the city will fight the order he's previously lauded the ban.

""The days of foie gras are gone and foie-gotten in New York City"" the punny Adams tweeted in 2019 after the New York City Council passed the ban. ""A new law will END this cruel practice in our city for good.""

In addition to the demise of New York City's ban the U.S. Supreme Court may finally hear a challenge to California's terrible ban on the sale of foie gras in that entire state. Earlier this week Reason Foundation submitted an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff foie gras producers who are challenging the California law. That means 2023 could spell the end of two of America's worst food bans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR0bnBmLmNvbS9hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS93ZWIvYWcvbmV3cy9mYXJtLWxpZmUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2Zyb2VsaWNoLXRyYWN0b3ItMTg5MHMtdmlsbGFnZS1tdXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Froelich Tractor and 1890s Village Museum: A Must See for Many Reasons,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR0bnBmLmNvbS9hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS93ZWIvYWcvbmV3cy9mYXJtLWxpZmUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2Zyb2VsaWNoLXRyYWN0b3ItMTg5MHMtdmlsbGFnZS1tdXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224E50280>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The initial investigation into price trends on late-model loaders quickly established that they share a common characteristic with tractor loaders beyond both being loaders.

As is the case with ag equipment the lack of manufacturing components and supplies has hampered the production of new construction equipment such as wheel loaders which has led to buyers readily gobbling up late-model used loaders. That has led to inflated used asking prices or final bids that are sometimes double or triple what they were three to four years ago.

A great example of this is a 2018 Deere Model 544K showing 1312 hours and equipped with a 105-inch bucket that sold at a recent Steffes Group auction. The final bid for this wheel loader was $141000.

That final bid was easily 30% to 40% higher than wheel loader bids experienced just a year ago. This inflationary spiral is repeatedly witnessed in the asking values of similar-size 2018 wheel loaders featured in the Pocket Guide. Note the Deere 644Ks listed there and their $114900 to $324995 asking price spread. The recent demand for new homes during the COVID-19 crisis helped fuel this price spiral.

The good news is the industry is beginning to see the prices for late-model used construction iron soften.

Significantly Higher Hours

If you are in the market for a wheel loader and haven't bought a used one before be ready for some hour shock. Unlike farm tractors construction gear (skid steers telehandlers and wheel loaders in particular) is in almost constant use during the year. After settling on the general size loader you want pay close attention to engine hours when shopping. It is not unusual for example to have a five-year-old loader that has racked up 10000 to 12000 hours."

The Lufthansa Group appears poised to win the contest for the state-owned carrier even after an apparent loss this fall to the private equity-backed bid of Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines.

A new decree from the Italian government which is expected to be signed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Friday specifies that an airline must lead the equity investment in ITA reports Italian daily Corriere della Sera. That change would effectively leave Lufthansa as the sole bidder given the capital in Air France-KLM and Delta’s bid comes entirely from Certares. And while the latter could restructure their offer Air France-KLM is barred from investing in other airlines until it repays the coronavirus aid it received from the French and Dutch governments something that is not scheduled before May 2025.

Lufthansa had planned to be a minority investor in ITA teaming with shipping giant MSC in its initial bid. However after Italy reopened the privatization to the group MSC bowed out in November and left Lufthansa to go it alone.

The group intends to invest €230-240 million ($244-255 million) for an initial 40 percent stake in ITA Corriere della Sera has reported. Lufthansa intends to take full control of the Italian airline in the future.

A Lufthansa spokesperson declined to comment.

A deal for ITA would achieve a long sought goal of Lufthansa: To secure a piece of Italy’s national airline. The group has been maneuvering for part of Alitalia and now ITA that replaced Alitalia in October 2021 since at least 2008. More recently CEO Carsten Spohr has said his group is the “natural home” for ITA amid repeated public overtures for the airline. The Lufthansa Group is already Europe’s largest airline conglomerate including its namesake carrier plus Austrian Airlines Brussels Airlines Eurowings and Swiss.

Lufthansa’s interest in ITA comes with good reason. Italy as Spohr put it in July is the “most important market beyond our home markets.” In 2019 the country was the fourth largest in the European Union by passengers after Spain Germany and France. The Lufthansa Group already has an Italian subsidiary Air Dolomiti that feeds Lufthansa’s hubs in Frankfurt and Munich from a bevy of Italian cities but ITA would give it a much larger share of the market plus slots at key airports including Milan Linate and Rome Fiumicino.

Air France-KLM and Delta were seen as the victors of ITA’s “beauty contest” when their consortium was selected as the preferred bidder in the final days of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government. The two airlines were to handle the commercial side of the deal which was expected to include ITA’s integration into their transatlantic joint venture with Virgin Atlantic. However the consortium and the new Meloni government were unable to finalize an agreement before the exclusivity period ended in October reopening the competition to Lufthansa.

And as the process dragged on Air France-KLM appears to have found a more attractive takeover target: TAP Air Portugal. “We’re very comfortable with the Iberian peninsula and TAP could be [an] option for us to have a larger presence” CEO Ben Smith said in October adding that the group plans to “definitely engage” with the Portuguese government when it is ready to talk. Reports have also indicated that TAP is in a better financial position than ITA which makes it potentially more attractive to Air France-KLM.

What could a Lufthansa-ITA deal mean? First it would undoubtedly result in more flight connectivity between Italy and the Lufthansa Group’s core hubs — Brussels Frankfurt Munich Vienna and Zurich. It would also increase the group’s share of European capacity by about a point to nearly 10 percent; the largest of the continent’s three big airline groups but still behind discounters including EasyJet and Ryanair. And ITA would almost certainly eventually join Lufthansa’s transatlantic joint venture with Air Canada and United Airlines as well as the Star Alliance (it is currently a member of SkyTeam).

However the deal may not be everything Lufthansa management hopes for its bottom line. The group has a checkered past acquiring airlines in the name of consolidation and greater market clout in order to boost its finances. Only Swiss has consistently produced strong profit margins amid its dealmaking.

The Chicago-developer led by Andy Gloor and Keating Crown revised its design by adding 14 floors to the office project planned for 330 North Green Street Urbanize Chicago reported.

Designs now call for a 32-story mixed-use tower with 22700 square feet of retail and 720000 square feet of office space to occupy the property spanning a full block. Previous plans were for an 18-story office building called The Porch.

Efforts to get approval for the rezoning of the property needed to start the project show Sterling Bay like other developers isn’t removing any chips from office building bets in Fulton Market — the only cluster of office properties in the city to ward off vacancy amid the pandemic and increase their occupancy — despite the challenges presented to the asset class in Chicago as a whole.

It’s also the latest example of Fulton Market’s buildings and Sterling Bay in particular producing taller buildings in the neighborhood. Some of the pioneers of the area such as Jeff Shapack have packed office buildings including 167 North Green full of tenants across 17 stories at that property and Thor Equities built an 19-story property at 800 West Fulton Market.

Sterling Bay’s tower at 330 North Green which is being designed by Gensler will rise 503 feet. Average tenant floors will be 29000 to 30000 square feet and have ceilings more than 13 feet high. Each floor will also have two 450-square-foot terraces. The podium will hold the retail portion 40000 square feet of amenities and parking.

The Chicago Plan Commission Committee on Zoning and City Council still need to approve the plans. Sterling Bay’s website has an estimated completion date of 2025.

The property located across the street from another Sterling Bay project at 333 North Green is immediately south of Metra tracks and bound by West Wayman and North Peoria streets.

Those who bet big on nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in order to own a small piece of the internet — be it for a profile picture a metaverse avatar or just for bragging rights — generally lost a lot of money. One report estimates the volume of NFTs across all marketplaces including OpenSea Rarible and CryptoPunks went down from almost $6 billion in January to less than $1 billion in October.

But some NFT investors lost far more than others by rushing into the hype surrounding Web3 — the so-called third generation of the internet in which users supposedly have more agency and ownership through decentralized mechanisms like the blockchain.

From Pakistan to Brazil Rest of World took a glimpse at 10 of the world’s most spectacular NFT-related downfalls in 2022 whether it was because the asset’s price plummeted its usefulness hit its limits or its user base didn’t prove large enough.

1. BollyCoin

A fall of 93% from peak value of $0.2 within 357 days.

Indian film superstar Salman Khan announced in late 2021 that he was backing BollyCoin an NFT marketplace created by fellow actor and filmmaker Atul Agnihotri. BollyCoin auctioned memorabilia from India’s massive film industry Bollywood. With an average of 2000 movies released each year and a billion consumers worldwide Bollywood seemed like it would provide an infinite catalog of movie stills and posters to mint as NFTs for devoted fans. The marketplace sold 20 million BollyCoins the crypto tokens needed to buy NFTs on the eponymous marketplace. A million BollyCoins were sold within the first three hours of its launch. At its peak BollyCoin’s price was $0.2. But collapse came swiftly; not even the April launch of a collection of 200 NFTs featuring the Dabangg franchise one of Khan’s most successful film series was able to sustain the token’s price. By the year’s end the BollyCoin’s price had fallen by almost 93% and almost no bids for the marketplace’s NFTs had been placed.

2. Comedy Monsters Club

A total wipeout in value within 386 days.

In late November 2021 Venezuelan stand-up comedian Bobby Cardoso announced the upcoming launch of the Comedy Monsters Club or CMC a private club with online and offline perks that required the purchase of an NFT to become a member. Membership included access to special live events and other perks. The collection featured “monsters” reminiscent of the characters of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The project sold about 10% of its entire collection before losing steam. Cardoso and his co-founders blamed falling crypto prices and chose to sell the NFTs without using cryptocurrencies via credit card payments for about $300 each. Club members claim Cardoso and his partners gathered more than $1.5 million from them before going dark on Discord and Twitter. Shortly after Cardoso and partners announced they were temporarily suspending the project. Users and crypto enthusiasts worry this could now be one of Latin America’s largest NFT scams.

3. Captain Tsubasa

Projected to be sold at a value of 1 ether (around $3000 when the NFT was listed) but delisted within 25 days.

Tsubasa Co. the Japanese company behind Captain Tsubasa — the famous football manga and anime from the 80s — sued a Singaporean company called Football Metaverse in mid-June for selling NFTs of its characters without approval. Soon after Football Metaverse said it had received approval from a former official Chinese distributor of the manga and kept promoting the NFTs on Twitter and Discord. It ended up removing the unauthorized Captain Tsubasa NFTs. Since then Tsubasa Co. has announced the launch of its own yet-to-be-released NFT of the character. The whole affair is similar to the NFT copyright infringement issues surrounding other Japanese characters like those from Dragon Ball Z and Pokémon.

4. ‘Friendship Ended With Mudasir’ Meme NFT

A fall of over 96% from peak value of $51000 within 506 days.

Muhammad Asif Raza Rana a Pakistani government worker accidentally created a meme in 2015 when he posted a photoshopped picture of himself and a new best friend on Facebook. In mid-2021 he sold the image as an NFT for more than $52000 to Andrew Kang the co-founder of a crypto investment firm and an enthusiast of internet culture. The sale was considered a gateway transaction in the opening of the Web3 market in the country — a responsibility that proved too great for a single meme which has now lost more than 96% of its worth.

5. Simibebés NFT

126 days from launch only to reach 22 sales

Videos of Dr. Simi the mascot of Latin America’s largest drugstore chain gather millions of views on YouTube. The character recently went viral on TikTok and Twitter after Mexican fans started throwing Dr. Simi plush toys at celebrities as they performed on stage. The mascot’s owners saw NFT collections as a natural next step for this internet sensation. To celebrate the opening of its 8000th store in August the company launched an NFT series of Dr. Simi claiming it was the first pharmaceutical company ever to join the metaverse. It was a failure: Of the 7864 NFTs available only 22 were sold by mid-December.

6. Dekotora NFT

A fall of over 50% from peak value of 1 ether ($1200) within 96 days from launch to its first and only sale

Short for “decorative truck” Dekotora art emerged in the 80s and 90s in Japan. The genre consists of artists who decorate semi-trailer trucks with neon lights patterned fabrics and bright paint to turn the vehicles into moving works of art. Though revered this style of decoration has become less popular in the past few decades. To keep it alive through financially aiding the few drivers who still make a living by decorating and driving the trucks the Utamarokai Japan’s largest association of Dekotora truck owners and fans launched an NFT collection in April. Despite the stunning artwork and the promise to raise money for disaster relief only one of the 38 Dekotora NFTs have been sold by the year’s end. The rest worth 0.5 ether (about $600) each have no bidders.

7. Metapurse’s B.20 token

A fall of over 95.5% from peak value of $29 within 544 days.

The auction of the “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” NFT by the digital artist Beeple for $69 million in March 2021 launched the NFT craze into the mainstream. The identities of the buyers who bid under the pseudonyms Metakovan and Twobadour were quickly revealed through a Substack post by the buyers themselves: Vignesh Sundaresan and Anand Venkateswaran two Indian investors. They both ran a crypto-focused company called Metapurse which tokenized and packaged several NFT art pieces. Metapurse created its own token called B.20 which traded at about $29 right after the Beeple acquisition. At the time the company had $189 million in digital assets under management 27 employees several metaverse projects and art installations. With the crypto downturn Sundaresan and Venkateswaran who have dissolved their partnership are stuck with Beeple’s artwork (the most expensive NFT ever sold) and the B.20 token which nowadays trades at $0.09.

8. Decentraland’s MANA token

A fall of over 94.2% from peak value of $5.1 within 390 days.

One of the most hyped places to use an NFT is Decentraland a metaverse founded by Argentine software engineers in 2017 that operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Seemingly everyone wanted a piece of it during the crypto bull market. For up to $15000 parcels of 16 square meters of digital land were available for sale as NFTs and brands like Dolce & Gabbana were part of a digital Fashion Week that drew about 108000 visitors in four days. But aside from headline-making online events user adoption hasn’t grown: Data from Decentraland shows an average 8000 daily unique visitors to the site. The platform launched a property rental feature in mid-December attempting to fuel interest in its digital real estate but only about 7% of the 90000 available parcels have received visitors. After its peak in November 2021 the price of Decentraland’s MANA the token needed to buy NFT properties and other assets on the site has been in free fall.

9. Ape Kids Football Club

A fall of over 90% from peak value of $650 within 146 days.

Despite it being a World Cup year football-themed crypto assets dropped the ball. Even the Argentine Football Association’s fan crypto token plummeted in value despite Argentina winning the tournament. NFTs for other football clubs didn’t fare much better. Liverpool F.C. was the first club to launch and auction a digital asset collection in March; 90% of them went unsold. A Chelsea F.C. coach created a collection called Ape Kids Football Club (AKFC) that traded above $650 after its launch in February. By mid-year despite being promoted by Serie A and Premier League players AKFC’s price had plunged 90% in value; it traded at about $118 in mid-December. National soccer teams also caught the NFT fever and are now reeling: The Brazilian Football Confederation (CFC) partnered with Turkish company Bitci to launch its fan crypto token and NFT collection in 2021. By November 2022 Brazilian outlets claimed the CFC had terminated its contract with Bitci due to several months of missed payments.

10. OpenSea

A fall of almost 30% in market share in a year.

NFT marketplaces were all the rage in the crypto space at the start of 2022. OpenSea a popular NFT marketplace held 90% of the market share in NFT transactions by volume in February when an unknown attacker hit it with a phishing scam due to a breach of information at Customer.io the platform’s email vendor. The attacker stole more than $1.7 million worth of NFTs. The attack took place over about three hours and wiped out 254 NFTs including some from the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Decentraland. Although the attacker later returned the stolen NFTs — with flipped prices — to their original owners the breach concerned OpenSea’s users. They started trying out other marketplaces like LooksRare Magic Eden and X2Y2. Magic Eden now enjoys about 11% of market share partly because it has a much lower sales fee than OpenSea: 0.50% versus 2.5%. OpenSea now has about 66% market share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL3RleGFzL2RhbGxhcy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2NoZWNrLW91dC1kYWxsYXMtZm9ydC13b3J0aHMtYmlnZ2VzdC1vZmZpY2Utc2FsZXMtb2YtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TRD Pro: Top Dallas Office Sales of 2022,"Dallas/Fort Worth was named the top CRE market in the nation this year and the city’s 10 largest office sales raked in over $1.58 billion.

Experts claim that there are good days ahead for proptech companies as real estate buying and sale continues to get increasingly onboarded on digital platforms.

Digital search is for initial search and to narrow down choice

The pandemic had accelerated online home buying but real estate shopping has not entirely become a digital phenomenon anywhere in the world including India. Digital platforms are still used for initial search and discovery but deals are always closed in person. Online searches help people narrow down searches. Consumers are still attached to the traditional habit of physical site visits as big-ticket investments like a home are not done on impulse and require the tangible essence of touch and feel.

House-buying will remain hybrid

People are slowly getting used to the concept of touring their future homes through immersive virtual tours and buying the idea of making a booking online looking at the convenience security and transparency of digital payment platforms. But they will still prefer to continue with the offline mode for crucial fact checks like due diligence or quality inspection unless maximum information and data are provided to them. In a nutshell buying homes on the internet is still in a nascent stage and will take some time to become a reality.

Indian proptech: a reality check

Like major economies in the world the rate of technology adoption is still in its initial phases in Indian real estate. However the proptech market has seen a steep jump over the past two years and the uptrend will continue to unravel in the times to come. Proptech has already made deep inroads into every aspect of real estate from search and discovery to transactions planning and design to construction techniques and rental and property management. 2023 could see steady growth in proptech companies claim stakeholders. “In 2023 we will see more partnerships amongst key stakeholders such as property advisors developers private equity investors and technology solution providers. Key areas in proptech value chain such as IoT AI blockchain AR hospitality tech will continue to see increased interest. Meanwhile the IPO and valuation-driven approach which we have been witnessing over the past sometimes might slow down. The focus will be more on unit economies and creating solutions for mass problems” Ankit Kansal Founder and MD 360 Realtors told Business Today.

Proptech stands to gain from rising home-buying sentiments

Increasing interest in homebuying is likely to have a direct effect on proptech. Ashwinder R Singh CEO of residential Bhartiya Urban told Business Today: “With PE funding increasing by five per cent in H1 2022 from an already higher base of H1 2021. The momentous shift in 2022 in the proptech has been that the scope has widened from only property aggregators to VR platforms for virtual site visits enhancing the sales process robotic inspection at the construction site and advisory and transactional support for investors. Co-living platforms have again picked up with many offices opening up.”





Tech in property and cost-cuts

Developers tenants landlords and other real estate stakeholders are fast adapting to proptech to lower operating costs. However proper implementation of technology could lead to better search and smarter decisions. Deepak Kushwaha Principal Partner and Head of Engineering Square Yards told Business Today: “AR/VR 3D tours and drones to facilitate better search and discovery of properties big data AI ML and Analytics to understand consumer behaviour and assess current trends and risks and blockchain for secure and transparent transactions are some of the trends that will drive proptech in India. While metaverse is a new trend and leaders are experimenting with its possibilities it will unlock exciting opportunities for consumers to buy real estate and make digital wallet payments in the future. All these exciting developments have increased investors’ appetite around the growth of proptech with the market pegged to touch USD 1 trillion by 2030.”

High-growth indication for Indian real estate

Indian real estate went through some turbulent times for the past couple of years but 2022 was a year of recovery and growth across demand supply sales prices and capital investments. Narayan Bhadana Managing Director 4S Developers told Business Today: “The real estate industry is rapidly adjusting to the data-focused strategy and progressing with the creation of client segments for the application of AI. Integration of new technologies such as AI to assess client behaviour and monetise the services in accordance with new-age client demands. The Indian real estate sector is predicted to reach $1 trillion in market size by 2030 up from $200 billion in 2021 and contribute 13% of the country’s GDP by 2025. Primarily this can be attributed to the escalating demand for residential properties due to rapid urbanisation and inflating disposable incomes of individuals.”",,,

After the pop star encouraged fans to vote in the 2018 midterm elections Ms. Smith registered. The 23-year-old’s most recent rite of passage — getting her first credit card — was also prompted by the singer.

When the 11-time Grammy winner announced her Eras Tour her first in five years Ms. Smith said she knew she had to “do everything in my power to be able to get tickets.” So she signed up for a card through Capital One which partnered with Ms. Swift to promote the tour and offered fans preferential access to presale tickets.

“Taylor Swift was once again that push” said Ms. Smith who lives in Pittsburgh. In addition to getting concert tickets she hoped the card would help her to build good credit. “As I signed up because of the Taylor presale I realized the importance of financial literacy and maybe it should be pushed more in schools and colleges” she said. Ms. Smith who has cerebral palsy was able to get four accessible seats for her and her friends for about $1013 though she used her debit card because the total exceeded her credit card’s limit.

COLUMBIA S.C. — A major provider of electricity in the South Carolina Midlands is urging residents to be judicious with their energy use due to a high demand recently placed on the grid due to extremely cold weather.

Dominion Energy is advising residents to take various precautions to help protect the stability of the electric grid since record-low temperatures have led to heavy use of the utility.

“We are feeling the effects of historically cold temperatures as our customers are running their heating units extra hard trying to keep warm” Dominion Energy South Carolina President Keller Kissam said in a statement provided by the utility. “Our top priority is keeping every one of our customers safe and warm while our team works hard to manage this situation.""

Dominion reports that ways to decrease energy use include setting thermostats to 68 degrees or lower turning off non-essential lights unplugging nonessential appliances and devices limiting the use of major power-consuming appliances and equipment and ensuring central heating unit vents are unobstructed.

Santee Cooper announces rolling outages to protect grid

Elsewhere in the state another electricity provider Santee Cooper is making a similar ask but is already warning of more drastic measures. Santee Cooper announced on Saturday morning that as necessary it would be implementing ""temporary managed and coordinated 30-minute rolling outages"" across the system to help manage the strain on the power grid.

“There is never a good time to implement this type of action and we apologize for any inconvenience that these temporary interruptions may cause for those who rely on our power especially during this holiday period” president and CEO Jimmy Staton said in a statement the utility provided.

The move will also impact electric cooperatives that get their power from Santee Cooper the city of Georgetown and the town of Bamberg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3dsb3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcG93ZXItb3V0YWdlLXZpcmdpbmlhLXdpbnRlci1zdG9ybS13ZWF0aGVyLTEwMGstdmlyZ2luaWFucy1kb21pbmlvbi1lbmVyZ3ktYXBwYWxhY2hpYW4tcG93ZXItZGVjZW1iZXItMjAyMtIBigFodHRwczovL3dsb3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3Bvd2VyLW91dGFnZS12aXJnaW5pYS13aW50ZXItc3Rvcm0td2VhdGhlci0xMDBrLXZpcmdpbmlhbnMtZG9taW5pb24tZW5lcmd5LWFwcGFsYWNoaWFuLXBvd2VyLWRlY2VtYmVyLTIwMjI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Over 50K Virginians without power,"LAST UPDATED: 12:30 a.m. Saturday

According to the Axios report Bloomberg sees News Corp-owned (NWSA.O) Dow Jones also the publisher of Barron’s and MarketWatch as the ideal fit but would buy the Post if the Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos was interested in selling.

Bloomberg LP the Washington Post and Dow Jones did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Shares of News Corp were up 3% in a broadly weaker market.

In October Rupert Murdoch started a process that could reunite his media empire News Corp and Fox Corp (FOXA.O) nearly a decade after the companies split.

The proposal has however met with stern opposition from several shareholders who say a combination on its own would fail to realise the full value of News Corp and have instead suggested a spin-off of the media company’s digital real estate business or Dow Jones as an alternative to the merger.

Craig Huber a media analyst at Huber Research Partners said he would be “shocked” if Murdoch sold the Wall Street Journal and has probably told his family not to sell it either.

“The WSJ is a trophy property to the Murdoch family” he said adding that the speculation is possibly a result of his plan to reunite his media empire.

While the former mayor of New York sees a Dow Jones acquisition as “ideal” he also would be interested in acquiring the Washington Post if owner Jeff Bezos is interested in selling believing the combination would create “a formidable potential competitor to the New York Times” according to the report.

The combination of Dow Jones and Bloomberg Media would create a business news juggernaut bringing together Bloomberg News and its lucrative terminal business with Dow Jones the publisher of financial titles such as the Wall Street Journal Barron’s and MarketWatch.

Dow Jones is owned by News Corp. which also owns the New York Post. Axios said Bloomberg has yet to approach Murdoch about his interest and has not engaged any third parties such as bankers to evaluate the opportunity.

A rep for Bloomberg dismissed the speculation and said: “There’s nothing to comment on.”

“The Washington Post is not for sale” a company spokesperson said.

News Corp declined to comment.

As for Bezos Bloomberg is friendly with the Amazon founder but “not close” a source said.

The Washington Post is expected to lose money this year after losing web subscribers following a Trump-era subscription surge. Last week the company said it expects to impose layoffs in the first quarter of 2023.

Two big software initiatives under Bezos — who bought the paper in 2013 for $250 million — have been sidelined and could be sold which has led some to “wonder how invested Bezos continues to be in the property” Axios reported.

Axios reported on Friday that Bloomberg who owns the Bloomberg media outlet wants to buy one of his fellow billionaires' media companies. He reportedly sees a Dow Jones purchase as the stronger option.

(WMC) - Mid-South developers are looking to address the housing shortage in Eastern Arkansas.

In Crittenden County a near-200 home development is in the works set to break ground in March and city leaders and developers are both excited for what they say will be a domino effect in further economic development.

It’s tall grass and trees right now but 75 acres off I-55 will eventually become 188 homes for the city of Marion.

The Brownstone Estates they’re calling it.

It’s the result of a months-long conversation between D.R. Horton a major construction company out of Texas and the P3 Group out of Memphis led by Dee Brown.

“[D.R. Horton] met with us and wanted to gauge our interest in being a part of the development with them” Brown said.

He says Crittenden County employers like Southland Casino Coca-Cola and the various school districts have had challenges with locating housing for new employees but major developments like this will help solve that.

“It’s going to give people who have been commuting for many years... the opportunity to purchase a nice home and live work and play right in Marion Arkansas” said Brown.

“That growth is very exciting to see” said Tracy Brick the president of the Marion Chamber of Commerce and the incoming mayor of the city.

She said the city’s growth isn’t stopping with the news of Brownstone Estates.

“Another announced housing development of 240 acres that’s to take place over the next two to three years” Brick said. “There’s also another one that is ready to go. That is 40 lots.”

“It’s going to open the door for further economic development” said Brown. “You’re going to generate additional sales tax revenue through grocery stores through gas stations restaurants so it’s a really big deal for the city.”

Brick says the city’s population has doubled since she moved here in the late ‘80s.

Now she says it’s time to grow the commercial sector.

“I’d like to encourage any developers to come over here and shop around. See what we have to offer” the incoming mayor said.

The homes will start around $250000 Brown said reaching as high as $400000 with brand new amenities that would appeal to any prospective homebuyer.

Brown says in March P3 will build the underlying infrastructure like water sewer and roads... selling the land to D.R. Horton to develop the new homes in November.

When 'boundaries' become barriers to just being human,"Jillian Horton is a physician and the author of We Are All Perfectly Fine: A Memoir of Love Medicine and Healing.

Last December early Christmas morning my friend and long-time mentor Dr. Sharon Straus was headed to the hospital. She is the physician-in-chief at St. Michael’s in downtown Toronto the brilliant compassionate leader behind a 475-bed health system that has now been in pandemic mode for almost three years.

She was on the corner of Queen and Victoria when she stopped and squinted. In the distance she recognized a familiar figure: one of her medical residents. He was handing out Tim Hortons gift cards to a group of people who were homeless. She watched him silently her heart full of pride before heading into the building.

She told me that story earlier this month as we were talking about working in the hospital at Christmas.

“Did you write him up for unprofessional boundary-crossing behaviour?” I asked.

We both laughed but not for the reason you might think.

All year long but especially in the season of giving medicine struggles with a problem that is partly of its own making. Even at Christmas many of us don’t know how much we can give.

Who cares if you give a patient a gift? Lots of people apparently.

In 2013 an American doctor named Gordon Schiff wrote an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) about a traumatic experience. After two fruitless hours on the phone with an insurer he’d given a patient money to purchase a medication they could not afford to buy. It wasn’t a loan and there was no coercion – there were just no other options. So Dr. Schiff reached into his pocket and gave the patient a total of $30. In JAMA Dr. Schiff wrote that while he had “hardly expected a commendation for such a simple act of kindness I was completely surprised to find myself being reprimanded for my ‘unprofessional boundary-crossing behaviour’” after the resident he had been working with told the clinic directors about the event. Dr. Schiff’s paper “Crossing Boundaries – Violation or Obligation?” was deemed so important that JAMA took the unusual step of publishing it again in 2020.

Is giving a patient a small amount of money for a prescription somehow different than giving them a Tim Hortons gift card? Dr. Schiff urges us to ask much deeper questions: When do certain “boundaries” become barriers to meaningful caring relationships? And over time do those boundaries make it easier for us to abdicate our deeper responsibilities to respond to suffering and the profound injustices – so vividly highlighted during the pandemic – that cruelly define many of our patients’ lives? That’s precisely why the issue matters so much. If you can’t ever facilitate the purchase of an inexpensive but desperately needed prescription or even buy a patient who is homeless a Tim Hortons gift card on Christmas Day what else are you going to walk away from?

We frame this issue in medical education as “professionalism” – lumping discussions about repugnant predatory behaviour (such as sexually touching patients) in with conversations about pro-social frankly desirable impulses such as wanting to give a patient who is freezing a winter coat. According to the Royal College of Physicians in Britain professionalism can be defined as “a set of values behaviours and relationships that underpin the trust the public has in doctors.”

Yet there are some who argue doctors should subordinate their personal identity to the role. This approach is incredibly confusing for young physicians trying to understand the norms of the profession they have joined. And leaving who you are at the door is completely at odds with the wise words of the late Dr. David Sackett the “father” of evidence-based medicine who once said that “the most powerful therapeutic tool you’ll ever have is your own personality.”

Not coincidentally the kind caring patient-centred Dr. Sackett was Sharon Straus’s most important mentor. And in a curious way since she is my most important mentor I suppose I am one of his compassionate descendants.

Sharon’s story about her resident reminded me of a story of my own about a patient. I’ll call her Bernice. Hailing from a Manitoba First Nation she was the same age as my own mother and was admitted that December to our ward with a problem we were treating with pills and infusions and stern pointless admonishments about diet and lifestyle. Pointless because when you are struggling to survive you don’t have much bandwidth for deciding between low-fat versus full-fat milk. You are lucky if you can afford any milk especially up north. Bernice’s bedside table was littered with pamphlets with pictures of food labels information we kept dumping on her like fanatics. When we rounded on her she was never looking at those pamphlets. Instead she was looking at her hands folded in her lap the room silent the parking lot outside her fourth-floor window coated in a layer of pristine snow.

“She looks depressed” one of my residents observed. “She’s always complaining how her skin is so dry. Maybe we should get psych to see her.”

“Maybe we should get psych to see her” is often a default setting on non-psychiatric wards. Feelings are sometimes treated as if they are head lice – things to be eradicated. So we called the psychiatry team to see Bernice. They are often at their busiest just before Christmas. They added her to their consult list promising they would be by the next day.

That evening just before I headed home I sidestepped the prelit Christmas tree the nurses had erected in the hall and I stopped by Bernice’s room.

I asked if I could talk to her; I sat down on the side of her bed.

“Your heart is getting stronger” I told her. “But we notice you seem so sad.”

She was rubbing her hands together.

“They’re so dry” she said.

“We can get you some hand lotion.”

There was a long agonizing pause.

She only liked Oil of Olay she told me.

And then she teared up.

The words began to spill out along with the tears. Her daughter had died suddenly six months ago. It had been abrupt and unexpected and the family’s life was shattered. The daughter left behind small children. She was loving and funny and always thought of the little things. She shopped for Bernice and bought her small treats. They spoiled each other with love.

Bernice had always been especially proud of her beautiful complexion and that’s what her daughter used to buy her – Oil of Olay. She always got her a gift set at Christmas. Bernice would put it on her face and hands and everyone always said she looked so young. But now she said she just looked the way she felt like a very old lady. She’d finished her last jar of face cream a few months ago. It was gone and so was her daughter.

I sat with Bernice in that dingy room and I finally understood what was wrong with her heart.

Professionalism in nursing is in my opinion a little different. Nurses don’t seem to pontificate so much about keeping patients on the other side of an imaginary fence. They are often more practical – and culturally more maternal – than doctors. They see basic needs and meet them without so much pointless deliberation.

“Can you give gifts as a nurse?” I asked my charge-nurse friend Vanessa Davis although I was sure I already knew the answer.

“Well” she said “I can tell you that the nurses always bought gifts for long-term patients at Christmas – shoes boots little radios candies warm blankets. But we also just brought in extra clothes or shoes or whatever those patients needed at any time of the year.” No reprimand from a boss for boundary-crossing behaviour. No need for articles in JAMA in defense of their humanity.

In his article Dr. Schiff identified something else as problematic: tokenism. Dr. Schiff cautions us that doing just a little might leave us feeling self-satisfied as though our work was done – excused from addressing the social and economic injustices that too often underlie patients’ suffering.

Was it “tokenism” when I left Bernice an Oil of Olay gift set from “Santa”? I don’t think it left me self-satisfied. If anything it illuminated the bigger forces and injustices shaping Bernice’s life ones I couldn’t change in that moment and ones I do try to address in other arenas of my life and work.

I still think about her every time I see a bottle of Oil of Olay. I probably will for the rest of my life.

A few days before Christmas our ward clerk Judy paged me to tell me a man had stopped at the desk; he wanted to give me something. It was one of the last long-ago Christmases before the pandemic and patients and visitors still roamed the halls freely. But I was tied up in the ER with an admission. I told Judy I’d be a while.

By the time I got up to the ward the man was gone. Still I passed through the double doors past the hundreds of paper snowflakes taped to the ceiling tiles all made and brought from home by the nurses and their children.

Judy waved when she saw me; she handed me a card.

“Don’t lose that” she teased. “He was anxious to make sure you got it.” I recognized the name written in the upper left-hand corner. It was from a patient I’d treated a few months earlier.

Judy made me take handfuls of Christmas oranges and candy before she’d let me leave the ward. Out in the relative quiet of the hallway I opened the envelope. A Tim Hortons gift card fell onto the ground.

Dr. Horton

Just a quick note to again say thanks and to let you know that I hadn’t forgot our discussion pertaining to my release from hospital in time for the long weekend in Aug where I offered to add you on my Christmas card list and you countered with the suggestion that the Christmas gift list would be better.

As you can see you made both.

Your ever appreciative patient.

I burst into laughter. It was so damn funny my face felt like it would split from smiling. I wanted to call and thank him. But I was no longer his doctor and the high walls around what is rightfully considered personal health information meant I couldn’t legitimately log into his medical record in order to get his phone number without the possibility of being flagged by the system for a boundary violation.

As of 8:40 a.m. Saturday 5120 remain without power.

DTE Energy said it has deployed more than 1700 employees and support teams who will continue to work throughout the holiday weekend to restore power for customers who remain without power. The majority DTE said will be restored by Saturday evening.

“I want to thank our customers for their patience as our crews work to restore their power in treacherous conditions” said Trevor Lauer president and COO DTE Electric. “There’s never a good time to be without power it’s even more challenging over a holiday. We’ll be working as long as it takes to restore power for every one of our impacted customers.”

DTE’s electric infrastructure endured significant battering from the winter storm beginning late Thursday into Friday evening.

""The weather system packed 13 consecutive hours of 45+ mile-per-hour winds with three hours of winds greater than 50 miles-per-hour. Such powerful unrelenting gusts would have caused significantly more damage had it not been for DTE’s ongoing work to upgrade its electric infrastructure to help combat extreme weather-related power outages"" DTE Energy said in the email.

DTE Energy wants to remind customers of the following:

The survey asked 1027 U.S. car buyers to provide their purchase preferences in relation to sustainability. In its press release Norfolk Southern noted that “More than two-thirds…would choose one car brand over another if it had obtained a sustainability certification for its manufacturing and transportation processes.” Meanwhile 904 participants or 88% confirmed that they research a company’s eco-friendly practices before deciding on a vehicle purchase. These two findings have major implications for the auto-industry and offer important insights for retailers.

Automakers are heavily scrutinized for their contributions to emissions and pollution. The attention is warranted given the vast amount of materials such as rubber glass plastic and metal that are consumed in production. While Norfolk Southern’s respondent pool was small the evidence that buyers research and avoid companies who lack eco-friendly certifications underscores the financial impact poor environmental practices can have. Automakers and dealerships could both lose money when they fail to meet environmental standards.

While eco-friendly initiatives are admirable from the perspective of social responsibility the study demonstrates that sustainable production is a major influencer of automaker images and finances. Companies should see sustainability as a competitive benchmark. For dealerships it highlights the need to rely on brands with a reputable history of climate action. In the future producers and sellers will need to work together to lessen environmental impacts and attract consumers.

MONTPELIER Vt. — The massive wild winter storm that has gripped much of the U.S. has been blamed for deaths in Vermont New York Colorado Missouri and Kansas.

Multiple highways were closed and crashes claimed at least eight lives officials said. Four people died in a massive pileup involving some 50 vehicles on the Ohio Turnpike. A Kansas City Missouri driver was killed Thursday after skidding into a creek and three others died Wednesday in separate crashes on icy northern Kansas roads.

A 51-year-old Vermont woman died Friday after a tree in her back yard broke off in high winds and fell on her in the town of Castleton in west-central Vermont near New York. Police said she died at a hospital after the Friday morning accident.

In New York two people died in their homes in the Buffalo suburb of Cheektowaga on Friday when emergency crews could not reach them in time to treat their medical emergencies Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Saturday.

Police in Colorado Springs Colorado said they found the body of a person who appeared to be homeless during this week’s winter storm. Officers found the 42-year-old man’s body outside near the Citadel Mall at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday afternoon The Gazette reported.

FRANKFORT Ky.—- Gov. Andy Beshear is warning Kentucky residents to avoid a stretch of Interstate 71 after a series of accidents since Thursday night.

The interstate through northern Kentucky links Louisville to Cincinnati Ohio.

“We got one cleared then another happened. We got that cleared and then another happened” Beshear said during a news briefing Saturday. “If you can avoid it please do. Don’t travel if you don’t have to.”

Highways officials said traffic on the interstate in northern Kentucky was backed up for 14 miles (23 kilometers). One southbound lane was open but traffic was moving slowly and taking several hours to route onto alternate roads.

___

FORT WAYNE Ind. — The company providing electricity to parts of northeastern Indiana and southwestern Michigan is asking customers to reduce their power use because of extraordinary demands on its system.

Indiana Michigan Power based in Fort Wayne Indiana warned that it might have to direct a regional power grid operator to begin “grid protection power outages” that “would be brief and intermittent whenever possible to limit the impact on customers.”

Meanwhile Detroit-based DTE Energy said more than 23000 lost power as the storm and freezing temperatures blew into Michigan.

As of 7 a.m. Saturday the utility said about 80% had their service restored. More than 1700 employees and support teams were working throughout the Christmas holiday weekend to restore full service DTE Energy said.

County road crews in parts of western Michigan were experiencing white-out conditions due to the snow blowing across roadways.

——

RALEIGH N.C. — More than 450000 customers in North Carolina were without electricity according to poweroutage.us as temperatures that dipped into the single digits early Saturday strained the power system.

Duke Energy said that it was putting planned emergency outages in place because of high demand and that trees felled in high winds had also damaged some lines. Maps indicated that the outages were spread throughout the state but the highest concentration was in the Charlotte area where more than 100000 were reported in Mecklenburg County.

Mecklenburg County said Friday it was adding capacity to its homeless shelters.

State officials said warming centers were opening around the state.

___

BUFFALO N.Y. — Officials are describing the ongoing blizzard in western New York around Buffalo as potentially the worst the area has ever seen.

Chief Timothy Carney of the Erie County Sheriff’s Office said deputies abandoned 10 police vehicles overnight Friday after getting stuck.

“It’s essentially a category 3 hurricane with a bunch of snow mixed in. It’s been like that for the past 24 hours” Carney said.

Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Saturday that there were still probably hundreds of people stuck in vehicles.

“This may turn out to be the worst storm in our community’s history” Poloncarz said during a news conference Saturday.

There was no emergency service available in Buffalo and several populous cities and towns.

“That is not to say attempts aren’t being made but there is no guarantee that in a life-threatening emergency situation that they’re going to be able to respond immediately"" he said.

___

KNOXVILLE Tenn. — The Tennessee Valley Authority directed local power companies on Saturday to implement planned interruptions to “ensure power system reliability.”

The authority provides electricity to 10 million people in Tennessee and parts of six surrounding states.

“This measure is expected to be temporary until the highest peak power demands have been met” TVA said in a statement.

___

MONTPELIER Vt. — Almost 400000 electric customers across the six New England states remained without power on Saturday morning.

The most outages were reported in Maine where more than 237000 customers were in the dark.

Some utilities warned it could be days before power is restored.

It was an unusual combination of widespread severe cold and high demand that led Duke Energy to cut power for around half a million customers. However some people living in the Triangle say an unplanned outage in that kind of severe cold was unacceptable.

One Chapel Hill resident wrote on Twitter ""Twenty-four hours without power ... my portable generator is just barely hanging in there and keeping us from freezing. I know it's miserable for everyone involved especially the crews working out there to get things fixed but this is ridiculous.""

Gov. Roy Cooper voiced his concerns on Monday asking for a complete report from Duke Energy about what went wrong – and what changes could be made for the future.

""Duke Energy assures me NC is in the clear now. But I’m deeply concerned about people who lost power and who didn’t get notice about rotating outages"" shared Cooper on his Twitter.

Was Duke Energy's severe weather plan strong enough?

Over the weekend Duke Energy asked customers to limit electricity use overnight to prevent additional blackouts as temperatures dropped into the teens three nights in a row.

With extreme cold temperatures forecast well in advance WRAL News asked Duke Energy spokesman Jeff Brooks if he felt the utility's severe weather plan was robust enough and why things happened the way they did.

""I think we felt like going into the event that we had adequate resources to serve customer needs. We saw those conditions change a little bit over the night going into Saturday and had to make some difficult decisions to protect the grid"" said Brooks.

Under normal circumstances Duke is usually able to get backup power from other utilities nearby but widespread cold across the South and blizzard conditions to the north meant those others did not have the help to give according to Brooks.

""The challenge came in when we lost some generation and had challenges bringing any other generation from around the region"" Brooks said.

Brooks said this combination of factors was very rare – saying it was a once-in-15-year event for him.

Duke Energy says they're going to continue to invest in making the grid more resilient against severe weather.

The company apologized for the need to use rolling outages.

""We’ll just have to look at what learnings there are to further improve that process"" said Brooks.

Crews continue to restore power from Friday’s winter weather

CHARLOTTE – Duke Energy asked customers to conserve energy usage as crews restored power following rotating outages in the Carolinas in response to high-energy demand Saturday morning.

Due to extreme cold weather causing increased demand and a shortage of available power in the Southeast region the company was forced to interrupt service to about 500000 customers to maintain the energy grid and prevent further disruptions. Power is currently being restored and should be completed today.

“This winter blast and customer demand has been unprecedented in recent history of our region and company” said Jason Hollifield Carolinas Storm Director. “Like other utilities Duke Energy took action to protect the overall energy grid – avoiding damage that could have meant even longer outages.”

Hollifield explained the company has systems in place to target prioritized circuits that can reduce energy demand to best maintain the electric system. That process stopped mid-morning Saturday. Duke Energy crews are bringing back service to those who experienced outages as a result of high demand and expect those customers to be restored today.

“We appreciate the patience and support from our customers” said Hollifield. “While it is possible we will experience rotating outages again tomorrow customers can help keep the lights on for everyone by conserving their energy use for the next 24 hours.”

The company is also restoring power to about 40000 customers who experienced outages from a high-wind event on Friday. The company will communicate directly with those customers to let them know when they can expect service to be restored.

The company continues to ask for energy conservation during the extreme cold temperatures in the Carolina to help avoid rotating outages in the early morning hours of Christmas Day. Energy conservation can help keep power on for all customers.

Some basic energy conservation steps customers can take:

Select the lowest comfortable thermostat setting and bump it down several degrees whenever possible.

Avoid using large appliances – this means appliances with a three-pronged plug such as dishwashers ovens and dryers – during high-demand periods like early winter mornings.

Shift non-essential activities like laundry to late evening hours when power demand is lower.

Charge electric vehicles overnight.

If you have an electric water heater limit the use of hot water as much as possible.

If your power is off turn off appliances and other electrical devices that may have been on when the power went out so there’s not an immediate surge on the system when power is restored.

Bringing many customers back online during extremely cold temperatures can add stress to the system.

Sign up for the free newsletter to get important environmental news by registering at this link.

It’s been about 20 years since Minnesota where the chemical giant 3M is based first began investigating drinking water contamination around a 3M factory that made the class of chemicals known as PFAS or per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances. Around the same time a lawyer named Rob Bilott was looking into similar pollution from a DuPont factory in West Virginia that was causing the gruesome deaths of nearby cows.

This was the beginning of the public consciousness around what we now call “forever chemicals.” In the wake of these investigations 3M and DuPont pledged to stop making PFOA and PFOS which are only two out of thousands of different types of PFAS. Minnesota settled with 3M for $850 million and DuPont spun off its PFAS business into the company now called Chemours.

Since then PFAS hotspots have arisen like a game of whack-a-mole in states including Maine where the chemicals have tainted sludge fertilizer that the state long encouraged for use on farms and seeped into waterways from military firefighting foam use. Marina Schauffler reported on topics like these in-depth in The Maine Monitor’s recent series “Invisible and Indestructible.” Regulators in places like New England have said that PFAS issues identified so far are only the tip of the iceberg for what’s to come.

3M and DuPont along with companies that bought PFAS from them now face scores of lawsuits — from states towns fire departments and individuals — accusing them of marketing the chemicals for use in all manner of other household and industrial products all while knowing the risks. The chemicals persist for decades in the environment and are linked to a range of deadly human health problems. Reporting by The Intercept has shown the 3M knew this and sought to bury it using a similar playbook to that of Exxon in regards to climate change. Now state and federal regulation of PFAS is finally on the rise years after Rob Bilott first began calling for these reforms.

It was likely with this massive legal liability in mind that 3M announced this week it will stop making and using PFAS altogether by 2025. “While PFAS can be safely made and used we also see an opportunity to lead in a rapidly evolving external regulatory and business landscape to make the greatest impact for those we serve” said 3M CEO Mike Roman in a press release.

It’s a splashy headline but what does it really mean? In many ways the PFAS cat is out of the bag — in Maine and worldwide the chemicals have been shown to be in drinking water wastewater rivers our bodies breast milk crops soil compost food packaging pets wildlife. Removing and destroying PFAS is an evolving challenge and towns states and water utilities are struggling to figure out how to fund testing and treatment. After 3M’s announcement some called for the company to go much further in helping fund this effort.

In the U.S. 3M has made the chemicals at factories in Minnesota Illinois and Alabama — all of which are or have been the subject of drinking water contamination investigations. Illinois is the most recent of these — there federal authorities stepped in to order a response to PFAS in the Mississippi River after reporting has shown state regulators failed to take action for years. And 3M and DuPont are not the only companies that have caused PFAS pollution. Factories that use the chemicals to make their own products — such as Saint-Gobain in New Hampshire — are the subject of similar investigations and PFAS in firefighting foam has polluted water at scores of airports and military installations.

The chemicals are used in paper-making which has caused some of Maine’s PFAS pollution and attracted class-action lawsuits as Mainers begin to ask how the chemicals have harmed their health land and water and who will pay to make it right. Maine has not yet joined the huge raft of federal lawsuits against 3M DuPont and firefighting foam makers which is being heard in combination in South Carolina but state Attorney General Aaron Frey said in May that the state planned to do so soon.

Billions in eventual legal settlements with 3M DuPont and other companies that used PFAS could help cover testing cleanup and health costs. But those cases may stretch for decades as has DuPont’s fight with cancer patients and others whose health problems are linked to PFAS in the Ohio River Valley. 3M has also opposed some state PFAS regulations in court — they successfully delayed New Hampshire’s limits for the chemicals by a year for example by suing over the rules’ use of Minnesota science on PFAS and pregnant people.

It’s unclear from this week’s 3M announcement what will become of the lawsuits the company is facing for past manufacture and sale of PFAS. “3M will continue to remediate PFAS and address litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions” the company said in its release.

It’s also unclear what the future holds for the successor chemicals to PFAS known as GenX — shorter chains of molecules that have been shown to have some of the same problems and risks. GenX chemicals have already been the subject of at least one settlement around a Chemours factory in North Carolina. According to New Hampshire Public Radio 3M declined to answer questions about what its PFAS announcement meant for GenX manufacturing.

“I think the devil is in the details here because PFAS is such a large class of chemicals” New Hampshire-based PFAS activist Andrea Amico whose family was exposed to the chemicals in Portsmouth N.H. told NHPR’s Mara Hoplamazian. “I’m really curious as to how 3M defines PFAS and if they’re truly going to stop making all PFAS chemicals or if it’s just a certain type of PFAS.”

Other advocates agreed that 3M’s move raised more questions than it answered both about the company’s next steps and the fate of PFAS throughout society.

“After telling everyone — their neighbors their workers and their regulators — that PFAS are safe while poisoning the entire planet 3M is now pledging to slink out the back door with no accountability. Congress and the courts cannot allow this to happen” said Scott Faber a senior vice president with the Environmental Working Group in comments sent to media. “No one should trust 3M’s commitment to do the right thing. They never have before.”

Michael Harty (27) a father of three from Deel Manor Askeaton and Danny Harty Jr (22) a father of one from Geitne Close Askeaton were each charged with one count of “violent disorder” contrary to Section 15 of the Public Order Act.

Gardaí alleged during separate bail hearings for both men at a special sitting of Limerick District Court that Danny Harty Jr was “ejected” from the Dark Horse pub Patrickswell Co Limerick last Wednesday night after he was involved in a dispute inside the bar.

Gardaí said Danny Harty Jr contacted his co-accused brother who along with their father Danny Harty Sr and another male arrived at the scene in a white Volkswagen Passat.

Detective Garda Fiona Reidy Roxboro Road Garda Station Limerick gave evidence that a group of males exited the pub after Danny Harty Jr and that a “high speed car chase” ensued through the village involving the two accused and others.

CCTV

Detective Reidy said Gardai harvested CCTV camera footage which showed a white Volkswagen Passat allegedly carrying Michael and Danny Harty Jr their father Danny Harty Sr and another male being rammed from behind by a white Nissan Qashqai and a silver Nissan Qashqai.

Detective Reidy said “weapons were produced and a mass brawl ensued”.

She said the “violent disorder occurred on a public street as members of the public were going about their normal business in the run up to Christmas”.

She said the Harty family were involved in a long-running feud with another family.

Detective Reidy claimed that the accused Danny Harty Jr was seen running from a car at the scene and kicking a man “Adrian Byrne in the head and while he was on the ground”.

Detective Reidy also alleged that CCTV footage shows Danny Harty Sr - who was not charged with any offence - “assaulting” a man with an implement resembling “a wooden pick-axe handle”.

Detective Reidy said that from follow-up enquires gardaí learned that Adrian Byrne along with his brother “Douglas Byrne presented with serious injuries at University Hospital Limerick on the same night. Douglas Byrne has sustained a stab wound to his abdomen” Detective Reidy said.

Detective Reidy said Adrian Byrne “collapsed” at UHL and was “rushed to Cork University Hospital (CUH) with a bleed on his brain” and that he was in an “unstable critical condition in a High Dependency Unit at CUH”.

Detective Reidy said gardaí believed that if Michael Harty or Danny Harty Jr were granted bail they would “commit serious offences” that witnesses would be “intimidated” and there would be “further escalation in a long-standing feud” between the Harty family and another family.

Detective Reidy instructed by Inspector Liz Kennedy Roxboro Road Garda Station told the court that gardaí believed if either of the accused were released on bail there would be “serious damage caused to property and persons involved in this feud which also may result in loss of life”.

Detective Reidy said that another man not named in court was admitted to UHL with “slash wounds” to his head and a further ramming of entrance gates of a property in Shannon Co Clare occurred on the same night which gardaí suspect is linked to the ramming in Patrickswell.

In her objections to bail Detective Reidy said that gardaí believe that both Michael Harty and Danny Harty Jr are “a danger to the community at large”.

Vehicle seizures

A number of vehicles have been seized by gardaí as part of their ongoing investigation.

Solicitor Tom Kiely representing the accused brothers said his client’s instructions were that they were “set upon” by a large group in Patrickswell on the night in question.

Detective Reidy agreed with Mr Kiely that Danny Harty Jr was not driving any vehicle that his brother Michael waited at the scene for gardaí to arrive and that there was no suggestion by gardaí at this stage that either Michael or Danny Harty Jr were seen in possession of any implements or weapons.

Judge Alec Gabbett said he was “satisfied” to refuse bail for both accused men under Section 2 of the Bail Act in order to “prevent the commission of further serious offences”.

“I have to take into account the allegation by gardaí that (they) are a danger to life” said the judge.

Career criminal Paul Owens was described as being a “blight on his parents’ lives” by a judge at Leeds Crown Court after it was heard the 48-year-old had regularly stolen cash from the pair between prison stints over the years.

For his latest offending he spent five months between April and September 2020 plundering their bank account racked up huge debts on credit cards in his mother’s name and then would “sell” items on over eBay that would never be posted out.

Owens was handed a 12-month jail term and a five-year restraining order to keep him away from his parents.

Owens used eBay to defraud his parents.

The judge Anthony Kelbrick said: “You have a dreadful criminal record and have been in prison for many serious offences. They are mean wicked and calculated offences from a man who has been a blight on his parents’ lives for years.”

Prosecutor Brian Russell said Owens’ parents who live in Wakefield were away on holiday in September 2020 when they received notifications that money was being taken from their account. It transpired that more than £7357 was removed from the account over the months. His mother realised it could only have been done by someone with access to her laptop and passwords.

The credit cards on which he spent more than £5600 were found at Owens’ address when he was arrested.

His mother had also been contacted by eBay demanding money after an account was set up in her name in which items were put up for sale.

Money from the sales were sent to his mother’s account but then removed. The items were never sent. She was told she owed more than £3109.

Owens admitted one count of theft and three counts of fraud.

He has a lengthy record which includes 27 convictions for 96 offences including multiple thefts and fraud. He is currently serving a five-year sentence for burglary fraud and theft.

There are video games based on every real-world sport from Formula One to soccer. Even action sports like WWE and MMA have got their video game adaptations.

Now talking about MMA-based gamers the first that comes to our mind is the UFC series. As the name suggests these games focus on the American mixed-martial art tournament Ultimate Fighting Championship or UFC. The game-developing company THQ led the torch to create the UFC Undisputed series.

The UFC Undisputed series was loved by all the MMA and video game enthusiasts. But later down the line Electronic Arts took over the torch to create UFC-based games and came up with their new series in 2014 which has released four titles. Recently UFC legend Conor McGregor shared his thoughts on the two UFC game series.

Conor McGregor isn’t a big fan of the latest UFC games

The UFC featherweight and lightweight double-champion is an icon in the MMA world. So Electronics art got him to appear as a cover star on two titles UFC 2 and UFC 3. In the second installment McGregor was featured alongside Ronda Rousey while in the third one as a two-time champion.

McGregor must like the UFC games. He agreed to feature on two game covers. However it seems that that’s not the case. Despite promoting two titles the Irish MMA star is not a huge fan of the UFC games by Electronics Arts. He instead likes the Undisputed series by THQ.

McGregor recently replied to English YouTuber KSI who claimed to defeat Conor’s former training partner Dillion Danis. But after responding to the YouTuber McGreggor shared a photo of playing UFC 2 with KSI. With this photo McGregor changed the conversation to his feelings for the UFC games.

The Irish UFC two-time champion wrote on Twitter “The big bad boss of Burberry. Damn those early UFC games were the best. The new one current is garbáiste.” For those who don’t know Irish Garbáiste means “Garbage.” Possibly McGregor loves the more aggressive and action-packed gameplay of the Undisputed series.

In September the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City sold $70 million of art to fund its digital platform. Google has also uploaded dozens of virtual tours of the world’s most famous museums onto its Google Arts & Culture platform including part of the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.

Most online exhibitions are still nothing more than an attempt to render physical works of art more accessible by faithfully representing them online through photos and videos. However some digital platforms are being used to display art that only exists in the digital realm.

Museums are accustomed to grappling with the question of how to host and display works of art made in new and different mediums as a result of changing technology. For example multimedia installations have become a popular facet of modern art exhibitions. Galleries used to be halls of reverent silence; now it is not uncommon for an exhibition to resound with the noise of a video or sound installation.

However as the mediums in which artists create expand beyond video and sound technology is forcing institutions to evolve and re-evaluate the traditional methods by which they display artwork.

The most prominent example of this is the use of blockchain technology to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which are beginning to take hold in the art world. Christiane Paul the digital art curator of the Whitney Museum of American Art has described NFTs as “a natural extension of artistic practices in the digital field.”

As digital art gains greater acceptance within these elite circles digital platforms continue to become more popular. There has been speculation about how the Metaverse could affect this trend by allowing artists to display their work in more democratic spaces that bypass the barriers of cost and access that come with traditional gallery space.

Naomi Beckwith the deputy director and chief curator of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum – which is also available to “visit” on Google – told the New York Times:

“We have hit a critical point where the technology that’s available to artists has far outpaced what museums can offer in terms of resources so we have to beef up. If artists are working with technology then we have to be able to hold it.”

So here are five of the best exhibitions (in no particular order) to explore from the comfort of your home this holiday season:

The Whitney Museum of American Art known informally as “The Whitney” is an art museum in the Meatpacking District and West Village neighbourhoods of Manhattan in New York City. Their online digital gallery known as the “artport” was originally launched in 2001 and acts as the Whitney Museum’s portal to internet and new media art.

This exhibition by Ọnụọha is a video installation exploring food waste in the United States. Not only will this video installation fit seamlessly into a rigorous schedule of Christmas films but it might make you think about ways to reduce your own food waste over the course of this holiday season.

Is there a difference between an online video installation and simply streaming a video on Youtube? Maybe not but you can still brag to your colleagues about how much of your free time over Christmas was spent absorbing culture rather than a dozen more cookies.

2. The Colour of the Climate Crisis by DesignKind 2022

DesignKind is a series of collaborations between emerging designers from South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa and the United Kingdom exploring the relationship between racial justice and climate justice.

This exhibition displays pieces of interdisciplinary work that arose through a process of research and critical dialogue with the help of innovative digital collaboration tools. The themes include climate migration storytelling comparative climate experiences in the oral tradition and the mapping of colonial and climate histories through materials.

This exhibition is especially topical in the wake of COP27 which focused more than any climate summit yet on the subject of loss and reparations. Negotiations over possible climate reparations gave a voice to the disparity between the experience of wealthy nations who predominantly contribute to climate change and poorer mostly non-white nations who are currently suffering the severest impacts.

The online version of this exhibition is hosted by the Pace Gallery a private American contemporary and modern art gallery with nine locations worldwide. It has a distinguished legacy as an artist-first gallery that mounts seminal historical and contemporary exhibitions and has spearheaded explorations into the intersection of art and technology.

Fred Wilson’s interdisciplinary practice centres around his investigations of the mutable nature of reclaimed objects. In this exhibition he imbues these ready-made objects with personal and historical importance by refashioning and recontextualising them through his own artistic revisions.

In a time of year when many people enter into shopaholic overdrive it can be useful to take a moment to reflect on the value of objects and how the context and history of a reclaimed item can add rather than subtract from its value.

Pace Gallery is also exploring the realm of NFT-based exhibitions via a collaboration between Pace Verso (the web3 hub of Pace Gallery) and Art Blocks (the leading platform for generative art). Find exhibitions such as “Contractions” here and “Floating World Genesis” here.

4. Fragile Soil Fertile Soils  U NSSC 20th Anniversary Art Exhibition

In celebration of its 20th anniversary the United Nations System Staff College (UNSSC) hosted an art exhibition on the United Nations campus in Turin and their own online platform. The climate action-focused series hopes to inspire everyone to act as agents of change amidst the climate emergency.

Commissioned in partnership with the Association Internationale pour la Biennale des Jeunes Créateurs d’Europe et de la Méditerranée (BJCEM) this exhibition showcases international artists who offer unique ways of nurturing and healing the earth as a means of inspiring action to address climate change.

During a period of the year when many look forward to a moment of relaxation and restoration it is worth remembering that we are not the only ones on the planet who could benefit from a bit of nurture and restored health.

The Environment & Society Portal is a gateway to open access resources on the human-environment relationship. They haven’t held any exhibitions in 2022 but one of the beauties of online exhibitions is that they are less strictly bound by the necessities of time and space.

This exhibition from 2021 explores the threat of hazardous waste to the environment and human life through a bend of artwork photography and text. The creators promise to take the viewer “on a journey both into our research and to the edges of our societies that many prefer not to see.”

If you are feeling a bit too festive and in need of some small talk that will enlighten your co-workers (but also risks dampening the mood of any company Christmas party) this is for you. This exhibition is also the digital equivalent of a gallery that has very long explanatory placards – therefore it is probably best consumed before any mulled or sparkling wine.

An honourable mention: #CreateCOP26 and #CreateCOP27 by ShowStudio

These are the winners of two competitions for digital art exhibitions held during the lead-ups to COP26 and COP27 which intended to engage young artists on climate change. Both exhibitions are short comprising just a few poignant and engaging images – perfect for quick inspiration if you need to come up with a socially acceptable new year’s resolution on the fly.

Rather than telling your co-worker or mother-in-law exactly how much weight you want to lose or how much less frequently you want to go on a binge-shopping spree on Amazon you can just say this: “In 2023 I want to be a climate ally.”

Jim Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who hosts the Mad Money show on news platform CNBC. He also runs the CNBC Investing Club and is the co-founder of finance publication The Street. His net worth as of the end of November 2022 was in excess of $150 million. Cramer is considered a leading expert on the US stock market as he has been involved in stocks for the best part of three decades and finished his hedge fund career with returns of over 24% becoming a finance guru between 1987 and 2001.

Cramer recently underlined recent comments from Jerome Powell the chief of the central bank and noted they had given investors the green-light to invest in stocks. Cramer reminded investors who were worried about the economy tipping into recession that a crisis was still avoidable and there were many segments of the market that could be potential winners in 2023. Some of the stocks that Cramer is bullish on heading into 2023 include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

We are confident in Humana’s value creation plan and ability to get back to market enrollment growth in addition to an increasing contribution from its health care services businesses. Shares of Texas Instruments outperformed as the COVID lockdowns eased in China and customers could accept the product shipments leading to an upside in expectations.”

It’s a company we know well as we have owned it in our large-cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large-cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.

But diabetes drug shortages driven in part by people seeking the drugs for off-label cosmetic weight loss leave fewer options for patients with clinical needs.

Those patients also face cost barriers as weight loss drugs are not typically covered by insurance.



Sarah Bramblette has long sought a sustainable way to manage her weight. She lives with obesity lipedema and lymphedema–conditions that cause swelling and fat buildup. Over the years she had tried bariatric surgery and various medications only to see her weight return.

Then in June 2021 a drug called Wegovy (semaglutide) was approved for weight loss making it the first anti-obesity medication in the U.S. since 2014. Bramblette was hopeful that Wegovy would give her the support she needed to shed some pounds and care for her heart health.

But Bramblette is on Medicare for disability and the government health program doesn’t cover medications for obesity. Paying for a month of the drugs would wipe out a whole disability check she said.

Her doctor discovered there was coverage for diagnosed insulin resistance which allowed her to get a prescription for Ozempic (semaglutide) a type 2 diabetes drug that is simply a low-dose version of Wegovy. Medicare covers diabetes medications but not those indicated for weight loss.

Across the U.S. patients like Bramblette are struggling to get their hands on weight loss drugs like Ozempic even when they have a prescription. The shortage is driven in part by a frenzy of reports on social media from celebrities and influencers who tout the drugs for cosmetic weight loss.

“People with obesity finally have something that’s helping us and it’s being hijacked by the same people who mock us for having obesity” Bramblette said. “The same people who always tell us ‘you just need to move more and eat less’ are the people out there wanting this to lose 15 pounds. It’s just very very frustrating.”

Shortages of the medication had her driving to pharmacies across south Florida seeking one with available stock. At times she accepted low-dose samples of Ozempic offered by her doctor self-injecting four shots to get her full weekly dose.

Now at 400 pounds Bramblette said she hopes to continue to lose weight with the help of medication to keep from developing diabetes and liver problems.

“It’s not a fad” she said. “There’s a difference between treatment of obesity and diet culture” she said.

Weight Loss Drugs Can Be Powerful but Hard to Come By

In May Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro (tirzepatide) received FDA approval to treat type 2 diabetes. The drug has also shown great success as a weight loss medication and the company is now seeking an indication for obesity. From its very debut Mounjaro has been in high demand partially as an off-label diet pill and it’s now also on the FDA drug shortage list.

But Eli Lilly recently tightened access to the drug by requiring patients to attest they have diabetes before using a coupon from the company to lower their out-of-pocket costs. The move may be to preserve medication for the diabetes patients for whom this drug is indicated or to keep Lilly in the good graces of the FDA said Dan Bessesen MD an endocrinologist and a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado.

Despite these medications’ effectiveness in promoting weight loss they’re often underprescribed for patients with obesity according to Bessesen.

More than 70% of people with type 2 diabetes take drugs to treat their condition while only about 3% of people with obesity can say the same.

Part of the reason Bessesen said is that providers may recall the fraught history of weight loss drugs. In the late 1990s “fen-phen” a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine was pulled from the market after it was linked to heart valve problems. There are other weight loss drugs still on the market but they tend to be less effective or come with undesirable side effects compared with semaglutide and tirzepatide.

How Do These Drugs Promote Weight Loss? Tirzepatide and semaglutide the drugs that comprise the new weight loss drugs belong to a class of medications that mimic natural hormones involved with insulin production and appetite. They create a feeling of being full when patients eat less than usual. Tirzepatide achieved a more than 20% body weight reduction in clinical trials while semaglutide achieved a 17% reduction.

Reshmi Srinath MD director of the Mount Sinai weight and metabolism management program said that many patients she treats have already tried lifestyle changes. Medications are a “crucial step in their path to weight loss.”

“Metabolically these drugs help to protect the liver reducing the risk of what’s called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. They’re potentially beneficial for the heart they’re helping protect the pancreas and reduce insulin resistance—they’re doing multiple actions at once.” Srinath said.

Some providers argue that prescribing the drugs will distract people from making important lifestyle changes like adhering to a healthy diet and exercise. Bessesen said that weight bias and stigma often factor into providers’ decisions not to prescribe weight loss medications.

Sarah Bramblette People with obesity finally have something that’s helping us and it’s being hijacked by the same people who mock us for having obesity. The same people who always tell us ‘you just need to move more and eat less’ are the people out there wanting this to lose 15 pounds.

— Sarah Bramblette

Bariatric surgery is the current gold standard for weight loss. One study found that the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass bariatric surgery led to a weight loss of about 25% while lifestyle changes made only a 5% difference. For patients who aren’t seeing enough progress with lifestyle changes but may not benefit from surgery medication can be a middle ground option.

“Diabetes could be treated with diet exercise. But people don’t say ‘I’m not going to give you any medicine until you prove to me that you’re not eating any sugar’ or something like that. And yet that kind of language gets used all the time with people with obesity” Bessesen said.

But this mindset appears to be shifting at least among some providers Bessesen said. Last week the American Diabetes Association released new guidance for providers emphasizing the importance of pharmacotherapy for treating obesity and diabetes.

For Bramblette who lives with lymphedema and hyperlipidemia the fat accumulation caused by these conditions doesn’t necessarily respond to diet exercise or other lifestyle factors. As an advocate for the Obesity Action Coalition Bramblette works to increase access to treatment options and to encourage research into the causes of metabolic diseases.

“I am a firm believer that it’s taken this long to get effective treatments for obesity because of weight stigma” Bramblette said. “There’s always been this idea that we just needed to eat less and move more.”

Insurance Often Doesn’t Cover Weight Loss Medications

Medicare does not cover weight-loss drugs though the program pays for bariatric surgery. List prices for the drugs run upwards of $1300 per month. Plus providers aren’t usually compensated for the cost of a weight loss drug for patients with obesity which may dissuade them from prescribing the medication in the first place.

“The medicine is being selectively prescribed to people who pay for it out of pocket” Bessesen said. “If you have diabetes and the only way you get a good diabetes medicine is if you pay for it out of pocket and everybody else gets one that’s less effective I think that’s a health equity issue.”

For the weight loss drugs to work patients must take the drug consistently for life. The cost to insurers of covering the 40% of Americans who have obesity Bessesen said is “untenable.”

If Eli Lilly wins approval to sell tirzepatide as a weight loss drug Srinath said she is hopeful that it’s somewhat affordable for patients.

“With other pills we sometimes can use generics but there are no generic forms of some of these newer medications. I’m really hopeful that some of that will change in the near future.” Srinath said.

Bramblette said she’s reliant on medication to continue improving her health. With the existing accessibility challenges the cost barriers add insult to injury.

“As someone who’s on disability and is on a fixed income knowing that they’re not just getting this written off label but that it’s not covered…it kind of makes it burn even more” Bramblette said. “It’s just the fact that they’re laying down thousands of dollars a month for maybe 15 pounds. I’ve never only been 15 pounds overweight.”

Eli Lilly said it is working to increase its supply but expects shortages to persist in coming months. Nova Nordisk the manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy said it is working to make Wegovy more widely available by the end of the year and that it will increase its production capacity in 2023.

This payment is contingent on Kelun-Biotech not retaining mainland China Macau and Hong Kong rights for the option ADCs and all candidates obtaining regulatory approval.

Merck will also make tiered royalty payments on net sales for any ADC product commercialised to Kelun-Biotech.

Furthermore Kelun-Biotech is eligible to get equity investment from Merck.

Merck Research Laboratories president Dr Dean Li said: “Advances in ADC technologies are yielding a new generation of candidates designed to more precisely target and deliver potent anticancer agents to the tumour site.

“We continue to augment our oncology pipeline and look forward to working with the Kelun-Biotech team to advance these candidates to the patients that need them.”

EV owners in South Australia can reportedly now apply to SA Power Networks to install V2G bi-directional chargers. While an important step towards making better use of electric cars don’t get too excited just yet.

Electric cars can do much more than just transport us from point A to B. An EV can also be used to power appliances homes and deliver grid services. But not all electric vehicles currently available have these capabilities and their capabilities vary.

There are three technologies involved. Very briefly:

V2L – Vehicle To Load (sometimes referred to as VTOL). Supports plugging external loads into the vehicle.

V2H – Vehicle To Home. Allows the use of an EV as a (really big) home battery system.

V2G – Vehicle To Grid. Specifically describes the ability for an electric car to discharge to the grid; but increasingly to also power a home.

SolarQuotes has more detailed information on V2L V2H and V2G here.

V2H and V2G require not only an electric car capable of supporting these technologies but also a compatible bi-directional charger. Unlike a standard EV charger that only works one-way a bi-directional charger operates from the charging source to the EV and from the EV to the grid and/or home. As such there need to be specific standards rules and regulations in place around their use.

SA Leading The Way On V2G

Discussion on national standards for bi-directional chargers is expected to kick off early next year. But according to Nissan South Australians can now apply (via their installer) to SA Power Networks (SAPN) to get permission to install one of the beasties.

Nissan’s announcement refers to a specific bi-directional charger the Wallbox Quasar. It’s going to be a pricey bit of kit initially – I’ve seen figures bandied about ranging from $10000 – $14000.

Nissan says JET Charge will be taking orders from South Australian customers starting late January. With regard to hard-wired EV chargers generally SAPN states a charger needs to be purchased first before an application for approval for connection can be made.

Nissan’s pretty pumped about all this as the Wallbox Quasar is compatible with the Nissan Leaf.

“V2G transforms the Nissan LEAF from a vehicle into a mobile energy storage solution at once meeting both your transport and home energy needs” said the company’s National Manager of Electrification and Mobility Ben Warren. “We’ve seen this technology deployed internationally and it’s so exciting to now see it begin rolling out across Australia first in the ACT with the REVS project and now with our first customer site in SA.”

V2G A “No-Brainer”

The first customer site in South Australia is at Ballycroft Vineyard and Cellars in the Barossa Valley.

According to Ballycroft owner Joseph Evans he’s gone from forking out $6000 annually for electricity to a zero bill – and making around $50 per week selling surplus power back to the grid. The large solar power system initially installed at the winery knocked $4000 off his annual electricity costs. The combination of Nissan Leaf (40 kWh battery) and Wallbox Quasar took care of the rest; plus his set-up provides a bit of drinking silver to boot.

“It makes me entirely self-sufficient with my power needs makes my home and business more sustainable and it’s so easy to use” said Mr. Evans

Mr. Evans says the Nissan Leaf starts its day fully charged and is used to deliver wine to Adelaide daily. The EV is back at Ballycroft by midday charging from the rooftop solar power system until around 6pm. Then from 6pm to 6am the car is switched to discharge to power his house.

Given the vehicle starts its transport working day fully charged as Mr. Evans mentions this could mean some mains grid power is involved. But since he has such a large solar power system (33kW) Nissan says the battery is topped up in the morning with solar electricity. No doubt the charging/discharging schedule and source vary with seasonal and weather conditions.

UPDATE 5:30 PM: Unknown to me until this afternoon SolarQuotes founder Finn had already been out to Ballycroft to chat with Joseph about his V2G setup. In this SQ video just released Joseph talks to Finn in-depth about how much it all cost tech specs clarifies how he’s using the Leaf’s battery at night (it differs somewhat to what is stated above) warranty implications – and a couple of surprising limitations.

The Only V2G EV Show In Town

As the video indicates Mr. Evans is more than a little convinced about the potential for V2G.

“If your next car is going to be an EV and it should be make sure it has Vehicle-To-Grid technology like the Nissan LEAF” says Mr. Evans.

At this point in time in Australia such an EV wouldn’t just need to be like a Leaf it would have to be one. It’s the only V2G compatible *fully electric* car available here at the moment. The Wallbox Quasar may be the only bi-directional charger available here for it too. The Quasar’s compatibility with other electric vehicles is also very limited (CHAdeMO connector); although the new Wallbox Quasar 2 (CCS) will offer much broader EV compatibility.

But still exciting times ahead for electric vehicles in Australia. Prices of bi-directional chargers will drop as they become more widely available and perhaps in the not-too-distant future we’ll see some households that may have otherwise bought a home battery system opt for an EV with V2G/V2H capabilities instead. Kilowatt-hour for kilowatt-hour capacity it could work out cheaper than some home batteries; including Tesla Powerwall.

And a Powerwall won’t take you to the shop.

She said current Commerce Secretary Mike Preston has helped create a ""phenomenal foundation"" in partnership with businesses in Arkansas under the direction of Gov. Asa Hutchinson over the past several years for McDonald to build on.

Sanders said at a news conference that Preston will transition to the private sector in Arkansas and ""we know that we are going to continue working with you in a close capacity as you move to the next step."" Afterward Preston said an announcement about his next job will be made in the near future.

The state Department of Commerce includes the Arkansas Economic Development Commission Division of Workforce Services Office of Skills Development State Bank Department Insurance Department Securities Department Development Finance Authority Division of Aeronautics Waterways Commission and Wine Producers Council.

McDonald 64 is the fifth Cabinet secretary whom Sanders said she intends to nominate to lead an executive branch department in her administration.

He served as president and chief executive officer of Entergy Arkansas Inc. from 2000 until he retired in 2016. Entergy Arkansas is the largest electric utility in the state serving more than 700000 customers with annual revenue exceeding $2 billion.

Sanders said one of the governor's most important jobs is to sell Arkansas and ""letting people know about the greatness of Arkansas the goodness of our people and the opportunity that exists in every corner.

""We need to make sure we have the right people in place that have a desire and a love to see Arkansas succeed and I have no doubt that Hugh is that person"" Sanders said at the news conference at the Arkansas State University System headquarters in Little Rock.

""He is not only going to help create and foster a great community and environment in the business world but also help us build the workforce that is absolutely necessary for us to be successful"" Sanders said.

At the news conference McDonald said Sanders ""pulled me out of retirement.""

""But it is certainly a critically important job that I will do my dead-level best to make sure that we continue to press forward in increasing jobs bringing companies in building existing companies and developing the top talent in the state of Arkansas"" he said.

McDonald noted that Sanders' father former Gov. Mike Huckabee appointed him to his blue ribbon committee on education reform about 20 years ago.

In Sanders' news release issued after the news conference McDonald said that ""Together we will foster a business-friendly environment with a strong workforce development pipeline that allows businesses to recruit and retain highly skilled workers.

""I'm proud to stand with Governor-elect Sanders as we champion our Arkansas economy"" he said in the news release.

Randy Zook president and chief executive officer for the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce/Associated Industries of Arkansas said Thursday in an interview that Sanders' selection of McDonald as the Department of Commerce secretary is ""a first-rate choice.""

Sanders ""could not have found a better candidate"" Zook said.

Gus Vratsinas of Little Rock chairman of the Arkansas Economic Development Foundation said Thursday in an interview that McDonald is ""a wonderful choice"" to lead the Department of Commerce.

""Mike Preston is going to stay in the state so that's a positive"" he said.

""Another positive is Hugh knows the state and has been intimately involved in all these issues that are going to be coming up -- economic development workforce development and everything else -- so this is a great choice"" Vratsinas said

McDonald's salary as the Department of Commerce secretary will be determined later Sanders spokesman Judd Deere said after the news conference.

Preston's state-paid salary is $168047 a year according to the Arkansas Transparency website.

Under an updated memorandum of understanding between Preston as director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission and the nonprofit Arkansas Economic Development Foundation signed in June of 2022 the foundation will provide quarterly supplemental payments of $7684 to Preston in fiscal 2023.

For the past seven fiscal years Preston has received performance bonus of more than $50000 in private funds from the nonprofit foundation. In June Vratsinas said the foundation's board approved a $54810 bonus for Preston recommended by Hutchinson. The privately financed bonus is part of the compensation package agreed to in 2015 when Preston was hired. Hutchinson evaluates Preston's performance each year.

McDonald joined Entergy in 1982 as an engineer at the Waterford 3 nuclear generating plant in Louisiana according to Sanders' news release. He held various management positions in the distribution transmission customer service retail marketing and regulatory business functions in Louisiana Mississippi Texas and Arkansas.

Prior to working for Entergy he worked for Black and Veatch Consulting Engineers in Overland Park Kan.

McDonald currently serves on the board of trustees of The Nature Conservancy of Arkansas as a trustee for the North Dakota State University Foundation and a board member of the Arkansas Career Education and Workforce Development Board.

McDonald is a past board member of the United States Chamber of Commerce the University of Arkansas Sam Walton College of Business Advisory Board and the University of Arkansas Little Rock College of Business Advisory Council according to Sanders' news release. He also served as past board chair of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce Fifty for the Future the Arkansas Research Alliance the Arkansas Career Education and Workforce Development Board and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Board of Advisors.

He received a bachelor's degree in construction management from North Dakota State University in 1980 and a master's degree in business administration from the University of New Orleans in 1987.

Besides McDonald the four other department secretaries whom Sanders has said she intends to nominate include:

• Arkansas State Police Captain Mike Hagar as secretary of the Department of Public Safety and as director of the Arkansas State Police.

Current Department of Public Safety Secretary A.J. Gary has agreed to continue as director of the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management according to Sanders. Gary currently serves in both roles. Arkansas State Police Director Col. Bill Bryant plans to retire Dec. 31 according to a department spokesman.

• Mike Mills as secretary of Department of Parks Heritage and Tourism to replace the current secretary Stacy Hurst. Mills is the founder and owner of Buffalo Outdoor Center in Ponca which was Arkansas' first log cabin resort. From 1982 to 1986 he served as Arkansas' director of tourism where he started Partners in Tourism.

• Department of Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward who has served in the post since March 2015.

• Department of Energy and Environment Chief Counsel Shane Khoury to replace current department Secretary Becky Keogh.

State government currently has 15 executive branch departments headed by secretaries.

Sanders will be sworn in as governor Jan. 10 succeeding the term-limited Hutchinson. Hutchinson has served as governor since 2015 and has said he is considering running for the Republican nomination against President Trump in 2024.

Sanders is a former White House press secretary for President Trump. She will be Arkansas' first female governor.

Staying warm without power

If you find yourself without power in these cold temperatures these tips may help:

Close blinds and curtains to keep in some heat.

Close off rooms your not using to avoid wasting heat.

Wear layers of loose-fitting lightweight warm clothing.

Eat and drink. Food provides your body with energy to keep it warm.

Avoid caffeine and alcohol.

Stuff towels or rags in the cracks under doors to keep heat in the room.

Generator Safety

For those without power and running a generator always make sure you are doing so safely:

Do not place generators inside of any structure including garages carports and sheds

Instead place the generator at least 20 feet away from your home down-wind away from open doors windows and vents

Before refueling turn the generator off and allow it to cool for 15-20 minutes

Never try to power the house wiring by plugging the generator into a wall outlet

Instead use a heavy-duty outdoor extension cord to plug appliances into generators

Do not use in rain or wet conditions

Have a fire extinguisher nearby

Have a carbon monoxide monitor for your home

When the industry started to take efficiency seriously in the mid-2000s engineers noticed that data centers were spending half their energy (or more) in cooling the building and only half reached the racks of IT servers.

For at least 15 years there's been a consensus in the data center industry that the way to run data centers more efficiently is to run them warmer. Now just when some of the more conservative parts of the industry are finally taking action in response there are signs that things may not be so simple.

Our biggest mag yet explores the future of the biggest data center market in the world

Obviously if that could be reduced the data center as a whole would use less energy. The industry created the PUE metric and from then on focused on reducing the energy used in cooling data centers.

World of warmcraft

One way to spend less energy cooling the data center would be to allow it to warm up. Data center operators were keeping data centers below 20°C. This was seen as a waste of energy in the process because IT hardware worked just fine at higher temperatures.

In 2004 ASHRAE (the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) recommended an operating temperature range from 20°C to 25°C. In 2008 it suggested that temperatures could be raised to 27°C. A further revision has taken this to 32°C (89.6°F) depending on conditions.

The US General Services Administration says data centers save four percent of their total energy for every degree they allowed the temperature to climb.

Hyperscale companies picked this up and Facebook took its Prineville and Forest City data centers to 29.4°C Google went up to 26.6°C. Joe Kava Google's vice president of data centers said: “Google runs data centers warmer than most because it helps efficiency.”

For ten months in 2008 Intel took 900 servers and ran half of them in a traditionally cooled data center while the other 450 were given no external cooling reaching temperatures up to 33.3°C (92°F). There were no ill effects and Intel claimed it had saved 67 percent of its power budget.

The bulk of the industry didn't seem to take it on board. It has taken till this year before colocation giant Equinix announced it would ""adjust its thermostats"" and make its data centers warmer. But the announcement only promised to push temperatures up towards 27°C - well within targets ASHRAE set 14 years ago.

And it's just a proposal at this stage with no immediate effect. Equinix says it will be notifying customers at some time in the future and negotiating the temperature increase with them according to a ""multi-year global roadmap.""

Maybe cooling is cool

It's clear that Equinix is readying a process in which it will still have to convince customers to budge from the levels of cooling that have been the norm. It is pitching this as a way for customers to help Equinix reduce its own emissions and thereby reduce their Scope 3 emissions - the emissions in their supply chain.

But surprisingly there's some evidence that those customers may have a point. Allowing temperatures to rise is actually a mixed blessing.

Professor Jon Summers of Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE) suggests that much of the benefits claimed for hotter air temperatures may be completely spurious and perhaps an artifact of the outmoded PUE metric.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL3RvcC01LWNvdW50cmllcy13aXRoLXRoZS1yaWNoZXN0LWRhdGEtY2VudGVyLWhlcml0YWdl0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW5hbHl0aWNzaW5zaWdodC5uZXQvYW1wL3N0b3J5L2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL3RvcC01LWNvdW50cmllcy13aXRoLXRoZS1yaWNoZXN0LWRhdGEtY2VudGVyLWhlcml0YWdl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 5 Countries with the Richest Data Center Heritage,In the current digital era the reliability of data has become extremely important.

Retired homeowners in these provinces pay taxes on their pension income just like retirees do in British Columbia or Ontario. But they generally haven’t gained the large amounts of home equity benefitting many retirees in B.C. and Ontario especially in Metro Vancouver and the Greater Toronto Area.

By failing to tax wealth windfalls enjoyed by owners like me in regions where average prices have soared Canadian tax policy deviates from the principle by which we expect people who have more to contribute more. As a result residents in the rest of Canada pay more than their fair share of taxes. Fixing this inequity requires a surcharge on high-value homes. The revenue could be used to solve big problems such as affordable housing or pay for tax cuts for middle and lower earners.

The problem originated a half century ago when the federal government made its most significant tax policy decision about housing. In 1972 it created the home ownership tax shelter which excluded principal residences from the taxation of capital gains.

Research by Generation Squeeze shows that average home prices increased from around $230000 to more than $680000 in the decades since the loophole was created (after adjusting for inflation). As a result many owners have enjoyed substantial gains in the value of their principal residences largely tax-free. Homes do not need to be sold to access the tax-sheltered wealth gains because home-equity lines of credit are now common in the finance industry.

Residents of Atlantic Canada and the Prairies should be angry because the home ownership tax shelter creates inequities across regions. It’s no secret that home values skyrocketed in B.C. and Ontario from approximately $250000 in 1976 to around $900000 today – and higher still in Vancouver and Toronto. By contrast average home prices in Saskatchewan Manitoba Nova Scotia and New Brunswick started around $140000 and remain under $360000.

The result is that tax policy whacks the retired homeowner in Fredericton. She must manage her money in the absence of any dramatic escalation in the value of her home. A retired homeowner in Vancouver or Toronto may have an identical fixed income but be much more financially secure because her principal residence has gone up in value by hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars compared with when she bought it. She can use that gain in property value to borrow against a line of credit and will benefit from it when she sells the house. Since housing wealth windfalls are almost entirely sheltered from taxation whereas our incomes are not these two retirees will be expected to pay similar levels of taxation when they absolutely do not enjoy similar levels of affluence.

Residents of regions where average home prices have soared often lament that their property taxes rise in proportion to the wealth they are gaining. But that’s not true. The owner of a quarter-million-dollar home in New Brunswick pays more in property taxes than the owner of a million-dollar home in Vancouver. Plus buyers pay the land transfer taxes collected by provinces – not sellers who may have gained wealth while living in the homes they now exchange.

Online polling of 1010 Canadians conducted by Research Co. on behalf of Generation Squeeze showed that Canadians recognize this unfairness. Fifty-eight per cent judge that a retiree who owns a home that is fully paid and worth $2-million is either “very” or “moderately wealthy” even if they have a low income of just $22000 a year.

Accordingly a majority of Canadians agree that “by failing to tax the wealth gained by owners in Vancouver and Toronto we expect retirees in the Prairies and Atlantic Canada to pay more than their fair share of taxes.” This includes two-thirds of respondents in Alberta and Atlantic Canada.

Given this public agreement it’s time to soften the sharpest edges of the home ownership tax shelter by implementing a modest surcharge on housing inequity.

Colleagues and I propose adapting annual property tax bills by adding a surcharge of between 0.2 and 1 per cent on a home’s value above $1-million. This threshold would exempt about 90 per cent of Canadian households including all rentals and almost everyone outside B.C. and Ontario. In the latter provinces 75 per cent of households would be exempted. Anyone incurring the charge could defer payment until the home is sold or inherited – just as seniors are allowed to defer property taxation now.

The poll shows that a majority of Canadians support this sort of surcharge. Support grows if revenue would pay for tax cuts for middle and lower earners or reduce wealth inequality between homeowners in markets where prices have soared compared with markets where prices remain relatively affordable.

However Estée Lauder’s purchase in November of Tom Ford—an American company with super-premium pricing—may indicate a shift in how the world perceives American brands. After fetching a valuation of $2.8 billion the company has secured a seat at luxury’s power table.

That’s because Ford’s products are considered pricey even compared to other global luxury brands. A 30 ml bottle of Tom Ford Lost Cherry fragrance costs $240 a big markup compared to a same-sized bottle of Hermès D’orange Verte ($132) or Miss Dior fragrance ($72). A Tom Ford suit starts at about $5000 not quite as high as Kiton which can run five figures but more expensive than a suit from Dior or Zegna which starts around $3000.



That’s not the usual positioning of the typical American fashion or beauty firm which tends to aim for accessible prices like those at Coach or Kate Spade.

Europe dominates fashion’s top end

While France and Italy boast the lion’s share of the world’s top luxury brands American fashion and beauty fortunes have historically been made in mass and sports apparel such as Gap or Nike or in categories such as affordable luxury—think Ralph Lauren Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.

Although there are some standout US gown designers Oscar de la Renta and Vera Wang among them those brands have never reached the size or influence of business juggernauts like Chanel or Dior.

Partly that’s because as a nation the US was formed without a formal aristocratic class. Europe’s monarchies were the birthplace of luxury explains Karla Martin Deloitte’s fashion apparel and footwear lead.

“If you think about Burberry in London they started out with a commission to the queen. There’s a strict apprenticeship model and for couture it’s something where every single element has to be sewn by hand. It requires a long time to learn” Martin says. She notes the business was also nationalistic and exclusionary. “There were people who weren’t allowed to be in the business and we’re a younger country of immigrants.”

There’s also a certain timelessness involved. Chanel and Louis Vuitton are not dramatically changing up their look from season to season but rather reinterpreting already familiar house codes. That’s in part the reason why Kering in November parted ways with Alessandro Michele after keeping the designer in its top creative post for seven years. Michele’s magpie eclecticism reinvigorated the brand in 2015 but sales had been slowing and his designs felt too trendy and fadlike.

Martin points out that a real test of a luxury brand is whether it can stand on its own apart from its founding designer. Japan has birthed acclaimed avant garde designers such as Yohji Yamamoto Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo but while not cheap their creations fall more under designer fashion not a grand maison.

“It’s very much an aesthetic of that designer and it’s hard to continue when that designer is gone. Whereas if you think about Dior it’s managed to be quite successful with many designers who are not Christian Dior. This is how the house of Chanel is versus a Japanese designer or Tom Ford or Ralph Lauren. The 100 years of extra history matters” Martin says.

Americans are especially good at beauty and underwear

But Americans have proved themselves in sectors such as high-end cosmetics. Tom Ford for instance is known more for its fragrance and beauty than its fashion line.

Even at luxury prices beauty still remains relatively affordable and so in many ways is more suited to American innovation. Seven of the top ten American billionaires in the fashion and cosmetics sector stem from a single fortune: Estee Lauder. After the sale of Tom Ford its founding designer owes his billionaire status to that company too.

Another category Americans have a firm handle on: underwear. Les Wexner built his fortune on the back of Victoria’s Secret which was once the main star at L Brands. Sarah Blakely became the youngest self-made billionaire with her shapewear company Spanx. Kim Kardashian also found a lucrative niche with her Skims line.



American fashion’s gradual maturation

It’s not just Tom Ford that’s climbing up luxury’s ladder. Capri Holdings the parent company of American outfits Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo is hunting for another European luxury brand to buy after its successful acquisition of Versace in 2017.



At the time of the Versace deal there was concern there would be a culture clash between an American group and a European label. But the Versace integr ation has gone well. Capri is targeting $2 billion in sales for the Italian label and analysts have turned more positive on the group’s prospects overall.

China meanwhile has also produced a few aspirational firms but Fung Group Shandong Ruyi and more recently Lanvin Group all have yielded disappointing results. The latter listed via SPAC recently but the vast majority of investors in the special-purpose acquisition company backed out on the merger. As of writing Lanvin Group’s stock was languishing at around half its debut price of $10 a share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdsYW1vdXJtYWdhemluZS5jby51ay9nYWxsZXJ5L2luZGktYmVhdXR5LXRyZW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indi-Beauty Is Bringing Us The Best Of Ayurveda To The UK,"Hold onto your holistic hats there's a new beauty trend in town called Indi-beauty and it's about to take over you skincare cabinets.

What is Indi-beauty?

The origin of Indi-beauty dates back over 6000 years ago when Ayurveda (the natural healing system of India) was first practised. ""Ayurveda promotes health using natural nontoxic substances and recognises the important role of the mind and emotions for total mind body and spirit"" says Vivek Sahni CEO and Co-founder of Kama Ayurveda.

Indi-beauty follows these Ayurvedic principles focusing on the potency purity and efficiency of ingredients (like herbs) and encouraging rituals that take the time to fully appreciate these products and give us a moment in the day where we can step back relax and pay attention to our skin hair and body. ""It’s about fully immersing in the experience and taking time – acknowledging the scent the texture and how it makes you feel"" says Vivek.

The onus is on long-term remedies rather than 'quick-fixes'. Traded-down beauty secrets passed from one generation to the next take precedence over quirky trends (though there's room for those too).

""The reason there is an aura of intrigue and romanticism surrounding Indian beauty traditions is because the idea of mindfulness and 'slow beauty' is given a lot of respect and attention"" explains Vivek. ""The inherent character of beauty ingredients and products (their natural textures consistencies and aromas) is upheld. As is their impact on hair and skin through systematic methods of ‘tactile therapy’."" In a nutshell Indi-beauty isn't just skin deep. It's a 360 approach that incorporates mind and body.

What are Doshas?

In order to understand Indi-beauty and Ayurveda it's important to know about 'Doshas' which are used to define people based on their energies. ""Everyone has all three doshas operating in the body (Vata Pitta and Kapha) however each individual has different proportions of each. These doshas define characteristics and personalities and in return can pre-determine the kind of skin health and mental quirks someone may experience"" explains Vivek.

How to identify your Dosha:

VATA

Vata skin tends to be dry and thin. The main concerns are usually dehydration and premature ageing. But (bonus) your pores are likely to be small or invisible.

PITTA

Pitta skin can be sensitive and usually falls into the combination category with congestion in the T-zone. Thee main concerns are breakouts redness and inflammation.

KAPHA

Kapha skin is the smoothest but tends to have larger pores. Common concerns are excess oiliness and blackheads.

Not everyone is the same and so by determining your 'Dosha' you can tailor your Indi-beauty routine not only to your skin and hair but your mental characteristics too.",,,,,,

Anyone getting paid for their goods and services through apps like Venmo PayPal or CashApp or platforms like Etsy and Airbnb just got a reprieve from the IRS.

Following concerns expressed by the tax community the electronic transactions industry and some lawmakers the IRS said Friday it would delay by one year the implementation of a rule change that would have resulted in a virtual paper chase of tax forms going out by January 31 2023 to anyone using such apps for their business transactions.

The rule change requires third-party payment platforms to issue a 1099-K to the IRS and the app user for business transaction payments if they add up to more than $600 over the course of the year. A business transaction that is taxable is defined as a payment for a good or service including tips.

It used to be those platforms only had to issue you a 1099-K if you engaged in more than 200 business transactions for which you received total payments of more than $20000 in a year.

“The IRS and Treasury heard a number of concerns regarding the timeline of implementation of these changes under the American Rescue Plan” said Acting IRS Commissioner Doug O’Donnell. “To help smooth the transition and ensure clarity for taxpayers tax professionals and industry the IRS will delay implementation of the 1099-K changes. The additional time will help reduce confusion during the upcoming 2023 tax filing season and provide more time for taxpayers to prepare and understand the new reporting requirements.”

Indeed the increase in 1099-Ks issued early next year for people’s 2022 tax returns was expected to be in a word “ginormous” according to Wendy Walker who chairs the information reporting subgroup on the Internal Revenue Service Advisory Council.

Walker works as a solution principal for Sovos which helps more than 30000 business clients with tax compliance including the issuance of all types of 1099s of which there are at least 16 different varieties.

Some businesses that only had to issue a couple thousand 1099-Ks under the prior rules were looking at a couple hundred thousand she noted. “Our clients … have reported enormous increases in their potential filing obligations as result of the threshold change” Walker said.

Meanwhile those receiving 1099-Ks for the first time will have to figure out what portion of the amount reported on the form is actually taxable versus what portion represents payments that may be deductible business expenses such as a fee paid to the payment platform or a credit issued to the business Walker said.

“People are just not going to understand how to take that gross amount and then work off the deductions to get to their taxable amount.”

Welcome news to companies having to issue tax forms

The move was welcomed by those representing third-party payment platforms.

“Given the potential confusion the reporting requirement would cause we applaud the delay ” said Scott Talbott spokesman for the Electronic Transactions Association. “The $600 reporting requirement is not worth the problems it would cause. ETA will keep working to increase the threshold to a realistic amount.”

How does ETA define realistic? A threshold that falls between $10000 and $20000 Talbott said. “ETA supports a reporting threshold that ties into regular businesses and not consumers occasionally selling a handbag or a bike online.”

What the new rule does and doesn’t do

The new rule doesn’t impose any additional taxes on anyone. Nor does it change your obligation as a taxpayer to always report to the IRS all of your taxable income from your business activities.

But the 1099-K reporting will make it harder for someone to evade the taxes they owe by underreporting their business income.

The rule also does not apply to personal transactions you conduct on an electronic payment platform. For example if a friend sends you money through Venmo to help pay for a dinner out or your mother sends you some spending money.

Lastly the 1099-K reporting rule does not apply to any transactions made through Zelle. That’s because Zelle is a payments clearinghouse that connects the payer’s bank account directly to the receiver’s bank account. “Zelle facilitates messaging between financial institutions but does not hold accounts or handle settlement of funds” the company said in a statement earlier this year.

But the IRS may still get reporting on at least some of your business transactions on Zelle Walker said.

If there is a business-to-business payment over the Zelle network the business that makes the payment must provide the receiving business and the IRS with either a 1099-NEC for non-employee compensation or a 1099-MISC for other expenses she explained.

Like the 1099-K those other forms also provide information to the IRS that will make it harder for businesses to understate their income in a tax year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTEyLTIzL2lycy1kZWxheXMtNjAwLXRheC1yZXBvcnQtdGhyZXNob2xkLWZvci12ZW5tby1ldHN5LXNlbGxlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IRS Delays $600 Tax Reporting Rule for Venmo Etsy Sellers,"Why did this happen?

The strong winter storm sweeping through the country will be causing intermittent power outages in New Hampshire at least through Christmas Eve and after a warm spell Friday temperatures will fall below freezing all weekend.

The emergency winter shelter at First Church Concord 177 N. Main St. will be operating from 6:30 p.m. to 7 a.m. every night.

Fire officials caution people who have backup generators to keep them outdoors at least 20 feet from doors or windows. Generators release carbon monoxide an odorless gas that can kill people; CO poisoning is one of the main causes of death after winter storms.

The region’s utilities have been preparing for outages caused by strong winds bringing in extra staff and deploying trucks in advance.

Thousands of people spent a cold night in the dark as the power remained out following Friday's ferocious winds which included an exceptional 84 mph gust in Rye according to the National Weather Service. Most other gusts were between 50 and 60 mph from the southwest bringing down trees branches and power lines.

As of 7:30 a.m. 79012 Eversource Unitil NH Electric Co-op and Liberty Utilities customers were without power statewide.

Central Maine Power had 43455 customers in York County without power. National Grid reported 5432 customers without power in Essex County.

Working All Night at Restoration

Unitil spokesman Alec O'Meara said his company's crews worked all night continuing to make progress restoring customers' power and will keep at it throughout the holiday until each and every customer is restored.

He said the band of thunderstorms that moved through late Friday afternoon that ushered in bitter cold air went through the heart of the company's service area and exacerbated the power outages which jumped from 1500 to 17000.

“This storm could not have come at a worse time and we recognize that many of our customers are wondering if they will have the lights back on in time for their family gatherings. We appreciate their patience during this difficult time” O’Meara said. “Our crews worked hand in hand with emergency responders through windy conditions and plunging temperatures overnight addressing public safety issues while restoring power where possible.”

As power is restored to an area crews will be redeployed to another area.

No Exact Time for Restoration

O'Meara said the possibility exists that some customers may not have power restored in time for Christmas Day and should consider alternatives.

Eversource said it has brought in crews from Alabama North Carolina Texas Virginia and Canada working around-the-clock shifts to address emergency situations clear blocked roads assess damage and restore power to customers impacted by the fierce storm.

""Our focus this morning is on blocked roads & community issues and getting largest outages worked as quickly as possible. Also working to replace 84 broken poles"" Eversource said in a statement Saturday morning. ""We’re continuing to assess damage & working on sharing ETRs. 62 more crews arrived overnight so we have 600+ line tree & service crews working in NH today.""

Fires in Hampton

During the astronomical high tide Friday morning Hampton Fire Chief Michael McMahon said that within the span of a hour the department received reports of 3 structure fires on I Street Jones Ave and Ashworth Ave and 1 vehicle fire on Hobson Avenue with exposure. Hampton Fire Alarm answered over 200 phone calls and dispatched 39 calls for service for Hampton and Hampton Falls.

""We are very fortunate that we had our mutual aid partners in route to assist us with the volume of calls"" McMahon said in a statement.

Rochester Police said they handled over 300 calls for service on Friday.

A tree fell on top of a car parked in a driveway on Whitehall Road on the Amesbury-South Hampton border with a person inside Friday night according to the Amesbury Fire Fighters IAFF Local 1783. A heavy duty wrecker was called into help with the extrication according to photographer Michael Kent.

Christmas Bitter Cold

The forecast calls for sunny skies on Saturday with temperatures in the teens to lower 20s. Southwesterly winds up to around 35 mph or so will send wind chill values down to below zero in most locations according to the National Weather Service.

O'Meara said that those using a generator should make sure it is installed and positioned. An improperly installed or positioned generator can cause exhaust containing deadly carbon monoxide to accumulate in a home.

Generators can “backfeed” electricity into the distribution lines and electrical equipment seriously injuring or electrocuting a line worker or anyone who may touch a now-energized line thought to be dead.

The state Department of Safety’s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management also offered these suggestions:

Use flashlights rather than candles for emergency lighting.

Do not use a gas range or oven as an alternate source of heat.

Only use a generator that has been wired to the house electrical service by a professional electrician.

Never run a generator inside a building or in an enclosed space and keep them 10 feet away from buildings with the exhaust pointed away.

The Westport Office of Emergency management says:

Temperatures will quickly drop below freezing and are expected to remain below freezing until Tuesday.

In the event of flash freezing Fire Chief Michael Kronick says: “If you must travel keep a flashlight food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. Allow extra time as some roads may be icy and dangerous if untreated. Please do not drive around barricades or through waters of unknown depth.”

If you lose power to your home during freezing temperatures follow these steps:

Notify Eversource of an outage: https://www.eversource.com/cg/customer/reportoutage

Now is the time to check your generators and charge your devices in the event of a power outage. Have a battery powered radio on hand.

Stay Safe! Never go near downed power lines including cable TV feeds. They may be live with deadly voltage.

Stay Warm! On top of dressing in layers and huddling under extra blankets hang your darker ones on the windows to draw in heat. Keep doors and windows closed and use towels to block drafts around them. If necessary move to your basement which may be more insulated by the ground.

Never use charcoal grills or camp stoves indoors. Deaths have occurred when consumers burned charcoal or used camp stoves in enclosed spaces which produced lethal levels of carbon monoxide.

Never use a generator inside a home basement shed or garage even if doors and windows are open. Keep generators outside and far away from windows doors and vents. Read and follow instructions on the generator label and in the owner’s manual. Any electrical cables you use with the generator should be free of damage and suitable for outdoor use.

Use caution with candles. If possible use flashlights instead. If you must use candles do not burn them on or near anything that can catch fire. Never leave burning candles unattended. Extinguish candles when you leave the room.

Listen for updates. If you’re using a cellphone choose texting over calling to keep phone lines free or use your landline. Save 911 for emergencies.

Since 2019 over 10 lakh saplings have been planted in 978 Punjab villages. As many as 14000 students have been enrolled in 54 �learn labs� for education and the opportunity to fulfil their sporting dream through 263 sporting centres. Nearly 122 villages have been efficiently managing their waste.

This monumental impact in the state is a result of Sunny (Gurpreet) Singh�s years-long endeavour.

As a young boy Sunny was always the child with many questions on his mind � whether it was for school projects or the things he saw as life progressed.

�I would watch construction workers and domestic help going back from work with their young children who were my age. The kids do not go to school they have no future because of the circumstances they are born in. Their parents as much as they would want to cannot afford to educate them� he recalls to The Better India.

Sunny moved to Seattle for further education and started working in companies such as Expeditors International and Microsoft. In 1996 he started Edifecs � a healthcare company. While he was doing exceptionally well in his work the itch to do something for his homeland stayed with him.

�As a kid when I would watch those kids I�d feel bad for them but could not do anything about it. But as a man who has his own business I knew I could do something because I had the means talent and resources to� he says.

Sunny came to India in 2014 to found RoundGlass Foundation an organisation that aims to drive holistic well-being in Punjab � from education to waste management and promoting sustainable living. He says that so far it has reached 1442 villages across 23 districts such as Fatehgarh Mansa Sas Nagar etc.�

Sunny explains �What we want to do through our initiatives is make 12500 villages in Punjab environmentally clean while making them financially sustainable so they don�t have to leave their villages. We have reached [around] 1500 villages so far� Sunny says.

The foundation has four initiatives � Sustain Punjab Her Punjab Sports Punjab and Learn Punjab.

Explaining how each works he says �Through Learn Punjab we are trying to give education to village kids in a way that they understand how the world works. We don�t do textbook knowledge. Our goal is to make them think out of the box and help them have good communication skills. In a village people can have a very confined way of thinking. We aim to break that barrier. The courses cover everything from agriculture and AI to space sciences.�

�Sports Punjab is about getting the kids to get out for one or two hours a day to play sports. The idea was simple I drew four lines and gave a few kids four footballs. Soon more and more gathered and now we have tennis and volleyball courts football fields etc with professional coaches.�

�The kids come out of the learning labs freshen up and come to their sports training. Their schedule is packed � they study they play and they go home. Now their lives have a purpose instead of playing gulli danda wandering around or worse getting into drugs� he continues.

Talking about Sustain Punjab he says �We plant mini forests and trees in the villages and the villages take care of them. We also make compost out of the solid waste from the homes. They are all organically made and can be used as manure by farmers. This has driven a sense of cleanliness among the villagers and they start complaining to the sarpanch if the garbage collection person does not come even for a single day. We have reached 122 villages for waste management but we hope to expand it to every village in the state� he says.

�Another initiative that the foundation has is Her Punjab where we have set up self-help groups and a sanitary pads unit where they learn how to make pads manufacture them and make money. We also help them set up beauty parlours etc to help them use whatever skills they have and become financially independent. When they are not subservient to the male members of the family they can stand against the abuse and early marriages that happen. When the mother is independent she would stand up for her daughter and so on� he adds.

Rajender Kaur a victim of domestic violence was given work in a flower nursery and now is able to earn a living. After enduring continuous violence for seven years in 2020 she left her husband�s home. Her father introduced her to the foundation where she was trained in the relevant knowledge and skills under the Her Punjab initiative.

�My husband would hit me for no reason. Everyone forced me to give him second chances. Now my life has changed drastically� she says.

�The work at the nursery gave me the courage to stand up for myself. Before this I was always tense and the work itself helps me to calm down. I am happier because I can give my children a better future� she says.

�My heart is in Punjab�

Although Sunny has spent a long part of his life in Seattle he says his heart belongs to the villages of Punjab.

�I have a special connection with Punjab. I spent a lot of time with the villagers and you would cry if you witnessed their hospitality and the kind of affection they will give you. The warmth and the love they will shower will not be anything like you have ever experienced� he says.

Sunny says he feels connected and in harmony with the people of Punjab. �I feel like these are my people my land my culture and I resonate with them and hence want to work for them. This is why I feel like I am the right person to be doing this work in Punjab� he says.

RoundGlass Foundation works on an open-source policy which also focuses to help similar organisations and teach them the tricks of the trade.

�This is why I wanted to go beyond basic corporate social responsibility. I wanted to create a space which is actively involved and is leading the charge to make social change happen. I see a problem and immediately want to look for a solution. I want other organisations to come and learn with us and spread the work in other states too.�

�I hope that the work RoundGlass does in Punjab inspires and makes other Sunny Singhs say �Let me do something similar�. One day by the combined efforts of organisations like RoundGlass we can improve lives in all villages in the country and make them sustainable.�

�My learning is that I want to uplift my people and be in service of humanity. If someone comes to me with choices to get a billion dollars or do good work I would give up money. I want to leave behind a good place for my children and the children of the world. I will continue to do so for the rest of my life� he says.

After all if you live in a small home the living room isn’t always just the living room it can also be a home office guest room dining room or serve all three these purposes at once. So having the right furniture and decor to utilize every square foot is essential. Are you ready to get your small living room organized? Here are seven tips from professional organizers.

How to organize a small living room

The prices below were correct at the time of publishing this article.

1. Maximize the space with functional furniture

The less space you have the more storage you need. So choosing furniture that has hidden storage can help curb excess clutter. “When I’m doing a consult for a new client I’m listening to their needs for the space"" says Carrie Kauffman professional organizer and owner of Carrie’s Essential Services. ""I’m thinking we need to declutter here and get proper storage for the space. I see all the good items that the client can keep and then also have to discuss the larger items that may be useful but are too large for the space.""

Kaufman likes the Ornavo Large Storage Ottoman Bench from Amazon and the Lark Manor Upholstered Storage Ottoman from Wayfair because both have space to stash extra linens and miscellaneous items. Looking to store books or knickknacks? Opt for Vario Stacking Cubes from Container Store.

2. Consider a coffee table with storage

In addition to ottomans you can’t go wrong with a coffee table that has storage. “Get a coffee table that you can entertain your company on and one that will give you some added storage that you can add throw blankets” says professional organizer Shantae Duckworth. Then take a less is more approach to decor. “Books and candles don't need to be on display.”

Duckworth recommends the Kakotito Modern Round Storage Ottoman from Amazon because it has plenty of storage inside and features a modern aesthetic. However if your living room has more of a vintage vibe go with the Yaheetech Modern Lift Top Vintage Coffee Table from Target. If your space is too small for an ottoman a storage stool such as the Sand & Sable Storage Stool from Wayfair can also work.

3. Have a WFH desk work harder

Do you work from home? Having a coffee table that converts into a desk is a worthwhile space saver. Duckworth tells me “we know that a computer desk can take up valuable space. You can also convert the space back into a livable space. Functional multi-purpose furniture is the key to small spaces.”

The Corrigan Studio Amethy Coffee Table from Wayfair has a stylish mid-century modern aesthetic while the Hommpa Lift Top Coffee Table from Walmart has a comfortable ergonomic design. Looking for something minimalist in style and price? Consider the HOMCOM 39"" Modern Lift Top Coffee Table Desk available at Target.

4. Utilize wall space

“Functional wall space can go unused or underused” says Kaufman. “Make the wall function for things you need every day but may not have the flat space to put items on. Wall space just isn’t for frames and artwork.”

The Wallniture Avila Floating Shelves from Amazon are a decorative way to do this but you can also use the 17 Stories Kendelle Wall Organizer With Wall Baskets from Wayfair or The Container Store'sAcrylic Wall Display Cubes instead.

The best way to approach using wall space is to get vertical. Duckworth likes using tall storage pieces such as bookshelves. “[In addition to displaying books] you can also put your photos sentimental items and or collectibles on display.”

A good example of this is the Latitude Run Elite Media Shelves from Wayfair because this unit has lots of compartments. Those with more traditional tastes may want to go with the espresso wood Furinno Jaya 5-Shelf Book Case from Amazon. Another option is a bookshelf/desk combo such as the Nathan James Theo 2-Shelf Industrial Wall Mount from Amazon which can be helpful for living rooms that also serve as home offices.

5. Store things where it makes sense

When you have a small living room both storage and finding the space to entertain can be tricky. Kaufman advises keeping items where you use them especially when you’re entertaining. “Small living room space is your primary entertaining space keep items you need handy versus clogging up valuable travel space in an apartment. [So you don’t need to] head back to the kitchen for drinks or refills! Store wine and liquor in your entertaining space where folks will be gathering. Think about small carts cabinets wine racks.”

Keep wines and spirits within reach using a timeless gold bar cart such as the Vasgale Bar Cart from Amazon. Not a fan of carts and have a little bit of extra space? Why not go with a larger cabinet like Wayfair's 17 Stories Lachesis Metal Bar Cabinet instead? Or to take advantage of vertical space consider Iron Stackable Wine Racks from The Container Store.

We love the idea of having a living room blanket basket to keep all of your throes in one place neat tidy and within reach at all times.

6. Consider little ones too

Children and pets may be little but they can have a lot of things that sure make the living rooms extra hard to keep organized. “When you are short on space but your kids have more toys and crafts than they ever will — storage is essential in any small space” says Kaufman.

The organizer suggests utilizing pieces that work with your aesthetic but are discreet and functional. “Benches ottomans and cubes offering storage can also keep toys out of sight and out of mind. This ensures that your home can be enjoyed by both adults and children alike.”

Storage pieces that can be easily cleaned are also ideal for toys that can bring in dirt from your backyard paint and sticky arts and crafts materials. That's why we love Amazon's 3-Tier Stackable Storage Bins which can be easily disassembled and wiped down as well as The Container Store's SmartStore Translucent Totes for kids toys especially.

Pet parents you'll be just as obsessed as we are with the Isabelle & Max Toy Basket from Wayfair which looks adorable in any decor theme and is a breeze to spot clean and wash.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2hvdy10by1mcmVlLXVwLWdpZ2FieXRlcy1vZi1zdG9yYWdlLXNwYWNlLW9uLXlvdXItaXBob25lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to free up gigabytes of storage space on your iPhone,"'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean?

The only 9 designer tips you need for a perfect space,"How do you design a kitchen that's better to cook in? When planning a high-functioning kitchen that allows you to unleash your inner chef it's all about design that prioritizes efficiency. 'Kitchens are about togetherness gathering with family and friends and enjoying a well-cooked meal' says John Lum AIA founding principal at John Lum Architecture. 'The best kitchens to cook in are those that maximize its utility with a welcoming environment for everyone to enjoy.'

When it comes to striking this balance think about the big ticket items that you need to consider how all the zones work together and what you can do to make your life easier in the long run. 'Try to imagine yourself and the list of tasks you wish to achieve in your kitchen at the design stage before you start any remodelling or construction works' recommends designer Benji Lewis. Read on for our ideas on creating a kitchen that's better to cook in.

How do you design a kitchen that's better to cook in?

1. Maximize countertop space

(Image credit: Julian Abrams. Design: Patalab)

First and foremost a sure-fire way to design a kitchen that's better for cooking in is to maximize your countertop and kitchen worktops. A home chef needs space to prep and greater space allows you to have more creativity in the space. Even in a small kitchen countertops are a cook's non-negotiable. From kitchen islands that double up as social spaces and prep zones to clever kitchen peninsulas that jut out the side of a wall for extra countertop space if you can give yourself as much countertop as possible your kitchen is off to a good start.

Most homes are fitted with countertops that are around 25.5 inches from the wall to the edge of the counter but some have extra room of up to 28 inches. If you can make your countertop longer consider turning your L-shape kitchen into a U-shape kitchen with a peninsula on the end if you can afford the space.

2. Create a good lighting scheme

Good kitchen lighting is a must in this space and while it helps with the atmosphere and aesthetic of the space its real selling point is how it can help the cooking process. It's a place where you'll be working to host for friends and family using the space for chopping and cleaning so these zones need to be well-lit.

You want a good mix of task and ambient lighting to fit the various activities. 'You want to balance functional overhead lighting with task and ambient lighting' says John. While overhead pendant lights are aesthetically pleasing they're not the most important light source when it comes to tasks in the kitchen. Consider LED lighting options in your kitchen as you can hide LED strips under kitchen cupboards that will shine down on your countertop space and help you prep as you entertain. Wall lights make for a nice addition to your wall and can be twisted and bent in any direction to shine a light on whatever you're working on.

‘You want to be able to see what you’re cutting and what you’re cooking which is why lighting over prep surfaces including under cabinet lights and a hood over the cooktop with lights to see what’s in those pots is key’ says Matthew Miller of StudioLAB.

The light of the bulb itself is also important in the kitchen and can help the room feel warm and welcoming instead of cold and stark. This helps if you're looking to create a kitchen where your cheffing is on show to guests and you are entertaining.

All light sources have a Correlated Color Temperature and it is measured in Kelvins (k). 'The lower the figure the warmer it is. In the kitchen environment I would suggest either 2700k or 3000k' says Darren Parnaby senior lighting designer from Beem.

3. Think about your 'work triangle'

(Image credit: Future. Matthew Williams)

The kitchen is a place where many different tasks and elements of housework take place so designing a well-functioning kitchen all comes down to the spaces between these zones how they interact and intricately planning the proximity of these areas.

'When I am designing a kitchen layout I envision what happens when my client is moving about the space while preparing food' says Nadia Watts of Nadia Watts Interior Design. 'What should be at arm's length? Where is the logical place to reach? And who else may be in the kitchen at the same time? Answering these questions helps determine the flow and placement of elements throughout the kitchen and allows me to design accordingly.'

John Lum refers to the distance between the fridge the prep and the cook areas as the 'work triangle'. The kitchen work triangle is used to determine kitchen layouts by looking at the primary tasks and where they are carried out - usually the cooktop sink and fridge. You ideally want equal distance between each of these spaces and for nothing to obstruct the flow. 'We try to optimize the work triangle and plan accordingly' says John. 'Locating separate under-counter wine refrigerators or refrigerated drawers for children’s snacks — away from the main cooking triangle — can minimize cross-traffic conflict.'

Think about what belongs near to each point in the triangle to. ‘Other items such as a microwave should be close to the fridge since you’re more than likely pulling out something cold to reheat’ adds Matthew from StudioLAB. Elsewhere you want a drying rack near the sink and the spices accessible near the hob. Break your kitchen into these three points and plan outwards.

4. Consider a working pantry

If space allows a pantry is a good option for a kitchen minimizing the clutter in the main space and allowing you to store dried foods and jars in a designated zone in an organized way and not taking up crucial space in your main entertaining area.

'A working pantry is a great use of space because not only does it store pantry items and kitchen appliances but it also serves as a prep area that can be hidden at the ease of closing the pantry door' says Amy Forshew founder of Proximity Interiors .

There are different options for your pantry too. You might want a sliding door system or soft fabric curtain to shut your pantry out of sight while a free-standing piece of furniture might make a better idea if you are lacking in space. Remember to light your pantry no matter whether it's a smaller side room or a freestanding piece this will all help the cooking process be as smooth and streamlined as possible.

5. Organize the clutter

Planning for clutter is also super important in the kitchen. The cooking process is messy and it's part of the fun. It’s not about keeping everything neat it's about thinking how mess can be cleaned up as easily as possibly afterwards. 'Appliance garages that allow easy access to everyday appliances such as coffee makers and toasters can hide some of the clutter' says John 'while open shelves and cubbies can frame the chaos so that the kitchen still looks orderly' recommends John.

'We utilize appliance garages any time we have an open kitchen' says architect Megan Blaine co-founder of Blaine Architects + Marshall Interiors . 'They keep the kitchens looking clean and tidy while not sacrificing function.'

6. Make sure you have deep drawers for pots and pans

When planning and organizing your kitchen drawers try and prioritize drawers that fit in all your favorite cooking necessities. There is no use planning a kitchen with cupboards that don't fit saucepans so go for drawers with extra depth to accommodate those pots and pans you'll need for the cooking process. Drawers are most commonly around 10 inches high with one slimmer one at four inches high. 10 inch deep drawers are better for those baking bits and pieces.

Alternatively a lower cupboard can be divided with one shelf so you can stack your pots and pans and larger kitchen items.

7. Really consider the type of kitchen faucet you go for

The kitchen sink is an important element of your kitchen and getting the design right will help the flow and make a space that's better for cooking in. During the design stage think about where in the kitchen your sink goes - is it on an island facing your guests or does it take up part of your countertop space. Think about organizing the clutter that gathers in your sink area. A larger sink area and a dedicated zone for dishwashing means visual mess can be kept off the main countertops.

During the design stage consider investing in a hot water tap these use up a lot less electricity and free you up some space where your bulky kettle normally sits. This gives you more countertop space which we already know is important. The arc of your kitchen faucet normally falls around eight to 10 inches high but think about where your cabinets sit and if it is too high and bumps into kitchen cabinets you might want to drop it to around three inches. A faucet that has a spray nozzle is also good for the cooking process helping you clean easier and with more force.

8. Keep utensils close to hand

Another important factor when bearing in mind design in the kitchen is also about those everyday utensils 'Keep utensils close to hand' advises interior designer Benji Lewis. There is no use having wooden spoons spatulas and ladles on the other side of the kitchen so make sure you have designed a space that is both aesthetic and easily accessible.

You can buy large pots that sit by your cooking station or have a drawer nearby so you're never caught short. 'A hanging rail or kitchen shelf with hooks behind the stove work well' says Benji using the wall for extra space for storage.

9. Consider what type of hob you want

(Image credit: Paul Raeside. Future)

Designing a kitchen to have the right hob is key. 'You need to think hob versus range gas versus induction aga versus tepan' says Hugh Leader Williams designer at Blakes.

'This is normally relatively easy to resolve as it is largely informed by the type of food most regularly cooked. People who value quick intense heat and like to cook Asian style food will likely prefer to cook with gas and need good strong overhead extraction like a Westin hood. People who cook less often or cook more European-inspired food tend to like induction hobs that can get away with more subtle downdraft extraction like that offered by Bora' says Hugh.

Clients who love to cook socially and entertain while preparing food tend to like an induction hob on a modern kitchen island as they can chat to their family or guests who are seated at the island. For others concentration is key so a defined cooking space with the hob on the back wall run of a kitchen gives them the ability to have their back to the room. After the cooking device has been determined the layout flows from here."

The report said that this gives Exxon time to make its corporate move to its campus near Houston.

Capital Commercial Investments based in Austin Texas closed on the deal on Friday. An ExxonMobil spokesman confirmed to CoStar News that the real estate deal has closed. Terms of the highly anticipated sale of its nearly 300-acre campus in Irving were not immediately available the report said.

The energy giant plans to relocate from North Texas to its massive campus located about 25 miles north of Houston in Spring Texas in mid-2023. The move is expected to save the company billions of dollars in costs the report. ExxonMobil now with a major enterprise in Guyana’s waters put its Irving campus on the market last winter.

“As we announced earlier in 2022 we are moving our corporate headquarters to our campus north of Houston” Casey Norton an ExxonMobil spokesman said in an email to CoStar News. “The move will enhance collaboration and provide more opportunities to share expertise across the entire corporation as part of our strategy to better leverage corporate advantages to grow shareholder value. We greatly value our long history in Irving and Dallas and appreciate the strong ties we have developed in the community” he said.

ExxonMobil is also building headquarters for its operations in Guyana.

At the time ExxonMobil listed its headquarters CoStar News said that Irving officials had stated that the marketing of the campus offered a “blank slate” to the city that touts itself as being “the headquarters of headquarters.” Eight Fortune 500 companies have their headquarters in Irving including McKesson Fluor Corp. and Kimberly-Clark.

“The former ExxonMobil site is one of the most exceptional infill locations in North Texas” Robb Buchanan an executive vice president of Capital Commercial said on LinkedIn. “We look forward with engaging with the city of Irving and other parties to redevelop the campus into a luxury master-planned community and capture Fortune 500 companies that are continuing to move to Dallas-Fort Worth from out-of-state.”

Beyond sheer acreage for development the ExxonMobil campus also houses the company’s current headquarters building. Built in 1995 it has nearly 360000 square feet of space with an adjacent parking garage. The building was last appraised at US$48.1 million according to the Dallas Central Appraisal District.

The city of Irving has been home to ExxonMobil since the company announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Manhattan to the Texas prairie in the late 1980s as a cost-cutting measure following a similar move by retailer J.C. Penney CoStar News said.

ExxonMobil’s move to the Houston region will help the company save on costs including “nearly (US)$2 billion of structural efficiencies in 2021” on top of US$3 billion the company saved in 2020 the company told investors this week. This would put the energy giant on track to “significantly exceed our goal of (US)$6 billion of structural cost savings per year by 2023 relative to 2019” it said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbW9jcmFjeW5vdy5vcmcvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9ndXlhbmFzX2NhcmJvbl9ib21iX2V4eG9ubW9iaWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Environmental Lawyer Taking on ExxonMobil to “Defuse Guyana's Carbon Bomb”,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.democracynow.org/2022/12/23/guyanas_carbon_bomb_exxonmobil on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbW9jcmFjeW5vdy5vcmcvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9ndXlhbmFzX2NhcmJvbl9ib21iX2V4eG9ubW9iaWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL3RleGFzL2F1c3Rpbi8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2F1c3Rpbi1maXJtLWdyYWJzLWZvcm1lci1leHhvbm1vYmlsLWNhbXB1cy1pbi1pcnZpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon's Former Campus Picked Up By Capital Commercial Investments,"It’s been almost a year but ExxonMobil Corporation’s Las Colinas headquarters is finally off the market.

The 290-acre property on State Highway 114 in Irving has been picked up by Austin-based real estate company Capital Commercial Investments. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed per the Dallas Morning News.

ExxonMobil put its corporate campus on the market in January after it announced it would be relocating its top executives and corporate staff to a megacampus in Houston. With many employees still based in North Texas Exxon’s Houston move isn’t expected to be completed until mid-2023.

JLL marketed the sale calling the property “one of the most desired addresses in North Texas.” The campus was built in 1996 after Exxon moved its head offices to North Texas from Manhattan. The deal includes the 365000-square-foot headquarters building which faces a small lake plus more than 200 acres of undeveloped land. While Capital Commercial has not indicated what it plans to do with the surrounding vacant space it could be used to construct millions of square feet of mixed-use development.

Since its founding in 1992 Capital Commercial has invested in and developed more than 12.8 million square feet of property across four states. The former Exxon campus is not the Austin-based firm’s first venture into North Texas. A little over a year ago it acquired the massive JCPenney campus in Plano. The sale was one of 2021′s biggest commercial property buys in North Texas. Earlier this month Penney’s announced to employees that it was moving its offices back to the Plano campus after two years.

Now newly disclosed documents confirm that the oil company’s reputational woes have extended into the industry itself and threatened to derail Exxon’s biggest climate proposal to date.

Last year Exxon struggled to gain support from its peers when it proposed a cross-industry effort to build a carbon capture and storage hub in Houston according to documents released by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform which has been investigating the oil industry. Top executives at Shell in particular worried that joining with Exxon would present an “unacceptable risk” to the European oil major’s reputation.

“I am not interested in participating with any advocacy effort led by” Exxon wrote Krista Johnson Shell’s head of US government relations in a July 2021 email to Gretchen Watkins president of Shell USA. Johnson said their competitor was continuing to draw negative headlines and that “zero companies” were prepared to join an Exxon-led consortium at that time.

A month later Watkins said she opposed any public participation with Exxon. “Their reputation is severely damaged here” she wrote to colleagues in the Netherlands where Shell was headquartered at the time “and we will only do harm to the strength of Shell’s US reputation.” (Shell later moved its headquarters to London.)

In April 2021 Exxon proposed a $100 billion public-private partnership to build what would become the world’s largest carbon capture and storage “hub” in Houston. The plan was to install equipment to remove carbon dioxide from smokestacks at the region’s largest power plants refineries and other industrial operations before it reached the atmosphere. The gas would then be compressed and sent through pipelines to wells drilled beneath the Gulf of Mexico where it would be injected underground for permanent storage. The company said the effort could eventually prevent up to 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year by 2040 but would need the region’s largest corporate polluters to participate.

The proposal has drawn substantial skepticism and criticism from environmental advocates who say carbon capture is unlikely to ever reach the scale proposed by Exxon. They have warned that government subsidies for the technology would be a waste of climate funding and have argued that Exxon was using carbon capture to burnish its image rather than drive real emissions reductions.

The documents suggest that some within the oil industry shared these concerns even if they supported carbon capture and storage as a climate solution.

Watkins in her August 2021 email said “I fully support our engagement” with potential carbon capture investments in the United States but advised steering clear of Exxon’s public announcement. She feared that Exxon was attempting to improve its image by appearing alongside Shell she wrote ahead of a possible Congressional hearing where oil executives might testify.

Another email from Marnie Funk a senior adviser for government relations at Shell said that Chevron was “internally divided” on whether to join Exxon’s effort with “Some minor unease in some Chevron quarters about Exxon reputational concerns.”

Funk also said Chevron viewed Exxon’s claims about how much carbon dioxide the project could capture and how many jobs it could create as “inflated—but harmless inflation.”

Chevron and Shell declined to comment for this article.

The emails say Exxon executives were calling all the Houston area’s top oil and chemical companies to get them to publicly pledge their support for the carbon capture proposal. The effort won the support of 11 companies including Chevron that released a joint statement in September 2021. Shell initially declined to join the effort but by January it had apparently been convinced too and publicly announced its support.

According to Funk’s email the September announcement was meant as the “first step” of an industry campaign to secure an expanded federal tax credit for carbon capture and new regulations that would allow companies to inject carbon dioxide beneath the Gulf of Mexico.

The Houston hub was “entirely dependent” on securing these changes Funk wrote and the industry’s lobbying campaign was ultimately successful on both fronts. The carbon capture tax credit was expanded this year by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Interior Department is in the process of drafting rules for carbon dioxide storage beneath federal waters.

The only Houston oil major that did not join the effort was BP which declined to comment for this article.

The documents were released earlier this month as part of an investigation by the House committee into the oil industry’s alleged campaign to spread disinformation about climate change. They were accompanied by a memo which said “These documents demonstrate how the fossil fuel industry ‘greenwashed’ its public image with promises and actions that oil and gas executives knew would not meaningfully reduce emissions even as the industry moved aggressively to lock in continued fossil fuel production for decades to come.” The memo was presumably the final act of the investigation before Republicans take control of the House next year when they are expected to curtail the committee’s work.

Todd Spitler an Exxon spokesman declined to comment on Shell’s internal discussions but said in an email that “The House Oversight Committee report has sought to misrepresent ExxonMobil’s position on climate science and its support for effective policy solutions by recasting well intended internal policy debates as an attempted company disinformation campaign.” He added “Our CEO has testified under oath on this subject during two all-day Congressional hearings before two separate committees we’ve been in regular communication with the committee for over a year and have provided staff with more than one million pages of documents including board materials and internal communications.”

Beyond the drama between companies the documents released by the committee also shed light on the oil industry’s sustained efforts to promote carbon capture and storage. For years the documents show companies saw the technology as a means of enabling continued fossil fuel consumption even as the world’s transition to cleaner energy grew more urgent. But the only way carbon capture could succeed the companies said was by winning substantial government funding and public support.

In 2016 for example a Princeton University program that is sponsored by BP sent the company advice on how to address climate change. One of the recommendations was to “Understand the potential for CCS” or carbon capture and storage “to enable the full use of fossil fuels across the energy transition and beyond.”

A 2017 Shell document titled “US Gulf Coast CCS Opportunity Framing” said “the window for CCS to remain relevant with governments and society is closing quickly” and that action was needed within a decade. “The value of CCS to Shell is the ability to decarbonize our products retain a larger market share for our products in the energy transition in addition to reputational value” it said.

Two years later a note to Shell’s executive committee said carbon capture in the United States faced “economic challenges” but that the company would continue to pursue a Gulf Coast project because of the possibility of future incentives and the “potential need for CCS on critical Shell projects.”

The documents also include a 2018 update on a National Petroleum Council report about carbon capture and storage written by John Mingé a former chief of BP America who led the petroleum council study. In addition to lowering emissions the document said wide deployment of carbon capture technology could help increase US oil production secure the export of fossil fuels to countries with stringent climate policies and allow for continued use of “existing infrastructure over the long term.”

Mingé’s update recommended “simplifying the narrative” about carbon capture as part of an effort to win support for the technology across academia environmental groups governments and the financial sector.

The petroleum council report published in December 2019 went on to become a foundational document for the industry’s lobbying over the last two years. Over that period Congress and the Biden administration have allocated more money to carbon capture than any other government in history.

She was 66.

The cause was bile duct cancer her cousin Edward Conlon said.

For nearly a quarter century Sister Pat as she was known was the executive director and galvanizing force of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment a group of religious orders that used the ownership of shares by their pension funds as an entree to challenge corporate executives to act more responsibly on a range of issues including environmental protection climate change and social justice.

“I don’t use the God card” she told The Chicago Tribune in 2005. “I’m not saying I’m speaking for Jesus here. But if people see the Dominicans and the Jesuits on a shareholder resolution they’re going to say ‘These are people with some credibility.’”

Before General Electric held its annual meeting in 1998 she proposed a resolution calling on the company to publicize the dangers of eating fish from the Hudson River which G.E.’s factories had polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs. To press its case the coalition paid for a full-page ad in The New York Times with a picture of a G.E. plant and upending the company’s own slogan a pointed message: “On the Hudson G.E. Brings BAD Things to Life.”"

They can now snap up highly desirable public tech companies at bargain-basement prices after valuations plunged by as much as 80% this year.

Just this week the PE giant Thoma Bravo agreed to buy the software maker Coupa an enterprise spend-management-software company in a deal valued at $8 billion. Coupa's stock had fallen 60% this year and the deal offers Coupa a 77% premium to where the stock was trading when word of the deal first got out.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Overall dealmakers have been sitting on the sidelines this year with PE activity down 55% in the third quarter from an already slow second quarter according to EY.

Investment bankers who Insider spoke with blame the slowdown on turbulence in the leveraged-financing markets as well as a reluctance of boards and major shareholders to sell at depressed valuations.

""A lot of frustration comes from the sell side being unrealistic"" Kirk Kaludis the global head of technology investment banking at RBC Capital Markets said.

For instance after recent speculation that another firm Vista Equity Partners wanted to buy Coupa the company's largest shareholder took the unusual step of saying publicly it would oppose any deal that undervalued the company.

But the company still ended up being taken private albeit at a higher price. And sellers are becoming increasingly resigned to accept lower offers Jason Gurandiano RBC's US head of technology banking said.

""We're starting to see people engage particularly founders who see the outlook for the next couple of years"" Gurandiano said. ""They can make a decision to sell today at a depressed multiple or hold on for a couple years and have value destruction.""

On the buyer side PE firms are sitting on upward of $2.5 trillion in dry powder. Thoma Bravo announced earlier this month it had completed fundraising for massive buyout funds totaling more than $32.4 billion after its recent acquisitions of the software companies Anaplan ForgeRock Ping Identity and SailPoint Technologies.

Bankers are advising private-equity clients to act fast.

""If you don't buy now it's gonna be more expensive in the second half of the year"" said James McVeigh a longtime investment banker and the founder and CEO of Cyndx a market-research firm. ""You will see pricing run away from you after Q1.""

So which companies are likely to be on the holiday-shopping lists of PE firms?

Cyndx which recently launched a new corporate-valuation tool for companies provided Insider with the most likely targets. (Coupa was originally on the list before it got snapped up.) Cyndx based the list on criteria bankers and buyout firms consider the most important:

Dependable revenue. Private-equity firms require a steady cash flow to pay down debt which excludes many kinds of tech companies that have more volatile income streams. One big exception is software-as-a-service companies that have subscriptions and other long-term contracts with customers who rely on them to run their businesses even in a recession.

One big exception is software-as-a-service companies that have subscriptions and other long-term contracts with customers who rely on them to run their businesses even in a recession. A market capitalization between $1 billion and $10 billion. There are some bigger leveraged-buyout deals — like Twitter's if that ever closes — but the average private-equity deal was $1.1 billion last year according to Bain & Co.

This one is not hard to find with the Nasdaq down about 20% this year and many SaaS providers down much more than that. Earnings expected next year. If PE firms are preparing to layer on more debt companies have to generate profits and use that cash to pay off the loans.

Here are the 34 contenders ranked by the lowest enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio as of December 3. A company's enterprise value includes its market capitalization debt and any cash on the balance sheet. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a common measure of profitability. (An EV/EBITDA value below 10 is commonly interpreted as healthy though tech companies often have much higher ratios because investors are willing to pay more for growth.) Companies did not respond to requests for comment unless otherwise noted.

NCR

NCR Corporation a company that helps restaurants retailers and banks run their businesses has not had a great 2022. The company's stock price has fallen over 40% in the past 12 months with the public markets valuing the entire company at slightly more than its projected 2023 revenues. Additionally NCR is fairly leveraged with $5.7 billion in debt versus $736 million in cash. Wall Street expects the company's revenue to grow by 3.2% next year.

Synaptics

Synaptics is a developer of human-interface hardware and software or the means through which humans and computers communicate with each other like touchpads or biometrics. The company has suffered an over 64% drop in stock price this year and is projected to shrink revenue by nearly 3% in 2023.

SolarWinds

SolarWinds develops software to help businesses manage their networks. Its time as a public company has been stormy with the stock cut in half since debuting on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018 and falling more than 40% this year. SolarWinds now has an enterprise value of just over $2.5 billion making it affordable for PE firms that might also be attracted to its $493 million of cash on hand.

F5

F5 provides application security multi-cloud management and online-fraud prevention. It stands out from most other companies on our list because it has been public since 1999 and is relatively large with an enterprise value of nearly $9 billion. But with the stock down nearly 40% this year the company could finally be small enough to attract interest from PE buyers who could also take a liking to its solid balance sheet.

TaskUs

Outsourcing company TaskUs debuted on the public markets in June 2021 with a strong 26% IPO price pop. Since then however the company has seen its market capitalization sliced nearly in half in the last year. TaskUs' low trading multiple of 2.4 times next year's revenue could be a reflection of its slow revenue growth with an estimated increase in 2023 revenue of just 6.6% according to Wall Street estimates.

EverCommerce

EverCommerce's first year as a public company has been a rough one with the stock down more than 60% since its debut last July. But it has a durable and growing business providing software-as-a-service to half a million small and midsize companies. It's carrying more than half a billion dollars in debt but Wall Street analysts are projecting 12.4% revenue growth next year.

R1 RCM

R1 RCM offers revenue tools to healthcare companies. Despite suffering a 60% drop in stock price this year which resulted in the company trading at less than three times next year's revenue the company is still projected by Wall Street to grow sales at nearly 30% in 2023 making it an attractive target for private-equity firms.

Perficient

Digital consulting firm Perficient has been an active acquirer in recent years picking up other consulting companies like Inflection Point and Ameex Technologies. With a stock price down 45% in the last year though it may soon find itself on the other side of the table. With a market capitalization of $2.6 billion Perficient trades at three times next year's revenue and is projected to grow sales just under 10% in 2023.

E2Open

E2Open originally entered the public markets in July 2012 before being taken private by Insight Venture Partners in 2015. In February 2021 the supply chain management firm went public for the second time through a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC at the height of the SPAC craze. Now E2Open may become a private company again as the company deals with a stock price down nearly 50% in the last year and over $1 billion in debt versus just $115 million in cash. A E2Open spokesperson declined to comment.

RingCentral

RingCentral is similar to Zoom except it focuses on audio providing a cloud-based business-phone system that delivers team messages videoconferences and phone calls. Both companies have had their shares battered in the past year with RingCentral's stock down about 80% giving it a market capitalization of about $3.9 billion. RingCentral seems interested in being a buyer itself as there's been market chatter about a potential acquisition of its competitor 8x8.

Alarm.com

Alarm.com offers services for remote control home automation and monitoring services. The company's stock has sunk 37% this year currently trading at less than 3 times next year's revenue. Wall Street expects Alarm.com's sales to grow by just 3.8% in 2023 but the company is profitable making it a potential target for private equity firms.

Informatica

Permira and Canada's government-pension fund took Informatica an enterprise cloud-data-management platform private in 2015. The company went public again in October of last year and with its stock price cut in half this year it could be primed to go private yet again. The company brought in $1.44 billion in revenue last year up 9% from 2020. In 2023 it's forecasted to grow sales by 9.2%. An Informatica spokesperson told Insider that the company ""continues to stay focused on growing its cloud customer base and be a market leader in cloud data management.""

DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean provides businesses with cloud-computing services. The company experienced a 66% drop in stock price this year and is now trading at 5.4 times next year's revenue estimates. However DigitalOcean is EBITDA-positive and is forecasted to grow sales at a nearly 30% rate in 2023.

Momentive

Related stories

Customer experience company Momentive originally known as SurveyMonkey has had quite a well momentous year. At the end of 2021 customer service firm Zendesk announced its acquisition of Momentive but just a few months later in February 2022 Momentive's shareholders rejected the proposed acquisition following a failed takeover of Zendesk by a group of private equity firms. Since then Momentive's stock has plummeted 60% from where it was a year ago and the company is projected to grow revenue by just 8.3% next year. Momentive's failed acquisition and lackluster performance could present an opportunity for opportunistic PE firms.

Squarespace

The website builder Squarespace went public in May 2021 via direct listing at a market capitalization of $6.6 billion. Since then the company has seen lukewarm stock performance with its market cap dropping to $3 billion. Private-equity firms may be drawn to the company for its positive EBITDA although its sales growth has faltered with an expected 10.5% increase in 2023.

Cvent

Cvent provides software for event management marketing and attendee engagement. It first went public in 2013 raising $135 million. Three years later it was taken private by Vista Equity Partners for $1.65 billion and it went public again late last year this time via a special-purpose acquisition company. Since then its stock has fallen by nearly 40%. It may soon be a private company for a third time.

Twilio

Twilio which sells programmable communication tools for making and receiving phone calls saw its stock plummet 34% in November after lowering its fourth-quarter guidance. The stock is down more than 80% this year and Twilio's enterprise value sits at just $6.4 billion. PE buyers could be enticed by the company's pristine balance sheet with more than $4 billion of cash against less than $1 billion in debt.

Five9

Five9 is a provider of cloud-based call-center software that over 2500 clients use for sales marketing and customer service. In 2021 Five9's shareholders rejected Zoom's $14.7 billion bid for the company but with a halved market capitalization from a year ago and a forecasted 16.5% revenue growth Five9 may be back on the market. A Five9 spokesperson declined to comment.

Everbridge

Everbridge which offers applications for personal safety and business continuity has seen its stock rise 20% in the past month. Even so the stock is trading at half what it was at the beginning of 2022. Everbridge brought in $368.4 million of revenue last year that analysts are projecting to grow 6.3% in the next year. Meanwhile its enterprise value stands at just $1.7 billion.

Altair

Altair offers software for simulation high-performance computing data analytics and artificial intelligence. The company's stock is down about 30% this year with an acquisition of data analytics and machine learning company RapidMiner announced in September and analysts predict only 8.4% revenue growth next year. Altair has about equal amounts of cash and debt $312 million and $305 million respectively. An Altair spokesperson declined to comment.

Rapid7

Throughout 2020 and 2021 Rapid7's stock soared as high-profile cybersecurity attacks and data breaches made the company's security offerings more relevant than ever. However after a year of falling stock prices and the acquisitions of fellow cybersecurity companies like Ping Identity and ForgeRock by PE firm Thoma Bravo Rapid7 may be next in line for buyers. The company has a nearly $2 billion market capitalization and is projected to grow revenue by 17.3% next year. A Rapid7 spokesperson declined to comment.

Q2

Q2 helps banks credit unions and fintech companies with digital banking and lending. Its stock has plummeted by nearly 70% this year giving it an enterprise value of less than $2 billion. The company has yet to turn a profit but has seen revenue growth of greater than 20% the past three years and analysts are projecting 13.6% growth next year leaving some to believe the stock is oversold.

Definitive Healthcare

Definitive Healthcare a healthcare analytics and data provider company joined a steady stream of healthcare companies going public in 2021 like medical professional platform Doximity and digital health startup Hims & Hers. Although the public offering was priced on the high end of its range and enjoyed a near 50% IPO pop Definitive Healthcare's stock has struggled since falling 57% in the last year. However the company is still trading at nearly 12 times next year's revenue and is projected to grow sales by about 17% in 2023.

Qualtrics

Qualtrics is an experience management company that allows enterprise users like UPS to easily create surveys and generate reports. Since going public last year its stock has fallen nearly 80% giving it a market capitalization of around $6 billion. But it has $732 million in cash on hand with zero debt and analysts are projecting 16% revenue growth. One obstacle to a sale is that any deal would have to be approved by SAP the German software company that remains the controlling shareholder.

Duck Creek Technologies

Duck Creek Technologies provides software to the property and casualty insurance industry. The company was one of the first to go public during the COVID-19 pandemic and its stock saw mixed performance during 2020 and 2021 due to smaller-than-expected earnings beats and weak financial guidance. This year Duck Creek's market capitalization has been cut by 60% presenting a potential opportunity for PE firms to pick up an asset at a low price.

Elastic

Elastic helps companies quickly store search and analyze huge volumes of data in the cloud. Its stock is down more than 50% this year despite projected revenue growth of 25% and an enviable client roster that includes Netflix Microsoft Slack and Uber.

Varonis

Data security and analytics company Varonis was perhaps one of the greatest beneficiaries of 2020 and 2021's tech craze as the company saw its stock soar over 300% from March 2020 to its heights in September 2021. This year though Varonis has come back to earth — its stock price has sunk over 57% in the last 12 months. However the company is still well capitalized with $790 million in cash and $249 million in debt and with lots of deal activity in the cybersecurity space Varonis could be an enticing acquisition choice. A Varonis spokesperson declined to comment.

nCino

nCino which offers a bank operating system braved the global pandemic to go public in July 2020 a time when many tech companies were avoiding the public markets. They were rewarded with a more than 150% surge in price during their first day of trading. Since then though the company's stock has faced tougher times decreasing by 47% in the last 12 months and giving the company a market capitalization of $3.1 billion. Wall Street predicts nCino's revenue to grow about 20% from 2022 to 2023.

Olo

Strong demand for Olo's March 2021 IPO helped push the company's offering price range from $16-$18 to $20-$22 before ultimately pricing at $25 per share with a nearly $4 billion valuation. A year and a half later the restaurant tech company's enterprise value is merely $842 million. Despite Olo's dismal stock price performance PE buyers could be enticed with the company's zero debt and 17% projected revenue growth.

Zuora

Zuora helps companies build run and grow their subscription businesses. The company has seen a nearly 60% drop in stock price this year and is trading at less than two times next year's revenue. In March 2022 Zuora received $400 million in capital from tech investment firm Silver Lake in the form of convertible debt and the recent cash infusion may make it less open to a takeover. However with strong projected 2023 revenue growth of 18.6% Zuora remains a strong target for PE firms.

Sprinklr

In June 2021 customer experience management company Sprinklr went public in a downsized IPO both cutting its opening price and number of shares sold. Since its lackluster public debut Sprinklr's bad luck has continued as the company has experienced a 36% decrease in stock price in the last year. But the company carries zero debt on its books and analysts expect brisk 19% revenue growth next year. A Sprinklr spokesperson declined to comment.

New Relic

New Relic provides cloud-based software to help websites and app owners track performance. The stock is down about 45% this year and now trades at less than three times next year's projected sales. New Relic's tough year has resulted in takeover rumors with Reuters reporting that the company is preparing to explore a potential sale following interest from private equity firms and a growing stake from activist investor Jana Partners. New Relic said as a company policy they do not comment on rumors or speculation.

BlackLine

BlackLine develops cloud-based services to automate the financial-close accounts-receivable and intercompany accounting processes. Its stock price has been hammered going down about 40% this year and making it the subject of mergers-and-acquisitions chatter. Wall Street sees 21% revenue growth over the next year.

UiPath

During its April 2021 IPO UiPath landed a $31 billion valuation slightly below its last private financing valuation of $35 billion but an impressive achievement nonetheless. Over the past year the software automation company has seen its stock plummet over 60% and now the company has an enterprise value of less than $7 billion. However UiPath has zero debt on its books and analysts are projecting demand for its offerings will remain strong with strong revenue growth of almost 20% next year.

The trend is clear: Inflation is cooling off in America.

The Federal Reserve’s preferred measurement of inflation showed price increases continued to moderate in November providing yet another welcome indication that the period of painfully high prices has peaked.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index or PCE rose 5.5% in November from a year earlier the Commerce Department reported Friday. That’s lower than in October when prices rose 6.1% annually.

In November alone prices rose just 0.1% from October.

Core PCE which excludes the volatile food and energy categories was up 4.7% annually and 0.2% on a monthly basis matching expectations of economists polled by Refinitiv.

The annual increases for both PCE inflation indexes hit their lowest levels since October 2021 and follows continued declines in other inflation gauges such as the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index.

PCE specifically the core measurement is the Fed’s favored inflation gauge since it provides a more complete picture of costs for consumers.

Friday’s report also showed that spending continued to rise in November but at a much slower pace than in previous months. Spending was up 0.1% in November as compared to 0.8% the month before. Personal income increased by 0.4% in November down from 0.7% in October.

What the Fed is looking for

The November PCE report the last major inflation gauge released in 2022 provided a snapshot of an economy in transition. Tasked with reining in the highest inflation since the early 1980s the Fed has undertaken a series of blockbuster interest rate hikes to squelch demand.

In its seven meetings starting in March the central bank’s policymaking arm raised its benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 4.25 percentage points. The sharp hike in rates has started to filter through the economy its effects showing up first in areas such as real estate where mortgage rates were 6.27% this week more than double the rate seen last year at this time according to Freddie Mac data.

“The economy is moving in the right direction from the Federal Reserve’s perspective at the end of 2022 but not quickly enough” Gus Faucher chief economist for PNC Financial Services said in a statement. “Higher interest rates are weighing on consumer spending particularly for durable goods and inflation is slowing.”

Inflation has moderated in recent months especially on items like goods as supply chain bottlenecks have eased and consumers focused more spending in areas like leisure and hospitality.

However inflation within the services sector has been a little “sticky” and not abating as quickly. Friday’s PCE report showed the services index posted a monthly increase of 0.4% – unchanged from October’s rate – and a year-over-year increase of more than 11% Faucher noted.

While much of the services inflation is due to housing costs which are rapidly reversing the Fed is concerned that strong wage growth could fuel persistent increases in services prices and overall inflation he added.

“The Federal Open Market Committee will continue to increase the fed funds rate in early 2023 until it becomes more apparent that the job market is cooling and wage growth and services inflation are slowing to more sustainable paces” he added.

The Fed’s latest economic projections that were released last week showed that board members were expecting inflation to remain slightly higher for longer than previously forecast. Fed board members now expect PCE inflation to end 2023 at 3.1% and core PCE to finish next year at 3.5% above the central bank’s target rate of 2%.

Durable goods orders sink in November

A separate Commerce Department report released Friday showed that new orders for manufactured goods tumbled 2.1% in November the biggest monthly drop since the onset of the pandemic.

Transportation equipment specifically new orders for non-defense aircraft and parts drove the decline according to the report. Excluding transportation new orders increase 0.2%.

Shipments increased 0.2% in November which followed a 0.4% increase in October.

“Core durable goods orders slowed but did not contract reflecting growing unease about the economy” Diane Swonk chief economist for KPMG tweeted Friday after the report’s release. “Manufacturing activity has begun to contract and prelim reading for December suggests it will contract further at year end. A cold winter expected for the manufacturing sector.

How consumers are feeling

Inflation’s slow march downward has been welcome news to consumers as well helping to perk up their economic sentiments during December according to new data released Friday by the University of Michigan.

The final December reading for the index of consumer sentiment came in at 59.7 in December up slightly from a preliminary measurement of 59.1 and November’s final reading of 56.8 according to data from the university’s Surveys of Consumers.

“Consumers clearly welcomed the recent easing of inflation” Joanne Hsu director of the Surveys of Consumers said in a statement. “While sentiment appears to have turned a corner from its all-time low from June consumers have reserved judgment about whether the trends will continue.”

She added: “Their outlook for the economy may have improved but it remains relatively weak. The sustainability of robust consumer spending is contingent on continued strength in incomes and labor markets in the quarters ahead.”

The report showed the biggest improvement in sentiment about business conditions while inflation expectations also improved by falling to 4.4% in December the lowest reading in 18 months according to the university. This is a key data point for the Federal Reserve. If consumers believe prices will remain high that could factor into increased wage demands which could cause businesses to raise prices.

Earlier this week the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index – another measure of how consumers are feeling about the economy – landed at its highest measurement since April 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you want to see more stocks in this selection go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.

A monopoly is defined as a market arrangement in which a single seller dominates the market and offers a unique product. In its purest form a monopoly has a 100% share of the market. Numerous industries are dominated by prominent players with significant market shares. These firms enjoy economies of scale and create barriers to entry for any new potential player to come up and break their domination. Companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have entered a sector and absorbed a sizeable amount of the market share are considered near-monopolies. These businesses frequently diversify their product lines in order to increase market share and revenue. Although the businesses allow some room for competition they yield significant market power over the industry.

Monopolies enjoy strong pricing power and famous investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett considers it a factor when he shortlists a stock for his portfolio that is followed and tracked by millions of investors globally. Back in 2011 when the Oracle of Omaha was asked to testify in front of the US Congress and provide the reason for investing in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) he highlighted that pricing power is one of the most integral criteria for evaluating a business. He added that if a business can increase prices without losing its market share to an industry peer it has a strong business model. Moody's along with two other credit rating agencies owns 95% of the credit rating market. The New York-based entity is still the eighth biggest investment in the portfolio of Omaha Nebraska-diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B) with a value of nearly $6 billion as of Q3 2022.

Interestingly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest holding in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway with a value of over $123.6 billion as of Q3 2022. The tech giant holds a monopoly or near monopoly position in numerous industries. Meanwhile American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is the fifth biggest investment in the portfolio of Warren Buffett. The New York-based company provides credit and debit cards along with Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Together these three entities hold a 99% share in the credit and debit card industry. All these monopolies or near-monopolies generate healthy profits and receive a positive response from experts. Another example is Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which occupies the fourth biggest position in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway. Together with PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) these three companies hold a market share of 57% in the soda industry.

Located at 301 Washington Street the building is owned by Capital One and is comprised of eight-contiguous lots and 0.33 acres.

Pierson Commercial’s Robert Mackowski represented Federal Realty Investment Trust (Federal Realty) the buyer of the corner-lot retail building.

“Due to our relationships with the buyer as well as the seller we were able to bring all the parties together and facilitate the sale of this highly sought-after retail property” said Mackowski.

The building is situated on an in-demand corner within Hoboken’s business district. Retail block co-tenants include Lululemon Athleta Sephora Starbucks and Panera Bread.

Recently a plan was unveiled to redevelop the parcels. The plan looks to demolish everything at the site in favor of a new five-story mixed-use development.

“Many investors have had their eye on this particular redevelopment opportunity due to the uniqueness of having over 145 feet of contiguous frontage along Washington Street – a rare-to-market opportunity that currently cannot be found anywhere else on the street” said Mackowski. “Adding in the prominent corner location high-foot traffic and identity at the heart of Hoboken’s thriving business district made this opportunity especially appealing. It was the right time the right buyer and the right property which was a win-win for one and all.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHA6Ly9yb2JlcnRkeWVyLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyL2xhc3Qtc3RvcmUtY2xvc2VzLWF0LW1henphLWdhbGxlcmllLWFuZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Last store closes at Mazza Gallerie and demolition prep gets underway (Photos),Bethesda news restaurants nightlife events and openings real estate crime reports and more - the way only a lifelong Bethesda resident like Robert Dyer can bring it to you.

Snowy icy conditions are slowing deliveries across the country.

UPS and FedEx released advisories warning of delays and USPS closed offices in five states.

Extreme cold will spread from the Midwest to the East Coast and South through Saturday.

A fast-moving brutal winter weather system could jeopardize last-minute gift deliveries just days before Christmas.

UPS and FedEx released service advisories ahead of the arctic blast weather system that's expected to bring ""astronomical winter"" conditions to nearly every state in the US ahead of the holiday weekend according to the National Weather Service.

Arctic blizzards below-freezing temperatures and intense winds which set in Wednesday are forecast to impact millions of Americans from the Pacific Northwest to the Appalachian Mountains through Saturday afternoon the government agency said in a notice.

FedEx's Friday advisory said winter weather had created ""substantial disruptions"" to shipments going through the company's Indianapolis and Memphis air hubs. Delays at these hubs could affect packages with Friday and Saturday delivery dates across the US according to the company.

UPS announced that severe winter weather is affecting deliveries across several regions of the US.

""Significant weather events across several regions of the U.S. are impacting the UPS Air and Ground network including UPS hubs in Louisville Kentucky and Rockford Illinois. As a result some delivery and pickup services in these areas will be affected"" the alerts reads. Packages will arrive as quickly as conditions allow according to the company.

Neither company will offer refunds for shipments that arrive late due to weather each stipulated.

The United States Postal Service closed offices in Iowa Nebraska North Dakota South Dakota and Minnesota due to weather as of Thursday.

Though the weather system will be felt by most Americans Friday some delivery drivers have already experienced snowy and icy conditions.

At least one UPS and one FedEx Ground driver posted on Reddit photos of trucks stuck in snowy drifts.

""I get worried for some other drivers who aren't exactly prepared that well but there's no such thing as bad weather! Just bad attire!"" said a Minnesota UPS driver who declined to be named since he hadn't received permission from the company to speak to the media.

""I've never been stuck and don't plan on it"" the driver told Insider adding that many delivery drivers will be driving less-optimal rental trucks this time of year due to the holiday rush.

FedEx faced continued weak market demand for air cargo in the second quarter with FedEx Express a particular pain point.

In the second quarter ended November 30 the transport company said previously implemented cost reduction measures helped soften the blow of reduced FedEx Express revenue.

Second quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $22.8bn compared to second quarter fiscal 2022 results of $23.5bn.

FedEx Express revenue is $10.9bn for the second quarter of 2023 down 6% on the same period last year.

FedEx Ground revenue is $8.4bn up 2% on the same period last year and FedEx Freight revenue is $2.5bn up 8% on the same period last year.

Earlier this year the company suffered the effects of lower than expected volumes prompting it to plan cost reduction initiatives.

In the latest fiscal quarter FedEx Express operating income declined 64% year-over-year due to lower global volumes partially offset by an 8% package yield increase.

In response FedEx Express implemented previously planned and incremental cost reduction actions during the quarter to mitigate the impact of volume declines including structural air network changes and the temporary parking of aircraft.

FedEx Ground FedEx Ground operating income increased 24% year on year due primarily to a 13% yield increase and cost reduction actions.

These factors were partially offset by increased purchased transportation rates lower package volume and higher other operating expenses.

FedEx Freight operating income increased 32% year on year driven by an 18% yield increase which was partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits and decreased shipments.

“The FedEx team moved with urgency to make rapid progress on our ongoing transformation while navigating a weaker demand environment” said Raj Subramaniam FedEx president and chief executive.

“Our earnings exceeded our expectations in the second quarter driven by the execution and acceleration of our aggressive cost reduction plans. At the same time we continue to focus on delivering excellent service for our customers.”

“Our teams have an unwavering focus on rapidly implementing cost savings to improve profitability” said Michael C. Lenz FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. “As we look to the second half of our fiscal year we are accelerating our progress on cost actions helping to offset continued global volume softness.”

Splurges on expensive bottles of wine and jewelry will be less spontaneous. For many bankers it might not be the most wonderful time of the year.

Annual bonuses — one of the most hotly anticipated numbers on Wall Street — are expected to be down as much as 50 percent this year as investment banks grapple with declining revenues following a sharp drop in their main businesses of lending mergers and acquisitions advisory and initial public offerings. With a possible recession in the offing next year might not look much better.

In a recent management committee meeting David Solomon the chief executive of Goldman Sachs told executives to brace for a steep drop in bonuses a possible recession and a continued slowdown in banking activity that could last through at least the second half of 2023 according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.

Machine had initiated a UCC foreclosure on Relevant’s 190-key Thompson hotel and the 212-key Tommie hotel in Hollywood with an auction scheduled for Dec. 21.

The auction has now been delayed until Jan. 21 according to Relevant’s managing partner Grant King.

“Relevant has engaged counsel and advisors and are currently working to determine the most prudent path forward” King said when the foreclosure was initiated in November.

In April of last year Machine provided Relevant with $72 million in mezzanine financing for both hotels a package that was described by sources at the time as a “rescue” deal.

Given foreclosures are a common recourse for mezzanine lenders in the case of default these lenders often find themselves owning the assets. Machine was founded in 2020 by Andy Kwon and Eric Rosenthal two former brokers at Garrison Investment Group with the intention of financing distressed assets.

Relevant which has faced cost overruns and construction delays during the pandemic also faces a number of challenges from local labor union Unite Here Local 11.

The hospitality industry union has filed federal and state labor complaints alleging former workers at the Thompson hotel were unfairly and unjustly fired. One complaint filed with California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleges a server was discriminated against for speaking Spanish and was called a homophobic slur by a chef at the restaurant.

In December Unite Here Local 11 met with pension fund Missouri LAGERS — an investor in Machine — to push the fund to ask Machine to abide by an arbitration ruling requiring Relevant to participate in a labor agreement with the union.

In light of the planned foreclosure the union “expects any successor operator of the hotel” to abide by the ruling Unite Here said in a statement.

A number of foreclosures have popped up in the L.A. market as loans come due. In Century City Michael Rosenfeld’s $2.5 billion Century Plaza hotel and residential development is up for foreclosure and in Downtown L.A. Starwood recently took over the Broadway Trade Center from investor Joel Schreiber after a foreclosure.",,,

And if holiday shopping has emptied your wallet or you need to handle any other banking business Saturday will be your last chance—and most banks will be calling it a day early.

Christmas Eve falls on a Saturday when most banks already have reduced hours. And just to make things more complicated Monday is a bank holiday so they’ll be closed then as well.

Hours can vary from branch to branch so it’s always wise to call and confirm before you venture out especially if your location is near a mall. Here’s a look at which banks are open—and how late.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also reported Friday (Dec. 23) that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for November increased by 0.1%.

Prices for services increased 0.4% and those for food rose 0.3%. These rises were partially offset by a 0.4% decrease in prices for goods and a 1.5% drop in energy prices according to the report.

Excluding food and energy the PCE price index increased 4.7% from a year earlier.

November’s increase in the PCE price index was the lowest recorded since July when prices dropped 0.1%.

In a Friday statement posted by the White House President Joe Biden said that the data shows signs of resilience and a recovery in the economy.

“Today’s report shows that incomes are up and inflation is coming down — while our job market remains strong” Biden said. “Christmas arrives with gas prices down and grocery store prices showing the lowest increase in a year.”

In a Friday report by Reuters Chris Zaccarelli chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte North Carolina said “Inflation continues to slow down which is good news for the Fed’s most important objective but unfortunately for the market it is happening at the same time as consumers are reducing their spending.”

In other news from the BEA report consumers’ incomes grew faster than their expenditures in November.

BEA said that personal income increased by 0.4% disposable personal income (DPI) grew 0.4% and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were up 0.1% during the month.

The growth rates for both personal income and disposable personal income were lower than October’s 0.7% but equal to the 0.4% seen in the three months before that. Personal consumption expenditures slowed considerably from October’s 0.9% growth rate and increased at the slowest pace since July which saw a decrease of 0.1%.

The increase in personal income was driven by increases in compensation — with private wages and salaries rising in both services-producing industries and goods-producing industries — and personal income receipts on assets.

Spending on services increased in November but this was partially offset by a decrease in spending on goods. Consumers spent more on housing during the month driving the growth in spending on services but spent less on new motor vehicles especially light trucks which was the category that led to the drop in spending on goods.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5jaW5uYXRpLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvMi04LW1pbGxpb24taW5kaWFuLWhpbGwtaG9tZS1zYWxlLWFtb25nLXRoZS13ZWVrcy10b3AtcHJvcGVydHktdHJhbnNmZXJzLzY5NzQxMjUwMDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$2.8 million Indian Hill home sale among the week's top property transfers,"Cincinnati Enquirer

Located at 13037 South Daniel Drive the 297-unit affordable apartment complex consists of 29 two- to three-story residential buildings and one community building. L+M and SAA|EVI secured $99.7 million in funding for the acquisition and rehabilitation of Concordia including improvements to both interior and exterior features across the aging property.

Concordia Place Apartments is comprised of 29 studios 92 one-bedroom apartments 114 two-bedroom apartments and 62 three-bedroom apartments. Originally built in 1969 Concordia is home to 297 households and is federally subsidized by a HUD HAP Section 8 Contract. Through L+M and SAA|EVI’s extensive renovation plans for the property apartments will receive upgraded kitchens and bathrooms new flooring upgraded Energy Star lighting fixtures as well as new paint and drywall repairs. New windows and boilers will be installed and the exterior stair system will be replaced with a more durable and environmentally-friendly structure. Plans also include upgrades to the community building including a renovated community room with new flooring and paint as well as the addition of a computer lab and exercise room.

“As a company committed to preserving our nation’s critical affordable housing stock we are proud to partner with SAA|EVI on this acquisition that will modernize Concordia and significantly improve the quality of life for its residents” said Josue Sanchez Senior Director at L+M Development Partners. “By completely overhauling the property to make it more sustainable safe and functional Concordia will not only remain affordable but will also be a place where residents will live with dignity for decades to come. We are grateful to our partners particularly the City of Chicago the Illinois Housing Development Authority and HUD for supporting our mission and look forward to making this transformative vision for Concordia a reality.” “As a majority black-owned development company we recognize how rare it is for a firm like ours to equally be at the table advocating for people who have been marginalized and underinvested in” said Ernst Valery Co-Managing Member and President of SAA|EVI. “The project’s scope of work will go beyond the standard practice of fixing the property’s bricks and mortar. SAA|EVI consistently puts tenants first and our goal – which we will relentlessly pursue – is to create a platform at Concordia that invests real capital into the people we serve – our tenants – especially the most vulnerable amongst them – the children. Stay tuned!”

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides rental subsidy under the Project Based Section 8 program that financially assists the residents of Concordia. HUD extended the rental assistance contract for twenty years to facilitate the financing of the rehabilitation of the development.

“This plan assures that residents will receive much needed renovations to their units and improvements to the common areas” said Diane Shelley HUD Midwest Regional Administrator. “Most importantly the replacement of the exterior porch entrances will enhance the design and the safety at the development. This plan furthers Secretary Marcia Fudge’s commitment to the residents and to Operation PUSH/The Rainbow Coalition who advocated on behalf of the tenants for long term improvements.”

The project is being financed via tax-exempt bonds issued by the Illinois Housing Development Authority 4% low-income housing tax credits syndicated by Raymond James a Freddie Mac tax-exempt loan provided by Capital One and a tax-exempt bridge loan provided by Fifth Third Bank.

“The redevelopment of Concordia Place aligns with IHDA’s mission of ensuring everyone in Illinois has a safe healthy and affordable home” said IHDA Executive Director Kristin Faust. “Affordable housing benefits all of us and we truly appreciate our public and private partners who are working tirelessly to transform this property and improve quality of life for both current and future generations in the community.” “We’re proud to partner with L+M and SAA-EVI to bring about transformative change at Concordia Place” said Evan Williams Senior Vice President of Agency Finance Capital One. “Preserving affordable housing communities always has its challenges but we were able to offer timely problem solving to offset the impact from increasing builder’s risk insurance cost and lock in a 2.77% 10 year treasury through the Freddie Mac Index Lock allowing us to close on-time and on budget.” “Raymond James is thrilled to participate as the equity partner in the rehabilitation of Concordia Place Apartments in Chicago” said Darryl Seavey VP and Managing Director of Acquisitions for Raymond James Affordable Housing Investments Inc. “The much-needed renovations and upgrades to the building systems and individual apartments will provide modern safe and affordable housing for future generations of Riverdale residents. The scope will represent a significant rehabilitation featuring a redesigned contemporary exterior façade with improved insulation new exterior windows renovated kitchens and baths new kitchen appliances a modernized community room and upgraded mechanicals. The modernization of the building will significantly enhance the residences of the 297 families that call Concordia Place Apartments home. Raymond James would like to congratulate our partners on this exciting collaboration as well as all of the participants who made this project a reality.”

Top 5 biggest banks in Nigeria by market capitalisation

Legit.ng reported that Zenith Bank GT Bank and 3 others made the list of the top 5 banks in Nigeria according to market capitalisation. This is according to data released by the Nigerian Exchange at the close of the market on Monday November 28 2022.

The market capitalisation is in otherwords the cumulative value of the banks. It is calculated by multiplying the total units of shares held by the price of the shares.

Typically the positions would be comprised of the tier-1 banks in Nigeria which are sometimes known as FUGAZ (First Bank UBA GT Bank Access Bank and Zenith Bank) but for the period under our scope UBA lost its position on the list to Stanbic IBTC.

Electric vehicle (EV) sales have ramped up tremendously in the last few years but their overall market share is still very much tiny negating their potential for decarbonizing the transportation sector. For instance in the US EV registrations have doubled over the past year but they totaled only about 5% of all new cars.

One of the reasons why many prospective buyers in the market for a new vehicle are reluctant to switch to electric is range anxiety. Although the autonomy of EVs has improved tremendously now regularly averaging 200 miles (360 kilometers) people either overestimate the real range they actually need from an EV or are simply wary of having to find a charging point and deal with the subsequent waiting time. In short there’s this impression that EVs are not yet as convenient to drive as fossil-fuel vehicles which may or may not truly be the case depending on where you live.

Lightyear a startup from the Netherlands that raised €150 million in investment is launching the world’s first production-ready solar-powered electric vehicle perhaps with such prospective buyers in mind.

Their futuristic-looking vehicle known as Lightyear 0 is covered in five square meters of sleek solar panels that are perfectly integrated with the car’s streamlined design very radically different from the dull blue panels you see perched on many rooftops. These solar panels charge the car’s battery while it’s either parked outdoors or driving in the burning sun.

Under optimal conditions the solar cells covering the top of the car should be able to add up to 44 miles (70 km) a day to the battery’s 388-mile (625 kilometers) capacity the company said. In theory at least that’s enough to meet people’s average commutes and daily trips without ever having to plug the car in a socket.

That’s of course predicated on the average number of overcast days where you live. According to tests run by the startup considering a daily 22-mile (35 kilometers) drive the Lightyear car could be driven for two months in the Netherlands without having to be plugged in whereas in sunny countries like Spain or Portugal the EV could charge itself in the sun reliably for seven months. When it’s too cloudy you have to plug in the vehicle for charging just like any other regular EV.

But the innovation isn’t in the solar cells themselves but rather in the ‘holistic’ design of the vehicle. Every part and assembly choice is optimized to reduce drag and friction as well as reduce energy consumption so the power harnessed by the solar cells can actually provide a meaningful range. For instance there are no side-view mirrors as these add too much air friction their function being replaced by cameras that feed side and back views to a display in the dashboard. The materials used in the car have been chosen to be as lightweight as possible from the electric motors to the interior which is made from vegan leather and recycled polyethylene terephthalate bottles.

“If we would have the same amount of energy that we harvest on these panels on any other car that uses three times the amount of energy to drive it becomes useless. It becomes a very expensive gimmick” Roel Grooten the lead engineer of Lightyear told The Guardian who recently took the car for a test drive in northern Spain. “You have to build this car from the ground up to make it as efficient as possible to make it this feasible.”

For those looking to buy new cars however be warned that the world’s first production solar-powered car is by no means cheap though. The asking price for the sedan is €250000 ($265000) an awful lot of money to pay just to have your car charge in the sun. Apart from a few (very wealthy) early adopters it’s difficult to see solar cars making a dent in climate change. However the Dutch startup views this as a proof of concept with the long-term goal of launching a commercial solar-powered EV in the $30000 range.

At the moment Lightyear 0 is just months away from entering its production run which is slated to deliver up to 950 vehicles across Europe. After they’ve proven themselves to the market the Dutch company wants to introduce an affordable product that is no longer exclusive to millionaires.

Lightyear isn’t alone either. Munich-based Sono Motors is planning to release Sion a small car covered in 456 solar cells that can add 112 km of driving range to the car’s battery on average per week. Meanwhile legacy automakers like Mercedez-Bens and Toyota are also working with prototypes that involve outfitting their next EVs with rooftop solar cells.

Solar panels are more affordable now than ever before decreasing in price by more than 70 percent over the past decade according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The panels can also earn homeowners a federal tax credit to reduce their federal income tax bill.

But as more Mainers have been taking advantage of the now-competitive pricing and incentives they are sometimes encountering a problem: There is not always room on the wires to hook them up.

When homeowners are interested in residential solar they will typically call a solar installation company. The company determines whether the location is suitable for rooftop or ground-mounted solar panels and will figure out what system will meet the homeowner’s energy needs.

Then the company applies to a utility company such as Versant Power or Central Maine Power Co. for their customer to connect to the grid. The utilities are responsible for the system of poles wires substations and other equipment that make it possible to deliver electricity. The solar installation company’s application includes details such as the number of panels needed and the kilowatts of electricity the homeowner’s system is anticipated to generate.

But recently some Mainers have had their applications denied due to a lack of capacity on the electric grid. One was Matt Quinn of Trenton whose rooftop solar application was denied by Versant on Dec. 7.

“The fact that we would own our solar panels and essentially reduce our electric bill by 80 percent was very impactful for us” Quinn said. He said the state’s goal to be carbon neutral and to electrify is important but to him “the policies don’t jive with reality.”

Danny Piper the owner of Sundog Solar in Searsport a company that installs residential solar systems said he has recently seen three other customers in addition to Quinn have their applications to connect to the grid denied.

Versant which serves 159000 customer accounts in northern and eastern Maine did not provide an alternative or suggest modifications to help Quinn connect Quinn said. The utility’s emailed response to him said it was denying his application because the level of generation would cause high voltage with the existing system. Versant also said the project designed for Quinn’s residence was beyond the scope of a minor modification.



Connecting a specific project can affect the voltage on the larger system or the power quality both of which have to be maintained within certain limits said David Littell an energy and environmental lawyer and a former commissioner of the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

“It’s certainly an issue” he said. “It is really about the level of the grid to accommodate the energy and the voltage variation.”

Otherwise voltage variations can damage equipment within the homeowner’s house or others’ homes on the grid. He dealt with the issue last year when a voltage variation led to a power surge and fried his electric car charger he said.

The Public Utilities Commission mandates utility companies the largest of which are Versant and Central Maine Power to maintain adequate power levels to avoid issues such as voltage variation and power failures.

“When people are generating lots of solar energy and using only a fraction of it they’re pushing out a whole bunch of energy onto the grid for other nearby customers to use” said Judy Long the manager of communications at Versant. “And when they aren’t generating enough solar energy they’re pulling in power from us.”

The electric grid wasn’t built to have a lot of power sources on the distribution system or to facilitate a two-way flow of energy Long said. In addition utilities do not have discretion and are not allowed to save room for rooftop solar programs.

“We feel for these customers” she said. “But we take them on a first-come first-serve basis and we have to study them to make sure they’re safe and reliable.”

Granting residential solar connection requests was never a substantial problem in the past she said. But with incentives to develop larger community solar projects the demand to connect to the grid has increased and the utilities are facing a larger issue.

“There’s only so much room on distribution lines and with all the demand to interconnect larger projects we’re running out of room for all projects without the necessary expensive upgrades needed to maintain the safety and reliability of the system” Long said.

In Maine there are more requests to connect to the grid than ever before.

“There are more requests to connect to the grid megawatts-wise than we actually even have demand for electricity” Long said. “So if we interconnected all these projects we would be making more energy than we use.”

The Public Utilities Commission does not track how many residential solar projects are being denied statewide but its chairman Phil Bartlett said he does not believe there are more rejections than approvals.

“It could happen in some places if someone is on a circuit that has very limited capacity for new solar but that’s certainly not the norm” Bartlett said.

Central Maine Power declined to say how many applications it has rejected but it is seeing a greater demand to connect rooftop solar to the electric grid according to spokesperson Catharine Hartnett. It has hooked up 1663 new rooftop solar customers this year more than any previous year.

Versant meanwhile started tracking the issue recently when it was unable to connect 10 rooftop solar projects due to a lack of capacity Long said. It has connected 485 rooftop solar installations since 2020.

Connecting to the grid is one of the biggest issues facing renewable energy development not just in Maine but nationwide said Littell a lawyer who represents utilities and renewable energy developers. He believes the lack of capacity will require upgrades to the electric grid.

“But that really requires everyone to work together to efficiently resolve these issues” he said.

The average cost in Maine this year to install solar panels producing 5 kilowatts of power was between $14238 and $19262 according to EnergySage an online marketplace where people can shop for local solar installers. It estimates that for an average-sized system paid for upfront a homeowner can expect to save $22693 over 20 years.

Sister company Powertis – the project development arm of Soltec Power Holdings – recently connected its first solar PV plant in Brazil with a capacity of 112.5MW and located in the state of São Paulo.

Canadian Solar sold a 70% stake of the Marangatu and Panati-Sitiá projects last June to SPIC Brasil with 75% of the energy capacity already committed through long-term power purchase agreements.

“We are proud to collaborate with top-tier players and further contribute to achieving the goal of energy transition through promotion of photovoltaic solar energy” said Raúl Morales Soltec’s CEO.

FirstEnergy which includes Mon Power and PJM Interconnection the electric grid operator for the region are asking people take steps to conserve energy.

EMS officials say this is to help take strain off the electric grid and reduce the risk of rolling blackouts.

The companies are asking people to conserve electricity through 10 a.m. on Sunday December 25.

“Demand for electricity is expected to increase through the day as the cold temperatures continue and families gather to celebrate the holiday” FirstEnergy said in a statement. “PJM will continue to monitor conditions and will take additional actions if necessary which may include the potential for short rotating customer outages. Taking action to conserve energy now can help offset the need for additional actions later.”

“PJM asks consumers to continue these efforts as the risk of rotating power outages is real” the company said in a statement. “While PJM will do everything in its power to prevent that consumer efforts to conserve electricity over the next 24 hours will help to avoid outages.”

FirstEnergy offers the following tips to help conserve the use of electricity:

If health permits set thermostats at a lower temperature than usual.

Turn off non-essential appliances equipment and electric lights – including holiday lights – that you do not need or are not using.

Postpone using major electric household appliances such as stoves dishwashers and clothes dryers.

Close curtains and blinds to retain warm air inside homes.

Frank Bisignano has signed a new contract that will keep him as the chief executive officer of Fiserv Inc. through at least December 2027. Bisignano joined the currently Brookfield-based financial technology company in 2019 as part of its acquisition of First Data. He was named CEO in July 2020 and became chairman in May 2022.

Frank Bisignano has signed a new contract that will keep him as the chief executive officer of Fiserv Inc. through at least December 2027.

Bisignano joined the currently Brookfield-based financial technology company in 2019 as part of its acquisition of First Data. He was named CEO in July 2020 and became chairman in May 2022.

Fiserv recently announced plans to move its headquarters from Brookfield to downtown Milwaukee after considering a move for years. The roughly $37 million investment by the company is receiving $7 million in support from the city of Milwaukee through tax incremental financing and could also receive additional state tax incentives.

“I look forward to the ongoing successful execution of our winning strategy which is already demonstrating strong results and momentum” Bisignano said. “With our robust platform of solutions leading technology and the best talent Fiserv will continue to deliver for our shareholders clients and associates in a dynamic market.”

The employment agreement Bisignano entered into with Fiserv when he joined the company in 2019 included an initial two-year term. When he was named CEO the contract was extended through July 2025.

The new deal will run through December 2027 and then automatically renew annually unless the company or Bisignano decide to end it.

“With a deep commitment to clients and a proven track record of execution Frank has been a driving force in the growth and global technology leadership at Fiserv” said Doyle Simons lead independent director of Fiserv’s board. “Frank’s continued leadership enables us to create further value for our shareholders by delivering growth through innovation and discipline.”

Bisignano will have a base salary of $1.4 million starting in 2023 up from $1.32 million. He is also eligible for an annual cash incentive of at least $2.5 million and equity awards consistent with Fiserv’s incentive plans.

The contact also continues to allow Bisignano reasonable non-exclusive use of Fiserv’s private aircraft for personal travel and the use of a car and driver.

In 2021 Bisignano used the company aircraft for $101389 worth of personal travel and company provided transportation and security for another $160300 worth of personal use.

GM isn't showing any signs of slowing its pursuits.

Over the past few years unmistakable buzz has surrounded autonomous vehicle technology as start-ups and major manufacturers are both battling to be king of a new frontier.

However with Ford Motor Company's (F -1.15%) shift away from trying to develop fully autonomous driving technology via Argo AI -- and the accompanying $2.7 billion impairment -- investors might be wondering if driving toward fully autonomous vehicles is a mistake and whether General Motors (GM -0.33%) will soon be admitting what Ford did.

Ford: The payoff will take longer than anticipated

Argo AI was a self-driving vehicle technology start-up with Ford and Volkswagen Group as the main backers. Long story short it was unable to attract new investors and announced in the fall that it would shut down operations.

That decision cost Ford a whopping $2.7 billion in a noncash pre-tax impairment on its large investment in Argo and largely led to the automaker's $827 million net loss during the third quarter.

Perhaps more telling for Ford investors and more concerning for broader automotive investors was the company's admission that bringing Level 4 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to the market profitably isn't close to feasible right now.

""We're optimistic about a future for L4 ADAS but profitable fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off and we won't necessarily have to create that technology ourselves"" said President and CEO Jim Farley in a press release.

Ford switched gears and decided the better opportunity for its investors would be to focus on Level 2 and Level 3 systems which do not totally cut out a human driver. Management believes that strategy could better serve customers by providing services options and thus profitability in the near term.

What about Ford's crosstown rival?

Ford's moves with Argo AI mark a rare divergence between it and rival General Motors which has received much admiration for Cruise its autonomous technology subsidiary into which it put $2.1 billion this year to up its stake from 60% to 80%.

It's a fair question for investors to ask if General Motors is throwing capital into a money pit and not cutting its losses on technology that is far out from scale and profitability. So far GM is adamant it's not making a mistake and believes Cruise is making operational progress.

Cruise is expanding into two new markets Austin and Phoenix with its San Francisco operations continuing to grow. Management believes Cruise will generate revenue of $1 billion by 2025 but that's dependent on safety and regulatory approvals.

Investors won't have to wait long to see if that $1 billion figure is hit by mid-decade and as they see how the dollars start to add up they'll have better insight into whether Cruise's $50 billion annual revenue target by 2030 makes sense.

Fork in the road

If GM succeeds and hits its targets with Cruise revenue by the end of this decade it will be one of the most massive victories by an automaker this century. And investors will be well rewarded for this success.

If it turns out GM is replicating Ford's mistakes and throwing money into a buzzword that's far from helping the company's bottom line investors will have plenty to complain about.

It's impossible to know how this will turn out and investors choosing between Ford and General Motors need to figure out their stance on autonomous vehicle development as it represents a rare major difference in strategy between the two.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoaXMtMTk5Ni1mb3JkLWJyb25jby1lZGRpZS1iYXVlci1zaG93cy11bmRlci01MDAwLW1pbGVzLWl0cy1wcmlzdGluZS1pbnNpZGUtYW5kLW91dC0yMDcwNDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 1996 Ford Bronco Eddie Bauer Has Less Than 5000 Miles It's Pristine Inside and Out,"Originally based on a dedicated platform the Bronco switched to F-Series pickup truck underpinnings for the 1978 model year. The fifth generation which ran between the 1992 and 1996 model years used the chassis introduced by the third-gen Bronco all the way back in 1979 for 1980.

There are many reasons for the Ford Motor Company’s discontinuation of the Bronco after 1996 chief among which is the rise of the crossover. But as mentioned earlier the antiquated frame of the seventh-generation Ford F-Series didn’t help either. Prospective customers interested in handling couldn’t make a case for the Bronco either especially not in comparison to the XJ Cherokee and smaller unibodies like the RAV4 and CR-V.Despite growing in dimensions after the switch to F-Series underpinnings the Bronco also had trouble attracting customers away from the Chevrolet K5 Blazer and its badge-engineered cousin the GMC Jimmy . General Motors eventually replaced them with the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon whereas the Ford Motor Company discontinued the Bronco for the Expedition a full-size sport utility vehicle with F-Series roots as well.Adding insult to injury the Dearborn-based automaker refused to give the Bronco two additional doors to be more competitive against its contemporaries. The final example from the fifth generation rolled off the Wayne plant’s assembly line in June 1996. Better late than never Ford learned its lesson for the Ranger-based sixth generation. The closest rival to the Jeep Wrangler is available in two and four doors and as opposed to its predecessor the sixth generation flaunts proper off-road credentials.Turning our attention back to the fifth gen the Bronco was retired after moving 34130 units in 1996. For the last year of the fifth generation three equipment packages were offered starting with the poverty-spec XL. The mid-range XLT was more like it but the Eddie Bauer was the one to get. Codenamed 686A this equipment package didn’t come with all the bells and whistles imaginable even though it stood above the XL and XLT.The 1996 brochure attached below lists optional extras like the 5.8-literas opposed to the standard 5.0-liter EFI powerplant a premium electronic AM/FM radio with a cassette player and digital clock captain’s chairs with leather upholstery remote keyless entry signal mirrors a cargo cover all-season or all-terrain rubber shoes Touch Drive 4x4 electronic shift an engine block heater and the trailer towing package.On the other hand it wasn’t all that unnatural at that time to squeeze the customer of extra dollars for desirable options. Well-equipped trims of the modern-day Bronco are available with plenty of them because the Ford Motor Company is well aware that there’s money to be made on them.Named after the American clothing store chain from Seattle the Eddie Bauer is – without a shadow of a doubt – the most sought-after variant of the fifth-generation Bronco. The only real problem with getting your hands on a 1996 model in tip-top condition is that you’ll rarely find an unmolested survivor. And if you do chances are that it’s listed for too much money.Chassis number 1FMEU15H6TLB66956 is one of those rarefied time capsules but we’ll talk about pricing a bit later.

SWITCHING IT UP Ben Affleck is spotted driving two electric cars in 24 hours – a $90K ‘Batmobile’ & $265K Ford Bronco

HOLLYWOOD A-lister Ben Affleck has added a $265000 custom Ford Bronco and $90000 Rivian R1S to his extensive motors collection.

The multimillionaire was spotted driving both electric SUVs around Los Angeles this week where the rest of his $1.2m auto inventory resides.

Affleck’s Ford comes from Gateway Bronco a Ford Motor Company-licensed brand that builds restored and modified classic Broncos autoevolution reports.

Affleck’s Bronco features a design rooted in the vehicle line’s first generation.

These distinctive first-generation design elements include Seafoam Green paintwork a black soft top and sleek red center wheel caps.

Gateway Bronco replaced the Ford’s inline six or V8 engine with an electric motor.

This electric motor delivers 295 horsepower and can go from 0 to 60mph in about 4.7 seconds.

Affleck’s other new electric automobile Rivian’s R1S could serve as an alternative Batmobile for the actor’s on-screen superhero role.

The R1S features two electric motors that produce around 600 horsepower.

Depending on the battery pack Affleck’s R1S can take the movie star between 260 and 321 miles on a single charge.

In 2021 Rivian’s R1T was given MotorTrend’s Truck of the Year award.

Rivian’s R1T is similar to its R1S but features an open bed that’s more reminiscent of a pickup.

While A-listers like Affleck are giving Rivian some free publicity time is ticking for the American electric auto manufacturing startup.

Rivian was producing its vehicles at around $220000 a piece and selling the models at an average of $81000 per unit during quarter three losing about $139000 for each sale Reuters reports.

Rivian’s cash reserve can maintain the company through 2025 Yahoo reports.

While his father Rupert Murdoch the billionaire co-chairman of both businesses preferred to let his executives compete against each other his eldest son had a different plan. The companies needed an empire-wide initiative to tackle Web 3.0 a more decentralized internet that could have a big impact on Murdoch outlets like Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.

But the biggest takeaway for those attending the meeting wasn’t the future of media according to Australian journalist Paddy Manning. It was more simple: “Lachlan’s in charge.”

The anecdote is the last chapter in Manning’s new book The Successor an unauthorized biography of Lachlan Murdoch published Tuesday by Canada’s Sutherland House Books.

Manning’s timing couldn’t have been better. Last month the Murdochs said that the boards of Fox and News Corp. had formed special committees to examine putting the two businesses together again after almost a decade as separate companies. Many Murdoch observers see the move as an effort by Lachlan who serves as executive chair and chief executive officer at Fox and co-chair at News Corp. to further consolidate his power.

What that means for the conservative media empire that Rupert Murdoch built over seven decades is what Manning tries to answer. The answer is as elusive as its subject.

Family Business

Lachlan Murdoch 51 was born in London but raised in New York along with his younger brother James 49 and sister Elisabeth 54. He attended prep schools and studied philosophy at Princeton University and enjoyed rock climbing before giving up the sport. After graduation he worked for the family newspapers in the UK and Australia while Elisabeth and James focused on TV.

Disagreements with Dad prompted Lachlan to leave News Corp. in 2005 and start his own investment firm in Australia. A series of deals followed some successful like Nova Entertainment a radio station group he still owns. Others were not most notably Australia’s Network 10 a TV station which Murdoch tried to turn around but failed.

Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 after a nearly decade-long absence and has been the heir apparent since his brother James left with the sale of most of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney Co. in 2019. The following year James quit the News Corp. board as well saying he disagreed with the editorial direction and strategy. The real-life drama within the Murdoch family was beginning to look even more like Succession the HBO show it inspired.

Luxurious Lifestyle

Much like the characters in the series Lachlan leads a luxurious life with multiple estates custom-built Porsches and a $30 million yacht he acquired this year. Another $175 million ship is on the way. Like his father he hobnobs with prime ministers and fellow titans of industry but doesn’t love the limelight. He’s sued Australian media multiple times over their articles about him something his father has never done according to Manning.

Murdoch doesn’t weigh in on editorial decisions the way his father historically has. But his overall political leanings are conservative and he’s been there to defend Fox News hosts like Tucker Carlson even over their most controversial statements. An avid outdoorsman he identifies with the rugged individualism most associated with America’s red states even though he relocated his family to Australia during the pandemic.

Just as he runs his private investment firm Lachlan makes smaller bets at Fox than his father. In the past few years the company has acquired businesses as disparate as Tubi an ad-supported streaming service and Credible Labs Inc. an online loan broker. Fox is still heavily dependent on broadcast and cable TV two businesses losing viewers to online options.

The largest shareholder of both companies is a family trust over which Rupert 91 has the most say. On his death his votes will pass to his four oldest children including Prudence from his first marriage. Two younger children are beneficiaries but don’t have a vote. Whether Lachlan has the support of the three elder siblings to stay on as CEO remains to be seen. It’s just the kind of drama to keep people tuning in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2p1c3Qtc2VlaW5nLWZveC1uZXdzLWxvZ28tcHJvbXB0cy1yYWNpYWwtYmlhcy1uZXctcmVzZWFyY2gtc3VnZ2VzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does Fox News encourage racial bias?,When Donald Trump dined with noted white nationalist Nick Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago recently CNN and MSNBC covered the story extensively.

Such a merger would create a financial data and news giant further firming up the world’s 12th richest man’s stronghold on the business and probably allowing his company to sell more Bloomberg Terminals – the main source of its revenue.

According to the Axios report Bloomberg sees News Corp-owned (NWSA.O) Dow Jones also the publisher of Barron’s and MarketWatch as the ideal fit but would buy the Post if the Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos was interested in selling.

Bloomberg LP the Washington Post and Dow Jones did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Shares of News Corp were up 3% in a broadly weaker market.

In October Rupert Murdoch started a process that could reunite his media empire News Corp and Fox Corp (FOXA.O) nearly a decade after the companies split.

The proposal has however met with stern opposition from several shareholders who say a combination on its own would fail to realise the full value of News Corp and have instead suggested a spin-off of the media company’s digital real estate business or Dow Jones as an alternative to the merger.

Craig Huber a media analyst at Huber Research Partners said he would be “shocked” if Murdoch sold the Wall Street Journal and has probably told his family not to sell it either.

While his father Rupert Murdoch the billionaire co-chairman of both businesses preferred to let his executives compete against each other his eldest son had a different plan. The companies needed an empire-wide initiative to tackle Web 3.0 a more decentralized internet that could have a big impact on Murdoch outlets like Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.

But the biggest takeaway for those attending the meeting wasn’t the future of media according to Australian journalist Paddy Manning. It was more simple: “Lachlan’s in charge.”

The anecdote is the last chapter in Manning’s new book The Successor an unauthorized biography of Lachlan Murdoch published Tuesday by Canada’s Sutherland House Books.

Manning’s timing couldn’t have been better. Last month the Murdochs said that the boards of Fox and News Corp. had formed special committees to examine putting the two businesses together again after almost a decade as separate companies. Many Murdoch observers see the move as an effort by Lachlan who serves as executive chair and chief executive officer at Fox and co-chair at News Corp. to further consolidate his power.

What that means for the conservative media empire that Rupert Murdoch built over seven decades is what Manning tries to answer. The answer is as elusive as its subject.

Family Business

Lachlan Murdoch 51 was born in London but raised in New York along with his younger brother James 49 and sister Elisabeth 54. He attended prep schools and studied philosophy at Princeton University and enjoyed rock climbing before giving up the sport. After graduation he worked for the family newspapers in the UK and Australia while Elisabeth and James focused on TV.

Disagreements with Dad prompted Lachlan to leave News Corp. in 2005 and start his own investment firm in Australia. A series of deals followed some successful like Nova Entertainment a radio station group he still owns. Others were not most notably Australia’s Network 10 a TV station which Murdoch tried to turn around but failed.

Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 after a nearly decade-long absence and has been the heir apparent since his brother James left with the sale of most of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney Co. in 2019. The following year James quit the News Corp. board as well saying he disagreed with the editorial direction and strategy. The real-life drama within the Murdoch family was beginning to look even more like Succession the HBO show it inspired.

Luxurious Lifestyle

Much like the characters in the series Lachlan leads a luxurious life with multiple estates custom-built Porsches and a $30 million yacht he acquired this year. Another $175 million ship is on the way. Like his father he hobnobs with prime ministers and fellow titans of industry but doesn’t love the limelight. He’s sued Australian media multiple times over their articles about him something his father has never done according to Manning.

Murdoch doesn’t weigh in on editorial decisions the way his father historically has. But his overall political leanings are conservative and he’s been there to defend Fox News hosts like Tucker Carlson even over their most controversial statements. An avid outdoorsman he identifies with the rugged individualism most associated with America’s red states even though he relocated his family to Australia during the pandemic.

Just as he runs his private investment firm Lachlan makes smaller bets at Fox than his father. In the past few years the company has acquired businesses as disparate as Tubi an ad-supported streaming service and Credible Labs Inc. an online loan broker. Fox is still heavily dependent on broadcast and cable TV two businesses losing viewers to online options.

The largest shareholder of both companies is a family trust over which Rupert 91 has the most say. On his death his votes will pass to his four oldest children including Prudence from his first marriage. Two younger children are beneficiaries but don’t have a vote. Whether Lachlan has the support of the three elder siblings to stay on as CEO remains to be seen. It’s just the kind of drama to keep people tuning in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2p1c3Qtc2VlaW5nLWZveC1uZXdzLWxvZ28tcHJvbXB0cy1yYWNpYWwtYmlhcy1uZXctcmVzZWFyY2gtc3VnZ2VzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does Fox News encourage racial bias?,When Donald Trump dined with noted white nationalist Nick Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago recently CNN and MSNBC covered the story extensively.

Such a merger would create a financial data and news giant further firming up the world’s 12th richest man’s stronghold on the business and probably allowing his company to sell more Bloomberg Terminals – the main source of its revenue.

According to the Axios report Bloomberg sees News Corp-owned (NWSA.O) Dow Jones also the publisher of Barron’s and MarketWatch as the ideal fit but would buy the Post if the Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos was interested in selling.

Bloomberg LP the Washington Post and Dow Jones did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Shares of News Corp were up 3% in a broadly weaker market.

In October Rupert Murdoch started a process that could reunite his media empire News Corp and Fox Corp (FOXA.O) nearly a decade after the companies split.

The proposal has however met with stern opposition from several shareholders who say a combination on its own would fail to realise the full value of News Corp and have instead suggested a spin-off of the media company’s digital real estate business or Dow Jones as an alternative to the merger.

Craig Huber a media analyst at Huber Research Partners said he would be “shocked” if Murdoch sold the Wall Street Journal and has probably told his family not to sell it either.

“The WSJ is a trophy property to the Murdoch family” he said adding that the speculation is possibly a result of his plan to reunite his media empire.

There were about 3.464 million deaths in the U.S. in 2021 805000 more than the total reported in 2020 according to the Mortality in the United States 2021 report from the CDC National Center for Health Statistics.



The death rate for the U.S. increased by 5.3% from 835.4 deaths per 100000 people in 2020 to 879.7 in 2021 data showed. As a result life expectancy at birth for the U.S. population decreased from 77 years in 2020 to 76.4 years in 2021.



COVID-19 was a major factor in the change in mortality rates ranking as the third most prevalent cause of death after heart disease and cancer. A rise in drug overdoses also contributed accounting for more than one third of all accidental deaths in the U.S. according to the CDC. The rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl increased 22% from 17.8 in 2020 to 21.8 in 2021.



Despite the decrease in life expectancy actuarial tables that influence retirement planning and services may not see significant change according to Christian Veenstra co-president of Watkins Ross a retirement plan consultant actuary and administrator.



“Today’s headlines while interesting are likely based on averages of current data—that is the earlier than expected deaths caused by COVID[-19] created [an] average age at death lower than expected” Veenstra says in an emailed response. “But extrapolating that to future experience isn’t so cut and dried.”



Veenstra says that if deaths due to COVID-19 mostly impacted the elderly that would have brought the actual age of death down but would not necessarily provide information for the future mortality of survivors.



Mortality forecasts are used in the retirement and insurance industries for a number of purposes ranging from determining funding for defined benefit plans to valuing annuities and life estates.



Veenstra says there are two schools of thought about how to measure the long-term impact of COVID-19 on mortality. The first is that COVID-19 caused the death of people who may have died at a younger age from a different cause (i.e. those with underlying medical conditions) thereby leaving behind more people with longer life expectancy. If that is true Veenstra writes then “some models actually project longer average lifespan by several months to a couple of years.”



In the second scenario the long-term negative health issues for those who contracted COVID-19 may mean earlier death pushing down the overall mortality rate.



Veenstra says his firm Grand Rapids Michigan-based Watkins Ross is “eagerly awaiting” updates to mortality improvement tables that the Internal Revenue Service and Society of Actuaries usually publish in October which have been delayed due to uncertainty forced by COVID-19.



He notes that when retirement advice is given on the individual level many other factors enter the equation for decisions on asset distribution and associated costs including family history current health and past medical experience. Now that list will include exposure to COVID-19 and vaccination status.



“When we see decisions made by individuals in defined benefit pension plans—such as whether or not to take a lump sum a type of joint and survivor or other annuity option benefit commencement date etc.—participants can become quite honest in order to maximize the benefit for themselves” Veenstra says.

The causes are well-known: central banks aggressively raising policy rates to reduce inflation an energy shock in Europe zero-Covid policies and a shaky property market in China. Much of Europe is already in recession. We expect one to begin in the US in the third quarter of 2023 and while China’s growth will likely not turn negative it will be below historic levels.

One can easily think of ways in which the situation could yet worsen: a breakdown in a key financial market due to the rapid rise in interest rates a cold winter and blackouts in Europe or a flare-up in geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Europe is facing an energy shock unlike anything the region has seen since the OPEC price increases in the 1970s. Even though gas prices have moderated of late they are still 10 times higher than the average in 2019. Inflation is in double digits in some countries consumer sentiment has collapsed and demand is weakening along with disposable income. Nonetheless we believe headline inflation has peaked and will return to the ECB’s 2% target in 2024.

Jim Kwiatkowski CEO LTX: The capital markets industry experienced a particularly volatile 2H 2022 as investors grappled with a looming recession and peak inflation. This year will be remembered as the year when market participants were forced to adjust to a drastically different environment due to a hawkish approach from the Fed the war in Ukraine and persistent supply chain issues altering the trading landscape.

The US corporate bond market was not unscathed by these challenges which will continue to have ripple effects well into 2023. We expect the Fed’s tightening of monetary policy to continue with the process ending in the first half of 2023 and interest rates and inflation remaining relatively high throughout the year. We expect high rates and recessionary concerns to continue to hold back the new issue market. Amidst these conditions the availability of secondary market liquidity will be a key challenge that market participants will continue to solve for in 2023. We expect to see electronic bond trading reach record levels with the employment of innovative artificial intelligence (AI) and technology that increase transparency while minimizing information leakage. We also anticipate the further adoption of advanced trading tools for more efficient e-trading of large orders.

Matt McLoughin head of trading LionTrust: “Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in.” After an interesting covid-filled couple of years it is fair to say that 2022 did not disappoint with the number of challenges it brought for the market. I think that 2023 will continue to be an “interesting” trading environment but one that will bring new opportunities. As the guardians of investors’ financial futures we have a duty to invest responsibly and with that in mind I see ESG factors remaining front and centre of investors’ minds next year. I am hopeful that the increase in global interest rates that we have experienced will achieve its aim of controlling inflation and that the cost of living crisis doesn’t last as long as expected. I am very much looking forward to Ireland winning the Rugby World Cup on the 28th October 2023!

Jason Xavier head of EMEA ETF capital markets Franklin Templeton: We expect 2023 to be a bumpy year for financial markets globally. We think it will be a year for playing defence optimising income and tactically looking for a weakening dollar to potentially allocate to emerging markets (EM). My main prediction centres around this defensive play. As such we believe multi-factor smart beta ETFs especially those focused on quality and income generating strategies will outperform their relative AUM growth from this year as the decade of “cheap” money and record low interest rates is gone. The by-product of such monetary policy over the last decade has certainly benefited ETFs and index funds and in particular market capitalisation weighted schemes often heavily overweight growth stocks was a good “buy and hold” strategy returning solid annualised returns.

However the new interest rate environment calls for a more tactical approach to asset allocation and equity market exposures. Hence ETF investors may start looking favourably on alternative weighting schemes such as multi-factor smart beta ETFs which consider stock fundamentals in addition to just the market capitalisation of a stock. We believe this is a strong growth area next year.",,,,,,

As a result they make popular Christmas presents and if you’ve unwrapped a new Garmin this year then lucky you – you’re going to love it.

However if you’re going to get the most from your Garmin it’s worth taking the time to get to know it better because they’re not always the most intuitive devices to use out of the box. We’ve tested and reviewed pretty much every Garmin tracker and running watch out there so thought we’d help with a few tips on finding and setting up the key features on your new watch.

1. Set Up Your Sports Tracking

While today’s Garmins have all manner of fancy extra features they’re all still sports trackers at their core. This is one feature that’s easy to work right out of the box: just hit start choose your sport wait for GPS and off you go. But one thing you can do to improve your experience is set up your data screens to show the stats you want.

Runners in particular have a wealth of options to pick from including time distance pace heart rate and cadence. You can do this in the running menu where you should also turn auto lap on or off according to your preferences.

2. Choose A Training Plan

Did you get a running watch for Christmas to help you train for your first big event? Then head to the Garmin Coach section of the Connect app and you’ll be able to set up an entire training plan based on your target and current ability which you can then sync to your watch. At the moment there are plans for 5K 10K and half marathon races with all the workouts already set up so your watch will remind you when to run and what kind of run to do.

If you need a marathon plan head to our complete guide to marathon training. We have plans for all abilities.

3. Load It Up With Music

Many of Garmin’s watches now offer music playback from cheaper smartwatches like the Garmin Venu Sq 2 up to the top-of-the-range Forerunner 955 Fenix 7 and Epix 2 watches.

Garmin has an excellent workout creator that’s easy to use so you can sync your planned session to your watch to follow from your wrist. Unfortunately that creator is inexplicably tucked away at the back of Garmin Connect and accessed by hitting More then Training.

You can create workouts for all kind of sports with running sessions based on time distance pace or even cadence and on certain watches you can also sync across pre-made Pilates yoga and strength workouts with on-screen animations showing you how to perform each move.

If you’re planning on a simple interval session you can set that up directly on the watch in the options menu when you start a sport. Many Garmin watches now also suggest workouts for you each day based on your fitness and recent training.

5. Map A Route

Also hidden away in the Training section of the Garmin Connect app is Courses where you can map out routes to sync to your watch so it guides you through them when running cycling or hiking. You can also create the routes online on the Garmin Connect website which is slightly easier to do if planning a long activity.

Mid-range Garmin watches will show a simple breadcrumb trail of the route with just a line and a pointer to keep you on track and you can also fire up a “back to start” pointer during an outdoor activity if you’ve started without a route and got yourself lost.

Top-end Garmins like the Forerunner 955 Fenix 7 and Epix 2 range offer full colour maps on the wrist which not only makes it easy to follow pre-planned routes but also allows you to create new routes on the fly. If you’re in a new place and need a route to run you can set a rough direction and distance and the watch will create three options for you based on paths that are popular with other Garmin users. This last option is perfect if you’re away for the holidays and want your new watch to find you the perfect running route to burn some calories ahead of Christmas dinner.

6. Make The Call On Your GPS Accuracy

(Image credit: Garmin)

Garmin introduced new GPS chipsets on many of the watches it launched in 2022 and these offer several different GPS settings to pick between. The most accurate setting is multi-band available on watches like the Garmin Forerunner 255 Forerunner 955 Fenix 7 and Epix 2 but this is also the most battery-intensive mode and is only really needed for accuracy obsessives or in tricky GPS conditions such as under tree cover or when among tall buildings.

Most of the time the all-systems-on setting will be enough for accurate tracking during your outdoor activities and you can even opt for GPS-only if you’d rather have better battery life than spot-on GPS tracking. Some Garmins also have a SatIQ mode that will determine for itself when you need multi-band enabled and switch it on automatically.

7. Choose A Watch Face

While Garmins don’t offer much in the way of watch face customisation compared with say the Apple Watch you do have some options to play with. Head to the main menu to adjust your watch face which can be set up to show all manner of fitness stats as well as things like the temperature and sunrise/sunset time. You can also find more watch face options in the ConnectIQ app store if Garmin’s presets aren’t doing it for you.

8. Select Some Widgets

Scroll up or down from your watch to access your widgets which show key info on things like the weather your calendar your activity that day and your overall training load. Use the main menu to add or remove widgets so you’re getting only the info you want.

9. Set Up Emergency Assistance Just In Case

This is one feature you should set up on Christmas morning then hope never to have to think about again. With Garmin’s Incident Detection feature your watch can detect if you fall during an outdoor activity and then message a preset contact to alert them. You can also send these alerts manually by holding down the backlight button.

10. Link Garmin Connect To Your Strava Account

Activities tracked by your Garmin watch will sync automatically to the Garmin Connect app where you can pore over your stats in great detail. However many keen runners and cyclists will also have a Strava account where their activities can be posted for friends and followers to see and comment on (and give that all-important kudos of course).

You can link the Garmin Connect app to your Strava account so that any activities you sync for your Garmin device are automatically uploaded. To do this hit More in the app then Connected Apps and follow the simple guidance on linking the two accounts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL2dhcm1pbi1mb3JlcnVubmVyLTI1NXMtbXVzaWMtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Forerunner 255S Music review: Commit to getting fit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL2dhcm1pbi1mb3JlcnVubmVyLTI1NXMtbXVzaWMtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy95b3VyLWdhcm1pbi1pbnN0aW5jdC0yLWlzLWFib3V0LXRvLWdldC1zb21lLWFtYXppbmctbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLWZvci1mcmVl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your Garmin Instinct 2 is about to get some amazing new features for free,"If you’re a Garmin Instinct 2 wearer you’ll be getting some of Garmin’s best new features in an Alpha firmware update coming in January including the popular Morning Report and wrist-based running power functions. What a way to start your new year!

The new firmware update takes some of the features of the best Garmin watches released this year and adds them to the Instinct 2 according to a report published on Garmin’s website . Initially the features will only be available to members of Garmin’s early-access beta testing program but they are expected to be rolled out to all Instinct 2 users automatically around late-January according to a report by Gadgets & Wearables .

The full details of the features coming to the Instinct 2 can be found below as written on the Garmin website:

Added Morning report.

Added Sleep Mode.

Added Primary Race and Race Calendar glances.

Added Wrist-Based Running Power.

Added Daily Suggested Workout Improvements.

Added Grade-Adjusted Pace.

Added Backcountry Snowboard activity.

Added Physio TrueUp - Training Status Improvements.

Added Real Time Settings support for activity alerts.

Added temperature recording activity setting.

Updated phone app pairing flow to use PIN comparison.

Fixed issue where daily active calories total could be incorrect.

Fixed issue where Indoor Bike activity could start on wrong data screen.

Fixed Surf waves activity summary page.

Analysis: Reporting for duty – but what about the Instinct Crossover?

The main attraction here and the feature we’ve gotten the most use out of is the Morning Report. First introduced on the Garmin Forerunner 955  the Morning Report feeds a selection of curated information to your wrist as soon as you wake up including information on last night’s sleep the weather your Training Readiness score and a recommended training intensity.

This allows you to alter and curate your training plans for the day: for example if it’s a day of icy weather and you’ve had a terrible night’s sleep you may want to abandon that long run in favor of a short restorative yoga flow.

Race calendar glances is also really interesting allowing you to see the races you’ve put into Garmin Connect on your wrist offering a countdown to the next big day. Wrist-based running power is a fantastic way to calculate the overall effort and tax on your body created on any given run.

Normally you need one of the best heart rate monitors to calculate this metric effectively but the Instinct 2 will allow you to do it without a HRM from January. Other features include listed fixes to common problems such as increased calorie-counter accuracy.

There’s no mention of whether these features will come to the Instinct Crossover Garmin’s latest watch which is essentially an Instinct 2 retooled to work around analog hands. We imagine Crossover users will be in for a longer wait as the UX of each feature will need to be adjusted to work around the watch’s analog design.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcmVhYmxlLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9wb2xhci1pZ25pdGUtMy1yZXZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Polar Ignite 3 review,"Polar Ignite 3 By Polar The Polar Ignite 3 could be a top sports watch gem in design and smarts. Sadly though the laggy software some familiar performance problems and durability issues overshadow its achievements. Then there’s the price too. It’s more expensive than the Ignite 2 and when you consider you can pick up a Venu 2 for less and get a lot of the same core features with better smoother software it’s tough to recommend the Ignite 3 over it right now. Hit Sleek design with crisp display

Welcome interface redesign

Good array of tracking and analysis Miss Notable performance issues

Battery life is poor with always-on display

Screen has already been scratched

When Polar launched the Ignite in 2019 it felt like more accessible sports watch with a big dose of fun.

It boasted some of Polar’s best features but with a design best described as more lifestyle and less sporty.

The Ignite 2 landed in 2021 and didn’t make wholesale changes but with the Ignite 3 there are some big ones. Some we weren’t expecting to see on this particular Polar watch.

Those new features put the Ignite 3 into a new price bracket. The bigger price tag puts it up against the Garmin Venu 2 and you could even throw the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) into the mix here too.

The Ignite 2 felt like a step in the right direction for Polar’s fitness watch so has the Ignite 3 built on that good work? Here’s our verdict on the Polar Ignite 3.

> Best running and sports watches from our reviews

squirrel_12861174



Screen and display

Wareable

Let’s get straight into it. The big story here with the Ignite 3 is that it has an AMOLED touchscreen display which as far as we can recall is the first Polar watch to include the same kind of display technology typically reserved for smartwatches.

Garmin does include AMOLED screens on its Venu and Epix series watches but this is new ground for Polar and it's very much welcomed.

The Ignite 2 featured a color TFT touchscreen display but the Ignite 3’s roughly same-sized screen marks a step up in rich colors lovely deep rich blacks you like to see on an AMOLED panel and it’s bright too.

Polar lets you pick from three backlight brightness settings and you will want to use the brightest option in brighter outdoor sunlight.

This is typically a downside of this screen technology compared to the memory in pixel screens included on Polar’s Vantage V2 and Grit X Pro watches. We used the Ignite 3 at night and in sunnier conditions and it handled those more challenging visibility conditions well.

Wareable

The look of the display is also a big positive with its gently curved exterior a nice upgrade on the flatter screen included on the Ignite 2.

There’s still a black bezel surrounding that display but there’s less of it particularly at the bottom of the screen and Polar’s small handful of watch faces do an effective job of hiding what bezel there is here.

Wareable

Polar also adds Gorilla Glass 3.0 to provide stronger protection against scratches. Sadly it doesn’t look to be up to the task based on the long scratch that’s already appeared across the screen on our Ignite 3.

We’ve had it on our wrist 24/7 in the gym and for outdoor workouts and worn it in bed. That’s far from rigorous usage and we can’t put our finger on how this damage has materialized.

So for all the positives that Polar has finally put a great screen on one of its watches to make it feel more like a slick sporty smartwatch we can't ignore the nasty big scratch it's managed to acquire during our testing.

Performance struggles

Wareable

Polar’s watches that launched in 2021 had performance problems and that included the Ignite 2. Whatever Polar was packing its watches with components-wise it simply wasn’t delivering the kind of smooth software interactions that you’d hoped to find.

Like the Polar Pacer Pro the Ignite 3 promises to address those laggy concerns by beefing up processing power moving from a 120MHz CPU speed setup to a quicker 192 MHz one compared to what was packed into the Ignite 2. It’s bumped things up in the memory department as well going from 0.64MB to 5MB of RAM.

So do those upgrade internals make a marked difference? Sadly we'd say no. We’ve still experienced some pretty irritating lag swiping to look at our notification stream. The software’s response when pressing the physical button which now sits more centrally on the case is slow as well. It can also be slow to save workouts and we've had the watch randomly reboot on us on at least one occasion.

There are elements like swiping through widgets which feel relatively smooth so there’s a clear inconsistency with how smooth those interactions are.

In isolation it might not seem like a big problem but collectively it makes the Ignite 3 frustrating to get on with.

Improved UI

Wareable

Those performance problems are a shame because the work Polar has done to refine Ignite’s interface feels like a step in the right direction. It's still not perfect but it's better.

You’ve now got an interface that better fills the screen with vibrant watch faces to you can now add complications. Full-screen widgets for features like activity tracking Polar’s FitSpark suggested workouts weekly stats and the weather feel much nicer to glance at.

Wareable

Polar still doesn’t go all in on smartwatch features as Garmin does but you can view phone notifications and quickly identify which apps they’ve come from. The music controls feel well optimized to that screen and do work with third-party music apps like Spotify as well as being accessible during workout tracking.

You don’t get payments apps onboard safety features smart assistants and a fair bit more but by keeping things simple Polar delivers staples that most will be happy to find here. The music controls seem less affected by the performance problems than the notification support is so it’s a simple but imbalanced experience.

Dual-frequency GPS debuts

Wareable

We thought Polar would join the dual-frequency GPS party at some point but didn’t expect the Ignite 3 to be the first beneficiary of a mode that’s appeared on watches from Apple Garmin Coros Huawei and Amazfit.

The application of the technology designed to improve outdoor tracking accuracy in problematic scenarios like tracking near tall buildings in tall wooded areas or bad weather has certainly offered mixed results so far. We'd say its presence on Apple Garmin and Amazfit's watches have been the standout examples of its benefits to improve that accuracy.

On the Ignite 3 our feelings are that we hope it will get better when Polar decides to put it on one of its watches where it makes more sense.

Wareable

While core data for outdoor runs like distance tracked and average pace held up pretty well against Garmin’s multi-band mode on the Marq Athlete Gen 2 a closer inspection of the GPS tracks suggests those plotted routes weren’t quite on the money. Garmin’s multi-band mode wasn’t perfect either but it’s quite clear the points where Polar struggles.

Wareable

Wareable

Outside of those added dual-frequency GPS skills the Ignite 3 feels very similar to using the Ignite 2. You’ve got similar sports modes and there’s the same Precision Prime optical heart rate monitor which offers a mixed bag of data.

Wareable

On some steady-paced workouts it performed well against the heart rate monitor chest strap as the data screens from a treadmill run show above.

There were also similar workouts that delivered very different data. The outdoor run below illustrates where we saw strangely high maximum and average heart rate readings compared to Garmin’s HRM-Pro Plus heart rate monitor chest strap.

Wareable

Fortunately like the Ignite 2 you can pair it up with an external heart rate monitor to improve that accuracy and you'll want to do that if you want more consistent data.

There’s a new voice guidance mode which is a simple way of saying you can hear your metrics being read out to you during and after a workout.

Polar has now added a back-to-start mode for some basic navigation support and its running performance and walking tests cut to offer additional ways to gauge your current level of fitness. Again though that walking test requires walking at a pretty slow pace to use it and is very much aimed at people entirely new to getting more active.

Polar includes its Training Load Pro and Energy Sources insights but stops short of its Recovery Pro and Running Index metrics which are reserved for its more expensive watches. One odd inclusion here is Polar’s FuelWise fuelling recommendations which felt like a good fit on its more performance-focused watches but less so on a watch aiming at people who are probably not thinking about tackling an ultra marathon.

Sleep tracking powers

Wareable

Polar’s sleep tracking has impressed since it started to pay more attention to it and offers a level of accuracy that can help inform your training and recovery needs.

Along with offering very reliable core sleep stats it introduced its nightly recharge measurements which still needs to deliver those recharge insights more engagingly.

Those core sleep-tracking features seem okay on the whole. We wore it alongside the Oura Ring 3 and they generally tracked similar sleep duration and times we fell asleep. Looking at the sleep stages and the Ignite 3 tended to record much smaller amounts of deep sleep in comparison.

Wareable

Along with breaking down sleep stages including REM capturing sleep duration time sleep scores and additional metrics like sleep solidity Polar is now adding what it calls SleepWise. This is essentially a way of communicating how sleep and your sleep rhythm contribute to alertness and readiness for the day. This is something we’ve seen in slightly different forms from the likes of Garmin Whoop and Oura.

Wareable

Polar’s approach is to ensure you’ve captured at least five nights’ sleep within the last seven days to get these SleepWise forecasts which take the form of graphs in the Polar companion app to show your boosted levels of sleep. These are represented by different green blocks in the sleep insights section of the app. Lighter green blocks indicate a big energy boost and darker green blocks mean smaller energy boosts.

There’s also a Sleep gate which requires sleep data from seven nights of sleep and aims to tell you when you should go to bed based on your other data. Again this isn’t a new feature to watches and wearables like Whoop.

If that explanation of how SleepWise sounds clunky well its presentation on the Ignite 3 and the Polar Flow companion app mirrors that clunkiness. Like Polar’s nightly recharge measurements it needs to be packaged on the watch which makes the information more useful and actionable and makes you more likely to pay attention to it. That just didn't feel like the case for us and the presentation of that additional data feels overwhelming.

Polar can churn out a lot of potentially useful data here but it needs to work on how it communicates that data.

Battery wins and losses

Wareable

Polar has a bit of a battery problem. Not with the level of the battery it offers but the way that battery can drain and when it drains.

The Ignite 3 promises and delivers the same 5 days of battery life as the Ignite 2 when you’re just using it day-to-day checking the time and notifications and counting your steps. Add an AMOLED into the mix and turn that screen on 24/7 and that battery number drops hugely. That 5 days goes to just over 1 day and you can see that drain within minutes of enabling the always-on mode.

There’s still an issue with the battery drain at night as well. Whatever Polar is tracking during sleep is demanding big loads of the battery and we found drop-off overnight could be anywhere from 8-10%. Polar needs to offer the option to restrict or be more selective about those richer sleep features.

Things are a little more promising in tracking mode where GPS battery life has gone from 20 hours up to 30 hours. It also has the same 100-hour battery in Polar’s power saving mode where heart rate monitoring is disabled and you lower the GPS recording rate.

We’d say those GPS battery claims are a little optimistic or do not apply to the most accurate GPS tracking option you have available here. An hour of outdoor running saw the battery drop by 5%. That doesn’t equate to 30 hours. This was a similar story on the Ignite 2 but it seems at least that battery drop-off during tracking isn't quite as severe.

Another annoying trait Polar has decided to keep around is essentially stopping you from tracking a workout when the battery hits a certain point. Our Ignite 3 dropped just below the 10% mark which initiated a prompt to tell us to charge before we think about tracking again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xpc3QuY28udWsvaW4tZGVwdGgvYmVzdC1iaWtlLXRoaW5ncy0yMDIyLWVtbWEtY29sZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emma Cole: My 5 favourite bike things of 2022 ft. Garmin's Edge 1040 Solar and Beryl Burton,"Well well 2022 is done and dusted and with that comes some compulsory reflection.

I for one have had some huge highlights this year: taking on the Col du Granon riding with Jenny Graham interviewing some legends including Lael Wilcox Mel Nichols Mark Beaumont and Fiona Kolbinger to name but a few.

In my favourite world of sustainability I’ve investigated the environmental impact of the Tour de France the impact of our cycling kit on the planet and the role of greenwashing in cycling. As you can imagine these aren’t the chirpiest of reads but they’re such important topics.

Amongst what one might call gloom there have also been a huge number of good news stories this year.

Just take the soul-enriching work of Trash Free Trails the determined transparency of Reynolds Steel and the cycling clothing brands working to become more sustainable.

Inclusivity and accessibility have also been an important part of the conversation especially the work that Sustrans and Wheels for All are doing and here at Cyclist we now have three women on the editorial team which I am elated by. Check out our women-specific guides for bib shorts bib tights sports bras and saddles.

2022 has also thrown some considerable curve balls such as the fiery debate on headforms for our cycling helmets the potential benefits of CBD and questions around whether cyclists should adopt a plant based diet.

Happy 2023 to all and here’s to getting more people on bicycles exploring the great outdoors.

Bike is best.

1. Assos Signature Sweater

Credit: Emma Cole

Jumpers may come and go bobbled and worn but others stand the test of time and style like this glorious one from Assos.

This fleece which for some strange reason Assos calls a sweater has become an absolute staple in my wardrobe. I wear it all the time on the bike off the bike in the office to the shops you get the picture. I think my colleagues have got the picture.

But isn’t a fleece just a fleece I hear you ask?

To the un-sweater-cultured maybe but to those like me who have the highest taste in fleece design no.

Credit: Emma Cole

Simply put this is the most comfortable warming and utterly mesmeric fleece to ever have graced my wardrobe.

With its zipped fleece-lined pockets and reflective grey stripe across the chest not to mention the cosy and warm material this is a jumper which answers almost every question in life.

Cold after your ride? Throw it on. Cold on your casual ride? Throw it on. Need something to wear to the supermarket/office/café? You know what to do.

Plus and this is a big plus every time I wear it I know I look cool.

2. Garmin Edge 1040 Solar

Credit: Emma Cole

I am not the biggest fan of bike computers as I think they are slowly and sneakily become the rulers of every ride (this I assure you is a whole other article in incoming issue 135 of Cyclist so be sure to pick it up) but when I want to use a bike computer this is the one I go for.

Launched in May of this year the Garmin Edge 1040 Solar is an absolutely storming piece of tech. We rated it 4.5 stars in our full review and with good reason.

The screen is enormous easy to read and works come rain or shine. The interface is also particularly straightforward to use.

It’s got all the usual jazzy features but in high definition: expert training insights serious number crunching unrivalled accuracy helpful nuggets like places of interest and popular routes but it’s the battery life which is the real game changer here.

The 1040S is Garmin’s first ever solar charging bike computer and my word is this feature brilliant.

Especially in summer I have hardly ever charged it. The battery life is second to none – up to 100 hours the brand says.

Not having to worry about charging one less bike accessory is a total utter treat. It’s the most useful feature ever in my view.

Yes there is a glaring downside – the 1040S is expensive. It’s a serious amount of money.

But this piece is all about shining a light on outstanding cycling tech. And the Garmin Edge 1040 Solar my friends smashes that door right down.

3. Oakley Prizm Trail Torch lens

Credit: Dan King

For me 2022 has been the year of gravel and whilst gravel is great it does demand versatile kit especially when it comes to eyewear.

I’ve become used to taking my cycling glasses on and off frequently as I navigate the regularly changing light of trails and this is simply not that enjoyable. However I think this lens from Oakley might have sorted that issue.

I first tried the Oakley Prizm Trail Torch lens in October and while I was sceptical at first these are now my go to glasses for riding.

With a rose base the Trail Torch lens enhances reds and browns making it easier to see things like roots and stones. Colours appear more vivid and it effectively brightens the trail.

Credit: Dan King (spot the fleece)

It offers a 35% light transmission so is aimed at mixed lighting conditions and I have found the lens works particularly well on early morning gravel rides when the light is a bit dodgy.

The Trail Torch lens has an iridium coating giving a mirrored effect to hide your eyes but doesn’t make you look like a bug.

I’ve been using the Trail Torch lens in the Oakley Encoder and Oakley Kato shades – both great pairs of glasses – but it’s also an option elsewhere in Oakley’s range.

4. Restrap Race top tube bag

Credit: Emma Cole

A top tube bag is in my view the easiest way to ensure ride snacks are devoured in a timely manner and with its double zipper and stretchy side mesh pockets this Restrap Race top tube bag makes speed eating very easy.

I first saw this top tube bag at Eurobike back in July and immediately wanted to try it out.

Credit: Emma Cole (please admire the 750ml water bottle)

The design is neat slim and functional with Velcro straps to hold it in place and a rigid internal plastic structure which ensures the bag remains upright and stable on the bike.

Made with a X21 technical waterproof fabric and offering reflective detailing this bag has a 1.5 litre capacity which is ample space for a good number of jam sandwiches and salted boiled potatoes.

Incidentally Restrap hand-makes all its gear at its HQ in Leeds and tests everything in the glorious Yorkshire dales.

A cracking final piece for my gear puzzle.

5. What I’ve been into in 2022: Beryl Burton

Speaking of the Yorkshire Dales this year I have been well and truly inspired by none other than the great Beryl Burton.

Not coming from a cycling family nor a cycling background I had never heard of Beryl until Jeremy Wilson’s book came out this year and it landed on my desk.

Beryl: In search of Britain’s Greatest Athlete has been crowned this year’s William Hill Sports Book of the Year. It explores how Beryl Burton dominated her sport as much as Eddy Merckx yet is relatively unknown despite her epic achievements.

For all the words in the world I simply cannot exaggerate how bloody great this book is and how inspiring Beryl’s story is.

Wilson brings to life the Beryl’s invincibility at time-trials her incredible records how she beat a lot of men and most importantly for me her indelible spirit.

As a woman who is all too aware of the uphill battle women in sport (and elsewhere) have faced and continue to face Beryl’s almost unbelievable determination to ride and succeed is a huge source of inspiration and motivation.

Her achievements are a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and true grit and that what might seem impossible probably is not. Just keeping turning the cranks.

If I can take anything into 2023 it will be a mahoosive dollop of Beryl Burton-ness.

It shows how the US trade sanctions have effectively cut the company’s access to advanced new chips.

Both Huawei and HiSilicon were added to the US government’s trade blacklist known as the Entity List in 2019.

When Huawei Technologies Co once China’s biggest smartphone vendor along with its chip design arm HiSilicon were added into the US’ trade blacklist known as the Entity List in 2019 the company saw a US$12 billion shortfall in its revenue within the same year. The company struggled with supply continuity while having to increase its R&D tremendously. Its smartphone business started deteriorating and three years later the situation appears to be worsening for the Chinese tech giant.

At the point when the sanctions were just implemented research firms like Haitong and Canalys indicated that Huawei had been stockpiling critical US components for almost a year. Even HiSilicon said it had a backup plan to ensure the group’s survival. Three years since Huawei has been added into the trade sanctions and recently Huawei had depleted the entire inventory of its smartphone chipsets from HiSilicon.

In a report by Hong Kong-based firm Counterpoint Research it is highlighted that HiSilicon’s share in the global smartphone market had finally reached zero in the third quarter of this year after declining to 0.4% in the second quarter from 3% the same period last year. Basically the Counterpoint data reflects the effectiveness of the US restriction that has expanded over the years from was first enacted in May 2019.

HUAWEI TO IMPROVE DIGITAL WORLD CONNECTIVITY FOR 120 MILLION PEOPLE IN REMOTE AREAS

Prior to the tightened US sanctions HiSilicon accounted for 16% of the global chipset market share (as of the second quarter of 2020) according to Counterpoint data on the back of its shipments of advanced Kirin chips used on Huawei’s smartphones. HiSilicon also dropped out of the rankings of the world’s top 25 semiconductor vendors because of the stifling US trade restrictions which also reduced China’s overall share in the global chip market according to a report published in April by research firm Gartner.

How did the US drag Huawei down?

To recall it started with the Trump administration that placed the firm along with its chip division HiSilicon and 113 other subsidiaries on the US Department of Commerce’s so-called Entity List on the grounds of national security concerns. The move prevented the company and its affiliates from obtaining American-made components software and other technology from US organizations unless it received a special license.

To put it simply should Huawei intend to buy chips from US firms like Intel or Qualcomm or purchase chip-making equipment from US-based firms like KLA or Applied Materials there would be red tapes for their requests to be approved. Following the move in mid 2019 the Trump administration expanded restrictions on Huawei by blocking the company from acquiring semiconductors that were manufactured overseas using US software or hardware — unless it received permission from the US.

The move was a major step in curtailing Huawei’s silicon efforts because it meant the firm likely couldn’t turn to a contract chip manufacturer like TSMC to fabricate its designs if the foundry was using any US equipment or design tools. As anticipated a few months later chip giant TSMC announced that it would no longer manufacture chips for Huawei due to the US rules.

Therefore Huawei is where it is today: out of advanced chips from its HiSilicon division and are only left with 4G chipsets from US firm Qualcomm obtained through a special license for its latest flagship smartphones. For a while the company bought time by stockpiling components to delay its fate but as Counterpoint’s report shows the depletion of the advanced chipsets designed by HiSilicon was an inevitability.

“Based on our checks and sell-thru data Huawei has finished the inventory for the Hisilicon chipsets. It is also not possible for the brand to obtain newer chipsets from TSMC Samsung etc. because of the trade ban” Counterpoint said. As for the market for smartphone system-on-a-chip shipments in the third quarter it was led by MediaTek Qualcomm and Apple.

Frankly Huawei has seen its market share in the last three years falling in its home market but as of the third quarter the company remained out of the top-five vendor rankings in China data from tech market research firm Canalys shows. Once a 5G champion both in China and globally Huawei since 2020 have not been able to offer 5G in its latest phones.

Now there are talks that the tech giant may finally relaunch 5G smartphones as soon as next year. Before being added into the Entity List Huawei used to produce Kirin chipsets designed by HiSilicon and manufactured by leading chipmaker TSMC. But now the company may be reworking on its phones to use less advanced chips made by Chinese companies that will enable 5G.

This may just be the biggest challenge Huawei is dealing with right now and its quest to overcome the US restrictions will determine if the Chinese telecom giant reclaim its position as the world’s biggest smartphone vendor.",,,,,,,,,

With the world population topping eight billion for the first time “Santa is flying faster than ever; we estimate he’s traveling over Mach 7 this year” — seven times the speed of sound more than a mile per second — “to hit all those datapoints around the world in one night” says Adam Gorski aerospace engineer for Exton-based Ansys Government Initiatives.

AGI a flight-simulation subsidiary of Ansys Inc. is one of two Philadelphia-area tech companies that cooperate to track Santa Claus’ Christmas Eve flights in real time using data collected by NORAD the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command.

NORAD collects data from transmitters in many places including a convenient Santa Claus sled beacon — “Rudolph’s red nose” Gorski added.

“Anything that fast is hypersonic — you see it long before you hear it. You need special technology to go that fast” the kind that propels satellites into orbit but doesn’t yet power commercial aircraft he added.

“Also magic reindeer. They go that fast.”

A sister company Center City-based Cesium builds the user-friendly dashboard software that makes Santa easier to track along with systems used by gamers and other participants in the emerging virtual-reality networks known as the metaverse.

Since the 1960s NORAD has tracked planes satellites and other flying objects over North America and made the data publicly available making it easier for flight planners to avoid accidents and improve air traffic safety.

There are Grinches who object. Twitter owner Elon Musk earlier this month suspended social media users including some journalists who provided similar information from public sources that tracked his and other billionaires’ private jets around the world.

Musk said he had safety concerns that the data might be used by those who wish to harm him and other high-profile people; critics accused him of muzzling them and compromising his own promises to lessen restrictions on the circulation of information.

Despite Musk’s cancellations NORAD and its Philly tech partners have continued to post their Santa Claus tracking data through the NoradSantaNews.com website (with links in a few languages) YouTube Pinterest LinkedIn — and also @NoradTracksSanta on Musk’s Twitter network.

Ansys says the sites it services that provide Santa tracking information received more than 20 million visits last year and that traffic has risen each year.

Both Ansys’ Exton unit — it was the private company Analytical Graphics Inc. before Pittsburgh-based military contractor Ansys bought for $700 million it in 2020 — and Cesium were founded by engineer Paul Graziani and his colleagues who left what was then GE Aerospace in King of Prussia in 1990 to start a series of space technology businesses.

The Air Force began tracking Santa in 1965 after a Colorado newspaper accidentally printed its headquarters’ phone number in place of a department store’s call-Santa line and NORAD volunteers began answering the resulting flood of calls. Ansys began aiding the effort 25 years ago; the business now known as Cesium signed on in 2012.

I asked Gorski about Musk’s concern: Don’t his company and NORAD worry all that information about Santa’s location might be abused to compromise security? What if bad actors plot Santa’s course and attempt to rob the sleigh or wreck the gift-giving operation?

“His only defense is reindeer antlers and the ability to move really fast” Gorski acknowledged.

But Santa has many friends and able defenders watching out for him he concluded: “NORAD reports that our Navy jets check on Santa tipping their wings as he goes past.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvY2FuYWRhLXRvLWJvbHN0ZXItY2gtMTQ5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZmxlZXQtdGhyb3VnaC1jMS1iaWxsaW9uLXVwZ3JhZGUvMTUxNDUwLmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canada to bolster CH-149 helicopter fleet through C$1 billion upgrade,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.flightglobal.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /helicopters/canada-to-bolster-ch-149-helicopter-fleet-through-c1-billion-upgrade/151450.article (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002122695B2B0>, 'Connection to www.flightglobal.com timed out.

BJ and IMR-90 fibroblasts were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in complete DMEM (DMEM supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine 100 units/ml penicillin 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% FBS). These cells were maintained in a 5% O 2  5% CO 2  37 °C incubator. 293FT cells were maintained in complete DMEM and maintained in atmospheric oxygen concentrations in a 5% CO 2  37 °C incubator. For cells grown in organotypic skin models primary human melanocytes and keratinocytes were extracted from fresh discarded human foreskin and surgical specimens as previously described395354. The human primary cells were obtained from the University of Pennsylvania Skin Biology and Disease Research Core which establishes the cultures from deidentified discarded tissues under an approved IRB exempt protocol. Keratinocytes were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Gibco Keratinocytes-SFM medium + L-glutamine + EGF + BPE and Gibco Cascade Biologics 154 medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (ThermoFisher Scientific. # 15140122). Primary melanocytes were cultured in Medium 254 (ThermoFisher #M254500) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

Plasmids lentiviral generation and transduction

BRAFV600E-induced senescence was carried out using the HIV-CS-CG-BRAFV600E-puro plasmid or HIV-CS-CG-puro plasmid for control cells8. Mcl-1 overexpression was carried out using the plx307-MCL1 plasmid (Addgene # 117726). The plx307 empty vector plasmid was generated by excising the MCL1 open reading frame with NheI (NEB) and SpeI (NEB) enzymes for 1 h at 37 °C. Digested products were resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel and the backbone vector was purified using the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Blunt ends were generated using the Quick Blunting Kit (NEB) and subsequently ligated using T4 DNA ligase (NEB) overnight at 16 °C. Ligated vectors were transformed into NEB Stable Competent E. coli (C3040) before plating onto ampicillin-resistant plates overnight at 37 °C. A single colony was picked and incubated in liquid LB supplemented with ampicillin overnight at 37 °C. plx307 empty vector plasmid was purified using the PureLink™ HiPure Plasmid Midiprep Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).

3 µg of plasmids were transfected into 5 million 293FT cells with 3 µg each of viral plasmids (Addgene #12251 #12253 #12259) and Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) in Opti-MEM™ I Reduced Serum Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific). Medium was changed to normal DMEM medium but without antibiotics one day later. 48 h later medium was spun at 300 g for 5 min and viral particles were concentrated using PEG-it virus precipitation solution (System Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Concentrated virus was resuspended in 200 µl PBS and added onto melanocytes in melanocyte medium (1:50). Viral particles were removed 24 h later and cells were replenished with fresh melanocyte medium. Puromycin selection commenced 24 h later by addition of 1 µg/ml puromycin. For infection with HIV-CS-CG-BRAFV600E-puro or HIV-CS-CG-puro plasmids 6 µg/ml polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also added.

Senescence induction

γ-irradiation-induced senescence was carried out by subjecting cells to a 10 Gy dose using a Cesium137 source. For etoposide-induced senescence melanocytes were cultured with 1 µM etoposide for 3 days. For UV-induced senescence medium was removed from cells and replaced with PBS. Cells were then exposed to 20 mJ/cm2 UVB irradiation at days 1 and day 3 after plating. Experiments were carried out at day 10 for these types of senescence induction. For BRAFV600E induced senescence melanocytes were infected with HIV-CS-CG-BRAFV600E-puro or HIV-CS-CG-puro for control cells. Experiments were carried out 14 days post infection.

SA-β-galactosidase assay

Cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 10 min washed three times in PBS and stained overnight at 37 °C in X-gal solution (1 mg/ml X-gal 40 mM citric acid/Na phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) 5 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6  5 mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6  150 mM NaCl 2 mM MgCl 2 ).

EdU cytochemistry

Cells plated on coverslips were cultured with 10 µM EdU for 24 h before being fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were washed in PBS incubated in 100 mM Tris (pH 7.6) for 5 min and then permeabilised in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were washed again in PBS and then placed onto a 50 µl drop of staining solution (2 mM Cu(II)SO 4  4 µM Sulfo-Cy3-azide 20 mg/ml C 6 H 7 NaO 6 ) on parafilm for 30 min. Cells were washed in PBS before incubating in 0.5 µg/ml DAPI for 5 min. Cells were washed again in PBS before mounting with mounting medium.

Viability and apoptosis assays

For viability assays ~10000 cells were plated per well into 96-well plates. Drugs were added for the incubated period before replacing with fresh medium. One day later viability was measured using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For Annexin V/PI flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis drugs were added to ~400000 cells per well in 6-well plates for indicated time points. Cells were harvested and stained with the Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were processed on a BD FACSCanto II and results were analyzed using Kaluza. Caspase 3/7 activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Drugs were added to ~10000 cells per well in 96-well plates for 4 h after which caspase-glo reagent was added. Caspase activity was measured 1 h later.

siRNA transfection

Approximately 35000 cells per well in 96 well plates were used for siRNA transfections. Cells were transfected with 20 pmols Mcl-1 siRNA (sc-35877 Santa Cruz) or 20 pmols control siRNA (sc-37007 Santa Cruz) using the siRNA reagent system (Santa Cruz) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 h later siRNA was removed and cells were treated with ABT-263 for 24 h after which cell viability was measured as described above.

Quantitative real-time PCR

Total RNA was extracted using the Isolate II RNA mini kit (Bioline). cDNA was synthesized using the High-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). cDNA amplification was carried out with the Sensi-Fast Probe Lo-Rox Kit (Bioline) and the Universal Probe Library system (Roche) in a LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche).

Immunofluorescence

Senescent melanocytes were treated with either DMSO or ABT-263 for 24 h. Then cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min. Following two washes with PBS cells were blocked in 5% normal goat serum (Sanquin) supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature and then they were incubated with primary antibody against Mcl-1 (1:800 Cell Signalling Technology Ab#94296) diluted in 1% normal goat serum supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. The next day cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific R37116) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS and dH 2 O before incubating in 2 μg/ml DAPI for 5 min. Cells were washed again in PBS before mounting with mounting medium. MCL-1 fluorescence was analyzed in >50 cells per condition and expressed as Corrected Total Cell Flourescence (CTCF). Using ImageJ images were transformed to 8-bit and cells were manually selected with a free drawing selection tool. The area integrated density and mean gray value were measured in both the cells and in the background in each image. CTCF was calculated as Integrated Density – (Area of each selected cell · Mean fluorescence of the background reads).

Immunoblotting

Protein lysates were obtained by scraping cells in RIPA lysis buffer (Abcam). Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermofisher Scientific). Cell lysates were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% Milk in TBS-T (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20) or 5% BSA in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies used are: (1:000 Bcl-2 #15071 Cell Signalling Technology) (1:000 Bcl-xL #2764 Cell Signalling Technology) (1:1000 Bcl-w #2724 Cell Signalling Technology) (1:1000 Mcl-1 #94296 Cell Signalling Technology) (Mcl-1 sc-12756 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (p-p70S6K #9234 Cell Signalling Technology) (p70S6K #9202 Cell Signalling Technology) (Vinculin V9131 Sigma-Aldrich). After washing in TBS-T membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) in 5% Milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed again in TBS-T and proteins were detected using the Amersham ECL prime western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and the ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini imaging machine (GE Healthcare). Protein bands were quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) and normalized to vinculin bands.

For analysis of BRAFV600E OE adherent cells were washed once with DPBS and lysed with 8M urea containing 50 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3 10 mM dithiothreitol 50 mM iodoacetamide. Lysates were quantified (Bradford assay) normalized reduced and resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis on 4–15% Tris/Glycine gels (Bio-Rad Hercules CA USA). Resolved protein was transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Billerica MA USA) using a Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) blocked in 5% BSA in TBS-T and probed with primary antibodies recognizing β-Actin (Cell Signalling Technology #3700 1:4000 Danvers MA USA) BRAFV600E (Sigma-Aldrich #SAB5600047 1:1000). After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody proteins were detected using either Luminata Crescendo Western HRP Substrate (Millipore) or ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (GE Healthcare Bensalem PA).

Immunostainings

Nevi sections were deparaffinised by placing them in xylene two times for 10 min each. Sections were then rehydrated by washing in serial grades of ethanol (100% 95% 80% 60%) for 5 min each. Sections were then rinsed in dH 2 O 3 times for 3 min each. Antigen retrieval was carried out by placing sections in Tris-EDTA buffer (10mM Tris Base 1mM EDTA Solution 0.05% Tween 20 pH 9.0) and heating in a microwave for 10 min. Sections were cooled for 30 min in antigen retrieval buffer and then rinsed three times in TBS + 0.025% Triton X-100 for 5 min each. Sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum (Sanquin) in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight in Bcl-w antibody (1:200 Proteintech 16026-1-AP) Bcl-xl antibody (1:1000 Cell Signalling Technology 2764T) Bcl-2-A1 antibody (1:1000 Abcam ab45413) Bcl-2 antibody (1:200 Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7382) Mcl-1 antibody (1:200 Abcam ab32087) or MelanA antibody (1:1000 Abcam ab210546) at 4 °C in 5% goat serum in TBS. Sections were rinsed three times in TBS + 0.025% Triton X-100 for 5 min each and then incubated in goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific R37116) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then rinsed three times in TBS for 3 min each and incubated in 1 µg/ml DAPI for 5 min. Sections were rinsed again three times in TBS for 3 min each before mounting slides with mounting medium.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human skin tissue sections from organotypic tissue were stained for MelanA/MART (NCL-L-MelanA Leica Biosystems) and hematoxylin and eosin (Hematoxylin Gill III and Eosin (Cat# 3801540 and 3801600 Leica Biosystems)). Staining was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol for high-temperature antigen unmasking technique for paraffin sections. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed by the University of Pennsylvania Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-based Center (SBDRC). Tissue section quantification was performed according to previous reports5455. Briefly 4× photomicrograph images of representative tissue sections were taken using the Keyence BZ-X710 (Itasca IL USA). Tiff files of the images were saved and transferred to FIJI (ImageJ). Images corresponding to a single specific color were then analyzed to determine the number of pixels in each sample and normalized to epidermal area. The numbers of pixels representing Melan-A staining were normalized to the total amount of epidermal area.

Polysome analysis

Approximately 10 million senescent cells were seeded in 15 cm plates and per condition cells from two plates were pooled. Cells were treated with DMSO or ABT-263 for ~16 h after which cells were scraped on ice in ice-cold PBS containing 200 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 500 µl polysome lysis buffer (110 mM CH 3 CO 2 K 20 mM Mg(CH 3 COO) 2  10 mM HEPES pH 7.6 100 mM KCl 10 mM MgCl 2  0.1% NP-40 2 mM DTT 150 µg/ml CHX) and homogenized with a dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then loaded onto 10–60% sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 38000 rpm for 120 min at 4 °C. Gradients were fractionated and monosome light polysome and heavy polysome fractions were pooled. RNA was extracted from pooled fractions by addition of 185 µg/ml proteinase K 10 mM EDTA and 1% SDS. Samples were briefly inverted and incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. Equimolar volumes of phenol:chloroform were added vortexed and centrifuged at full speed for 8 min at room temperature. The upper aqueous phase was separated and 1.4 ml 100% EtOH 58 µl sodium acetate and 1 µl glycol blue was added before mixing and incubating overnight at −80 °C. Samples were centrifuged at full speed for 30 min at 4 °C and the pellet was washed with 80% EtOH. The samples were centrifuged again at full speed for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellet was air dried. Pellets were dissolved in 10 µl RNase-free water and incubated at 60 °C for 5 min. cDNA was synthesized and amplified using protocols as described above. C t values of Mcl-1 were normalized to β-actin and the percentage of Mcl-1 mRNA in each fraction was calculated as reported56.

Cycloheximide chase assay

Senescent melanocytes treated with either DMSO or ABT-263 for 12 h were then treated with 5 µg/ml cycloheximide. Protein lysates were obtained as described 30 60 120 and 240 min after the addition of cycloheximide and immunoblotted for Mcl-1 as described.

Nascent protein synthesis

Senescent melanocytes treated with either DMSO or ABT-263 for 24 h were subsequently depleted of Methionine by incubating the cells for 60 min in Methionine-free medium (21013-24 Gibco) without FBS. Then the cells were treated with 50 µM L-azidohomoalanine (Click-IT AHA C10102 ThermoFisher Scientific) for 4 h after which the cells were lysed in the following protein lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0 1%SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete mini 04693159001 Roche). Click-IT reaction was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using Biotin alkyne (B10185 ThermoFisher Scientific). The proteins were dissolved in RIPA-buffer (ab156034 Abcam) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche). Biotinylated proteins represent the nascent proteins. The protein samples have been immunoprecipitated using magnetic beads (Dynabeads™ Protein G for Immunoprecipitation; 10003D; Invitrogen) and an anti-Mcl-1 antibody (#94296 Cell Signalling Technology) followed by an immunoblot for Biotin (hyb-8; ab201341 Abcam). Immunoblots for Vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich) and Mcl-1 (Cell Signalling Technology) were used as controls.

Mice

All the mice were maintained in the central animal facility (CDP) of University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) under standard conditions. All the experiments were approved by the Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals (CCD – License #AVD105002015339) in the Netherlands. All mice were fed ad libitum (chow provided by Special Diets Services Cat# RM1 for breeding animals and RM3 for experimental animals) and housed in open cages.

Male Tyr::CreERT2 ;BRAFCA/+ mice32 at 9 weeks of age were topically treated each day with 2 mg of tamoxifen (T5648 Sigma-Aldrich) onto shaven backs for 5 consecutive days. For topical administration of drugs 1.3 mM ABT-263 and/or 0.27 mM S63845 was made up in a solution of DMSO/ethanol at a ratio of 1:6 and topically administered onto a small area of pigmented skin each day for 10 days. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment. Nevus density was calculated as described38 using ImageJ software.

Mass spectrometry analysis

Mice topically treated with ABT-263 and S63845 were euthanized and skin biopsies were harvested. Skin samples were sonicated and methanol supernatants were harvested after 12000 rpm 5 min centrifugation. Methanol supernatants containing drugs in skin was measured by Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS).

Human-engineered melanoma xenografts

Organotypic skin grafts were cultured in medium modified from previous methods395354. Specifically the Keratinocyte Growth Media (KGM) used for keratinocyte-only skin grafts was replaced with modified Melanocyte Xenograft Seeding Media (MXSM). MXSM is a 1:1 mixture of KGM lacking cholera toxin and Keratinocyte Media 50/50 (Gibco) containing 2% FBS 1.2 mM calcium chloride 100 nM Et-3 (endothelin 3) 10 ng/mL rhSCF (recombinant human stem cell factor) and 4.5 ng/mL r-basic FGF (recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor). Primary human melanocytes were transduced with lentivirus-carrying BRAF(V600E). Transduced melanocytes (1 × 105 cells) and keratinocytes (5 × 105 cells) were suspended in 80 μL MXSM seeded onto the dermis and incubated at 37 °C for 4 days at the air–liquid interface to establish organotypic skin. After 4 days 2.5 μM ABT-263 and 20 nM S63845 were added to three biologic replicates of organotypics and three biologic replicates were treated with vehicle (DMSO) control. Total drug concentration remained under one percent of total media volume. The organotypic cultures incubated for three days +/− compounds when they were taken for histology.

Statistics

Graphpad Prism was used for statistical analysis. Details are provided for each experiment in figure legends.

The tech giant is looking to appeal to young millennials and Gen Z by showcasing the ad on a 3D billboard.

The digital out-of-home activation debuted on Dec. 11 as part of Google’s ongoing “The Future is Unfolding” campaign with Samsung which started in 2021. In partnership with Universal Music Group and creative agency Cekai the billboard illustrates how people get frustrated when they fail at taking photos. It includes a 3D avatar of musical artist Ludacris demonstrating how to take a hands-free selfie using a foldable Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4.

Similar to Google and Samsung’s ’90s nostalgia campaign featuring TikTok personality Addison Rae the brands are targeting young millennials and Gen Z consumers through their partnership with Ludacris. The new ad spot encourages this target demographic to be creative and use the Samsung phone to capture more of their authentic selves with the goal of sparking conversation about what people should expect from their smartphones in both physical function and utility.

“While our primary target demographic is Gen Z and younger millennials we know we’ll reach beyond these groups to consumers who want more out of their most personal devices” said Adrienne Lofton Google’s global vice president of platforms and ecosystems marketing.

It is unclear how much of Google’s advertising budget is allocated to this specific campaign as Lofton declined to share overall budget specifics. According to Kantar data the company spent a little over $215 million so far on advertising efforts in 2022.

When developing this campaign Google wanted to find a way to demonstrate voice-enabled hands-free selfies on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4. To do this the company researched several different media and formats Lofton said. “One that really stuck out to the team was a high-impact specially designed 3D anamorphic digital billboard in Times Square” Lofton added.

Digital displays are going up in more strategic locations across the country which means marketers have to find the most compelling strategies for these digital OOH campaigns to successfully attract consumer attention. Several brands such as women’s health care brand Tia productivity app Notion and baby care brand Coterie have also contributed to this trend in 2022 making OOH a bigger part of their media mix going forward.

According to Allen Adamson co-founder of marketing collective Metaforce Times Square is the world’s most crowded and competitive marketing arena where every ad tries to be as loud as the next.

“First the breakthrough in large-scale high-definition screens allowed some advertisers to be bigger brighter more realistic and bolder than others and Google’s new 3D anamorphic billboard is changing the Times Square outdoor advertising game again” said Adamson. “3D is more attention-grabbing than HD and in Times Square’s cluttered and competitive environment the advertisers that get your attention win.”

Brandon Brown CEO at creator management platform GRIN agreed that Google and Samsung’s strategy for this campaign is in a good spot for winning attention with the billboard in one of the most heavily trafficked parts of New York City.

“The new first-ever 3D anamorphic billboard in Times Square featuring an avatar of Ludacris is a clever stunt and a very strategic way to use advanced technology to keep the marketing use of a popular celebrity evolving” Brown said.

In addition to the 3D billboard Google collaborated closely with Samsung and Universal Music Group’s teams to develop an integrated amplification strategy for the new campaign that includes social media behind-the-scenes content about the billboard development posted on Google Android Samsung and Ludacris’s TikTok Instagram Facebook and Twitter accounts. “We wanted to show that Samsung and Google are opening up new content creation opportunities through this functionality” said Lofton.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3RoZS13aXRjaGVyLTMtZ3VpZGUtdXBncmFkZS1wczQtdG8tcHM1LXZlcnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Witcher 3: How To Upgrade PS4 To PS5 Version,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3RoZS13aXRjaGVyLTMtZ3VpZGUtdXBncmFkZS1wczQtdG8tcHM1LXZlcnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvY2t3b3Jrcy5jby9uZXdzL2h1bnRpbmctaGlsbHMtY3J5cHRvLXBsYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Genesis Galaxy Execs Said To Helm Hedge Fund Hunting Hill's Crypto Play,"Longtime TradFi hedge fund operator Hunting Hill Global Capital is doubling down on cryptocurrency trading — which has not been common knowledge on The Street — according to three sources familiar with the matter.

The New York firm is closing in on a number of key hires for just that sources said: at least two former Genesis executives plus at least one senior addition out of Galaxy Digital.

There’s no shortage of interest in the ebbs and flows of talent from Genesis the struggling crypto lender and trader in the toughest job market in recent memory. Employers and jobseekers have been stung by plummeting payrolls. For the few with dry powder though there’s an upside: Talent exceeds openings.

Hunting Hill tapped Martin Garcia who spent more than half a dozen years at Genesis as chief investment officer for its emerging crypto-only affiliate Hunting Hill Digital sources said. Garcia in charge of the unit’s hiring is evidently looking to use that job market to his advantage.

Garcia had been biding his time since August 2021 when he left Genesis as one of its longest-tenured staffers. He’s been recently building out the “plumbing and piping and infrastructure” a source said.

Garcia has teamed up with Adam Gueren founder and chief investment officer of Hunting Hill proper. Guren is taking on the role of chief executive for Hunting Hill Digital in one indicator of his conviction in digital assets. Another Hunting Hill trader Adam Genello is set to join the new fund as a portfolio manager.

Crypto has tanked. It may still be tanking. Why launch now?

The rationale sources said for putting the fund in play sooner rather than later? Mammoth market dislocations brought into being by the collapses of some of crypto’s largest players.

“The market has been going kind of crazy and [Garcia and Guren] didn’t really see the right opportunity” until recently a source said.

Hunting Hill as it turns out has been in crypto since February 2020 via the launch of Hunting Hill Crypto Opportunities Fund — long before scores of Wall Street peers followed suit. While its performance since isn’t known two sources said results have been above average adding that Guren wouldn’t otherwise greenlight another fund.

The firm declined to comment. Sources were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive business dealings.

An effort to mesh TradFi crypto investing tactics

Hunting Hill has since its 2010 inception expanded its core arbitrage mandate to include additional strategies one source said. Digital assets are now up. It ran $718 million of gross assets at the end of 2021.

That evolution plays into the narrative of the multi-strategy fund operators increasingly cornering the market for limited partner dollars. A number have delivered standout showings throughout 2022’s frothy stock bond and commodity markets.

And a few such hedge fund behemoths including Steve Cohen’s Point72 have like Hunting Hill taken the crypto plunge.

The open-ended Hunting Hill Crypto Opportunities Fund now has about $50 million in assets under management the source said.

The yet-to-be-named new entity has its launch penciled-in for the end of first quarter or beginning of the second. It’s too early to get a pulse on capital-raising aspirations two sources said but conversations with would-be backers are already in play.

Garcia and Guren are vying to mesh the “traditional team at Hunting Hill and more crypto-native folks as well” one source said. To that end Garcia before Genesis spent time at illiquid asset specialist SecondMarket.

The firm typically trades bonds derivatives ETFs and equities. Its in-house products tend to pay off when markets chop and churn — likewise the bar for its crypto dealings.

The specifics of Hunting Hill Digital’s strategies aren’t settled. But it’s not going to be a quant shop one source said. That said it could look to acquire a crypto quant specialist at some point — part of a diversification push.

At the moment there’s all but untold alpha to be derived from crypto’s many corners by savvy traders armed with opportunistic strategies. And there’s real promise in buying into beaten-up spot assets and startup stakes in a recovery wager.

Still Hunting Hill has quite the tricky fundraising road ahead one source said. The largest of limited partners — the likes of top family offices pensions and endowments — had been engaged in serious due diligence on crypto portfolio managers in the bull market.

Scores have since backed out or put those prospects on the back burner.

“It’s an interesting launch” the source said. “But they’re looking at this as a four- or five-year play.”

GNRC,Generac,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi9AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMi8yNC8yNTc5MzE0LzAvZW4vZ2VuZXJhYy1hbGVydC1icmFnYXItZWFnZWwtc3F1aXJlLXAtYy1yZW1pbmRzLWludmVzdG9ycy10aGF0LWEtY2xhc3MtYWN0aW9uLWxhd3N1aXQtaGFzLWJlZW4tZmlsZWQtYWdhaW5zdC1nZW5lcmFjLWhvbGRpbmdzLWluYy1hbmQtZW5jb3VyYWdlcy1pbnZlc3RvcnMtdG8tY29udGFjdC10aGUtZmlybS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GENERAC ALERT: Bragar Eagel & Squire P.C. Reminds,"NEW YORK Dec. 23 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire P.C. a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Generac Holdings Inc. (“Generac” or the “Company”) (NYSE: GNRC) in the United States District Court of Eastern Wisconsin on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Generac securities between April 29 2021 and November 1 2022 both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until January 30 2023 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.



Click here to participate in the action.

This action arises from repeated misrepresentations by Generac and its senior executives that concealed from investors a defective component at the core of Generac’s solar power products. That component—the “SnapRS”—was intended to perform an essential safety function by rapidly shutting down solar devices in certain dangerous situations. Rather than protecting consumers the SnapRS would overheat melt and in some cases start fires.

Defendants knew that the versions of the SnapRS installed in thousands of homes were defective and dangerous. Numerous consumers filed complaints with regulators and Generac’s business partners that sold installed and serviced Generac’s solar products informed the Company of the SnapRS defect.

Instead of warning investors and consumers Defendants continued to tout the success and reliability of Generac’s solar energy products while quietly making minor modifications to the SnapRS including issuing a firmware update. After these modifications failed to fix the SnapRS Defendants continued to mislead investors.

Generac relied on “channel partners” to sell service and install its solar battery storage systems including Power Home Solar LLC d/b/a Pink Energy (“Pink Energy”) Baker Electric Home Energy Posigen and Valley Solar. During the Class Period Pink Energy was the largest of these partners with operations in 15 states. Among other deceptions Generac misled investors about its dependence on Pink Energy falsely assuring investors that no single customer or partner drove more than 6% of its sales and that Generac had a broad and diverse network of distribution partners.

Generac also misled investors about its financial condition by failing to account for its liability for warranty claims arising from the defective SnapRS. By misrepresenting its warranty liability Generac also overstated its earnings throughout the Class Period and falsely assured investors that the Company’s financial statements were prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).

Investors began to learn the truth about Generac’s defective SnapRS on August 1 2022 when Pink Energy filed a lawsuit against Generac revealing that the Company’s “defective” SnapRS components caused millions of dollars of damage giving rise to liability that threatened Pink Energy’s solvency (the “Pink Energy Complaint”). The disclosures in the Pink Energy Complaint caused the price of Generac shares to decline by $3.31 per share. The liability created by defective SnapRS components ultimately forced Pink Energy to declare bankruptcy on October 7 2022.

In the wake of Pink Energy’s bankruptcy on October 19 2022 Generac revealed that it had taken “pre-tax charges totaling approximately $55 million including approximately $37 million of clean energy product warranty-related matter and approximately $18 million of bad debt expense related to a clean energy product customer that has filed for bankruptcy.” The $37 million charge related to warranty expenses appears to reflect Generac’s belated acknowledgment of its increased liability to redress defective SnapRS units. The $18 million charge related to “bad debt expense” reflects receivables owed by Pink Energy and possibly other partners or customers burdened with defective SnapRS products that would not be paid. The October 19 disclosures caused the price of Generac shares to decline by $37.44 per share or 25%.

On November 2 2022 Generac released its earnings results for the third quarter of 2022 and lowered sales guidance on its solar energy business for the remainder of the year by approximately 40%. On a conference call with investors and analysts held that same day Generac’s CEO Defendant Jagdfeld attributed the lowered guidance to “the loss of a major customer during the quarter along with the specific warranty-related issue”—i.e. the defective SnapRS component and the Pink Energy bankruptcy that resulted directly from that defect. Analysts expressed shock upon learning how dependent Generac’s clean energy business was on Pink Energy with several analysts noting that investors had not been told of the significant concentration of that business with a single partner. As a result of these disclosures the price of Generac shares declined by $8.99 per share or 8%.

Through this action Plaintiffs seek an award of damages to compensate Generac stockholders for Defendants’ misrepresentations as set forth herein.

General Dynamics press release

Electric Boat is the prime contractor on the Columbia program which will replace the aging Ohio class ballistic missile submarines. The District of Columbia (SSBN 826) and Wisconsin (SSBN 827) are presently under construction.

The contract modification has a value of $5134324189. Work will be performed in Groton Connecticut; Quonset Point Rhode Island; and Newport News Virginia; and is expected to be completed by October 2030. The award funds advance procurement and advance construction of critical components and material to support Build II (the next five ships in the class) efforts to support continuous missile tube production enhancements to develop the Submarine Industrial Base and sustained class maintenance and support.

“This award enhances Electric Boat’s efforts to maintain the Columbia-class production and delivery schedule. Advance procurement of long lead time materials and component construction is critical to the program and the strategic investments in the development and expansion of the Submarine Industrial Base will help stabilize and grow the supply chain which increases manufacturing capacity reduces risk and ultimately drives timely delivery of submarines to the Navy.”

Kevin Graney President of General Dynamics Electric Boat

At 560 feet long with a displacement of nearly 21000 tons the submarines of the Columbia class will be the largest ever built by the United States. Ships of the Columbia class will have a fuel core that will power the submarine for its entire service life eliminating the need for mid-service refueling. Electric Boat will deliver the lead ship to the Navy in 2027.

Three companies are vying to build the ARV which will replace the 1980s-era LAVs before they leave the service in the 2030s.

The Marine Corps has previously struggled to design an LAV replacement but the ongoing Force Design 2030 modernization has helped clarify the role of the ARV and the tools it needs. Last year the service awarded competitive prototyping contracts to Textron and General Dynamics Land Systems and both companies have now turned their vehicles in for testing that’ll span the first half of 2023.

BAE Systems has worked with the Marines since April under a modification to its contract for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle. The company has integrated the Marines’ suite of command control communications computer and unmanned aerial system (C4/UAS) systems onto the ACV to offer another potential LAV replacement.

Here’s a closer look at the three companies’ offerings:

General Dynamics Land Systems

General Dynamics Land Systems is the only company to participate in both the 2019 science and technology demonstrator phase and the competitive prototyping phase and it pitches its vehicle as using proven components from other programs in its portfolio.

Phil Skuta GDLS’s Marine Corps and Navy business development director told Defense News the company’s prototype draws on investments the company has made in three areas: the Katalyst advanced electronic architecture artificial intelligence capability and autonomy and robotics.

General Dynamics Land Systems first built a prototype vehicle in 2017 using its own money Skuta said. It worked under the S&T contract from 2019 to 2021 he said and on Dec. 23 turned in a prototype vehicle under the current contract.

During that time he said the Marines’ have changed their focus from kinetic lethality to enhanced surveillance capability and the ability to view and contribute to a common battlefield picture. The swim capability for the vehicle is more robust under the current contract compared to the S&T contract Skuta said — asking for ocean swim capability rather than the legacy LAV’s riverine capabilities to reflect the Marines’ evolved plans for how they will use the vehicle. He said General Dynamics has ensured its offering has kept up with these changes to fully meet the current requirements.

Skuta added that between building the S&T demonstrator and the prototype General Dynamics Land Systems sought to increase the commonality in systems and components between its ARV proposal and other vehicles it’s currently building including the Army’s mobile protected firepower program.

Textron

Textron touts its Cottonmouth ARV as a clean-sheet design crafted with the Marines’ current and future needs in mind.

The company did not participate in the S&T demonstrator but Textron was tracking the Marines’ evolving vision for ARV and built an “alpha prototype” using internal research and development dollars David Phillips Textron Systems’ senior vice president of land and sea systems told Defense News.

Textron sent the alpha prototype to the Nevada Automotive Test Center early on for performance durability and reliability data and brought the vehicle back again after winning a contract with the Marine Corps in 2021.

Phillips said Textron used its work in other areas — including the landing craft air cushion it builds that will carry four ARVs from an amphibious ship to the shore and unmanned systems that will be integrated with ARV to expand its reach — to inform Cottonmouth.

Throughout 2022 Textron has been refining its vehicle design “realizing where we may have over-designed realizing where we may have under-designed in the [alpha] prototype and making those corrections” Phillips said.

The company finished building the prototype in August and after several months of contractor testing turned it over to the Marine Corps Dec. 1 at NATC according to company statements.

BAE Systems

BAE Systems did not participate in the ARV competitive prototyping phase but has a separate potential path to building the Marines’ next vehicle as the builder of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle.

Mark Brinkman the director of Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle for BAE told Defense News the base chassis is already in production at the company’s York Pa. plant.

Brinkman said BAE’s vehicle is larger than those of competitors and cannot fit four to a landing craft air cushion —but the company is pitching the Marines on a slightly different way to operate the ARVs. Rather than being moved on connectors like traditional Marine Corps ground vehicles the ACV C4/UAS would swim from the ship.

The larger ACV would carry more capability per vehicle allowing the Marines to consider using fewer vehicles to have the same recon/counter-recon reach Brinkman said.

BAE has received two full-rate production contracts for ACV since being selected in 2018 for the program. It is building personnel and command variants is designing a 30mm cannon variant and may design a recovery variant in the future.

Brinkman said an ACV was outfitted with the government-furnished systems and tested at NATC over the summer. It will now head to Camp Pendleton Calif. for additional government testing in the first half of 2023 alongside the two other prototypes.

Earlier this week General Mills which acquired Blue Buffalo in 2018 and Tyson Foods’ pet treat business in 2021 said its pet segment sales for its second fiscal quarter of 2023 were essentially unchanged from a year earlier totaling $593 million. Analysts had expected this number to come in closer to $672 million the WSJ said.

In an earnings call General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening said pet sales were hampered by “an unexpected headwind… in the form of inventory reductions at some key retailers” as well as capacity and customer service challenges that had carried over from the first fiscal quarter. “As a result while our all-channel retail sales grew at a high-single-digit rate in the quarter our net sales were essentially flat” he said.

Overall though pet food sales are seeing positive growth. Earlier this month online pet retailer Chewy revealed that 83% of its net sales in the third quarter came from non-discretionary categories like food and healthcare. According to the market research firm Packaged Facts’ latest study on pet food pet owners in the U.S. spent nearly $40 billion on dog and cat food in 2021 up 15% over 2020 (which was already 14% higher from 2019).

When it comes to pet food General Mills’ struggles are “definitely more company-specific” Brad Jashinsky a director analyst at Gartner told Modern Retail. “Pet food’s been very very stable” he said. “It grew so much before the pandemic and then so many people got pets during the pandemic that it continued to grow.”

Similarly Seth Basham who covers Petco and Chewy as managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities says pet food demand is “pretty strong.” “It’s the non-consumable side of the industry particularly discretionary hard goods that are seeing the weakness within their sales” he told Modern Retail. “Pet food specifically is driving the growth for them.”

Overall pet food sales have risen due to inflation with prices up 15.7% year over year in November. That’s more than double the overall economy which saw consumer prices jump 7.1% over the prior year. On a Dec. 9 earnings call Chewy CEO Sumit Singh said that “at Chewy we grew units and price” for the third quarter and that “we expect to do that in Q3 in 2023 as well.”

Blue Buffalo is a super-premium brand that offers foods with prescription formulas high protein and targeted nutrition. For General Mills “there’s definitely challenges in terms of supply but also supply at the right price” Jashinsky said. “Not only do you have to try to find the ingredients but you also have to find them at a reasonable price to be able to keep the margins where they’re at.”

In January 29% of pet owners said they faced “significant challenges” with price inflation in pet food according to Packaged Facts. Still even with inflation pet owners are unlikely to cut back on spending data shows. “A lot of pet owners are willing to splurge on their pets and I’m sure General Mills and Blue Buffalo are probably frustrated at not being able to keep their products on shelves because it is such a reliable product line” Jashinsky said.

Another thing hampering General Mills is competition David Lummis pet market analyst at Packaged Facts told Modern Retail. Blue Buffalo started out in speciality retail but once it moved over to the mass market “to my mind they automatically lose some of their cachet in terms of being super premium” he said. “There’s continually more and more super-premium brands entering the market. And so the competition just continues up and up and up.”

A large portion of Blue Buffalo’s business is dry food. But fresh and frozen pet food products in particular are gaining popularity with the frozen category expected to hit $23 billion by 2032 according to the market research firm Future Market Insights. Freshpet a refrigerated pet food brand that partners with retailers like Safeway and Walmart said sales rose 34.4% year over year in the second quarter. Earlier this year PetSmart formed an exclusive partnership with Nom Nom while Petco launched a WholeHearted Fresh Recipes line co-created with JustFoodForDogs. DTC brands such as PawFoods are also popping up to appeal to pets with special diets like gluten free.

The fresh pet food category is “still a very small part of the market but it’s really booming” Lummis said. To better position itself “it does look to me like General Mills may need to do something a little bit different with Blue Buffalo whether it’s incorporating one of the other big trends in the market that’s in tandem with fresh… like freeze-dried morsels… But much of the attention in super-premium is on that fresh wave.”

To prepare for the next quarter General Mills says it is upping its manufacturing capacity for dry dog food and treats taking advantage of its new distribution center and expanding capacity at its existing warehouses. Overall its CEO said on the call “as we move into the second half of fiscal 2023 we expect to get back to double-digit net sales growth on pet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGZvb2Rwcm9jZXNzaW5nLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlcy8xNjQ5NC1nZW5lcmFsLW1pbGxzLXJlbWFpbnMtaG9wZWZ1bC1mb3ItcGV0LWJ1c2luZXNzLWRlc3BpdGUtdW5kZXJ3aGVsbWluZy1xMi1zYWxlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Mills remains hopeful for pet business despite underwhelming Q2 sales,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGZvb2Rwcm9jZXNzaW5nLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlcy8xNjQ5NC1nZW5lcmFsLW1pbGxzLXJlbWFpbnMtaG9wZWZ1bC1mb3ItcGV0LWJ1c2luZXNzLWRlc3BpdGUtdW5kZXJ3aGVsbWluZy1xMi1zYWxlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223B2A3B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The disappearance of Bugles an ingredient used in making many holiday recipes has some Canadians searching for alternatives to the delectably crunchy corn snack.

Bugles are still sold in the United States but have been discontinued in Canada for several months — just one of the latest products American food manufacturers are no longer selling here.

General Mills the U.S. company that manufactures Bugles did not respond to CBC's calls or emails but has replied to hundreds of customers on Twitter  saying it hopes Canadians ""can find a tasty substitute elsewhere.""

That substitute could exist in the snack aisle of your local Asian supermarket according to Canadian fans of Bugles on Reddit. It's called Tongari Corn — a salty crispy horn-shaped corn snack that's been made by House Foods in Japan since the 1970s.

Over the last few weeks the Umami Shop in Lethbridge Alta. has had customers come in daily asking for ""Japanese Bugles"" to use in their homemade nuts and bolts recipes says owner Patricia Luu.

""We only have one bag left"" she said.

With her supply running low Luu has ordered more of the Japanese corn snacks from her supplier in Vancouver. She says she got his ""last six cases.""

Loch Willy went looking for Tongari Corn at four Asian grocery stores in Saskatoon but they were sold out.

CBC Radio's Cost of Living found a bag in Calgary and shipped it to him so he could taste test the purported Bugles substitute alongside the original snacks. Willy had three bags of Bugles in his possession thanks to his snowbird parents who carried them back in their luggage for him from Arizona.

Willy uses Bugles to make nuts and bolts every Christmas and says his family recipe cannot be made without them.

""They have that distinct cone shape they're the finger hat. Honestly if we were growing up and they weren't in there we would have noticed and been like 'Why? Where's the Bugles?'""

When Willy and his daughter Kiara tore open the two different corn snacks they were surprised at how similar the two products looked.

""I was skeptical but wow!"" Willy said. ""I think most people wouldn't know the difference.""

After several tastings the Willys concluded that Tongari Corn was slightly ""spicier"" than Bugles but had the same texture. Overall a ""pretty good substitute"" for any nuts and bolts recipe.

""Japanese Bugles look like they're going to save Christmas"" Willy said.

Bugles not only U.S. snack to leave Canada

In the last five years Canada has also lost other American products such as Skippy peanut butter  Ragu pasta sauce and Grape-Nuts cereal .

Bagel Bites a Kraft Heinz product disappeared last month along with Cosmic Brownies Oatmeal Cream Pies and Swiss Rolls — the entire line of Little Debbie boxed treats manufactured by McKee Foods Corp. In an email statement a spokesperson for the company told CBC that the decision to ""cease selling"" the Little Debbie treats was not made by the brand itself but by its Canadian distributor.

When it comes to distribution Canada is a ""notoriously costly"" place to do business said UBC Sauder School of Business marketing professor Yann Cornil. As a big country with a low population density Cornil said it's expensive for companies to ship products from coast to coast.

""And there are requirements for packaging to be translated into French and English. That increases the cost for U.S. brands so sometimes the decision is to just discontinue those products.""

Competition in the snack aisle

Another reason Bugles may have left the Canadian market is because the snack was facing too much competition from store-owned brands like President's Choice Kirkland Signature and Great Value.

According to its 2022 annual report  most General Mills products compete ""with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices"" and it notes that economic uncertainty may push some consumers to purchase more store-owned brands.

""In those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher-margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower-margin offerings"" the report said.

Every major grocery store in Canada has at least one if not several of its own private brands. A Sobeys spokesperson said the company adds hundreds of new products every year under its Compliments brand. Western Canadian grocer Calgary Co-op launched its store brands — Founders & Farmers and Cal & Gary's — three years ago and already has more than 1000 products on shelves.

""In the past private labels were just cheap versions or imitations of a popular brand at a lower price and probably also at a lower quality"" Cornil said. ""But that's no longer the case. Now the private label can compete with the national brands even at the high end even when it comes to satisfying niche segments of consumers.""

The snack aisle in particular is where consumers will find a wide variety of store-owned products — from low-salt and sea salt potato chips to gluten-free crackers and vegan cookies — and they get prime shelf space.

Cornil says that's deliberate and just one strategy Canadian grocery stores use to encourage shoppers to choose their labels over such name brands as Ruffles Lays and Bugles.

Private brands are also typically cheaper because grocery chains have economies of scale — they make massive orders for all of their stores which allows them to negotiate lower prices with the manufacturers that produce their products.

And with inflation still running high Canadians are reaching more often for store brands.

""Pretty much everyone buys private label groceries at some point"" said Brian Ettkin with Numerator Canada. The market research firm's latest numbers show that compared with 2021 private label grocery sales in Canada are up four per cent this year.

Trend toward 'healthier' snacks

It could also be that Canadians just aren't that jazzed anymore about America's No. 1 Finger Hat . Bugles have been around since the 1960s and Cornil says tastes have changed since then.

""With snack foods it's an interesting market because there has been shifting demand for healthier natural less processed foods. And you see a lot of these are sometimes 50- to 70-year-old brands that clearly do not satisfy the new demands of consumers. So the companies the manufacturers either have a choice to completely reformulate their products or to discontinue them in specific markets.""

Yann Cornil who teaches marketing and behavioural science at UBC's Sauder School of Business says consumer demand is shifting toward healthier and less processed snacks. (Submitted by UBC)

This isn't the first time Bugles have been discontinued north of the border. It happened in 2010 and the snack was back in Canada a year later.

That gives Bugles fans like Willy hope but in the meantime he's finding other ways to get his salty corn snack fix. Whether that's buying up bags of Tongari Corn or driving his parents' car home to Saskatchewan from Arizona.

""I've already told them 'If you guys don't want to drive home I'll fly down and bring your vehicle back. But I'm going to be filling it up with Bugles for all.'""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RyLWtub3cvMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9jYW4taS1tYWtlLW15LXdvcmtwbGFjZS1zdG9wLXRoZS1jaHJpc3RtYXMtbXVzaWMtb24tcmVsaWdpb3VzLWZyZWVkb20tZ3JvdW5kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can I Make My Workplace Stop the Christmas Music on Religious-Freedom Grounds?,"My workplace is currently playing all Christmas music. Can I make them stop simply because the music is terrible? If not can I make them stop on the same religious-freedom grounds that make it illegal for them to have mandatory Christian prayers? —Miserable Under Mistletoe

I feel a little guilty Miserable since (as you know) you sent this message over a year ago. By now you’ve probably killed your boss torched the shop and gone on a six-state murder spree so you don’t care anymore. But for the benefit of others in the same predicament I’ll furnish the answer to these (and many other) questions: You’re screwed.

You may be surprised to learn you’re far from the first person to notice that Christmas’ (nominally) denominational aspect might present a problem for the HR department. This is why a quick Google search for “nonreligious Christmas carols” will turn up reams of playlists specifically designed to help employers fend off objections from the likes of you.

For example your boss is on rock-solid ground with that genre of holiday carols that focus on the season rather than the holiday itself: There’s zero religious content to be found in frost-rimmed classics like “Winter Wonderland” “Sleigh Ride” “Let It Snow” and even “Jingle Bells.” (Also “Baby It’s Cold Outside” assuming you don’t consider sexual assault a religious practice.)

“Sure” I hear you saying “but how many carols don’t mention Christmas at all? Maybe a dozen?” To that I would reply that if you think an employer can’t make a monthslong playlist out of a dozen (or fewer) songs you’ve never worked retail. But it doesn’t matter anyway because hundreds of songs that do mention Christmas are effectively secular because they treat it as a generic celebration devoid of content. Good luck convincing a jury you feel religiously oppressed by “I’ll Be Home for Christmas”—it could just as easily be “I’ll Be Home for Taco Night.”

In any case the U.S. Supreme Court has held (in a case I’m going to call Grinch v. Nordstrom) that even overtly religious music is perfectly legal for private employers to play if they want to. “Perfectly legal” is not the same as “no one’s going to complain” and many retailers probably nix “Away in a Manger” in favor of “Silver Bells” just to play it safe. Your legal options are nil either way so you might as well get used to it. Look on the bright side; at least it’s been a while since we heard “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.”

Only Toyota and Volkswagen built more cars this year. Hyundai slipped past General Motors in 2022 according to Bloomberg.

A Long Way to Go to Catch Toyota

Final tallies of sales results can lag for months. Through the first half of 2022 BusinessKorea notes Hyundai sold about 3.3 million cars globally. Japan’s Toyota sold more than 5.1 million with Germany’s Volkswagen taking second with about 4 million vehicles.

Here we should point to a distinction between automakers and brands. Manufacturers sell cars under dozens of brands. But most of those brands are owned by just a handful of larger companies. General Motors for instance operates Buick Cadillac Chevrolet and GMC (and perhaps soon separate Camaro Corvette and Escalade brands.)

So when analysts say Volkswagen is the world’s second-largest automaker they don’t mean the VW badge is on more cars than almost any other. Volkswagen sells cars globally under the Volkswagen Škoda Seat Cupra Audi Lamborghini Bentley and Porsche brands as well as Ducati motorcycles. Totaling all of those sales gets it to second place.

Hyundai made it to the podium with three badges – Hyundai Kia and the Genesis luxury brand. Bloomberg says that all three have built a significant presence in North America accounting for 21% of Hyundai’s global sales.

Hyundai Has Some Electric Hits but a Problem With U.S. Law

As the automotive industry shifts its focus toward electric cars Hyundai Motor Company has a couple of hits on its hands. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 an all-electric SUV with a funky pixelated look and surprising cabin space for its midsize footprint has won accolades. They include the 2022 World Car of the Year prize and more importantly our own Best New Model trophy.

The Kia EV6 which uses many of the same parts has also been an early sales success with its more aggressive look and 576-horsepower high-performance GT trim.

But there’s a speed bump in their way – new federal tax law offers a $7500 tax rebate on electric cars built in North America. Hyundai makes the Ioniq 5 and EV6 in its home country South Korea.

The company recently broke ground on a new electric car factory in the U.S. state of Georgia. It’s one of several automakers to move EV production to the U.S. after Congress passed the law. But car factories can take several years to build. While Hyundai prepares rivals already producing in the U.S. may chip away at the company’s standing here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ib2R5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9idWljay1kZWFsZXJzLWluLXJ1cmFsLWFyZWFzLW1vdmUtdG93YXJkLWJ1eW91dC1pbnN0ZWFkLW9mLWV2LWFkb3B0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buick Dealers in Rural Areas Move Toward Buyout Instead of EV Adoption,"Buick dealers in rural areas are moving in favor of buyouts from General Motors instead of shifting toward EV adoption dealerships said.

In September GM said it would offer Buick dealerships in the U.S. buyouts in an attempt to push stores toward widespread EV adoption. While GM is set on selling only zero-emission vehicles by 2035 Global VP of Buick and GMC Duncan Aldred said some franchises might not want to move toward EVs.

“Not everyone necessarily wants to make that journey depending on where they’re located or the level of expenditure that the transition will demand” he said.

Several dealerships across the country are more than considering the buyout offer. Buick’s minimum commitment amount of between $300000 and $400000 to prepare stores to sell and service EVs is just too much for some to consider especially those in rural areas.

A report from the Detroit Free Press said Buick dealership owners in rural and small market areas are taking the buyout offer while other sales centers in larger markets are investing in the transition to EVs.

One dealership owner who chose to make the EV investment said GM offered inventory from other Buick dealerships opting to take a buyout.

GM spokespeople did not comment on how many Buick dealerships across the country are opting to sell the franchises back to the automaker instead of investing in EVs as legal confidentiality is still needed. While GM couldn’t comment on how many if any dealers would take the buyout one Buick dealer said all Detroit metro dealerships would make the initial investment to sell EVs and equip their buildings with charging infrastructure and other necessities.

Dick Garber who runs Garber Buick in Michigan said in the report GM made him a “generous and fair” offer and doable in terms of the sales figures his dealership pulls in. However he understands there are some stores that do not sell many units and the buyout is likely the better option.

“I know GM is being very generous and very fair and it could be good for everyone” he said in the report.

GM is not the only company attempting to push dealers to transition to predominant EV sales over the next decade. Ford is also pushing dealers to do the same but is encountering pushback from some as its EV Certification Program requires a hefty investment.

The United States has banned the import of forced-labor goods from Xinjiang due to China’s treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority. Senate Finance Committee chair Ron Wyden recently wrote to General Motors Tesla Honda Ford Toyota Volkswagen Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz and asked them about their Chinese supply lines and any relationships in the Xinjiang region.

In the letter Wyden asked the carmakers if they had ever canceled or curtailed the use of any supplier “because of its use of raw materials mining processing or parts manufacturing linked to Xinjiang?”

“Unless due diligence confirms that components are not linked to forced labor automakers cannot and should not sell cars in the United States that include components mined or produced in Xinjian” Wyden added.

Wyden addressed the eight major car manufacturers after a report from the UK’s Sheffield Hallam University said that “heightened scrutiny” was needed to ensure that the mining of raw materials and production of automotive parts did not involve Uyghur forced labor. The report found evidence that carmakers were using metals batteries wiring and wheels made Xinjiang or sourcing from companies that used Uyghur workers in other regions of China.

Responding to Nikkei Asia for comment on the letter General Motors said its supplier contracts forbid the use of any “forced or involuntary labor” adding that it “conducts extensive due diligence particularly where we identify or are made aware of potential violations of the law our agreements or our policies.”

“I recognize automobiles contain numerous parts sourced across the world and are subject to complex supply chains” Wyden added in his letter. “However this recognition cannot cause the United States to compromise its fundamental commitment to upholding human rights and U.S. law.”

The U.S. State Department asserts that more than 1 million Uyghurs are held alongside other minorities in roughly 1200 state-run internment camps in Xinjiang The Wall Street Journal reports."

The consumer discretionary sector is down about 37% for the year. Companies in this sector tend to suffer during times of economic downturn since consumers prioritize paying for necessities such as rent or food over discretionary purchases when their budgets are tight.

But ""while most consumer discretionary stocks have been horrendous this year we've had some pools of strength too and many of them can work in 2023"" according to Cramer.

Here are his picks:

Genuine Parts  O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone

Cramer highlighted these three auto parts stocks as potential buys stating that AutoZone is his favorite. With used car prices coming down and new car prices likely to follow consumers are more likely to fix up their old car next year than purchase a new one he reasoned.

Ulta Beauty

While the company reported a solid earnings beat and boosted its outlook earlier this month investors shouldn't be greedy with the stock especially if it sees a big gain Cramer advised.

TJX Companies

The parent company of T.J. Maxx Marshalls and HomeGoods will benefit from the excess inventory the holidays will leave behind he said. He added that because TJX operates discount retailers its stock is a winner during times of recession when consumers tend to trade down.

Yum! Brands

Cramer called the parent company of KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut a great value proposition for consumers.

Starbucks

He said he expects Starbucks to make a powerful comeback in China once the company's economy fully reopens.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for Gilead Sciences’ Sunlenca (lenacapavir) plus other antiretroviral(s) (ARV) to treat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.

The treatment is indicated for adult patients who are heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) with multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 infection.

This approval is backed by findings from the multicentre double-blinded placebo-controlled international Phase II/III CAPELLA clinical trial of lenacapavir plus an optimised background regimen.

Subcutaneous lenacapavir’s antiviral activity administered every six months was analysed in the trial.

According to the findings at week 52 83% of the subjects who received lenacapavir plus the background regimen attained an undetectable viral load.

These subjects also had a mean rise in CD4 count of 82 cells/µL.

A long-acting HIV capsid inhibitor Sunlenca is intended for dosing twice a year.

It acts by hindering the protein shell (capsid) of the HIV-1 virus to hamper the viral lifecycle’s steps.

Sunlenca is also said to be the first-ever capsid inhibitor-based HIV therapy to receive such approval.

At present lenacapavir alone or in combination is approved by regulatory agencies in the US UK Canada or the European Union.

Gilead Sciences chairman and CEO Daniel O’Day said: “This news is an important milestone in the work to help end the HIV epidemic as Sunlenca is now the only FDA-approved twice-yearly treatment for people with multi-drug resistant HIV.

“Our goal is to deliver multiple long-acting options for treatment and prevention that are tailored to the needs of people living with HIV and people who could benefit from PrEP medicines.”

Gilead’s Sunlenca (lenacapavir) is the first capsid inhibitor to be FDA-approved for treating HIV-1.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Gilead’s Sunlenca (lenacapavir) a capsid inhibitor for adults living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who cannot be successfully treated with other available treatments.

Sunlenca is the first of a new class of drugs called capsid inhibitors to be approved by the FDA for treating HIV-1. Sunlenca works by blocking the HIV-1 virus’ protein shell (the capsid) thereby interfering with multiple essential steps of the viral lifecycle.

The starting dose of Sunlenca is given as oral tablets and subcutaneous injections followed by maintenance injections once every six months. Sunlenca is given in combination with other antiretrovirals.

The safety and efficacy of Sunlenca were established through the multicentre Phase II/III CAPELLA clinical trial involving 72 patients whose HIV infections were resistant to multiple classes of HIV medications. The patients involved had to have high levels of virus in their blood despite being on antiretroviral drugs.

As part of the trial patients were enrolled into one of two study groups. One group was randomised to receive either Sunlenca or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The second group received open-label Sunlenca. The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of patients in the randomised study group who achieved a certain level of reduction in virus during the initial 14 days compared to baseline.

In this group 87.5 percent of patients who received Sunlenca achieved such a decrease in virus compared to 16.7 percent of patients who received a placebo. After 26 weeks of Sunlenca plus other antiretrovial drugs 81 percent of participants in the first group achieved HIV RNA suppression where levels of HIV were low enough to be considered undetectable. After 52 weeks 83 percent of participants continued to have HIV RNA suppression.

The most common adverse reactions with Sunlenca were injection site reactions (swelling pain or redness) and nausea.

“Today’s approval ushers in a new class of antiretroviral drugs that may help patients with HIV who have run out of treatment options” said Debra Birnkrant MD director of the Division of Antivirals in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The availability of new classes of antiretroviral medications may possibly help these patients live longer healthier lives.”

Daniel O’Day Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gilead Sciences added: “This news is an important milestone in the work to help end the HIV epidemic as Sunlenca is now the only FDA-approved twice-yearly treatment for people with multi-drug resistant HIV.”

In August 2022 the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorisation for use of Sunlenca® (lenacapavir) injection and tablets in adults with multi-drug resistant HIV infection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvdXMtZmRhLWFwcHJvdmVzLWdpbGVhZHMtbG9uZy1hY3RpbmctaGl2LWRydWctc3VubGVuY2EvOTY0NDcxMzTSAXpodHRwczovL2hlYWx0aC5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3BoYXJtYS91cy1mZGEtYXBwcm92ZXMtZ2lsZWFkcy1sb25nLWFjdGluZy1oaXYtZHJ1Zy1zdW5sZW5jYS85NjQ0NzEzNA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US FDA approves Gilead's long-acting HIV drug Sunlenca,"Bengaluru: The U S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday approved Gilead Sciences Inc's Sunlenca therapy for HIV infections paving the way for a drug that requires less frequent dosing than existing treatments.



Sunlenca injection and tablets are expected to cost $42250 per year during the initial year of therapy the company said ahead of the approval.



Treatment of HIV infections typically involves giving a combination of anti-retroviral HIV medicines such as Gilead's Biktarvy and ViiV Healthcare's Triumeq daily to treat the infection.



Gilead's Sunlenca whose common name is lenacapavir is given once every six months as an injection but will be in addition to the current treatment regimen of patients.

Gilead Sciences Inc. announced this week that Sunlenca® (lenacapavir) in combination with other antiretroviral(s) (ARV) has been granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) adults with multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 infection. Sunlenca has a multi-stage mechanism of action distinguishable from other currently approved classes of antiviral agents and no known cross resistance exhibited in vitro to other existing drug classes. Sunlenca offers a new twice-yearly treatment option for adults with HIV that is not adequately controlled by their current treatment regimen.

“An effective antiretroviral regimen can be devised for most people living with the virus; however some people living with HIV no longer have durable viral suppression due to resistance to multiple classes of antiretroviral therapies” said Sorana Segal-Maurer MD Director of the Dr. James J. Rahal Jr. Division of Infectious Diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian Queens Professor of Clinical Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and the Site Principal Investigator for the CAPELLA trial. “The availability of new classes of antiretroviral drugs is critical for heavily treatment-experienced people with multi-drug resistant HIV. Following today’s decision from the FDA lenacapavir helps to fill a critical unmet need for people with complex prior treatment histories and offers physicians a long-awaited twice-yearly option for these patients who otherwise have limited therapy choices.”

Despite the significant advances in ARV therapy there remain numerous critical and pressing unmet needs for people living with HIV. This is particularly true for individuals who are heavily treatment experienced – which account for an estimated 2% of adults living with HIV who are on treatment globally –- and are unable to maintain virologic suppression due to resistance intolerance or safety considerations. This type of complexity further increases the chance of treatment failure underscoring the need for new treatment options that are active against resistant variants of the virus with a novel mechanism of action.

Lenacapavir is a breakthrough innovation with the potential to be a preferred and versatile foundational long-acting agent due to its therapeutic potency and a range of dosing frequencies and routes of administration. Lenacapavir is being developed as a foundation for Gilead’s future HIV therapies with the goal of offering several long-acting options that help address individual needs and preferences that may help optimize outcomes and reduce burden of care. Lenacapavir is being studied in multiple ongoing early and late-stage development programs and has the potential to offer a diverse set of person-centric options for treatment and prevention that could uniquely fit into the lives of people living with HIV and people who would benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The use of lenacapavir for HIV prevention is investigational and the safety and efficacy of lenacapavir for this use have not been established.

“This news is an important milestone in the work to help end the HIV epidemic as Sunlenca is now the only FDA-approved twice-yearly treatment for people with multi-drug resistant HIV” said Daniel O’Day Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gilead Sciences. “Gilead scientists have developed a unique and potent antiretroviral medicine in Sunlenca with the potential for flexible dosing options. Our goal is to deliver multiple long-acting options for treatment and prevention that are tailored to the needs of people living with HIV and people who could benefit from PrEP medicines.”"

However payments technology—and consumer trust—present a challenge for brand marketers amidst an $80 billion-dollar opportunity.

Social Commerce’s Surge Has A Notable Hitch – Payments And Consumer Trust

According to a recent report by Insider Intelligence over half of American consumers will have purchased through a social media platform by the end of 2022. According to the report consumer spending in the US via social commerce will likely reach $80 billion by 2025—and global spending will reach $1.2 trillion. With 92 percent of consumers stating that they discovered a new product on social media and 40 percent of consumers reporting that they actively search for products while interacting on a social platform the opportunity for brands to benefit from a social commerce storefront is significant. Results can be impressive—for example a two-hour live shopping event on TikTok resulted in more than a week’s worth of sales at a brand’s flagship retail store.

In addition social commerce appeals to the consumer segments that shop the most. For example millennials and Gen Z. An October 2022 survey reveals that 78 percent of Gen Z and 70 percent of millennials reported that they are likely to purchase directly from a social media platform in the next 12 months. One reason for Gen Z’s and millennials’ high levels of engagement with social commerce is their reliance on influencers as they make shopping choices. A recent survey revealed that over 70 percent of consumers who regularly watched influencers’ live streams were likely to buy products that they recommended.

More than half of millennials and Gen Z have purchased based on a social media influencer or content creator recommendation. That means coveted demographics are looking for product purchasing guidance interacting with influencers’ product-focused content and are willing to buy—all on the same platforms. And many social commerce consumers want to become repeat customers: a 2022 McKinsey survey found 75 percent of live shopping event attendees wished to attend another virtual sale.

But there’s a hitch: 43 percent of consumers who would not purchase via social media said they distrusted the platforms with their payment information.

How Trust And A Payments Infrastructure Drive Social Commerce Sales

According to a Mckinsey report more Gen Z consumers purchase directly online via social and creator platforms. A Forrester survey quoted by the McKinsey survey shows 61 percent of Gen Z adults made an in-app social media or creator platform purchase up from 53 percent in 2020.

That growth—and consumers’ willingness to buy directly on social platforms may be boosted—or hindered—by how user-friendly and trustworthy payment processes are for shoppers. For example in China where social commerce has exploded in recent years the integration of seamless social shopping and payments made it simple for social media consumers to shift purchasing to social channels.

“Over the years mega-platforms such as Alibaba and Tencent have used the trust they built among Chinese consumers to create a sprawling digital ecosystem and enable the rapid growth of social commerce” the report reads. “Creator content product discovery community sharing and digital-payment infrastructures are all integrated into a seamless one-stop-shop digital universe.”

While there are certainly differences between Chinese and American shopping behaviors one point of symmetry is the significance of influencer culture to consumers’ shopping interests and the opportunity user-friendly digital payments present for brands.

“Just as the arrival of Alibaba’s Taobao Live in 2016 ushered in a new type of e-commerce social-commerce adoption in the United States is being driven by social media and content creation platforms (such as Pinterest and TikTok) adding new shopping capabilities” according to McKinsey’s Social Commerce: The Future Of How Consumers Interact With Brands. “These tech-enabled features allow platforms to process transactions and in doing so gain access to first-party customer data and expand their ability to offer value to advertisers.”

According to the report the ability to securely manage transactions through a platform provides benefits to brands and platforms. “Instead of merely targeting consumers with top-of-the-funnel awareness campaigns social media platforms can now draw a much more direct line between advertising impressions and verified sales.”

But gaining that first-party data from consumers requires gaining consumers’ trust something complicated by social media’s slew of recent controversies regarding data privacy.

While a recent survey showed that 47 percent of consumers stated that they “strongly distrusted” social media platforms concerning their financial or banking data they held high trust for traditional banks. A payment tool tailored to social commerce provided by a bank may offer a solution for social media platforms and brands attempting to boost social shopping adoption.

Enter embedded finance: a trending shift in payments strategy among retailers that may address some consumers’ reluctance to trust their payment data to a social platform. Embedded finance typically means a nonbank such as a retailer or a brand offering customers financial services such as providing access to a digital wallet or branded Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) payments. FinTechs often offer embedded finance services in collaboration with banks for their brand or retailer clients. For example a brand or retailer selling in-app or via a live-shopping event could offer shoppers customized payment options through the bank or FinTech and assure customers that these services must comply with strict financial data handling regulations governing financial institutions.

According to a recent survey of European retailers presented by Finextra:

Seventy-four percent of the retailers surveyed currently offer embedded financial products or services to customers and a majority 56 percent plan to roll out new offerings over the coming 12 months. Retailers surveyed cited a range of reasons for creating or planning the integration of embedded finance options such as creating a new revenue stream (41 percent) increasing customer loyalty (40 percent) and improving customer brand satisfaction (38 percent).

Per a recent report by Bain & Company financial services embedded into e-commerce and other software platforms accounted for $2.6 trillion—approximately 5 percent—of all US financial transactions in 2021. According to the report these transactions will likely reach $7 trillion by 2026.

It is the ""largest recovery ever achieved in a data privacy class action and the most Facebook has ever paid to resolve a private class action"" Keller Rohrback L.L.P the law firm representing the plaintiffs said in a court filing late Thursday announcing the settlement.

The class action lawsuit was prompted in 2018 after Facebook disclosed that the information of 87 million users was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica a consultancy firm linked to former President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.

The case was broadened to focus on Facebook's overall data-sharing practices. Plaintiffs alleged that Facebook ""granted numerous third parties access to their Facebook content and information without their consent and that Facebook failed to adequately monitor the third parties' access to and use of that information"" according to the law firm behind the lawsuit.

Judges overseeing the case in the Northern District of California will now have to approve the settlement.

""We pursued a settlement as it's in the best interest of our community and shareholders. Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy program"" a Meta spokesperson told CNBC. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement."

The snow globe–themed painting? Made and gifted to him by his sister. Image: Chona Kasinger

spin an actual globe and chances are you'll land on a destination that Alex Crick has immortalized in a snow globe. His world-spanning collection of glass water ceramic and sometimes plastic manifests in viking ships (Iceland) bald eagles (Alaska...and Denver) cherry blossoms (Japan) dolphins (Florida) and so many buildings.

It all got rolling in 2000. ""I just started collecting them because I thought it would be fun"" Crick says. ""Then it got to the point where we're going to more places and picking up more snow globes and friends brought me more snow globes and it ended up you know I have a collection of them.""

Crick doesn't keep track but estimates his snow globes number in the hundreds now. He's quickly running out of shelf space. ""Some of them are actually stacked on top of other ones at the moment because I'm running out of spots."" But does he think he'll ever stop? ""There's always more places to visit.""

On his snow globe criteria

""Usually the best place to find snow globes is actually in an airport. Airport gift shops are notorious for that sort of thing.""

""I try to go for the one that I find the most interesting. Whichever one is the cheesiest is usually the one that I get because those are the more interesting and decorative ones. And sometimes you know you don't have a choice.... The cheesier the better is what I always say.""

On recalling and making memories

""I look at them and shake them around every once in a while. A lot of them are associated with people or memories. Each place kind of tells a little story.""

""I remember going to Scotland and I went with my nieces. I think the oldest one was 10 at that point and the youngest one was about four or three. They want to do what the uncle was doing and so they all got snow globes of their own. I thought that was pretty cute. Now they all have their own little Scotland snow globes.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvbWF2ZXJpY2tzL25ld3MvZGFsbGFzLW1hdmVyaWNrcy1sdWthLWRvbmNpYy1qYWxlbi1icnVuc29uLW12cC1jYW5kaWRhdGUtdGFtcGVyaW5nLXB1bmlzaG1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mavs MVP Candidates: Luka Doncic Vs. … Jalen Brunson of Knicks?,"Mavs future Hall of Famer(s) Cowboys comfort from the cold Rangers fan cashes in and the confounding cost of Crocs at Christmas all in this week's DFW sports notebook.

WHITT'S END 12.23.22:

Whether you’re at the end of your coffee your day your week or even your rope welcome to Whitt’s End …

*While Luka Doncic whines and his Dallas Mavericks lose about as often as they win Jalen Brunson is suddenly clicking in New York.

The former Mav is playing so well that ESPN NBA analyst Michael Wilbon went this far:

“Jalen Brunson better be mentioned when you start your MVP discussions. He’s having that good of a season. You think Luka and his .500 team wouldn’t like to have him back?”

No lies detected.

And to think it only cost the Knicks a second-round pick to steal Brunson from Dallas.

*The wind chill during the fourth quarter of Thursday night’s Armed Forces Bowl between Baylor and Air Force was a crisp -11 degrees. Otherwise known by two simple words:

Eff. That.

While a big part of the U.S. prepares for a white(out) Christmas this weekend Saturday’s Dallas Cowboys-Philadelphia Eagles anticlimactic “showdown” will be sheltered from this arctic “Blue Norther” inside AT&T Stadium’s climate-controlled 72-degree environment.

But there was a time – more often and more recently than you remember – when Mother Nature stuck her uncomfortable nose in our Dallas-Fort Worth sports business. As in it was just last May when a rainy leaky roof at American Airlines Center delayed Game 4 of the NBA’s Western Conference Finals between the Mavericks and Golden State Warriors for 16 minutes.

Our Top 10 most memorable weather “games”:

10. 12.9.13 – The wind chill at kickoff is a brutal -9 degrees. It turns out to be the good news as the stiff and shoddy Cowboys’ defense allows 348 passing yards to journeyman Bears’ quarterback Josh McCown in a 45-28 loss at frosty Soldier Field.

9. 12.22.89 – With the temperature bitterly dipping to 3 outside Rolando Blackman heats up Reunion Arena with a 31-point performance (without attempting a single 3-pointer) that helps the playoff-bound Mavericks beat the Los Angeles Clippers and improve to 12-12.

8. 12.24.89 – You know it’s bad when the temperature matches your win total … and both are 1. On the coldest day in DFW history (-1) the Cowboys cap a 1-15 season with a 20-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers. It is so cold that the toilets in Texas Stadium freeze prompting Dallas sportswriting icon Frank Luksa to opine: “The 1989 season was so bad it wouldn’t flush.”

7. 2.14.21 – On the coldest Valentine’s Day in DFW history Luka Doncic spoils a 44-point performance by missing an open 3-pointer that would’ve surely heated up an overtime against the Portland Trailblazers.

6. 5.3.09 – Though it isn’t a “game” per se the stormy Spring day results in a permanent devastating outcome as Cowboys’ scouting assistant Rich Behm is paralyzed from the waist down after a 64-mph wind gust (one degree shy of an official tornado) blows down the team’s Valley Ranch indoor practice structure during a rookie minicamp.

5. 2.6.11 – A debilitating arctic blast turns DFW into horrible hosts. Frigid temperatures and icy roads hamper travel cancel events and send six fans to the hospital after ice falls from the roof of then-Cowboys Stadium. At the end of a long bad week Cowboys fans have to watch a Super Bowl XLV featuring two of their most-hated teams: Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Green Bay Packers.

4. 1.17.93 – This wasn’t a wintry mix but rather pig slop. In a game they aren’t supposed to win and on a field that was barely playable Alvin Harper sloshes through Candlestick Park’s rain-soaked muddy sod for a 70-yard catch-and-run that punctuates the Cowboys’ NFC Championship Game upset of the San Francisco 49ers and a ticket to Super Bowl XXVII.

3. 1.1.79 – Neither hypothermia caused by a sub-freezing wind chill nor a 22-point deficit can stop Joe Montana in the 1979 Cotton Bowl. With Notre Dame trailing Houston 34-12 late in the third quarter Montana – with the aid of hot chicken soup – returns from the locker room to lead an improbable rally and a 35-34 victory in a game that sees only 7000 in attendance and a 30-mph wind dictating every point scored in the south end zone.

2. 11.25.93 – Leon Lett’s brain freeze. On a turbulent Thanksgiving that surprises fans – and weatherfolks – with an ice storm that transforms Texas Stadium into a snow globe Lett infamously and inexplicably attempts to recover a blocked field goal in the waning seconds of a heart-breaking mind-numbing defeat to the Miami Dolphins.

1. 12.31.67 – Though it’s played 1000 miles north in a world accustomed to the frozen tundra the “Ice Bowl” forever burns a painful image in the hearts and minds of Cowboys fans. The 1967 NFL Championship Game at Lambeau Field includes coaching legends Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi the Packers’ Bart Starr’s game-winning touchdown in the final seconds and a brisk temperature of minus-15.

*What a buzzkill. Since Dak Prescott returned from his thumb injury in October we’ve been circling the Cowboys’ Christmas Eve game against the Eagles. Two best teams in football we thought. NFC East on the line we figured. Now? The 10-4 Cowboys aren’t catching 13-1 Philadelphia Eagles’ MVP candidate Jalen Hurts isn’t playing and the expected holiday treat of a game has deteriorated into a White Elephant gift. After all who wants Gardner Minshew in their stocking? Can’t we just skip to the part where both teams are motivated and playing at full strength better known as the NFC Championship Game?

*Unfairly Judged?

In the wake of catching – and selling – the most valuable baseball on Earth Texas Rangers fan Cory Youmans sets the record straight about his past present future and process of being at peace with only $1.5 million.

Youmans who caught New York Yankees’ slugger Aaron Judge’s historic 62nd home run at Arlington’s Globe Life Field on Oct. 4 isn’t some romantic baseball hero that voluntarily relinquished the ball out of his love of the game. But nor is he the rich-get-richer villain fittingly hoodwinked out of half his potential windfall an image being portrayed by the media and amplified across uninformed social networks.

Before selling the ball at an auction that ended last Saturday Youmans said he received sketchy DM offers for the ball in exchange for things like Ferraris and suitcases full of cash.

“No matter what I did not everyone would agree that it was the right strategy” Youmans told me this week. “If I gave it back I was stupid and if I sold it I was greedy. I’m a private person that essentially won the lottery live on national TV. So to say the least it’s been an interesting experience. But at the end of the day I feel lucky to have been in the stadium that night and lucky to have caught the ball.

""I’m at peace with the process.”



As the Rangers prepare for a 2023 season they hope breaks a streak of six losing campaigns they’re creating another buzz with more offseason spending. Last winter it was half-a-billion dollars for Seager and Marcus Semien. This year they signed a bona-fide pitching ace in New York Mets’ former two-time Cy Young winner Jacob deGrom.

By the time they host their first ever Sunday Night Baseball game at Globe Life Field on April 2 the gnashing of teeth over Youmans’ perceived error in selling strategy will be long gone. His profit however will still be hard at work.

His plans include using some of the money for he and wife Bri’s first home together and re-paying a grandfather who delayed retirement in order to see Youmans through high school. Youmans wants to build him a garage for his passion: working on classic cars.

“I want part of this money to allow him to do what he loves for as long as he wants to do it” he said.

Youmans will gladly keep the fortune. But he’s had his fill of the fame.

“One minute you’re standing in line for a cheeseburger and the next minute everyone is trying uncover every wrinkle of your life” Youmans said. “If a Google search says this is my No. 1 accomplishment I’m fine with that. I don’t expect to go on and do something else that gets me on Good Morning America.

“This was enough for me.”*Took Big Brothers Big Sisters lil’ bro Ja Christmas shopping this week. What’s on a 16-year-old boy’s wish list: Crocs. $50 Crocs. I remember when they were $8 and ugly. Now they’re $50 and still as hideous.

*Duncanville finally de-fanged its Houston nemesis and Dallas County schools went 3 for 3 in last weekend’s high school football state championships in Arlington. The Panthers Desoto and South Oak Cliff all won titles in their divisions. Amazingly the three schools are separated by less than 15 miles.

*How much does Cowboys owner Jerry Jones love Christmas? This much: “I have lights everywhere I can fit ’em and I’ve been known to leave ’em up past Valentine’s.”

*Hot.

*Not.

*When I was a kid the Pro Bowl mattered. Couldn’t wait to see how many Cowboys made it. But in this era of endless stats-driven grades Madden ratings and Top 100 player lists it’s downshifted to a sideshow afterthought. It’s a convoluted voting system and the actual game is being replaced by something called the Pro Bowl Games featuring skills competitions. If the Pro Bowl was a horse we’d shoot it to put it out of its misery.

*Forget Winter Storm “Elliott” Texans are bracing for a rare event that will deal an even more severe blow to their holiday spirits. Liquor stores closed?! For 61 consecutive hours??!! Twice in two weeks???!!! Beer and wine sales are a go 24/7. But liquor in Texas – thanks silly Prohibition leftovers – is a different animal. Can’t buy it on Sundays or major holidays such as sure enough Christmas and New Year’s Day. Here’s the double whammy: When those holidays like this year fall on a Sunday sales are also banned the following Monday. Bottom line: Texas liquor stores will close at 9 p.m. Saturday and not re-open until Tuesday at 10 a.m. Same routine for Dec. 31 through Jan. 3. Binge-buy accordingly.

*Four Mavs are candidates for the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2023: Dirk Nowitzki Michael Finley Shawn Marion and Dick Motta. Dirk will get in. Motta should but won’t.

*I have a friend. Let’s call her um “lucky.” On Dec. 22 2021 she got COVID and had to inform her family who was en route to her house. Thursday was Dec. 22 2022 and guess who tested positive for COVID? Should we tell her family or make her do it again?

*In August 2001 the Rangers offered slugger Joey Gallo a five-year $100 million contract that he turned down. Last week he signed with the Minnesota Twins: one year $11 million. Ouch.

*A year ago on Christmas it was 84 degrees. For some strange reason I felt moved to keep a receipt.

*I live nearby and often have to navigate the dicey Highway 121/Preston Road intersection where Cowboys’ linebacker Sam Williams was involved in an accident Thursday. Williams was taken to the hospital but is apparently okay. Lots of speed and ego squeezed into that mesh-point. Tread lightly.

*Hey people who just couldn’t wait for “sweater weather” and the leaves to turn and pumpkin-flavored everything in the Fall these single-digit temps are your fault. Hope you’re happy. And freezing.

*Next Thursday is a sports version of a partial eclipse when – for the first time I can remember – the Cowboys (at the Tennessee Titans) and Texas Longhorns (vs. Washington in The Alamo Bowl) play at the same time. Why isn’t picture-in-picture still a thing?

*Merry Christmas! No Santa Claus ain’t real. But his “spirit” is as tangible as ever.

*This Weekend? Friday let’s get festive with friends old and new. Saturday let’s visit the parents in JoCo MoFo while keeping an eye on Cowboys-Eagles. Sunday let’s have a traditional Thanksgiving meal on Christmas because why not? As always don’t be a stranger.

The year 2005 was the year of “biopics.” Exactly half of all domestic feature films which received a Golden Globe nomination that year were biographical pictures. And the two Best Actor awards went to men who portrayed historical figures: in the drama category Leonardo DiCaprio for his role as Howard HughesJamie Foxx for his portrayal of R&B giant Ray Charles.



Since the earliest days of cinema the subgenre of biopics was enormously attractive. Audiences saw countless films about kings and other rulers such as Henry VIII Julius Cesar Winston Churchill Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin as well as queens mostly named Victoria and Elisabeth. Viewers followed the lives of artists like Mozart Michelangelo or Vincent van Gogh and of men and women with extraordinary achievements from the worlds of sports science or exploration.

Film historian Dennis Bingham in his 1995 book “Whose Lives Are They Anyway?” explains the reason for the popularity: “The biopic is a genuine dynamic genre and an important one — it narrates exhibits and celebrates a subject’s life and demonstrates investigates or questions his or her importance in the world.”

He concludes with the main reason for our attraction to observe the lives of others: “Ultimately (the biopic) provides a medium for both artist and spectator to discover what it would be like to be that person.”



That is certainly the case with the nominated movies of 2005. There is the evening’s big winner Martin Scorsese’s Aviator depicting the early years of legendary aviator and director Howard Hughes. The film received five nominations notching wins for Best Film – Drama and Best Original Score to go alongside DiCaprio’s victory.



Then there is Bill Condon’s drama Kinsey. Liam Neeson portrayed Alfred Kinsey who caused a monumental stir by investigating the elusive mystery of human sexuality. Neeson got a nomination for his role as did Laura Linney in her role as Kinsey’s free-spirited wife (one of a total of eight Golden Globe nominations for Linney over the years).

Director Marc Foster’s Finding Neverland starring Johnny Depp as writer J. M. Barrie focused on his inspirations in the creation of the character Peter Pan himself the subject of many films. Hotel Rwanda retold the gripping experience of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina during the horrific struggle against the Hutu militia in Rwanda. Don Cheadle received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance.

And finally director Taylor Hackford’s music-filled Ray tackled the life story of Ray Charles from his poor childhood and coping with blindness at a young age to his herculean efforts to overcome his loss of eyesight and his growing success even amid his mounting drug use. It was a masterstroke turn for Foxx who could bring his own musical chops as a singer and pianist into the role. For his efforts he was awarded the Golden Globe in the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy category.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy8yNTc5MDg5LzAvZW4vYXRhaS1MaWZlLVNjaWVuY2VzLUFubm91bmNlcy1SZXN1bHRzLWZyb20tdGhlLUt1cmVzLVRoZXJhcGV1dGljcy1QaGFzZS0xLVRyaWFsLW9mLUtVUi0xMDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,atai Life Sciences Announces Results from the Kures Therapeutics Phase 1 Trial of KUR-101,"- This two-part phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers was designed to assess the safety pharmacokinetics and analgesic activity of KUR-101



- KUR-101 was well tolerated and demonstrated analgesic activity in two experimental pain models

- An assessment of the respiratory impact of KUR-101 was inconclusive as the positive control oxycodone failed to separate from placebo

- KUR-101 a deuterated derivative of mitragynine is a low-potency partial mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist designed to produce therapeutic effects without clinically significant respiratory depression

NEW YORK and BERLIN Dec. 23 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- atai Life Sciences N.V. (Nasdaq: ATAI) (“atai” or “the Company”) a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to transform the treatment of mental health disorders today announced additional clinical data from the Kures Therapeutics Phase 1 trial of KUR-101 in healthy volunteers. This two-part trial was designed to assess the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and analgesic activity of KUR-101.

Part 1 consisted of a double-blind randomized 5-cohort single-ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and analgesic activity of a single oral dose of KUR-101 (10mg 20mg 40mg 60mg 90mg) in a total of 42 healthy volunteers. Analgesic activity was assessed by the cold pressor test (CPT) and impact on respiration was evaluated by measuring respiration rate at multiple time points. As previously reported KUR-101 was well tolerated and produced dose-dependent analgesic activity without clinically significant effects on respiration at any dose-level tested including at the 90mg dose level selected for the Part 2 comparator study.

Part 2 consisted of a randomized double-blind crossover study to evaluate the safety and analgesic activity of KUR-101 compared to both oxycodone and placebo. 18 healthy volunteers were enrolled and randomized into one of three sequences (6 subjects each). Each subject received single oral doses of KUR-101 (90mg) oxycodone (20mg) and placebo separated by a 7-day washout. Analgesic activity was measured by both CPT and thermal testing. Respiratory rate was assessed at multiple time points.

Results from part 2 showed that a single dose of 90mg of KUR-101 was generally well tolerated and was observed to produce analgesic effects on CPT comparable to those seen in Part 1 of this trial. The analgesic effects of KUR-101 were less than those seen with oxycodone on both CPT and thermal testing. Further both KUR-101 and oxycodone demonstrated effects on respiration comparable to placebo thus precluding definitive conclusions of KUR-101’s respiratory impact.

“We are pleased that KUR-101 was both well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity in healthy volunteers. As the data comparing the respiratory effects of KUR-101 to both oxycodone and placebo are inconclusive at this stage additional research will be needed to further characterize the therapeutic potential of KUR-101” said Florian Brand CEO and Co-Founder of atai.

Current OUD therapies like buprenorphine methadone and naltrexone show limited efficacy for many patients and come with inconvenient treatment regimens side effects and barriers to access due to abuse liability. In contrast KUR-101 is an atypical opioid receptor modulator with a unique pharmacology that may make it safer for chronic use. Its deuteration improves its pharmacokinetic and overall safety profile while reducing dosing requirements.

Earlier this week Santos was revealed to have lied about working at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as well as attending New York University and CUNY Baruch College.

A follow-up New York Times report now details that Santos was in fact working at a DISH Satellite call center in the College Point section of Queens living with roommates and struggling to pay his bills.

Meanwhile a colleague who used to work with Santos at a hotel chain told DailyMail.com that the congressman wrote a bad check to Conway Funeral Home in Jackson Heights to pay for his mother's funeral in 2016.

Other accusations have emerged against Santos such as allegedly lying about his family's history. Santos had previously said that his Jewish maternal grandparents escaped the Holocaust by moving to Brazil. Records show that his maternal grandparents were Brazilian-born Catholics.

More accusations about incumbent congressman George Santos' past have emerged here he's pictured on the campaign trail in Glen Cove New York

The 'openly gay' Santos who lives in Long Island with his fiancé was also revealed to have been secretly married to a woman named Uadla between 2012 and 2019.

The Donald Trump-supporting politician won a historic victory on November 8 when he became the first openly gay non incumbent Republican elected to Congress.

He defeated Robert Zimmerman an openly gay longtime left-wing operative for outgoing Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi's seat in New York's 3rd Congressional District.

In response to the various inaccuracies in his biography Santos tweeted: 'To the people of #NY03 I have my story to tell and it will be told next week. I want to assure everyone that I will address your questions and that I remain committed to deliver the results I campaigned on; Public safety Inflation Education & more.'

Santos' mother Fátima Devolder died in 2016. The congressman has claimed that she was an executive working in the South Tower on 9/11

A new report says that at the time Santos said he was working at Goldman Sachs he was actually working at a call center in Queens for $15 an hour

The DISH Network call center in College Point Queens were Santos answered customer calls in Portuguese and English for $15 an hour between 2011 and 2012

A colleague of Santos' told the Times that the soon-to-be-congressman worked at the call center between 2011 and 2012 for around $15 an hour taking calls in both English and Portuguese. He's the son of Brazilian immigrants.

His roommate at the time Gregory Morey-Parker told the Times that Santos would tell outlandish tales about his family having property in Nantucket while his mother worked as a housekeeper.

Another former friend Peter Hamilton said that he met Santos in 2014 and lent him money so that the Republican could move into a home with his boyfriend.

When that loan wasn't repaid Hamilton took Santos to small claims court where a judge ordered the Queens-native to pay up $5000 plus interest.

That same year a landlord in Queens took Santos his sister and mother to court over three months of unpaid rent which resulted in the trio being evicted.

Hamilton told the Times: 'I have regrets that I didn’t come forward before the actual election. At this point it’s like he’s defrauding the public.'

Public records however show that he was previously married to a woman named Uadla Vieira a native of Brazil until 2019

George Santos (left) shakes the hand of Rudy Giuliani (right). The New York Times found out Santos may have lied about where he went to school and working for big financial institutions like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs

On Monday night Santos' lawyer Joseph Murray put out a statement attacking The New York Times for 'launch[ing] this shotgun blast of attacks'

In 2015 another landlord took Santos to court over $2250 unpaid rent. The same thing happened in 2017 with a different landlord who ordered the future representative to fork over $12000.

It wasn't just landlords who had an issue Discover Card won a judgement over Santos in 2018 to the tune of $1027.45.

DailyMail.com's source said of Santos' mother's funeral: 'When his mother passed away he gave a fraudulent check to the funeral home.'

Santos told the church that his family could not afford the funeral for his mother Fatima Devolder. A collection was held at the church with the priest telling CBS that the money collected was 'significant.'

DailyMail.com has also discovered a GoFundMe page that Santos set up to help to pay for his mother's funeral in 2016.

The page raised $1850 of a $10000 goal. On that profile he wrote that he and his sister were not working at the time of her death because she needed 24 hour care.

On his campaign website it reads: 'George's work ethic comes from his mother who came from nothing but worked her way up to be the first female executive at a major financial institution. On September 11 2001 George's mother was in her office in the South Tower. She survived the horrific events of that day but unfortunately passed away a few years later.'

New York state Attorney General Letitia James' office is 'looking into' Santos now DailyMail.com has learned

New York Attorney General Letitia James' office has said that they are 'looking into' Santos' finances.

The AG's office did not specify whether the New York Times story triggered the review nor did it say whether a full investigation was being launched.

Santos' lawyer Joe Murray did not have a response for DailyMail.com and said he has not been contacted by the New York State Attorney General's office.

Santos previously billed himself as a 'walking contradiction' for being a non-white LGBTQ Republican.

He's used his identity to hammer Democrats for their own identity politics.

He previously claimed to DailyMail.com in August that he's been all but excommunicated from the Big Apple's LGBTQ crowd.

'We've been scorned exposed I mean I don't even know what word to use. But we're persona non grata in the gay community in New York City' Santos said at the time.

But earlier this week his identity was put under serious scrutiny as more and more holes began to pop up in his background story.

Santos suggested he'd respond to the mounting claims within a matter of days.

'To the people of #NY03 I have my story to tell and it will be told next week' the Rep.-elect wrote on Twitter.

An earlier statement by his lawyer reacting to the Times' story called it a 'shotgun blast of attacks' against Santos.

Santos' fellow future members of the New York congressional delegation were among the first to cry foul over his apparently misrepresented credentials.

Incoming Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called Santos 'woefully unqualified.'

Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) wrote on Twitter: 'Looks like far-right Republican George Santos who fabricated his whole political identity may have even lied about his sexuality. I may be the only actual openly gay member of Congress in New York in the New Year.'

And progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) representing parts of Queens and the Bronx raised questions about Santos' timeframe for his rebuttal set for next week.

'Why do you need a full week to confirm if you live where you said you did worked where you said you did went to school where you said you did…?' Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvYnVzaW5lc3Mvd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtYm9udXNlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Many Wall Street Bankers This Year's Bonus Season Is a Bust (Published 2022),"The luxury travel bookings will be more subdued this year as will the purchases of $200000 Aston Martins and vacation homes. Splurges on expensive bottles of wine and jewelry will be less spontaneous. For many bankers it might not be the most wonderful time of the year.

Annual bonuses — one of the most hotly anticipated numbers on Wall Street — are expected to be down as much as 50 percent this year as investment banks grapple with declining revenues following a sharp drop in their main businesses of lending mergers and acquisitions advisory and initial public offerings. With a possible recession in the offing next year might not look much better.

In a recent management committee meeting David Solomon the chief executive of Goldman Sachs told executives to brace for a steep drop in bonuses a possible recession and a continued slowdown in banking activity that could last through at least the second half of 2023 according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.

The two top executives at Jefferies Group another investment bank warned employees to expect a drop in pay. “This is going to be a more difficult compensation season at Jefferies just like it will be for every firm in our industry” the bank’s chief executive Richard Handler and president Brian Friedman wrote in a memo."

On Friday night Indiana Pacers (17-16) point guard Tyrese Haliburton had a sensational performance in their 111-108 win over the Miami Heat (16-17) in Florida.

The 22-year-old had 43 points two rebounds seven assists one steal one block and hit the game-winning shot.

Haliburton is averaging 20.7 points 3.9 rebounds 10.5 assists and 1.7 steals per contest in 27 games.

After spending part of two seasons with the Sacramento Kings he was traded to the Pacers in the deal that landed the Kings two-time NBA All-Star Domantas Sabonis last season.

In his first full season with the Pacers he looks like a lock to make the 2023 NBA All-Star Game.

Yet what's even more fascinating is that the Phoenix Suns could have drafted him.

How?

The Suns had been coming off ten straight seasons of not making the NBA Playoffs and they had the tenth-overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft.

Two days before the draft they made an incredible trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder that landed them future Hall of Famer Chris Paul.

Trading for Paul was not a mistake.

It can be seen as one of the best trades of the decade considering he helped lead them to the NBA Finals and end their ten-year playoff drought in his first season with the franchise.

The mistake was that they could have also drafted Haliburton in addition to having Paul.

With the tenth pick the Suns selected Jalen Smith out of Maryland (Haliburton was drafted 12th overall).

Over a season and a half Smith played in 56 regular season games for the Suns and averaged 4.1 points and 3.1 rebounds per contest (he also played in six NBA Playoff games for them).

Ironically Smith is now teammates with Haliburton on the Pacers (he was traded there last season in a deal that landed the Suns with Torrey Craig).

Yes the Suns had just traded for Paul so they did not need to draft a point guard but at the same time they could have taken Haliburton to be the backup.

Paul is 37 so it's not like he will be with the franchise for another five years.

Having Haliburton on the roster to pair with All-Star shooting guard Devin Booker one day could have made for an exciting duo.",,,,,,,,,

The Bissell compound's historic marker. (Tim Jensen/Patch )

SOUTH WINDSOR CT — To get to the latest Hidden Gem one must head down a hill to a secluded spot along banks of the Connecticut River in South Windsor and then go back in time.

At the end of Ferry Lane — No. 315 for those keeping score at home — sits the oldest house in South Windsor and an old ferry landing. John Bissell was the town's first settler and built his original home on the property in 1662. He operated a tavern in the house and maintained the adjacent ferry which took folks across and back from South Windsor to Windsor.

The military took over the building during King Philip’s War in 1667 and the original structure no longer exists. The house standing on the parcel today was built in 1786 and was also used as a tavern. The town of South Windsor acquired the property including some abutting farmland in 1850 and the farm was maintained by impoverished residents.

The town doubled the size of the building adding a pair of jail cells in the rear. According to town property records the building currently consists of 20 rooms including eight bedrooms and encompasses 4208 square feet.

The Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority or MIRA waste-to-energy facility in Hartford closed in July. Now more 860000 tons of Connecticut trash is shipped out-of-state.

Shipping trash is expensive and unacceptable said Norm Needleman the Senate chair of the Energy and Technology Committee.

Policy makers have concerns about the environmental impact and commercial viability of trash burning facilities located in low-income communities.

“Without some stability in pricing I think this business becomes questionable on all fronts and then we are left with shipping garbage out of state. And I think that’s the least desirable option right now.” Needleman said to members of the Public Utility Regulatory Authority.

The authority is drafting recommendations aimed at the trash-to-energy industry for lawmakers to consider next year.

If you’re like us and are currently without this licensed unlicensed nuclear accelerator today’s feature is for you as German franchise group Ghostbusters Ruhrgebiet has provided an excellent overview and unboxing of the Proton Pack along with the various pack-in accessories.





As shown Hasbro kept assembly to a minimum with only a few items needing to be connected among them being the ion arm cap and the hose connection for the Neutrona Wand. To make it more screen accurate there’s also the option to attach an ALICE LC-1 frame with all mounting hardware included.

One small surprise accessory came with the unadvertised inclusion of an orange cap for the G1 releases of the Plasma Series Spengler’s Neutrona Wand. Initially cast in silver plastic the wand’s original tip is now considered a safety concern with Hasbro citing that the release of the Proton Pack changes the wand “from collector item to roleplay item” and the pack-in will “allow people to use the Neutrona Wand freely in cosplay and public environments like comic conventions.”

One criticism the pack has received is the rumble motor with heard Ghostbusters Ruhrgebiet comparing the noise to a mooing cow. Hasbro has made the vibration effect optional so if you find that it’s a bit too loud it can luckily be turned off from a switch found within the cyclotron.

We hope to soon showcase a video overview of an ALICE LC-1 frame being attached so if you haven’t done so already be sure to subscribe to the Ghostbusters News YouTube channel for upcoming coverage.

The host of Warrior Hearts has made a donation of toys in the name of her show and in conjunction with Hasbro Toys. Alongside Francis X. Suarez the mayor or Miami Denegri made the donation to a Miami foundation that provides treatment care and support to child victims of sexual abuse and trafficking

Natalia Denegri host of Warrior Hearts has once again joined forces with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez to bring a Christmas surprise to Kristi House a foundation that provides treatment care - as well as legal medical and emotional support - to children and young adults who have been victims of sexual abuse and human trafficking.

The event was held on Wednesday Dec. 21 at the foundation's headquarters in Miami Florida. Denegri whose MegaTV children's program Warrior Hearts focuses on solidarity and social causes and who recently won 4 Emmy awards - adding to the 26 she already has - is also the spokesperson for Hasbro Toys and donated hundreds of toys to the foundation spreading joy to the children there before this holiday season. She was on hand to pass out the toys personally along with her eight-year-old daughter Nicole who was surprised to receive a diploma from the Mayor recognizing her solidarity to the city. ""I give you this because I am very proud of how you represent our city. Thank you!"" said Suarez as cameras captured the moment he bestowed the young girl with the award.

""You cannot put a price on a smile especially the smile of those kids who've endured the worst traumas a person could endure [...] The fact that an organization like Kristi House is working to protect and help these kids will undoubtedly affect the future of our society in a positive way [...]. I thank Hasbro Toys and Natalia Denegri for this donation and for always collaborating with the City of Miami through various charitable initiatives"" Suarez added at the press conference to kick off the event in which each child received a Christmas present of their own.

""It's my honor to collaborate with Mayor Suarez to continue to help children throughout our city. Miami has been my home for more than ten years and it is where I formed my family. Helping the kids who need it the most is my way of giving back to the city that has given me so much. The work that Kristi House does to support sexually abused kids during the entire legal process as well as in their adaptation back into society along with their families is amazing. I am proud to be part of this event and to bring a smile to the faces of these incredible kids this Christmas. Representing my show Warrior Hearts and Hasbro Toys I know we share the same objective: to spread light where there is darkness"" attested Denegri.

During the space race while other food companies like Baskin-Robbins celebrated lunar landings back on Earth Hershey's actually got in on the fun and went out of this world. It's unlikely that Milton Hershey founder of the company — per Encyclopedia Britannica – had imagined such a thing when he first started his business in 1894.

Nevertheless Hershey's had a meteoric rise. By the turn of the previous century the candy brand was selling its now iconic milk chocolate bar and just seven years later in 1907 little Hershey's Kisses were reaching people's lips as well. Around this same time the Hershey factory opened going on to become the biggest chocolate-manufacturing plant across the globe also spawning its very own community around itself.

In the new millennium Hershey's has become an icon in its field. It owns several other candy brands like Jolly Ranchers Milk Duds Reese's Twizzlers and Whoppers. There are even Hershey's museums memorializing the venture's legacy. Multiple billions of dollars in sales are now generated by Hershey's every year. Between those humble beginnings and its contemporary domination of the sweet treat industry Hershey's also made an astronomical amount of history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3Qtc3RvcmUtYm91Z2h0LWhvdC1jb2NvYS1yZXZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Store-Bought Hot Cocoa Brand Is the Best Review,"I had a small microwave mishap but it didn't affect the hot cocoa's flavor.

Based on the novel by Iris Rainer Dart 1988 comedy-drama Beaches is one of the most beloved tear-jerkers of all time and a key entry on the résumés of lead actresses Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey.

Centred on childhood friends who take very different paths in adulthood but never lose their bond it’s never advisable to watch it without a dry handkerchief on standby. Here are some facts about Beaches that you might not have known.

25. Mayim Bialik didn’t get to do her own singing

Getting to play C.C. in Beaches was a big break for young actress Mayim Bialik. Aged only 11 at the time Bialik had the advantage of looking a lot like her adult counterpart Bette Midler and similar to Midler Bialik was also a triple threat: an actress a dancer and a singer.

Unfortunately for Bialik her singing voice proved to be a bit of a sticking point. The young actress’s singing voice was deemed too far removed from that of Midler so all her vocals were overdubbed. Nonetheless the film proved a great launchpad for Bialik who would later enjoy small screen success in The Big Bang Theory.

24. The film’s director makes a cameo (kind of)

At one point during Beaches we see a poster for an upcoming production entitled Sizzle 76. On the poster it states that it’s a Garry Marshall production; Marshall being the director of Beaches. Prior to his film career Marshall was best known for creating the beloved 50s nostalgia sitcom Happy Days.

After Beaches Marshall enjoyed his biggest movie success with the celebrated rom-com Pretty Woman. Marshall later went on to direct such hits as Runaway Bride and The Princess Diaries. Sadly Marshall passed away in 2016 at the age of 71 following complications after a stroke.

23. Lainie Kazan only accepted the role for the chance to work with Bette Midler

Actress Lainie Kazan who has since become better known for the My Big Fat Greek Wedding movies co-stars in Beaches as Leona Bloom. Kazan has a long history of stage work on Broadway and elsewhere and made her film debut two decades before Beaches in 1968. However initially the American actress was not interested in taking the role of C.C.’s mother Leona.

There was one key thing that changed Kazan’s mind: the fact that Bette Midler was playing C.C. With that knowledge Kazan happily accepted the part as she was eager to work with Midler. This was despite the fact that Kazan was in one key respect an unlikely choice for the part…

22. There wasn’t much difference in age between Kazan and Midler

Lainie Kazan was born in May 1940 which means she was 48 when Beaches opened in December 1988. Meanwhile her screen daughter Bette Midler was born in December 1945 making her 43 at the time of the film’s release. You don’t need to be a skilled mathematician to note that this is an age gap of only five years.

This being the case Kazan and Midler were an unlikely cast for mother and daughter – but they made it work regardless. In any case this is hardly the only time that a movie has cast actors of comparable age as parent and child. Take TV’s The Golden Girls in which Bea Arthur is actually older than her screen mother Estelle Getty.

21. Barbara Hershey underwent a cosmetic procedure to prepare for the role

Beaches is set over the course of 30 years following friends C.C. and Hillary from childhood to adulthood. For the scenes in which the characters are youngest Mayim Bialik and Marcie Leeds played C.C. and Hillary. Later on in the film however Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey simply play their younger selves.

Hershey who was 40 at the time went to perhaps unexpected lengths to get a more youthful appearance. The actress underwent collagen lip injections specifically for the scenes in the movies when she plays Hillary in her 20s. Reportedly the whole cast was shocked when Hershey rocked up with new lips but soon grew used to her new look.

20. Sets from another Midler film were reused in Beaches

As well as playing the lead role Bette Midler was also one of Beaches’ producers. Therefore it makes sense that the movie also re-uses some sets from an earlier Midler movie. Earlier in 1988 Midler starred alongside Lily Tomlin as two sets of twins in the comedy Big Business.

As production on the two films was close together they wound up holding screen tests with Barbara Hershey on the Big Business set. On top of that a key set from Big Business also winds up appearing in Beaches too. This is the department store set where C.C. and Hillary famously fight.

19. A cut storyline revealed CC’s husband was a paedophile

Not everything from the Beaches book made it onto the big screen. One particularly sensitive story thread from Iris Rainer Dart’s 1985 novel was left out of the movie. The plotline in question involves the character of John Pierce husband of Midler’s C.C.

The filmmakers opted to omit the novel’s shocking revelation that John played by actor John Heard was a paedophile. This would doubtless be a relief to many viewers who know and love Heard for his role in the Home Alone movies and also ensured that the tone remained sad and sentimental rather than truly dark.

18. Shelley Winters turned down the role of CC’s mother

Given that she was just a mere five years older than Bette Midler Lanie Kazan wasn’t the most obvious choice to play C.C.’s mother. However Kazan was not the only actress under consideration for the part. Another person in the running was long-standing Hollywood mainstay Shelley Winters.

With a career dating back to the early 1940s Winters was 68 at the time so considerably more age-appropriate for Leona. However Winters turned the part down over concerns that she would fail the insurance exams needed to appear in the movie. Winters would go on to appear in several more films before passing away in January 2006 aged 85.

17. One trailer for the film was guilty of false advertising

The theatrical trailer for Beaches promoted the film off the back of its leading ladies. And yet whoever edited the trailer was either being liberal with the truth or didn’t know much about the film’s two stars. Midway through that distinctive 80s movie trailer narrator guy tells us that Beaches stars “Academy Award nominees” Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey.

Midler was indeed a one-time Oscar nominee having been up for Best Actress in 1980 for The Rose. Hershey however had not been Oscar-nominated at the time making this a big fat lie. Still Hershey would later get a nod from the Academy in 1997 for The Portrait of a Lady. By then Midler had already earned her second nomination for 1991’s For the Boys.

16. The film was almost called Remember Me

Sometimes a movie title proves so iconic that it’s hard to imagine they ever considered calling it anything else. There are some extreme examples such as when Back to the Future was almost renamed Spaceman From Pluto. In the case of Beaches the alternate title they almost went with is not nearly so outlandish.

For some time the film was set to be released under the title Remember Me. This would have made sense given the terminal illness storyline but it also might have been a bit of a spoiler. Ultimately the filmmakers decided against this and kept the original title from Iris Rainer Dart’s novel in order to ensure fans of the book knew to watch it.

15. Mayim Bialik and Marcie Leeds made a spoof remake as adults

After playing young C.C. actress Mayim Bialik went on to enjoy a long and successful career as an actress not to mention gaining impressive credentials in the world of academia. Marcie Leeds meanwhile went from Beaches to a recurring role in late 80s fantasy drama Beauty and the Beast. By the early 90s however Leeds gave up acting and went on to medical school ultimately becoming a surgeon.

Both women have gone on to achieve great things in both the entertainment world and the world of science – but neither of them have forgotten Beaches. The two reunited in August 2016 shortly after the death of director Garry Marshall to honour his memory by re-enacting their scenes from the movie.

14. There was meant to be a sequel

As you might expect the success of Beaches the movie also boosted sales of the original novel. Inspired by this interest author Iris Rainer Dart penned a follow-up novel a few years later. Beaches II: I’ll Be There was first published in 1991 and followed C.C. in her new role as a surrogate mother to Hillary’s daughter.

Originally there had been plans for this novel to also be adapted for the screen as a TV movie. However Midler was not poised to return as C.C. with the role instead earmarked for Barbara Eden from TV’s I Dream of Jeannie. For reasons that are unknown this adaptation of Beaches II: I’ll Be There never wound up being made.

13. It received terrible reviews

Earning $57 million off a $20 million budget Beaches was a modest box office success. However whatever success the comedy-drama enjoyed was in no way down to the reviews it received. On release the critics were almost unanimous in their disdain for director Garry Marshall’s tear-jerker.

Many reviews blasted the film as being sentimental and contrived with its emotional moments feeling ‘unearned.’ Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times said it was “shamelessly manipulative” whilst Gene Siskel called it “too mechanical.” None of this stopped the film from accruing an enthusiastic following particularly once it hit home video and television.

12. The theme song was a huge hit

Like many well-loved films of the 80s one of the most memorable elements of Beaches is its iconic theme song. The film features Bette Midler performing the suitably emotional ballad Wind Beneath My Wings. Although the song is now synonymous with Beaches and Midler you might not know it was written several years earlier.

Wind Beneath My Wings was written by Jeff Silbar and Larry Henley in 1982 and had been recorded by a number of other artists beforehand. Midler’s recording was a number one hit single and won the Grammy awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. It has since been re-recorded many more times and has become one of the most frequently played songs at funerals.

11. There is a stage musical version

It’s become increasingly common in recent years for hit movies to be adapted into stage musicals. Beaches as Barbara Hershey herself noted was a “natural” choice for such an adaptation given the role music plays in the story. So it was that in 2014 Beaches: the Musical premiered at the Signature Theatre in Arlington Virginia.

The show was adapted from Iris Rainer Dart’s novel by playwright Thom Thomas and composer David Austin. After opening in Virginia the show played in Illinois in 2015 and has been poised to reach both Broadway and London’s West End. To date however the Beaches musical has yet to be performed in either location.

10. The song about Otto Titsling was written by Bette Midler

Wind Beneath My Wings was not an original Bette Midler composition – but Beaches features one song that is. The track in question is the somewhat less emotional and considerably more ribald Otto Titsling. This vulgar comedy number is based on a popular urban legend about the invention of the bra.

The story is of course completely false and was invented by British humorist Wallace Reyburn in 1971. Bette Midler co-wrote the track herself in collaboration with Jerry Blatt and Charlene Seeger. It was first recorded on Midler’s 1985 live stand-up comedy album Mud Will Be Flung Tonight!

9. The film foretold the future

It’s not hard to note just how much common ground the character of C.C. Bloom shares with Bette Midler herself. Both women are larger-than-life multi-talented performers who are most in their element on the stage. In one scene C.C. and the doorman at her apartment building talk longingly about winning a Tony Award.

For those who don’t know the Tonys are basically the Broadway equivalent of the Oscars. As it happens Midler had in real life already won a Tony having been given a special award in 1974. However Midler would later go on to win another Tony being named Best Actress in a Musical for her 2017 production of Hello Dolly!

8. Medical knowledge has come a long way since the movie first aired

The emotional final act of Beaches sees Barbara Hershey’s Hillary meet a tragic demise from a terminal illness. We’re told her character is suffering from a medical disorder known as viral cardiomyopathy which makes sense because when Beaches was first released this was indeed a terminal condition with no effective treatment.

Happily advances in medical science in the years since have significantly helped people suffering from the condition. Since 2005 thousands of people afflicted with viral cardiomyopathy have had their lives saved as the use of beta-blockers and implantable cardio defibrillators can help alleviate symptoms and increase life expectancy.

7. The cottage is now a Beaches museum

Near the end of the film when Midler visits the dying Barbara Hershey we are introduced to cottage number 13. This is a real location in Crystal Cove State Park in California and it still stands today. We can also see this very same eye-catching location on the Beaches movie poster and video cover art.

The cottage quickly became famous for its association with Beaches which has since been capitalised on. Today the building is officially known as Cottage #13: The Beaches Film and Media Center. It has become a museum dedicated to the movie and regularly attracts visits from fans.

6. It wouldn’t be the last time Bette Midler and director Gary Marshall would work together

Beaches would not be the last time that Bette Midler and director Garry Marshall would work together on a film. Six years later the duo reunited on a very different movie. The movie in question was Midler’s 1994 Halloween-set family comedy adventure Hocus Pocus.

Midler played one-third of the wicked witch sisters the Sandersons alongside Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy. Garry Marshall didn’t direct Hocus Pocus that duty fell to Kenny Ortega but he did make a memorable cameo appearance. Marshall plays the middle-aged man dressed up as the Devil for Halloween in an uncredited role. Somewhat oddly his wife is played by his real-life sister Penny Marshall.

5. The character C.C. Bloom was actually based on Midler

We’ve already said that the character of C.C. Bloom bears a striking resemblance to real-life Bette Midler. It probably shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise then that the role was written with Midler in mind. Mary Agnes Donoghue wrote the screenplay adaptation of Iris Rainer Dart’s novel envisaging Midler as C.C right from the beginning.

Beaches was Donoghue’s second credit as a screenwriter and she followed it with 1991’s Paradise which she also directed. Donoghue went on to write the screenplays for Deceived White Oleander and Veronica Guerin. She also wrote the stage play Me and Mamie O’Rourke which was performed in London’s West End by Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.

4. It was a breakthrough role for Mayim Bialik

Credit: @missmayim Mayim Bialik Twitter

For younger versions of C.C. the producers were looking for a sassy redhead. Mayim Bialik although a brunette was perfect for the role. She was cast as the part when she was just 11 after four long months of auditions. Her physical resemblance to Bette Midler was key to her casting although reportedly Midler herself didn’t think Bialik looked like her.

Although Beaches didn’t get great reviews Bialik earned a lot of praise with Variety calling her ‘extraordinary’. Three years later Bialik landed the lead role in hit sitcom Blossom which established her as a big star. After Blossom she stepped away from acting to study neuroscience but she later returned to TV as Amy on The Big Bang Theory.

3. The whole crew cried at Barbara Hershey’s death scene

Today the mere mention of the title Beaches is synonymous with the terms ‘weepie’ and ‘tear-jerker.’ This is because of the film’s tragic emotional climax and its knack for reducing viewers to blubbering wrecks. It turns out this wasn’t only true for viewers of the movie but also for those making it.

On the day they shot Hillary’s death scene Barbara Hershey recalls “When it finished and I opened my eyes the whole crew was crying.” In an amusing twist it just so happened that this was a day on which Hershey had brought her teenage son along to watch her work. On seeing all these tearful faces Hershey says her child “basically thought everyone had lost their minds.”

2. The film made the Disney executive cry

Making regular viewers and crew members cry is one thing but studio executives are another breed entirely. Such high-ranking film industry figures are infamous for their cut-throat attitudes and emotional detachment. This means that filmmakers are often wary of dealing with executives given the power they wield to make-or-break careers.

When the finished cut of Beaches was ready to screen for the top brass at Disney to see it nerves ran high. It turns out they needn’t have worried because even those hardened studio figures proved susceptible to the emotional power of Beaches.

1. It was remade for TV in 2017 with Idina Menzel and Nia Long

You might not have known it but Beaches is yet another 80s classic that has since been remade. A new version of Iris Rainer Dart’s story was produced as a TV movie in 2017. As C.C. Bloom the film cast Frozen and Wicked actress Idina Menzel a fitting choice given her Broadway musical credentials and similar career trajectory to Bette Midler.

Meanwhile the role of Hillary was taken by Nia Long with co-stars including Antonio Cupo and Colin Lawrence. Directed by Allison Anders for TV network Lifetime the Beaches remake was met with a largely negative response.",,,,,,

News reports say cold weather has shut down several U.S. oil refineries causing crude prices to spike.

LyondellBasell Industries shutdown the large crude distillation unit and two hydrotreaters on Friday at its 268000-barrel-per-day Houston refinery due to extreme cold and the winter storm impacting much of the U.S. and Gulf Coast Reuters reported citing sources.

The global chemical company says Houston Refining is one of the largest refineries in the U.S. designed to process heavy-sulfur crude oil.

Data compiled by the U.S. National Weather Service showed temperatures in Houston fell 45 degrees on Thursday from a high of 63 degrees Fahrenheit to a low of 18 degrees Fahrenheit.

BRUTAL WINTER STORM KNOCKS OUT POWER FOR OVER A MILLION AMERICANS

A spokesperson for the Houston-based refinery told FOX News on Friday ""Our LyondellBasell U.S. Gulf Coast sites continue to conduct detailed assessments stemming from Winter Storm Elliott but for competitive reasons we do not provide specific details about units their operational status production figures or supply.""

""Our focus remains on ensuring the health and safety of our people and the communities where we operate. We may need to conduct some flaring to ensure safe operations"" the spokesperson continued. ""Flares are a safety feature designed to burn excess material resulting from certain routine operations as well as some non-routine situations such as power loss or equipment failure.""

""We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our community neighbors.""

Guyana was issued 33.47 million forest carbon credits for preventing and reducing deforestation and forest degradation in the period 2016-2020. The credits have been verified by a third-party against ART’s robust environmental and social requirements. The announcement marks an important step for how tropical forest countries can sell high-integrity carbon credits for preventing and reducing deforestation and forest degradation.

“I congratulate Guyana on being the first country to issue forest carbon credits certified by ART paving the way for many others to come. This marks a breakthrough for the emergence of a high-quality global carbon market to protect tropical forests” said Espen Barth-Eide Norway’s Minister of Climate and Environment in a statement. Guyana is the first country to conclude the ART process out of 15 jurisdictions that have so far entered the ART pipeline.

Norway and Guyana have collaborated on green development and forest conservation in Guyana since 2009. In this period Guyana successfully maintained one of the world’s lowest deforestation rates. Norway’s support to Guyana adds up to approximately USD 220 mill (NOK 1.5 billion at the time) in total for maintaining low deforestation rate. The funding provided support to Guyana’s Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) and the agreement was the first international commitment of financial support to the strategy including activities such as the development of solar energy climate adaptation and strengthening Indigenous Peoples rights.

“It is great to see Guyana fulfilling its vision from 2009 to mobilise international private capital in support of its Low Carbon Development Strategy. Norway is proud to have been a partner of Guyana in this journey” Barth-Eide said in the statement from Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative. Guyana’s more than 18 million hectares of rainforests (almost one and a half times the area of England) are estimated to store approximately 20 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Following the LCDS 2030 Guyana aims to maintain 99.5% of its forests.

A considerable portion of the world’s remaining tropical forests are found in countries like Guyana which has high forest covers and historically low deforestation rates (HFLD) and are collectively known as “HFLD-countries”.

While forest carbon market and climate finance schemes historically have tended to focus on areas that have reduced high levels of deforestation this is now starting to change with the first ART credits issued to Guyana. The multi-year purchase agreement with Hess Corporation stipulates that there is significant demand from the private sector to purchase high-integrity forest carbon credits from HFLD-countries such as Guyana. “Guyana has demonstrated that it is indeed possible to protect rainforest over time. This is the result of dedicated strategic work over more than a decade” said Barth-Eide.

In a separate announcement the Government of Guyana announced that they had entered into a multi-year agreement worth at least USD 750 million with Hess Corporation for the purchase of 37.5 million credits. This translates into 2.5 million credits per year from 2016 to 2030 roughly a third of Guyana’s current and projected credit issuance.

The revenues Guyana will receive under the new agreement with Hess Corporation will finance Guyana’s LCDS 2030 plan distributed according to a benefits-sharing mechanism and will be used towards activities including renewable energy village-based job creation and land titling climate adaptation and enhancing trade and market development for sustainable forestry and agriculture products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvMjAyMjEyMjQvbGlvbnMtc2hhcmUtb2lsLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbmV4dC15ZWFyLWNvbWUtZ3V5YW5hLWJyYXppbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Lions share' of oil production next year to come from Guyana Brazil,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='jamaica-gleaner.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/news/20221224/lions-share-oil-production-next-year-come-guyana-brazil (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212261D3070>, 'Connection to jamaica-gleaner.com timed out.

The HPE statement comes after Dealreporter reported that HPE is no longer in talks to buy Nutanix sending Nutanix shares down seven percent in early afternoon trading on Friday.

A Hewlett Packard Enterprise spokesperson Friday told CRN “there are no discussions with Nutanix” in reponse to a Dealreporter story that HPE is no longer in talks to buy Nutanix.

Nutanix could not be reached for comment.

The Dealreporter report comes three weeks after a Bloomberg story that HPE had “expressed takeover interest” and “held talks with Nutanix in recent months.”

The Bloomberg story said that the “talks between the companies have been on and off and it’s unclear whether they will be able to reach an agreement over price.”

That Bloomberg story sent Nutanix shares rising leading to a jump in Nutanix’s market capitalization to $7.02 billion on Dec. 1 up from $6.50 billion on November 30. Nutanix’s market capitalization on Dec 22 stood at $6.42 billion.

Nutanix shares were trading down seven percent or $1.99 in early afternoon trading to $25.93 after the Dealreporter report.

HPE shares were down three cents to $15.68.

[RELATED STORY: Nutanix CEO Rajiv Ramaswami Talks Broadcom VMware And His Vision To Help Partners Drive Business

Nutanix CEO Rajiv Ramaswami told CRN in early December that Nutanix was “flattered” by market’s rumors of a potential takover but said he would not comment on speculation.

“Now in terms of the rumors and speculation look it’s not appropriate for me to comment but we are flattered by all the attention we’re getting. And in some ways you know it’s a testament to the fact that we’re doing something good in the marketplace. And we’re doing something that our customers like’ he told CRN. “We’re trying to help them continue to simplify their infrastructure. Help them walk in the cloud with a cloud platform. We’re going to provide them freedom and flexibility of choice and delight.”

Nutanix channel partners have told CRN that they believe the HCI pioneeer will be sold this year.

Nutanix and HPE have had a long-standing business partnership that began three years ago with a global strategy that integrated Nutanix software on HPE servers. That deal resulted in Nutanix’s Enterprise Cloud OS software being made available through the HPE GreenLake cloud’s pay per use service.

A top executive for an HPE partner who did not want to be identified said that such a deal would have been a “big gamble” for HPE because of the challenges in integrating the two companies.

“Nutanix could have accelerated HPE’s move into multi-cloud it makes sense from a technology perspective” he said. “We sell a ton of Nutanix with the HPE flavor. We know the integration works. But it’s a big gamble and would have been very expensive at the current Nutanix valuation.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
HLT,Hilton Worldwide,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2hpbHRvbi1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWZyZWUtYnJlYWtmYXN0LWNoYW5nZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton’s international free breakfast is here to stay — at least for now,"We know if there's one thing TPG readers love it's free breakfast. And for elite Hilton Honors members it's a very important perk.

But a recent change to the terms and conditions on Hilton's website has people wondering if change is in the air outside the U.S.

Last year Hilton moved away from offering the complimentary continental breakfast benefit in the U.S. for Gold and Diamond elite members in favor of a $10-$25 food and beverage credit. While Hilton claimed the credit offered more flexibility to guests many elite members considered the change a downgrade to the program.

Outside the U.S. the complimentary continental breakfast benefit stayed the same.

Then this month Hilton updated the language in its terms and conditions leaving many people to speculate if Hilton could be ditching free breakfast outside the U.S. just as it did within our borders.

Previously the terms and conditions stated that on-property Hilton Honors benefits included ""complimentary snacks and beverages complimentary continental breakfast (All-Inclusive hotels hotels with Executive Lounges and non-U.S. only) Daily Food & Beverage Credit (U.S. only when guest does not have access to Executive Lounge.""

The updated version now reads ""Qualification for all on-property Hilton Honors benefits including complimentary Internet and MyWay benefits such as complimentary snacks and beverages complimentary continental breakfast OR a Daily Food & Beverage Credit (varies by brand and region).""

HILTON

This updated language could imply that international Hilton hotels now have the option to offer the same food and beverage credit as U.S. hotels in place of a full continental breakfast.

TPG reached out to Hilton for clarification and was told that there are ""no changes in the U.S. or internationally."" As the representative explained the confusion seems to come from the international expansion of Motto by Hilton which ""has always offered food and beverage credit as part of its brand standard.""

Additionally the spokesperson said beyond Motto shaking things up by going global there are ""no changes on the broader Hilton Honors F&B program offerings.""

But the new language in the terms and conditions still leaves the door open to changes further down the line. A free full breakfast is a great money-saving perk — and we'd hate to see that valuable offering be swapped once again for a dollar-valued credit that at many hotels barely covers the cost of coffee and a muffin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vaGlsdG9uLXJlcGxhY2VzLWJyZWFrZmFzdC1iZW5lZml0LWZvci1lbGl0ZS1tZW1iZXJzLWluLXRoZS11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton replaces breakfast benefit for elite members in the United States [not expanding worldwide],"Update 12/23/22: Loyalty Lobby reports that at some point during December the Hilton Honors T&C’s changed from: complimentary continental breakfast (All Inclusive hotels hotels with Executive Lounges and non-U.S. only) Daily Food & Beverage Credit (U.S. only  when guest does not have access to Executive Lounge) To: complimentary continental breakfast OR a Daily Food & Beverage Credit (varies by brand and region) Expanding f&b credits worldwide (instead of free elite breakfast) is a move that many have suspected would happen eventually and it appeared as though Hilton might be laying the groundwork for such a move here. We reached out to Hilton and they told us that this change was made entirely because of the international expansion of the Motto brand which only features f&b credits at all brand locations. They said that there are no plans to change the f&b offerings for elite members at other brands internationally…at least for now. Update 12/14/21: Ugh. Hilton has extended the moratorium on elite members getting free breakfast at their properties in the US and will continue to offer daily food & beverage credits (that will probably continue to not fully cover breakfast in many markets) “into 2022” (I assume this means through the end of 2022. In positive(ish?) news beginning on February 1 2022 at “lifestyle and full-service brands” in select cities the credit will increase from $12 per person to $15 per person per night (for up to two registered guests in the room) and from $15 to $18 per person per night depending on the market (destinations include properties in Boston Chicago District of Columbia Key Largo Key West New York City and San Francisco the County of Los Angeles and the state of Hawaii). That may get you half a buffet at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on The Big Island….if only they sold half-buffets. Overall this is bad news for members who used to value Hilton Gold status as the best mid-tier hotel status based on the free breakfast benefit but on the other hand it is good news for those who would rather eat breakfast elsewhere and use the food & beverage credit toward other meals at the hotel. And in reality some properties didn’t provide a proper breakfast before so the credit at least gives members the ability to choose something better than what they would have otherwise been given. I’m still not a fan of what I assume will become a permanent change here. Original post follows.

Hilton has destroyed the value of elite status for me with yesterday’s announcement that they will no longer offer free breakfast to Gold and Diamond members but will rather offer a food and beverage credit starting in July and running through the end of 2021. While some people may prefer this I think that overall this is a huge devaluation of the Hilton program and I can’t help but think that this will become a permanent change.

Starting in July Hilton properties in the US will no longer offer free breakfast to Hilton Gold and Diamond members but rather will offer a credit per person for up to two people per room. Hilton hasn’t officially said what the credits will be but it has been widely reported that the credits will be as follows:

$25 for luxury brands including Waldorf Astoria Conrad and LXR

$12 for full service brands ($15 for full service brands in high-cost markets)

$12 for lifestyle brands ($15 for lifestyle brands in high-cost markets)

$10 for Hilton Garden Inn properties

Gold members will be given an option for taking points or credits Diamond members will get both points and credits.

Credits must be used daily (they can’t be saved / stacked) and apply to up to 2 registered guests per room. You’ll need to charge breakfast to your room and the credits will be applied manually at check-out.

That’s awful. While $10 might cover breakfast at the Hilton Garden Inn across the street from Buffalo airport I have stayed at many Conrad and full service Hilton brands I don’t think these credits will cover both an entrée and a cup of coffee at any of them never mind the full breakfast buffets that I have enjoyed at many properties. Hilton bills these changes as adding flexibility:

Food & Beverage Credit for Gold & Diamond Members. You asked for flexibility and we’ve got it. Whether you look forward to breakfast or would rather skip it in favor of a refreshing beverage and afternoon snack the choice is yours. In early July we’ll begin offering a daily Food & Beverage Credit that will continue through the end of 2021. You can use this credit at the hotel brands where you currently receive a complimentary continental breakfast as your elite benefit of your membership. You’ll now be able to dine when and how you want. We will share more details in the coming weeks.

If you aren’t a breakfast person or you like to go out to a local spot for breakfast / brunch and would enjoy a glass of wine at the bar or appetizer back at the hotel later in the evening I am sure you’ll probably appreciate the flexibility as they suggest. If you’d rather have room service I suppose these credits will work out to be a discount of sorts on getting breakfast-in-bed. In fairness some hotels have long given credits in place of a full breakfast and the truth is that many hotels haven’t been offering full breakfast in light of the pandemic anyway and many club lounges have been closed so the breakfast benefit as-is has been highly inconsistent for the past year.

On the other hand pre-pandemic I had come to really enjoy Hilton precisely for consistency of things like being able to expect free full hotel breakfast at almost every property I’ve visited (even though the benefit is technically “continental” breakfast most hotels at which I’ve stayed provided an actual full breakfast pre-pandemic). It’s not that I don’t enjoy checking out local breakfast places but I have even more so come to enjoy the convenience of not having to travel farther than a few floors on the elevator to get breakfast without having to gather everything I’m going to want to bring with me for the day out. That’s especially true now that I’m traveling with kids; I highly value being able to return to the room straight from breakfast to finish getting ready for the day. Getting what amounts to a discount on breakfast via these credits feels cheesy. I just wouldn’t consider a Hilton property that offers a breakfast credit over free breakfast these days which will make it highly unlikely that I’ll stay at a Hilton property in the US for at least the rest of this year. Given that the CEO of Hilton has gone on the record recently saying that they expect hotels to become higher-margin now that they have essentially figured out how to cut costs during the pandemic I just can’t help but think this will be a long-term change once they do some sort of survey to determine that members “appreciate the flexibility”.

These changes only affect US hotels at the moment and only from July to December 2021 but writing that sentence almost makes me feel like I’m telling Hilton’s tall tales for them. I hope that this only lasts from July to December 2021 and then hotels return to giving a full breakfast. However given that many hotels have significantly trimmed back breakfast during the pandemic I find it hard to imagine a return to a more-generous-than-necessary breakfast benefit any time soon. Again this is probably a positive change for some members who will be happier with a drink and appetizer mid-day but overall I take this as a major devaluation to the program and to the Hilton Surpass credit card . That card has long come with the best mid-tier hotel elite status in Hilton Gold and the key benefit of that status is now going to be highly inconsistent moving forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2FsbHlzb25wb3J0ZWUvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9hLWNpdHktd2l0aGluLWEtY2l0eS10aGUtcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtaXMtc2luLWNpdHlzLW1vc3QtZWxlZ2FudGx5LWRlc2lnbmVkLWNvbXBsZXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A City Within A City The Resorts World Las Vegas Is Sin City's Most Elegantly Designed Complex,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/allysonportee/2022/12/23/a-city-within-a-city-the-resorts-world-las-vegas-is-sin-citys-most-elegantly-designed-complex/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2FsbHlzb25wb3J0ZWUvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9hLWNpdHktd2l0aGluLWEtY2l0eS10aGUtcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtaXMtc2luLWNpdHlzLW1vc3QtZWxlZ2FudGx5LWRlc2lnbmVkLWNvbXBsZXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9iZXN0LXBvaW50cy1ob3RlbHMtaW4tZXVyb3BlLXBlcmZlY3QtZm9yLWEtd2ludGVyLXNub3ctaG9saWRheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best points hotels in Europe for a winter snow holiday,"Looking for a snowy getaway this winter?

Since he took over the reins at Manchester’s Cloud 23 and Podium Restaurant they have already scored a two AA rosette award.

But after a brief chat overlooking Manchester in the Cloud 23 bar it’s clear he’s not resting on his laurels.

He began life as a kitchen porter working his way up the ranks in the kitchen to executive chef.

He has previous experience at The Lowry Hotel and working for several British hotelier chains including: Village Devere and Q hotels.

We sat down with the executive chef to talk about his plans for the restaurants at the Hilton.

He said: “We want fine dining to be more affordable and accepted by people in Manchester. I think some people are a bit intimidated with pretentious menus and what’s not what we’re looking for here.

“What I’m looking to do is to present familiar and loved foods in a way that’s surprising modern and unique.

“Manchester’s known for it’s dirty food and we all love it who doesn’t?

“But we’re aiming for quality a bit of finesse and some really bold punchy flavours.”

Asking about the highlights of their current menu Dave said that the focus now is on the main elements of dishes and the proteins they feature.

He continued: “We’ve had a few great highlights this year but at the moment we are focussing on the quality of our protein in the dishes.

“The main element whether it be Creedy Carver duck Herdwick lamb from Cumbria or Orkney scallops which arrive hand delivered fresh still alive it all has to be amazing quality.

“If you have a fantastic main ingredient you can build around it by using seasonal accompaniments it make things as good as you can be.

“The menu writes itself seasonally with what’s available.”

Showcasing some of Manchester’s fine produce the restaurant uses sourdough delivered on foot from from Holy Grain delicious charcuterie from Northern Cure Seven Bro7ers beer from Salford and Cloudwater too.

And the new team at Podium and Cloud23 restaurants are already making waves in the industry.

This year they took part in the Hilton’s annual Venture Beyond: Flavour and Flair competition where international Hilton restaurants compete for bragging rights as top dog in the hotel chain.

They made short work of the UK Ireland and Israel competition as outright winners.

This meant the qualified for the EMEA finals which include restaurants from all over Europe Middle East and Africa. It represents one third of the Hilton’s worldwide offerings.

They were narrowly pipped to the number one spot by the Hilton in Barcelona which has a Michelin star losing out by just three points.

Dave said: “I think that made it worse really losing out by just three points.

“They’ve got a Michelin star and have just been voted one of the best restaurants in Spain so there’s no shame in that. The team we beat from Croatia also had a Michelin star so it just shows how far we’ve come.

“It was great to meet chefs from around the world a real experience.

“We’ve set some high standards this year already with the two AA Rosettes but I’m really looking to push us forward into the new year. To get another and get us up to three would be a real highlight and it’s something we’re looking at.”

As the industry dipped during Covid and things were quiet Dave took over his role back in January.

But unusually he explained how the lull in proceedings allowed him to carve his own niche and put his own stamp of authority on the restaurant’s direction looking forward.

“It has without doubt been a crazy year here to be honest. When I first arrived the whole of the banquet space was hired out to Manchester Crown Court – and that was a big portion of our business on hold.

“We were only open a few days a week up at The Cloud 23 and the restaurant was serving burgers steak and fish and chips.

“Things were slow but in some respects this was a blessing for me getting my feet under the table.

“We figured out the process and what was needed in the journey we were about to set out on.

“We all thought its been about two years now on and off so let’s forget how we used to do everything and re-learn it all again in the right way.

“Luckily the bosses fully backed what we are trying to achieve here. I don’t think previously it’s ever been a place renowned for it’s food but with the rosettes now and a desire to push things forward we can make it a special place.

“Great food and that view it just sells itself.”

Looking to the future now Podium will be putting out a five course taster Menu come March in a bid for their third AA rosette.

But Dave highlighted how he didn’t want to turn people off trying something a bit different.

“We’re going to be putting on special events and taster menus to push things in the new year.

“The taster menu will be a real chance to showcase what we can do here – but we want to make it affordable.

“There are some restaurants doing tasters in the city for about £150-160 a head and we don’t want to be doing that. Not in the current climate.

“I really like what they are doing at Six by Nico – six courses of different and varied food for £37. It’s a great business model and because the place is always rammed and people come away tasting a lot of things it’s a great experience.

“We want people to have that opportunity to taste things and enjoy them and do something they wouldn’t normally do. But not put ourselves in a bracket where it becomes too stuffy or is too unaffordable.

“I hate that aspect of dining. I want it to be casual and enjoy themselves and have a laugh.

“We want to take the pretentiousness out of it.

“People having the confidence and putting smiles on faces. That’s what we’re all about.”"

HD,Home Depot,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy83MS1pbnN0aXR1dGlvbmFsLW93bmVyc2hpcC1ob21lLWRlcG90LTEzMDAyMzk5Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With 71% institutional ownership The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a favorite amongst the big guns,"If you want to know who really controls The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company around 71% to be precise is institutions. Put another way the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight especially with individual investors. Hence having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Home Depot beginning with the chart below.

View our latest analysis for Home Depot

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Home Depot?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

As you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Home Depot. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Home Depot's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Home Depot. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group Inc. with ownership of 9.3%. BlackRock Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 5.2% of the company stock.

On studying our ownership data we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register implying that no single individual has a majority interest.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Home Depot

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Story continues

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Home Depot Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$231m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

With a 29% ownership the general public mostly comprising of individual investors have some degree of sway over Home Depot. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Home Depot better we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that Home Depot is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis  you should know about...

Long before he was tied for the record for most knockouts in UFC welterweight history the 17-year veteran was just a guy who liked to fight. There’s no better example than how Brown made his professional MMA debut in 2005 which came just three months after he suffered a broken jaw in training.

“Funny enough there’s a newspaper article [about it]” Brown revealed on The Fighter vs. The Writer. “This was in Lancaster there’s a newspaper guy coming to interview all the fighters it was a group of fighters out there Aaron Crowell Higher Power Promotions if you remember this locally. He’s coming to interview everybody and after I got my jaw broken I didn’t know it was broken.

“My mouth was bleeding a lot and in the newspaper article it talked about ‘This guy named Matt Brown is spitting blood into a cup as he’s doing the interview with me.’ It made for a pretty good article.”

According to Brown the pain from his broken jaw was severe but not enough to make him want to pay out of pocket to get proper medical treatment. In fact the 41-year-old Ohio native didn’t even bother to get an x-ray done right away but he eventually discovered that his jaw was fractured in two separate places.

“I just didn’t have a mouthpiece and I was sparring” Brown said. “Hit the jaw broke it in two spots. I think it’s part of why I have such a strong jaw now. It repairs stronger than it was before. Never got it wired or anything.

“I didn’t know it was broken. I was like ‘Well it hurts.’ I got an x-ray a week or two later. I didn’t have insurance or anything so it’s like what do you do?”

Brown says he continued dealing with the pain from the broken jaw after returning to training — even while just hitting a heavy bag as the vibrations reverberated throughout his entire body.

Despite the fact that he never actually received medical care for the broken jaw much less took time off from the gym Brown ended up booking his professional debut five weeks later.

“[My jaw] definitely still hurt” Brown said. “I had a boil and bite mouthpiece. I didn’t have no professional mouthpiece so I wasn’t protecting it very well.

“I remember going in thinking the guy [I was fighting] he was a Golden Gloves boxer. A really good one. I remember I wanted to show that my Muay Thai would outdo his boxing. I was like ‘I’m just going to take this motherf***** down. If he hits me in the jaw it’s going to hurt really bad.’”

The event took place in Lancaster Ohio — a city that sits just over 30 miles southeast of Columbus — with Brown taking on Ricardo Martinez.

While there was obviously a lot happening on the night he made his pro debut Brown will never forget the look of the cage which gave him an idea about his strategy for the fight.

“The cage it must have been made out of dog kennel panels because it had a bar running straight across the middle” Brown described. “About belly button height so I thought I’m just going to run him straight into that bar and that’s exactly what I did.

“I just did a double leg a blast double ran his back as hard as I could into that bar and it was an easy fight from there. As soon as he hit the bar he [screamed]. Pretty sure that it worked.”

Brown can’t verify for certain that the cage doubled as a dog kennel but he definitely remembers that the cage link fence didn’t have any kind of protective coating like the kind that makes up the UFC octagon.

Regular chain-link fencing is just raw metal — complete with jagged edges and bent pieces — and Brown absolutely noticed before the fight started.

“This was chain link from f****** Home Depot” Brown said. “Like the cheap stuff. I just wanted to use my surroundings. I was like well there’s a bar there the fence itself is a little bit rough. I’m going to try to use this to my advantage. It worked out.”

The end result was Brown finishing the fight with a first-round neck crank submission to move to 1-0 in his career.

He eventually got to the UFC less than three years later but Brown will never forget those early days in his career when fighting was just about fighting and not much else mattered.

“We’re young kids and we just wanted to fight” Brown said. “It’s such a different world today of course with social media and the whole size of the sport the chances out there. Back in my day we just wanted to fight.

“Ohio used to have more shows than any state in the country and there would be shows on Friday Saturday and Sunday. I know guys that would fight on all three of them. We were just a bunch of young savage dumbasses. But we had a f****** blast doing it and it made us who we are today.”"

To keep the chill at bay space heaters provide a great and economical way to stay warm in a single room without having to heat up the whole house (or apartment). Not all space heaters however are built the same. Some may help heat up a large room while some are just good for keeping your personal space toasty. And then there are some that just feel like you’re using a public bathroom’s hand dryer. We tested and researched a number of space heaters to find 11 units tailored for different needs. The best part? Most come in at under $100.

Space Heaters 101

Are space heaters more efficient than central heat?

Yes because space heaters are only heating up single rooms rather than entire living spaces space heaters will use drastically less energy. If you’re only going to be spending your time in your bedroom just use your space heater so you’re not heating up the rooms you’re not in.

Can’t I use my oven to heat my home?

Tempting as it may be to use your oven to stay warm don’t do it. You risk carbon monoxide poisoning and it’s just not an effective way to stay warm. Think about it: ovens are meant to contain heat not spread it throughout your home.

Can you leave a space heater on all night?

To be perfectly safe don’t leave your space heater running while you’re asleep. Most space heaters will have built-in safety features to ensure you don’t hurt yourself or burn your place down but these measures won’t completely ensure bad things don’t happen. We can’t fully recommend you sleep with the space heater on but we understand there may be instances when it’s needed to stay warm overnight. It’s also possible to run a space heater for a while before you go to sleep then shutting it off once it’s lights out.

Is it OK to leave my space heater on while unattended?

If you’re not in the room where your space heater is on what’s the point of keeping it on? While any good space heater will have built-in safety features to keep it from overheating and malfunctioning you probably shouldn’t keep it on if you’re not going to be around. Always be in proximity to your space heater when it’s on so you can take action if something bad were to happen to it.

Energy for space heaters

Depending on how old you are you may have grown up around kerosene-fueled space heaters. These heaters burn petroleum-derived lamp oil — AKA kerosene — to provide heat and while they are still available their use in homes has decreased immensely. That’s because while they provide ample heat kerosene heaters have a number of drawbacks. They smell strongly of kerosene (a similar smell to gasoline) their fumes are bad for the environment and for your health they burn up the oxygen in a space and can be dangerous to use in small areas and they’re a greater fire risk than cleaner-energy alternatives.

Speaking of those cleaner alternatives most space heaters on the market today are electric. Electric space heaters heat up quickly and don’t have to burn any fossil fuels so they’re much better for the environment as well as your home’s local air quality. They’re also safer as they contain no combustible fuels and frequently boast features like auto-shut-off mechanisms that prevent them from running for too long or running after being tipped over. Given the vast health and safety benefits that electric space heaters possess over kerosene heaters this guide only contains the former.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NkYXkubmcvY29tcGFuaWVzL2FydGljbGUvYXJocGwtYXBwb2ludHMtaG9uZXl3ZWxsLXVvcC1hcy1yZWZpbmVyeS1wcm9jZXNzLWxpY2Vuc29yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ARHPL appoints Honeywell UOP as refinery process licensor,"In a push to boost the development of its 100000 Barrel Per Stream day (bpsd) deep conversion refinery the African Refinery Port Harcourt Limited (ARPHL) has signed a Process licensing agreement with Honeywell UOP.

Starting with the powertrain the VF 8 Eco City Edition features an 82 kWh battery pack that feeds a dual-motor all-wheel drive system developing 349 hp (260 kW / 354 PS) and 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) of torque. This enables the model to accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in approximately 6.5 seconds and travel 179 miles (288 km) on a single charge.

Customers can also get the VF 8 Plus City Edition and it’s notable for featuring an upgraded powertrain with 402 hp (300 kW / 408 PS) and 457 lb-ft (619 Nm) of torque. Thanks to the extra oomph the dash to 62 mph (100 km/h) takes around 5.5 seconds while the range remains unchanged.

The motors appear to be shared with the standard VF 8 but the City Editions have a slightly smaller battery pack. This helps to explain their disappointing range as the regular model is slated to have a larger 87.7 kWh battery. Speaking of which VinFast said the City Editions can go from a 10% to 70% charge in 24 minutes or less using a DC fast charger.

Putting the powertrain aside the VF 8 Eco City Edition has LED lighting units and 19-inch wheels. The Plus variant is largely identical but rides on larger 20-inchers.

Moving into the cabin the Eco trim has heated power front seats a dual-zone climate control system and a 15.6-inch infotainment system. They’re joined by an eight-speaker audio system and keyless entry.

The VF 8 Plus City Edition builds on that by adding a panoramic sunroof and leather seats with more power adjustment. Buyers will also find a power liftgate and a ten-speaker audio system with a subwoofer.

On the safety front both trims come with an assortment of driver assistance systems including Traffic Jam Assist Highway Assist Lane Departure Warning Lane Keeping Assist and Lane Centering Assist. They’re joined by Adaptive Cruise Control Forward Collision Warning Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Blind Spot Detection. Other highlights include front/rear parking assist a rearview camera automatic high-beam headlights and traffic sign recognition technology.

Speaking of technology the crossover has GPS navigation as well as Camp Pet and Valet modes. Customers can also get a subscription that provides a virtual assistant live traffic information and a “web browser.”

The VF 8 Eco City Edition starts at $55500 before a $1200 destination and handling fee is factored in. However the company is offering a $3000 City Edition discount and customers can get a two year lease for $599 per month with $5774 due at signing.

The Plus City Edition starts at $62500 (before destination charges) and is also eligible for the $3000 discount. Customers can also get a similar lease for $699 per month with $6789 down.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vYmVydG9uZS1oeXBlcmNhci1ydW5zLW9uLXBsYXN0aWMtd2FzdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bertone reveals a 1100 hp hypercar that runs on plastic waste,"“We are building this car for customers that appreciate the history and legacy of Bertone. And for connoisseurs who love sports cars with exceptional performance. It’s not only about raw power and performance. It’s about celebrating the long Italian tradition of timeless elegant cars.” said Ricci CEO of Bertone.

A true hypercar in design & specifications

The makers have gone to great lengths to ensure GB110 fits the hypercar status. Its makers say that GB110 is a “limited-edition state-of-the-art hypercar designed for breathtaking performance while at the same time paying homage to pioneer Bertone designs from the ’60s and ’70s” according to a release.

The makers have not revealed the capacity or the source of the combustion engine used but the motor is mated to a 7-speed transmission with all-wheel drive capabilities. The combination which produces 1100 hp and 1100 of torque can accelerate GB110 from a standstill to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 2.79 seconds. The hypercar can also clock 186 mph (300 km/h) in 14 seconds and the top speed is rated at 236 mph (380 km/h).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZ2Vhci5jb20vMTE0NzQ5Ny93aGljaC1icmFuZC1kby15b3UtdGhpbmstbWFrZXMtdGhlLXdvcnN0LWdhbWluZy1wcmVidWlsdC1wY3MtaGVyZXMtd2hhdC1nYW1lcnMtc2FpZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Brand Do You Think Makes The Worst Gaming Prebuilt PCs? Here's What Gamers Said,"Which Brand Do You Think Makes The Worst Gaming Prebuilt PCs? Here's What Gamers Said

While some people may find the experience of building their custom gaming PC rewarding it could be a tiresome daunting process for others. This is especially the case with novice users with minimal PC hardware experience. Given that even the most experienced gamers and PC builders need to perform in-depth research to ensure that their machine is devoid of any compatibility issues many people choose the easier way out and buy off-the-shelf prebuilt gaming PCs.

Among the advantages of prebuilt gaming PCs include a company-provided warranty very little set-up time and generally lower price tags. In addition the company-provided warranty is often seen as an important buying factor for consumers who prefer having a single point of contact for repairs and service requirements. There is also inherent peace of mind when a product is backed by a warranty. While parts used on assembled systems also usually come with a warranty customers must self-identify parts that malfunction and contact the component manufacturer for service.

It is no surprise therefore to see several brands continuing to have a sizable presence in the prebuilt gaming PC segment despite the rising popularity of self-assembled systems. With so many brands to choose from it is natural for consumers to prefer some brands over others. To gain better insights into what SlashGear readers think of some of the more popular gaming PC brands out there we asked 601 gamers what they thought were the worst gaming PC brands out there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvc2llbWVucy1pbmRpYS10by1tYWtlLTEtMjAwLWhvcnNlcG93ZXItZWxlY3RyaWMtbG9jb21vdGl2ZXMtZm9yLXJhaWx3YXlzLTEyMjEyMjQwMDc5OF8xLmh0bWzSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy9zaWVtZW5zLWluZGlhLXRvLW1ha2UtMS0yMDAtaG9yc2Vwb3dlci1lbGVjdHJpYy1sb2NvbW90aXZlcy1mb3ItcmFpbHdheXMtMTIyMTIyNDAwNzk4XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Siemens India to make 1200 horsepower electric locomotives for railways,"The logo of German industrial group Siemens is seen in Zurich Switzerland

Siemens India will manufacture 1200 electric freight locomotives of 9000 HP each for the railways according to the terms of a contract valued at Rs 26000 crore the national transporter said on Saturday.

The Indian Railways has issued a letter of award (LoA) for the manufacturing and maintenance of the 9000-HP electric freight locomotives to Siemens India.

""Railways factory at Dahod Gujarat will manufacture 1200 high horsepower (9000 HP) electric locomotives over a period of 11 years. It would entail manufacturing of 1200 locomotives and maintenance of these locomotives for 35 years. The estimated value of contract is about INR 26000 crore (about 3.2 billion USD) excluding taxes and price variation"" the railways said in a statement.

An agreement with Siemens India will be signed within 30 days of the issuance of the LoA. The prototype locomotives are to be delivered in the next two years.

The Dahod unit will be fully constructed for manufacturing these locomotives within a period of two years. Siemens selected as the technological partner will manufacture the locomotives at Dahod and maintain those at four maintenance depots -- Visakhapatnam Raipur Kharagpur and Pune -- for a period of 35 years utilising the railways' manpower.

""Suitable economic drivers will ensure complete indigenisation of the manufacturing which in turn will lead to development of ancillary manufacturing units making it a true 'Make in India' initiative. The project will also lead to development of the Dahod region and generate employment"" the railways said.

These 9000-HP locomotives will be the future workhorse for freight operation on the Indian Railways. These locomotives are planned for use primarily on the Western DFC and on graded sections of the railways for hauling container freight trains in double-stack configuration and improve the average speed of such trains to around 50-60 kilometres per hour over the existing 20-25 kmph.

The quantum jump in the operating parameters will lead to an increase in the throughput and also enhance line capacity. These locomotives equipped with state-of-the-art IGBT-based propulsion technology will provide savings in energy consumption due to regenerative braking technology.

There is a provision to manufacture and supply standard gauge locomotives for the export market.

Siemens India was selected as the technology partner through a fair transparent and competitive bidding process to manufacture and maintain these locomotives the railways said."

Humana Military and TriWest Healthcare Alliance were awarded contracts to manage the Defense Department's Tricare health program that altogether could be worth up to $136 billion over a nine-year period the announcement stated.

With the new contracts set to begin in 2024 the Defense Health Agency also will shift six states from the East to the West Region meaning that beneficiaries who live in those states will move from Humana to TriWest.

The DoD said the change will allow a more equitable balance of the beneficiary population with roughly 1.5 million beneficiaries in Arkansas Illinois Louisiana Oklahoma Texas and Wisconsin making the move.

The Tricare health program manages private health care treatment referrals customer service claims processing and other support services to roughly 9.6 million beneficiaries including active-duty personnel some members of the Reserve and National Guard military retirees and family members.

According to the contract announcement Humana Military will retain its role as managed care support contractor for the Tricare East Region in a deal worth up to $70.9 billion while TriWest which managed the West Region from 1996 to 2013 received the $65.1 billion contract to again oversee the West Region.

Ousted in the selection process was HealthNet Federal Services which has managed the Tricare West Region since 2018 and has overseen some portion of the Tricare portfolio since 1996.

Whether HealthNet will protest the decision has yet to be determined. Company officials said in a statement to Military.com that they have a debriefing scheduled with DHA in January and have asked for details about the decision.

""We are disappointed by DHA's decision. ... We have requested details to which we are entitled under the government's procurement rules. Following receipt of this information we will be in a position to determine our options regarding the Agency's decision"" they wrote.

The Tricare program dates to 1994 when the DoD announced it would implement a nationwide managed care program to provide civilian health benefits for non-military beneficiaries.

In its press release Thursday the Pentagon said the new contracts known as the T-5 Managed Support Contracts should provide improved service for beneficiaries and a seamless transition.

Historically however this hasn't been the case.

In 2016 when the Defense Health Agency consolidated its Tricare regions from three to two it awarded the contracts to Humana Military for the East Region and Health Net Federal Services in the West.

United Healthcare which lost the Tricare West contract proved difficult in the transition providing little assistance to incoming HealthNet that resulted in a backlog of referrals provider change requests and payment updates that required a need to freeze enrollments and swaps between plans.

Payment information for more than 224000 beneficiaries was lost resulting in 15000 patients being kicked out of Tricare and providers experienced a rough transition as well with payment delays and incorrect reimbursements.

An investigation by the Government Accountability Office into the bungled transition faulted the Defense Health Agency for a lack of guidance and oversight of the process.

The previous contract award also was fraught with issues. The selection of a contract provider that never before had served military beneficiaries got off to a rocky start with delayed payments to providers and patients complaining of unresolved issues.

DHA Director Lt. Gen. Ronald Place said the agency has learned its lessons and patients should experience few problems.

""Tricare is moving into a new era making use of the lessons learned in the first three contract phases"" Place said in a press release. ""Defense Department leadership and the incumbent managed care support contractors are dedicated to managing a smooth transition to the new managed care support contractors with minimum disruption to our beneficiaries.""

Place said the new contracts aim to improve the ""beneficiary experience"" by allowing patients to transfer specialty care referrals when they move regardless of the region where they relocate.

The contracts also call for better customer service requiring the regions to reduce the average speed to answer calls to 20 seconds and improve problem-solving on a first call to meet the industry standard of 85%.

And they require improved coordination between military treatment facilities and private care including interoperability through an exchange with the DoD's electronic medical record system MHS Genesis.

""We listened to our beneficiaries about what impacts their experience of care and addressed many of those concerns in T-5"" said Place.

Officials with Humana Military said they were honored to have been chosen to continue serving 4.6 million military beneficiaries in 24 states and Washington D.C.

""This is an incredible opportunity to take innovative patient-focused care to the next level for beneficiaries and the military health system as a whole"" Sue Schick segment president for group and military business at Humana said in a press release.

TriWest which currently manages the Department of Veterans Affairs Community Care Network in the West and Hawaii will provide Tricare services to beneficiaries in 26 states.

""At TriWest it has been our privilege to serve the health care needs of the military and Veteran communities for more than 26 years"" TriWest Healthcare Alliance President and CEO David McIntyre said in a release. ""The goal of our company's non-profit owners employees our world class partners and more than 740000 health care professionals in our network who have stepped up to care for our nation's heroes is simple...to ensure that our work honors the sacrifices of those we are humbled to serve.""

Blue Shield of California said Friday that with the award going to TriWest roughly 1.8 million active-duty military members and their families would have access to its provider network as part of the deal.

Given that TriWest would hold both the DoD and VA private care health contracts for the area patients would have an easier time transitioning their health care after they leave the service depending on eligibility noted Paul Markovich president and CEO of Blue Shield of California.

""Our company's mission is to ensure all Californians have access to high-quality health care at an affordable price. Serving 1.8 million eligible active-duty military veterans and their families in communities across the state through our collaboration with TriWest is an important part of achieving our mission"" Markovich said in a release.

The T-5 managed care support contracts will take effect in 2024 to continue providing health care claims processing customer service and other administrative support to approximately 9.6 million Tricare beneficiaries the Department of Defense said Thursday.

Humana Government Business received a $70.9 billion contract for the East Region that includes Washington D.C. Alabama Connecticut Delaware and Florida.

TriWest secured a $65.1 billion T-5 MCS contract for the West Region which includes Alaska California and Colorado. Under the contract the region will take in six states from the East covering about 1.5 million beneficiaries: Arkansas Illinois Louisiana Oklahoma Texas and Wisconsin.

Each contract will have a transition-in period of 12 months that will kick off on Feb. 1 eight option years and a transition-out period.

DHA received two offers for each of the T-5 contracts through a competitive solicitation process and will oversee the contracts through its managed care contracting division in Aurora Colorado.

DOD said the contracts will require the vendors to help improve the integration between the T-5 private sector care and military medical treatment facilities and enhance interoperability with the MHS GENESIS system through Health Information Exchanges to speed up the transmission of information to health providers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2ZlZGVyYWxuZXdzbmV0d29yay5jb20vY29udHJhY3RzYXdhcmRzLzIwMjIvMTIvdHJpY2FyZS1hd2FyZHMtYS1uZXctaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1jb250cmFjdC13aXRoLWFuLWV5ZS10b3dhcmQtbGVzc29ucy1sZWFybmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TRICARE awards a new healthcare contract with an eye toward lessons learned,"Military family members and retirees who use TRICARE will see changes to their healthcare starting in 2024. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) announced its new contract for TRICARE services on Dec. 22. The new contract for civilian health care known as T-5 will start in 2024.

Humana Government Business and TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corporation will be the regional contractors with Humana covering the TRICARE east region and TriWest providing coverage to the TRICARE west region.

The combined $138 billion contract will serve close to 10 million patients in the health network. With the new contract the Defense Department replaces Health Net Federal Services with TriWest Healthcare in the western TRICARE region

The contractors work with DHA in providing health care and combining the resources of the contractor and the military’s direct medical care system to provide health medical and administrative support services to service members retirees and eligible family members or dependents. While active duty servicemembers get direct no cost health care services for their dependents and for retirees are contracted to commercial healthcare providers. DHA said the new contracts will offer beneficiaries greater provider network flexibility enhanced telehealth appointments and more efficient referral transfers between the two regions.

Humana and Health Net won the contract for services in 2016 after a process that generated nine protests all of which were eventually denied. DHA expected protests due to the large size of the contract. The agency had proactively asked the Government Accountability Office and other acquisition experts to look over the process prior to award in an effort to head off protests. DHA wanted to forestall problems after a 2009 contract award for TRICARE generated protests that delayed implementation of the contract for close to three years.

The contract was offered in a competitive bidding process two bids submitted for each of the two regions.

In addition to a change of provider the T-5 contract also makes a change to the makeup of the regions. The new boundaries of the two regions will move Arkansas Illinois Louisiana Oklahoma Texas and Wisconsin from the eastern to the western region. Those six states will bring about 1.5 million beneficiaries into TriWest Healthcare’s region.

“Moving these six states into the west region will create a more even balance to the TRICARE population each regional contractor manages. The move will also streamline processes and standards for both regions” said a statement from TRICARE.

While some of the past changes to the program caused major problems for beneficiaries TRICARE hopes that with a year built in for transition this next change will offer a better experience. The transition period begins Feb. 1.

“Transition planning time is scheduled for one full year. This is to ensure healthcare delivery is ready for all 9.6 million beneficiaries on day one of the new contract” TRICARE said.

In 2016 TRICARE moved from a three region administration to the two current regions. United Healthcare lost the region and failed to get the contract renewed. Problems riddled the ensuing rollout of the T-2017 contract. Patients reported being dropped from TRICARE rolls having their payment information lost and seeing referrals backlogged. Adding to the confusion DHA increased the cost of co-pays during that transition period.

The terms of the new contract are cost-plus-award-fee firm-fixed-price and fixed-price type contract with the included 12-month transition period. It then moves to eight one-year option periods for healthcare delivery plus a transition-out period. This contract also includes incentives and performance guarantees.

Military service organizations including Military Officers Association of America lobbied DHA last year to minimize disruptions to patients during the transition and make sure new contractors have adequate networks to care for beneficiaries. The group raised concerns that the contracts emphasized value-based service to the potential detriment of patients.

General Dynamics press release

Electric Boat is the prime contractor on the Columbia program which will replace the aging Ohio class ballistic missile submarines. The District of Columbia (SSBN 826) and Wisconsin (SSBN 827) are presently under construction.

The contract modification has a value of $5134324189. Work will be performed in Groton Connecticut; Quonset Point Rhode Island; and Newport News Virginia; and is expected to be completed by October 2030. The award funds advance procurement and advance construction of critical components and material to support Build II (the next five ships in the class) efforts to support continuous missile tube production enhancements to develop the Submarine Industrial Base and sustained class maintenance and support.

“This award enhances Electric Boat’s efforts to maintain the Columbia-class production and delivery schedule. Advance procurement of long lead time materials and component construction is critical to the program and the strategic investments in the development and expansion of the Submarine Industrial Base will help stabilize and grow the supply chain which increases manufacturing capacity reduces risk and ultimately drives timely delivery of submarines to the Navy.”

Kevin Graney President of General Dynamics Electric Boat

At 560 feet long with a displacement of nearly 21000 tons the submarines of the Columbia class will be the largest ever built by the United States.

I'm a dividend investor so an out-of-favor stock like Intel (INTC -0.80%) with its historically high yield is something I'm going to take a look at. The company has some attractive features.

But a deeper dive suggests the risks outweigh the benefits especially when I compare the chip giant to my investments in International Business Machines (IBM 0.53%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 0.93%). Here are two big reasons why I'm taking a pass on Intel.

1. A high yield on its own isn't enough

The big thing that attracted me to Intel was the stock's current 5.4% dividend yield. That's not only large on an absolute level but it's also near the highest levels in the company's history suggesting the stock is relatively cheap today. That combination is easily enough to get me to take a closer look at Intel right now. One warning sign for me here however is that the dividend hasn't been increased annually for even 10 consecutive years.

By comparison IBM has increased its dividend annually for over 25 years. IBM's yield meanwhile is an attractive 4.7%. And while the yield isn't near all-time highs it is still fairly generous historically speaking.

And there's the fact that IBM has an over 100-year history that includes several major business transformations -- one of which has just recently been completed with the company's purchase of RedHat. In fact a long period of declining sales appears to have turned around. While IBM is hardly perfect it has proven that it can adjust with the times.

One of the reasons why Intel is in the Wall Street doghouse today is that it hasn't actually proven it can do that. When smartphones became more important it missed the opportunity and its efforts in autonomous driving haven't been inspiring (it just spun off a piece of Mobileye which I don't think it would have done if this push into the autonomous driving sector was a huge success). Meanwhile it has recently fallen behind CPU competitors because it has faced delays with new technology. Change takes time and it is likely that the company will muddle through but I'd rather stick with IBM which has a similar yield and a better business history.

2. Not enough diversity

On the other side of the coin looking specifically at chip stocks Intel has one main product that gets used in two main end markets. Basically from my simplistic point of view as a non-tech investor it makes the brains of a computer (the CPU). As mobile devices have become increasingly important demand for desktop computers has largely waned. Intel appears to have gotten lucky with the server market (basically just a variation on a computer) taking off to supply the data centers that support mobile demand. In some ways it's a one-trick pony.

Texas Instruments meanwhile makes far simpler microchips that get used in thousands of products. To put a number on that this chipmaker has around 80000 products that it sells to more than 100000 customers. The chips it makes are very similar to each other but that's kind of the point. These are simple commodity chips that are somewhat fungible making them easier to sell into the market. I believe strongly in diversification for my portfolio and I tend to favor companies that have diversification in their businesses too.

Meanwhile Texas Instruments has increased its dividend annually for 19 consecutive years. And its 2.9% dividend yield is toward the high end of its historical range suggesting it is relatively cheap. Like Intel Texas Instruments is focusing on capital investments right now but the stakes aren't nearly as high. Intel needs to upgrade its tech or risk falling further behind its peers; Texas Instruments is really just trying to prepare ahead of time for the increased demand it sees down the road. That's a much stronger position to be in.

Tech confuses me but...

I'll happily admit that I'm not a technology genius but I don't think you need to be to see the bigger picture trends at these three companies. And when you add up the pros and cons Intel just doesn't seem as attractive as similarly high-yield IBM or Texas Instruments in the chip sphere. I reserve the right to change my mind but right now I'm passing on Intel because it doesn't stack up to the other tech names I own.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvZWR3YXJkLWtsYXVzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NDU3OTc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edward Klaus Obituary (1930 - 2022),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/edward-klaus-obituary?id=38457976 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvZWR3YXJkLWtsYXVzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NDU3OTc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZmFjZTJmYWNlYWZyaWNhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RoaXMtdHJhaWxibGF6aW5nLWJsYWNrLWludmVudG9ycy13b3JrLWxlZC10by10aGUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtdGhlLWNvbG9yLXBjLW1vbml0b3LSAX1odHRwczovL2ZhY2UyZmFjZWFmcmljYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90aGlzLXRyYWlsYmxhemluZy1ibGFjay1pbnZlbnRvcnMtd29yay1sZWQtdG8tdGhlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LW9mLXRoZS1jb2xvci1wYy1tb25pdG9yL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This trailblazing Black inventor’s work led to the development of the color PC monitor,"He showed a lot of promise while growing up with a lot of interest in creating his own inventions. At a tender age he built a tractor from ground zero with the assistance of his father who was a supervisor at the Tennessee Valley Authority.

He was gifted in many aspects of academics and on the field as an athlete. At Jefferson City High School he graduated with straight A’s. He came up on top of his class at the University of Tennessee in 1979 where he studied engineering as reported by Biography.

Today Dr. Mark Dean a computer scientist and engineer is credited with inventing revolutionary technologies that changed the face of how computers operate and are utilized in many workplaces and homes.

He co-invented the personal computer monitor the Industry Standard Architecture system bus which allows for computer plug-ins such as disk drives and printers and the first gigahertz chip which fast-tracks the speed of processing data in computers.

He has at least three of IBM’s patents out of the company’s original nine patents but has more than 20 patents linked with his name. If computers are handier and work at great speed Dean was instrumental in getting the personal computer age to where it is today.

He was born on March 2 1957 in Jefferson City Tennessee. He got a job at IBM shortly after he completed college. He showed a lot of promise like his childhood days a few months after his employment at IBM.

Dean built the new Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) systems bus with his workmate Dennis Moeller. This technology enabled peripheral devices such as disk drivers printers and monitors to be hooked directly into computers. It facilitated the integration and effectiveness of computers.

His research at IBM transformed the accessibility and power of the personal computer. His groundbreaking work in 1999 led to the invention of the color personal computer monitor. He later led a team of engineers to build the first gigahertz chip which is able to do a billion calculations a second.

He had a knack for higher learning despite his accomplishments. He returned to the classroom to pursue his master’s degree in electrical engineering from Florida Atlantic University in 1982. A decade later he went to Stanford University to do his doctorate degree in electrical engineering.

In 1996 IBM acknowledged him as one of their fellows the first to be earned by an African American. He was also given the Black Engineer of the Year President’s Award and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. He was made a member of the National Academy of Engineers in 2001.

He is reported to have indicated that children should be told they could be whatever they dream of becoming despite the challenges they may face."

Intel’s new 13th Gen Core CPUs are so easy to obtain that they are literally sitting on shelves in Asian stores as we speak. Luckily for us more than a week before formal launch a known overclocker from JagatOC team Alva “Lucky_n00b” Jonathan has been able to buy one himself. This provides first-hand information on one of the most interesting Intel desktop CPUs for this generation.

Intel Core i5-13500 Source: Lucky_n00b

As a reminder the Core i5-13500 is a 14-core CPU with 6 Performance and 8 Efficient cores. That’s one of the biggest jumps compared to 12th Gen series as the predecessor had no Efficient cores at all. What is intriguing is that Alva seemingly confirms that this i5-13500 might be using Alder Lake C0 die.

The Core i5-13500 is part of the new 65W TDP series. This power level applies to PL1 (Power Limit 1) or Processor Base Power as Intel calls it now. However the CPU also supports PL2 or MTP (Max Turbo Power) of 154W which can actually be forced in motherboard BIOS. Many of existing and upcoming Intel motherboards will offer an option to increase the period for the CPU to stay boosted with maximum power effectively putting the CPU into a higher performance state for a prolonged time.

Intel Core i5-13500 CPU-Z Clocks Source: Lucky_n00b

According to Alva this CPU gains massively from running in max power mode with a difference of 1.5 GHz for all cores running simultaneously during heavy workloads such as Cinebench. With default 65W TDP the max all-core boost is 2.9 to 3.0 GHz but with TDP unlocked it goes up to 4.5 GHz with all cores. This of course applies to Performance cores but Efficient cores gain higher frequency as well from 2.9 GHz to 3.5 GHz as per report.

It is said that the CPU running at 4.5 GHz all-core mode almost reaches a multi-core performance of Core i7-12700K processor while in 65W mode it almost matches i5-12600K (both tested in Cinebench R23). However unlocked power mode means that stock cooler is insufficient and not recommended using in this mode.

Intel Core i5-13500 Cinebench R23 Performance Source: Lucky_n00b

Alva did not have time for a full review yet but here are his notes from the brief testing:

Quick Pretest Core i5-13500 notes: Run on MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 (1.90 BIOS) and GSkill TridentZ RGB DDR4-3600 2x16GB

Judging from the L2 Cache seems like an Alder Lake C0 die with 2 less P-Core?

Default detected power config is 65W PL1/154W PL2

Increasing PL1 from default 65W to Max/Unlimited mode will give massive clock boost

Max Clock 1-Core 4.8Ghz (P-Core)

Sustained All-core Clock on default 65W Mode 2.9-3Ghz P-Core 2.9Ghz E-Core

Sustained All-core Clock on Max/unlimited PL1 4.5Ghz P-Core 3.5Ghz E-Core

Default 65W Mode might be feasible for Stock Heatsink (Temp might be higher just for the initial Burst to 130W ish)

Unlimited/Max PL1 Power IS NOT RECOMMENDED for Stock Heatsink (will easily hit TjMax)

65W Multi-Core Performance almost match an i5-12600K on Cinebench R23

Max/Unlimited Power Multi-Core Performance slightly below i7-12700K!

Single-Core close to i5-12600K. Quick Summary: Pretty Decent overall performance

Might be run on cheap/value H610 board but PLEASE make sure power is 65W not maxxed out

Recommended to pair with midrange B660 and Decent 120mm Tower HSF (like Thermalright TA120 EX or ID-Cooling SE-224XT) max out all power limit on the board to get optimal multi-core performance. Now I’m not sure if i5-13600K is my best CPU of the year this i5-13500 CPU might have better multi-core performance-per-dollar 😃 — Alva “Lucky_n00b” Jonathan

Alva claims that he bought the processor for as little as $270 (after conversion). He also confirms that the CPU has a max 1-core boost of 4.8 GHz so we can now update the chart below with new data.

Intel Core i5-13500 CPU Might Become The Best Budget CPU At Launch As Early Benchmarks Reveal

There has been no shortage of Intel Core i5-13500 CPU benchmarks over the last couple of weeks. We have seen benchmarks here and here but the latest one comes from renowned overclocker & also tech enthusiast Alva Jonathan aka Lucky_n00b. The CPU is already available for sale within the Indonesian PC market place so it wasn't that hard for Alva to acquire the chip. He did put the CPU through various tests and the results are very interesting.

Intel's Core i5-13500 CPU will be part of the 13th Gen Non-K CPU lineup but will utilize the Alder Lake C0 die since its cache structure is similar to that rather than Raptor Lake chips. The Core i5-13500 comes with 6 Performance Cores & 8 Efficiency cores for a total of 14 cores and 20 threads. That's the same amount of threads as the Intel Core i7-12700K but that has a higher number of Performance Cores. There's also 24 MB of L3 cache and 11.5 MB of L2 cache on board the chip.

The Intel Core i5-13500 CPU was tested on an MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 motherboard and it comes with a maximum 1-core clock speed of 4.8 GHz (P-Core) and a sustained all-core clock speed that ranges between 2.8-2.9 GHz for the P-Cores and 2.9 GHz for the E-Core under the 65W PL1 mode. With the maximum PL1 mode this frequency jumps to 4.5 GHz across all P-Cores and 3.5 GHz on the E-Cores.

At stock the Intel Core i5-13500 CPU has a 65W PL1 and a max PL2 rating of 154W. During tests the CPU can hit up to 130W All-core package power bursts while 65W is sustained in the majority of multi-core tests. Users can also select the Unlimited Power mode on certain motherboards which will allow the CPU to utilize up to 150W+ power in all-core workloads but doing so will result in a lot of heat so you'll need a better cooler. Alva was using the stock air cooler so a high-end heatsink or liquid cooling is recommended if you want to push the chip this hard.

When it comes to benchmarks the Intel Core i5-13500 scored 1834 points (PL1 - 65W) and 1885 points (PL1 - Unlimited) in the Cinebench R23 single-threaded test. In multi-threaded the Core i5-13500 scored 17104 points (PL1 - 65W) and 21103 points (PL1 - Unlimited). While the single-core score doesn't get a huge performance boost the multi-threaded score gets a 23% boost with the unlimited power profile. Even at the stock 65W profile the CPU is on par with the Core i5-12600K but with the Unlimited Power profile the CPU ends up close to the Core i7-12700K which is very impressive for a chip that will cost just slightly above $200 US.

Alva also provides a few notes on his experience with the Intel Core i5-13500 CPU:

Quick Pretest Core i5-13500 notes:

- Run on MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 (1.90 BIOS) and GSkill TridentZ RGB DDR4-3600 2x16GB

- Judging from the L2 Cache seems like an Alder Lake C0 die with 2 less P-Core? - Default detected power config is 65W PL1/154W PL2

- Increasing PL1 from default 65W to Max/Unlimited mode will give massive clock boost - Max Clock 1-Core 4.8Ghz (P-Core)

- Sustained All-core Clock on default 65W Mode 2.9-3Ghz P-Core 2.9Ghz E-Core

- Sustained All-core Clock on Max/unlimited PL1 4.5Ghz P-Core 3.5Ghz E-Core - Default 65W Mode might be feasible for Stock Heatsink

(Temp might be higher just for the initial Burst to 130W ish)

- Unlimited/Max PL1 Power IS NOT RECOMMENDED for Stock Heatsink (will easily hit TjMax) - 65W Multi-Core Performance almost match an i5-12600K on Cinebench R23

- Max/Unlimited Power Multi-Core Performance slightly below i7-12700K!

- Single-Core close to i5-12600K. Quick Summary:

- Pretty Decent overall performance

- Might be run on cheap/value H610 board but PLEASE make sure power is 65W not maxxed out

- Recommended to pair with midrange B660 and Decent 120mm Tower HSF (like Thermalright TA120 EX or ID-Cooling SE-224XT) max out all power limit on the board to get optimal multi-core performance Now I'm not sure if i5-13600K is my best CPU of the year this i5-13500 CPU might have better multi-core performance-per-dollar 😀 *PS : CPU is bought at retail shop not an engineering sample all run with publically available BIOS 😉 Also I need sleep

We have previously reported in our exclusive that the Intel B760 motherboards and Non-K 13th Gen CPUs will be launching at CES 2023 on the 3rd of January so stay tuned for more information. The Intel 13th Gen Non-K CPUs will be compatible with B760 & cheaper B660 motherboards which are plentiful in the new and user market plus being available in DDR5 & DDR4 flavors gives Intel a massive advantage over AMD's Ryzen 7000 Non-X CPUs which are going to launch in January too.

Many know Single Root I/O Virtualization or SR-IOV. The new standard is emerging as Scalable IO Virtualization. Originally this was donated as an Intel specification but it is now part of OCP. The main goal of Scalable IOV is to provide performance paths to access hardware while that hardware is shared in an increasingly virtualized containerize and composable infrastructure.

Scalable IO Virtualization is Replacing SR-IOV

These days SR-IOV is well supported but it is not perfect. SR-IOV was designed originally for 20 or so VMs. The vast majority of cloud instances are 8 vCPUs or less. As we move to 60-128 cores/ 120-256 threads in 2023 and then into several hundred cores per socket going forward each CPU in a dual socket server will easily eclipse that 20 VM mark. Beyond that new devices and topologies with things like CXL mean that the industry needs a different solution. That solution seems like it is going to be Scalable IO Virtualization or Scalable IOV.

The main benefits that OCP members like Microsoft are touting are scalability flexibility over-provisioning and compatibility. For those wondering SR-IOV can still be supported with backward compatibility in a Scalable IOV system.

Scalable IOV uses hardware-assisted efficient routing and has different modes for direct path and intercepted path functions. The intercepted path can be handled in software or on an embedded controller. While allowing more fine-grained and performance and access.

Final Words

If you want some holiday reading material checking out the OCP Scalable I/O Virtualization spec would be a great way to learn more. At STH we will cover Scalable IOV as we start to see it more in future generations of servers.

Since it is Christmas Eve and I am on my second-to-last flight of 2022 I just wanted to share some of my holiday reading material that I have had bookmarked since it was presented at the OCP Summit 2022 Keynote a few months ago.

Markets usually make gains from the first trading session after Christmas through the second trading session of the New Year but will this cost of living crisis year bring a Santa rally?

Figures from Bestinvest show that it is not a myth as December has the highest incidence of any month in providing investors with positive returns with shares making gains 76% of the time a far higher proportion than any other month.

“As the year draws to a close investors could certainly do with some seasonal cheer. Could the month of December offer up a financial Christmas present? Potentially if history is anything to go by. That’s because December has earned a reputation as a typically strong month for stock markets ⁠— a phenomenon dubbed as the ‘Santa Rally’” Jason Hollands managing director at Bestinvest said.

The data also shows that when it comes to the UK stock market using the MSCI United Kingdom Index of large London Stock Exchange listed UK companies the high success rate for December was also evident with the month also delivering positive total returns 76% of the time and with an average monthly gain of 2.26% over the 50 years.

Analysis has identified June as the most dangerous month on average for stock markets both globally and in the UK. Chart: Bestinvest

“However unlike the global snapshot in the UK April had the highest incidence of gains overall delivering positive returns 82% of the time” Hollands said.

Looking at the MSCI World Index which is comprised of more than 1500 of the world’s largest listed companies Bestinvest found that December proved to be the most consistent month for delivering positive global equity gains an average total return of 1.45% for the festive month is also high compared to the average monthly return for global equities across all months over the last half century of 0.95.

Looking at the MSCI World Index average monthly total returns over the last half century ranged from as low as -0.31% in September to as high as 1.71% in January. Chart: Bestinvest

“Particularly impressive Santa Rallies were seen in 2010 (6.8%) in 2008 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (10.2%) and in 1999 at the height of the Dot Com Bubble (6.8%)” Hollands said.

“In his novel Pudd’nhead Wilson the American writer Mark Twain cautioned about October saying: ‘This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July January September April November May March June December August and February.’ Yet even he might have to admit to December’s festive charms as it is easily the best-performing month over time” Russ Mould AJ Bell investment director said.

“Since its launch in 1984 the FTSE 100 index has gained 2.3% on average in December whereas April and July are the only other months to offer an average advance of 1% or more"" he added.

For Mould the Santa Rally is more fact than fiction because the numbers back it up.

“The FTSE 100 has served up 11 annual losses since 1984 and ten of those came after a gain in the December of the previous year ⁠— the only exception was 2015 whose 4.9% annual decline came after a 2.3% slide in December 2014"" Mould added.

“If anything some of the best Decembers have led to the most treacherous subsequent years ⁠— a buoyant festive season in 1993 was followed by 1994’s Fed rate rise shock 1989’s knees-up let investors stumble into a recession and a bear market while 1999’s party led to the hangover that came with the collapse of the technology bubble in 2000.

“If nothing else that may back up Warren Buffett’s old aphorism that: ‘The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs.’""

Explanations as to why stock markets tend to do well in December include the markets getting a boost as City fund managers position for the year ahead investing any spare cash in their funds to ‘window dress’ their portfolios ahead of reporting periods.

Another is that hedge funds who take negative bets on companies ⁠— known as ‘short positions’ ⁠— close out some of these positions before the year end. This would require them to repurchase shares that they have borrowed off other investors in order to sell them and then hopefully repurchase them at a lower price later before returning the shares to the stock lender.

“Of course it could just be a case of seasonal cheer and the magic of the festive season” Hollands added.

Stocks try to get into the Christmas spirit

Stocks did gain ground this week after some good earnings and consumer confidence figures from the US but was it enough?

""The question is whether the bounce off the Tuesday lows is the seasonal Santa rally taking shape. It’s always a bit of a guess at this time of year…you could easily see 4000 retested on the S&P 500 before the resumption of the downtrend which is still in charge overall"" Neil Wilson chief market analyst at Finalto said.

""Bulls would require a breach of 4100 to consider a more sustained rally was taking shape. Ultimately the inflation/recession/tightening narrative cannot be ignored and I believe firmly there is at least one more major flush ⁠— the big one way bigger than we have seen in 2022 ⁠— to wipe out the bulls ⁠— there is just too much bullishness still"" he added.

Washington Capitals defenseman John Carlson was hit in the head by a slapshot in the third period the team’s game against the Winnipeg Jets. He left the ice under his own power after lying on the ice for a few moments.

On the same night that teammate Alex Ovechkin tied Gordie Howe for second all-time in Goals Scored in NHL history Carlson was struck by a slapshot by former teammate Brenden Dillon with not even two minutes gone by in the third frame of play.

Carlson had skated 16:12 prior to exiting the game with two shots on net and was bleeding heavily following the hit but skated to the locker room under his own power trailed by Capitals Head Trainer Jason Serbus. Dillon played for the Caps from 2019-2021 before being traded to the Jets in exchange for two draft picks.

Since early October 2022 Russia’s attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have dramatically increased. With almost weekly strikes against power stations and other energy facilities millions of Ukrainians across the country suffer from massive power and water outages. As temperatures in Ukraine drop below zero experts warn of an imminent humanitarian catastrophe. In this position paper the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) analyses why the Russian attacks against Ukrainian energy infrastructure violate international humanitarian law and could be qualified as war crimes.

In an apparent retaliation for the successful counteroffensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) in the Kharkiv region in early September Russia’s armed forces had launched major attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure including the country’s second-biggest heat and power plant Kharkiv TEC-5 as well as the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Station near Mykolaiv. However such attacks drastically increased after 10 October 2022 with already nine waves of large-scale strikes against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Each wave can be characterized as a massive barrage of up to 70–100 rockets cruise missiles or drones launched in the span of just several hours.

In November 2022 according to Ukrainian authorities about 40% of the country’s energy infrastructure had been seriously damaged with almost no thermal or hydroelectric power plant remaining fully intact. As documented by FIDH’s member organisations the Center for Civil Liberties (CCL) and the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (KHPG) the strikes cause massive power and water outages affecting millions of civilians across the whole country while hundreds of civilians have been killed or injured as a result of the attacks. On 10 December Russia attacked two energy facilities in Odesa with Iranian-made ‘kamikaze’ drones depriving 1.5 million civilians of electricity potentially for several months despite Ukraine’s growing ability to intercept Russian missiles and drones.

On 8 December 2022 Russia’s President Vladimir Putin publicly admitted that Russia’s strikes were deliberately directed against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure insinuating that Russia will not cease targeting power stations and other energy facilities across Ukraine.

The Russian attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure are illegal under international humanitarian law (IHL) the law of armed conflict specifically the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions a treaty that regulates the conduct of hostilities and that has been ratified by both Russia and Ukraine.

Attacks against energy infrastructure under international humanitarian law

International humanitarian law prohibits attacks against civilians and also requires parties to an armed conflict to always distinguish between military objectives and civilian objects. Attacks may be directed exclusively against military targets – objects which by their nature location purpose or use make an effective contribution to the military action of the enemy and whose destruction offers the adversary a definite military advantage in the concrete circumstances. The threat imposed by Russia in its strategic choices is the deliberate conflation of military and civilian targets pushing the conflict into the throes of “total war”.

This reality is leading to the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Not only the soldiers but also their commanders and the Russian leadership must be held accountable for this country-wide violence against Ukraine’s population. The form that this judicial response will take (legal proceedings in Ukrainian courts proceedings based on the principle of universal jurisdiction cases before a Special Tribunal the International Criminal Court etc.) has yet to be defined and will probably be complementary.

International humanitarian law also prohibits acts of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population “without offering any significant military advantage”. In this respect the last few months have marked a critical turning point in the deleterious nature of Russian political discourse. Statements of Russian State officials or Duma members calling the attacks “warning strikes” or “strikes of retribution” with the aim that Ukrainians shall “freeze and rot” indicate that the attacks were carried out with the intention to spread terror among the population by continuously disrupting essential services. Dmitry Peskov the Russian President’s Press Secretary has openly stated that the Ukrainian leadership “has all possibilities to resolve the situation [the strikes against energy infrastructure] in a way to meet the demands of the Russian side and to stop respectively all kinds of suffering of the local population”. The Russian leadership is aware that it is terrorising the Ukrainian population and persists in using it as a military tool despite the ineffectiveness of this strategy in order to get out of the impasse it has put itself in.

Additionally it is unlawful to attack or destroy objects that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population “for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value”. While the provision gives examples of such objects including foodstuffs crops or drinking water installations the list is non-exhaustive and may accommodate electricity and water supply. Even where such objects become military objectives they may only be targeted if they are used either exclusively for the sustenance of the members of the adversary’s armed forces or at least in direct support of its military action. Yet even then such attacks are unlawful if they would lead to an inadequate food or water supply among civilians causing starvation or forcing them to move away.

Applying these rules to the Russian attacks our preliminary analysis shows that the targeted power stations and other energy facilities are civilian objects as they fail to meet the definition of a military objective under international humanitarian law and Russia therefore commits several violations of IHL in targeting these facilities. With winter temperatures plunging up to -20 degrees in Ukraine electricity for heating as well as drinking water become indispensable for the survival of the Ukrainian civilian population. Considering the freezing temperatures the destruction of the energy grid leads to starvation and can also force civilians to move away seeking refuge in other parts of the country or abroad.

Lastly on 8 December Russia’s President Vladimir Putin publicly confirmed that the Russian attacks have deliberately targeted the Ukrainian energy infrastructure. However Putin’s attempt at justification in the form of a rhetorical question – “But who started it?” – falls short. Firstly from publicly available information it seems that the strikes against the Kerch Bridge (if attributable to Ukraine) and the oil storage tank in the Kursk region were consistent with international humanitarian law. Secondly parties to an armed conflict are obliged to respect international humanitarian law “in all circumstances” regardless of whether the adversary complies with it or not. Alleged Ukrainian violations can thus never justify IHL violations committed by Russia. Lastly even if these attacks by the AFU were unlawful reprisals against civilians or civilian objects are expressly prohibited by IHL.

International accountability: Ways forward

In summary the attacks on critical energy infrastructure carried out by the Russian armed forces violate international humanitarian law. They characterise an even more brutal turn in a conflict that now resembles a “total war”. While the representatives of several States have repeatedly condemned Russia’s attacks including in a UN Security Council emergency meeting following the strikes on 23 November the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has already announced that it will further examine the legality of the Russian attacks.

When carried out intentionally attacks against civilian infrastructure and attacks aiming to starve the civilian population amount to war crimes and can be prosecuted by national jurisdictions or by the International Criminal Court (ICC) whose jurisdiction Ukraine has accepted pursuant to Art. 12(3) of the Rome Statute.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phc3Blci1maWVsZC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODQ2MTM4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jasper Field Obituary (2022) - Amsterdam NY - Betz Rossi Bellinger & Stewart Family Funeral Home - Canajoharie,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/jasper-field-obituary?id=38461387 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phc3Blci1maWVsZC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODQ2MTM4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

7 ways Scorpio and Cancer are compatible

Before diving too deep you have a right to know is writing this piece. I’ll be direct. I am not an astrologer or psychic.

Instead I am a Scorpio man who has been formally trained in psychology. For reasons that are beyond my awareness I am drawn to the world of ancient mysticism.

What you see here is a product of that interest.

Using concepts from Jungian psychology (Jung 1953) I write about signs like Scorpio and Cancer as pathways to self-insight. At times I draw upon aspects of psycho-spiritualism; a term used to describe the blending of psychology and spirituality.

Scorpio and Cancer Compatibility Scorpio and Cancer Compatibility

As part of my research I’ve discovered that not all signs are a good match for Scorpio. On the flipside I’ve also learned that Cancer doesn’t always fit well with other Zodiacs.

Let’s be honest. Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs in astrology. It gets tagged with being highly sexual overly possessive and vengeful. See this post on the Scorpio man in love and relationships.

On the other hand Cancer is a feeler. It’s pegged with being overly emotional highly empathic and protective.

But are the stereotypes about these signs true? You are about to find out.

As you continue reading below bear in mind that the material presented is gender neutral focusing only on the pairing between Scorpio and Cancer.

My promise to you as a website visitor is to share information that is straight forward unfiltered and devoid of astro-babble. The ancients didn’t make their teachings complicated and I’m not going to either.

Woven into this post are practical tips on how to best handle Scorpio and Cancer relationships. A video on water signs has also been included; something I’d like you to watch to gain greater insight.

Let’s first look at a chart of primary traits. Take note of the similarities and differences. This will serve as a foundation for all that follows.

Afterward we’ll explore each sign individually and examine how Scorpio and Cancer match in 7 unique life areas.

Cancer: June 22 – July 22

In the traditions of horoscopic astrology Cancers are born into the “Fourth House” of the astrological universe. That’s a fancy term used to describe a symbolic structure that holds karmic traits.

If you were to walk into Cancer’s house you would sense the presence of energy representing security caretaking compassion and empathy. Maternal light is also said to emanate from this house.

The crab is exclusively ruled by our moon located some 29000 miles from where you are right now. It is from this celestial body that Cancer’s powers are derived. (See Cancer man traits).

According to ancient teachings the moon represents deeply held beliefs instincts and the unconscious. Per legend it also infuses Cancer born people with strange psychic powers (Orion 2007).

Main Cancer Traits Include (Positive and Negative):

Compassionate

Super protective

Talkative

Prone to worrying

Highly empathic

Sometimes pessimistic

Animal lover

Clingy

Family oriented

Weak verbal filter

Warm personality

Can be reclusive

Loyal

Scorpio: October 23 – November 21

Individuals who are born under the Scorpio sign fall into the “Eight House” of the Zodiac. If you were to walk through its front door you would find energy forms floating about that sybolize intimacy logic bonding and mystery.

Pluto and Mars rule Scorpio. Mars considered a “hot” planet is fourth in distance from our sun.

Pluto located some 737 million from earth is much further out. It is considered the last planetoid in our solar system. It’s also the coldest and most puzzling to astronomers.

Mars around 141 million miles from the sun symbolizes energy desire passion and action. According to alcimists Pluto vibes out secrecy death mystery obsessiveness and reinvention.

Main Scorpio Traits Include (Positive and Negative)

Curious

Logical

Empathic

Highly sexual

Disconnected

Mysterious

Intense

Dominant

Reclusive

Distrustful

Jealous

Loyal

Water Signs Primer

Both Cancer and Scorpio are are represented by the natural element of water. At their core water signs are thought to be:

Highly intuitive

Empathic and;

Emotionally deep.

There are only three such signs: Cancer Scorpio and Pisces respectively (see Pisces sign).

It’s important you know that not all water signs are the same.

Cancer is a cardinal sign; meaning it has the power to initiate and adapt. They are energetic enthusiastic and compassionate.

Scorpio is a fixed sign; meaning it is accustomed to ritual and doesn’t like change. Think stability and familiarity.

Pisces is a mutable sign. They are good with change and go with the flow.

Why Cancer and Scorpio Match

Now that you have the essential traits of Scorpio and Cancer let’s look at the specific reasons why they match.

As you read through each area notice how one compliments the other.

1. Sexual Energy Between Cancers and Scorpios

To be blunt Scorpio and Cancer put a high premium on emotional bonding. But in the privacy of the bedroom the two vibrate at different frequencies.

Guided by the heat of Mars Scorpio is usually dominant and intense. Many signs cannot handle this type of energy because it’s “too much”.

Tapping into Pluto’s gravitational waves Scorpio also cloaks emotions holding back true feelings.

Cancers empathic and intuitive are uniquely equipped to handle Scorpion sexual energy. That’s because Cancerians are born with a centering chip that balances Scorpio’s wild fluctuations.

If Cancer is able to get Scorpio to reveal emotionally and then connect the end result is often powerful. Without that bond nothing else can happen.

That said the physical energy between both signs is often extreme. Once the two are emotionally linked there’s no need for small-talk as a buildup to intimacy. Initiation of mating is intuitive.

Conversation during bedroom time usually isn’t necessary. That’s because both signs can empathically read one another in an almost supernatural way.

Cancer has one advantage over Scorpio. It can easily “see” through Scorpion defenses and center into arousal zones. This disarms Scorpio and paradoxically pulls the sign into Cancer’s snares.

The Moon’s Impact On Scorpios and Cancers

It’s important to note that because both are water signs they are heavily influenced by the moon. Much of this has to do with astrophysics and the lunar effect on oceanic tides.

So how does it work?

It’s simple. During full moon Cancerians are able to seduce Scorpio into a place of submissiveness; the complete opposite of its usual dominant persona.

Also during full moon when the lunar tides are most high an energy field is generated causing an erotic effect on both Zodiacs.

During this short monthly window physical attraction and sexual energy reach their peak. Mating is often spontaneous powerful and explosive.

When you think about the bedroom pairing of these two signs conjure up mental pictures of passion.

“Scorpio and Cancer put a high premium on emotional bonding”

2. Love Between Cancer and Scorpio

Cancer is one of the most loving signs in astrology. A born caretaker it thrives on helping others and making them feel relaxed.

This is a double edged sword for Cancerians. That’s because they often care too much and sacrifice self-care in the process. The less emotionally revealing a person is the more Cancer is drawn in.

The moon acting as a cosmic force pushes Cancer to seek out and bond with people who live complicated lives.

This is where Scorpio enters the picture; a sign that is arguably one of the most perplexing in the galaxy. Pulsating out light from mars and darkness from pluto Cancer is drawn to Scorpio magnetically.

Conversely Scorpio finds comfort and solace from Cancer; a gift the moon gives to all Cancerian born people.

When it comes to love Cancer and Scorpio match in two ways: 1) emotionally and 2) intuitively. There also exists a deep spiritual connection.

Because they are water signs both are able to “dive deep” into one another’s hearts.

When Scorpio enters an obsessive cycle which happens often Cancer offers balance and understanding. In turn this helps Scorpio return to its normal fixed steady state.

On the flip side when Cancer becomes overwhelmed with the emotions of others Scorpio uses its claws to pull Cancer back from the edge and creates space for renewal.

This is not to say that the two signs live in blissful harmony. They disagree – plenty. But because the pair is so highly tuned into one another friction is usually the bi-product of strong feelings.

Their differences are where their passion comes from.

3. Do Scorpio and Cancer Share Trust?

Trust between Cancer and Scorpio is very high. The reason is simple. Both signs are intuitive and can quickly sense dishonesty.

Should one even think about cheating the other will immediately pick up on it. Trying to hide from one another is useless as each have excellent B.S. detecters.

Both signs place a premium on emotional and physical fidelity. Cancer must be careful to not overreact when others respond to Scorpio’s sexual energy. Conversely Scorpio must be careful to not mistake the crab’s emotional bond with others as cheating.

The trust mentioned above does not happen automatically. It takes time for this develop and requires patience. Once established the link between the two is unbreakable.

“Both signs can intuit dishonesty”

4. Communication Between Both Signs

After bonding has occurred between Cancer and Scorpio communication is a breeze. That’s because both “speak” to one another empathically.

But all is not perfect. There can be friction at the beginning of the relationship. That’s because Cancers are born talkers. They love to chat about everything. It’s just who they are.

Scorpios like to talk too. But during the initial stages of a relationship not so much. You may be wondering why?

It’s simple.

Scorpio knows the more it talks the more it reveals. And revealing anything to others is an anathema to this sign. Remember part of what makes a Scorpio a Scorpio is the mystery.

As time goes on and trust builds Scorpio lowers its guard and lets Cancer in. From there communication increases. Together the pair excels.

Much of their communique is unspoken. There’s an uncanny knowing of what the other is thinking. It’s not hocus pocus either. Instead it’s a powerful intuitive bond that can’t be explained on this realm of reality.

Ask any person in a Cancer-Scorpio relationship about their psychic link. They will verify what I have just shared to be totally true.

5. Intellect Match – Crab and Scorpion

Because Cancer and Scorpio are water signs they come out of the womb curious. They’re also gifted with great analytical abilities used for the purpose of deduction.

Both have a high degree of perceptual intelligence; a 10-dollar term for understanding another’s feelings and emotions.

What attracts one to the other are their unique gifts.

For example Scorpio can at times see things too logically. In turn this causes black and white thinking. Cancer tugs at Scorpio to look through different lenses infusing compassion into the dynamic.

On the flipside Scorpio taps into Cancer’s creative side stimulating the crab to a place of action.

When you reflect on this pairing think of a highly intelligent couple that is curious about the world around them.



6. Money Matters

This life area is a natural match for both signs. Cancer is concerned with all things home related. Stability motivates Scorpio.

Both gravitate towards safety and security. Both are good planners. In short they like money in the bank and aren’t ones for wasteful spending.

That said this doesn’t mean there aren’t disagreements on how money is spent. For example when it comes to big ticket items Cancer likes to buy things for the enjoyment of all at home.

Conversely Scorpio is a miser. It doesn’t always see the benefit of purchasing something for comfort. An example might be balking about buying a T.V.

Nine times out of ten Cancer will win the disagreement. That’s because the crab has a way of appealing to Scorpio’s emotional side.

Money-wise the stereotypical traits of Cancer (worry) and Scorpio (obsessive) actually vibe well together. In the final analysis both work hard to create safety and stability.

7. Shared Interests Cancers and Scorpios

Given that Cancer and Scorpio are water signs both naturally gravitate towards the sea. Swimming surfing fishing and being on the beach are shared areas of interest.

Because Scorpios are fixed signs they are sometimes resistant to new things. That’s not to say they won’t do it. But it takes an energetic sign like Cancer to give the Scorpion a little nudge.

Scorpios love traveling. Cancers get into romantic get-aways. Provided that water (ocean lake) are part of the vacation plans the two do just fine together.

It is important to note that Cancers have an unusual almost psychic relationship with animals. They are able to communicate with creatures of nature in ways that can’t be explained. Moreover animals are strangely attracted to Cancerian energy.

If an injured animal is found Cancers are the ones to take the creature in and nurture it back to health. I can’t explain it. It’s just part of who cancers are.

Scorpios like animals too. But they don’t have the same connection as Cancers do. In fact some creatures avoid Scorpios because they can sense its deep psychic conflicts.

As far as relationships go just keep in mind that dogs and cats are naturally going to gravitate towards the Cancer. It’s just the way things are.

Other areas of interest include spirituality the afterlife ritualism and home. Ancestry and history are also great conversation topics.

Finally the two also enjoy tawdry gossip current events and pop culture.

Key Considerations for Scorpio and Cancer

When thinking about the Cancer and Scorpio pairing the critical thing to keep in bear in mind is the duo are naturally meant to be together.

Part of this relates to both being water signs and part of it has to do with a deep almost uncanny connection the duo share that transcends our collective consciousness.

Scorpio is a strong sign that is fiercely independent and highly protective of people it loves. Cancer shares these same traits yet can moderate its personality in ways that the Scorpion cannot.

That said the duo compliments one another in unique ways that transcend our ability to understand.

Why Cancer and Scorpio match in relationships

One provides what the other lacks

Sexual energy is highly powerful

Both signs are super intuitive particularly with one another

Scorpio can be moved out of its hiding places by Cancer allowing the arachnid to enjoy more things in life.

Cancer benefits from Scorpio’s intellectual and empathic gifts. In turn this allows the crab to be dive deep on a variety of topics

The shared passion between both signs is enduring

Both signs naturally fit together and will unconsciously seek one another out magnetically drawn together

Summary of Cancer and Scorpio

Scorpio and Cancer are highly compatible. They connect emotionally physically and intellectually.

Once a bond has been established the relationship tends to be long term. We’re talking lifetime here.

The duo makes for wonderful parents offering children a caring stable and loving environment.

The one take-away I hope you experience after absorbing all that was presented here is this: Cancer and Scorpio share a unique bond that is as old as the universe itself.

In many ways they are a mystical and powerful match.

[To the tune of Rudolph]:

You know Mayo and Markman and Alice and Fintiv;

Juno and Axle (American) and Amgen and Teva.

But do you recall … the handful of Federal Circuit decisions that got little press but may be important to your practice at all?

Didn’t think so. (Although this may be exaggerated—it depends on how much you read and what you remember from it.)

Neither did I so I searched through the last year of precedential U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit opinions to find those that may have important nuggets in them even though they weren’t high-profile or didn’t involve billions in damages.

These are those decisions.

Kyocera Senco Industrial Tools Inc. v. ITC 22 F.4th 1369 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 21 2022)

Experts play a huge role in patent litigation. The Kyocera case suggests the presence of a nuclear weapon that could kill experts and then kill their clients’ cases. The case was about power nailers—those tools that roofers and framers haul around to drive many more nails than they could drive manually. The relevant expert had expertise in the more general area of fastener driving tools but not in the specific area of power nailers. The case does not hold that your expert has to map perfectly to your technology but it does make available an argument whenever your opponent’s expert has a background in an adjacent technology. The tactic going forward will involve citing Kyocera and then convincing your trial judge that the opposing expert is too far away—at least as far away as the Kyocera expert (who seemed pretty darn close to tell the truth). It’s hard to believe the Federal Circuit will repeat this holding often but it is a potentially killer tool for any patent litigator.

Dyfan LLC v. Target Corp. 28 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 24 2022)

For those who practice in software Dyfan may be a critical means-plus-function decision. That is so because software is largely described (and claimed) by the functions it performs when it is executed and purely functional claim limitations in apparatus/system claims are supposed to be subject to means-plus-function treatment. This can result in the particular limitation being limited to a computer that performs the particular algorithm that the patent describes (see WMS Gaming) which can be very narrow. Or if the patent describes no such algorithm which is common because drafters often fall into means-plus-function-land without intending it then the claim is invalid.

Dyfan held at least in one context that the common software terms “code” and “application” (modified by certain functional language) connoted enough structure to avoid construction as means-plus-function terms (see Zeroclick)—based in part on unrebutted testimony from the patentee’s expert. The court reached a similar conclusion for the term “system” where that was the only term of substance in a preamble. This decision is important because many software claims use similar language and probably would be invalid as indefinite if they were found to be subject to means-plus-function treatment.

Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude Medical S.C. Inc. 30 F.4th 1339 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 11 2022)

While we’re on indefiniteness it can arise in a variety of ways—like means-plus-function limitations that don’t have corresponding structure but also claims that use subjective claim terms—most famously the term “aesthetically pleasing” found in Datamize back in 2005. In Niazi this year the Federal Circuit ruled that the flexible terms “resilient” and “pliable” were not too subjective. Rather the record provided objective boundaries by which a skilled artisan could identify their scope: “[t]he terms are broad but they are not uncertain.” This is a good case for patentees whose opponents are suggesting that claims (e.g. those that recite things descriptively or with terms of degree) are defective unless the patentee can provide a construction that has numeric precision.

Intuitive Surgical Inc. v. Ethicon LLC 25 F.4th 1035 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 11 2022)

Let’s talk quickly about post-grant. It’s been said that most of the front-and-center issues have been hammered out. Intuitive involved an issue not front-and-center because it came up only through particular actions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Specifically two inter partes reviews (IPRs) had been filed against a patent on the same day but the USPTO—rather than deciding them simultaneously decided only one and then dismissed the other as estopped under 35 U.S.C. § 315(e)(1). The Federal Circuit agreed that the USPTO could effectively change two parallel IPRs into serial IPRs—and then dismiss one at the very end. Keep this decision in mind if you are facing a complex IPR that won’t readily fit within the page limits and are tempted to split it into two.

California Institute of Technology v. Broadcom Ltd. 25 F.4th 976 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 4 2022)

The Federal Circuit used to apply a presumption against extraterritorial application of U.S. patents. The Supreme Court changed that in WesternGeco a case about 271(f)(2) infringement. Little progress has been made since to identify how much WesternGeco broadened the more common area of § 271(a) infringement. In CalTech v. Broadcom the Federal Circuit at least approved of a district court refusing to instruct a jury that there is a presumption against extraterritoriality for patent damages since there was no dispute that the laws apply only domestically and the dispute was whether the nature of the accused activities was foreign or domestic. This is a big issue because so much innovation-related activity occurs in the U.S. followed by manufacturing sales and use that occur outside the U.S. I draw your attention to this issue so that you can recognize how much WesternGeco upset the underlying law and perhaps make new post-WesternGeco law in this area.

Auris Health Inc. v. Intuitive Surgical Operations Inc. 32 F.4th 1154 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 29 2022)

I can’t go without citing a decision on obviousness which is present everywhere now that IPRs dominate the Federal Circuit’s IP docket. Auris is (indirectly) a case about objective indicia of nonobviousness. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board had found claims not proven invalid because of skepticism in the art—i.e. doctors were not enthusiastic at the time of the invention on the emerging field of robotic surgery. But the Federal Circuit ruled 2-1 that such evidence did not stand in the way of finding that there was a motivation to combine because that skepticism was too general. To get weight the skepticism needed to be directed more to the particular robotic surgery problem and solution in this case. Be careful to align the views of the relevant public with the particular invention not with some more general issue about the field of the invention.

Cupp Computing AS v. Trend Micro Inc. __ F.4th __ (Fed. Cir. Nov. 16 2022)

This simple case is hot off the presses and made precedential a basic point that the court had previously made in a non-precedential opinion—i.e. the “Board is not required to accept a patent owner’s arguments as disclaimer when deciding the merits of these arguments.” Such a rule had long been true for normal prosecution because it encouraged applicants to amend so as to make claim scope clearer to the public (a laudatory goal). Here the Federal Circuit recognized the goal of IPR that allows the USPTO to “revisit” its decisions such that patent owner efforts to “shapeshift” claims should be blocked. Notably IPR disclaimers are binding in later litigation—so that for the most part they can hurt a patent owner but not help them.

As you nestle down with hot cocoa a cozy fire and your family be comforted by the knowledge that you now know more about your profession than you did ten minutes ago. What gift could be better than that?

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital (IRB-TPEVGH No.: 2021-11-006AC) and carried out in accordance with the IRB guidelines and regulations. The requirement for informed consent was waived in this retrospective cohort study with data anonymity by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Patient selection for RPD was determined by patient preferences after detailed counselling about the innovative nature of RPD as well as its advantages and disadvantages and the availability of a robotic machine. Patients with previous upper abdominal surgery which could be associated with severe adhesion and long vascular encasement more than 2 cm were not considered for RPD. Patient demographic and clinical variables were assessed which included sex age body mass index (BMI) diabetes mellitus (DM) American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification clinical presentations and diagnosis. Additionally pathological variables such as malignancy tumor size lymph node status perineural invasion lymphovascular invasion and stage were included for evaluation. Intraoperative variables were surgical approach (RPD vs. OPD) PPPD operation time blood loss vascular resection and tumor radicality. Postoperative variables for evaluation included surgical mortality and a variety of complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Study endpoints

The primary study endpoint was to clarify the incidence of DGE in RPD with extracorporeal hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy involving careful downward positioning of the stomach while the secondary study endpoint was to identify the risk factors associated with DGE after RPD and OPD.

Surgical technique

RPD and OPD were performed with the same surgical technique by the same team led by Shyr YM. All the RPDs were carried out with the assistance of Si or da Vinci Xi Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc. Sunnyvale CA USA). There were some differences in the technique used between the OPD and RPD groups. In the RPD group the Harmonic® scalpel an energy device was used for the small vessel division and Hem-o-lok® systems (Teleflex Inc. Chelmsford MA USA) were selectively for the large vessels. Most of the vascular pedicles were cauterized or selectively ligated in the OPD.

After a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy reconstruction was completed involving an end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy and end-to-side gastrojejunostomy on the same jejunal limb. The pancreatic reconstruction was completed with a modified Blumgart pancreaticojejunostomy described previously in detail151718. In the RPD group all the resected specimen were extracted through a 4–6 cm umbilical wound. To facilitate anastomosis and save time the small umbilical wound was also used for the extracorporeal hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy involving a careful downward positioning of the stomach. The final position of gastrojejunstomy was antecolic antiperistaltic and inframesocolic near the umbilicus region (Fig. 1). Therefore the stomach was in a relatively vertical position after the RPD (Fig. 2A B). In the OPD group the jejunal limb was pulled upward for the gastrojejunostomy and the final position was antecolic antiperistaltic and supramesocolic. Thus after OPD the stomach was relatively horizontal in position and just beneath the large abdominal incisional wound (Fig. 2C D).

The right gastric artery was routinely divided in our practice. PPPD was attempted initially whenever possible; otherwise a limited antrectomy was done for those with ischemic pylorus after dividing the right gastric artery. After surgery intravenous proton pump inhibitors were routinely administered to all the patients. Upon the resumption of food intake medications were administered orally. Prophylactic octreotide or prokinetic drugs were not used after surgery. The nasogastric tube (NGT) that was routinely placed before surgery was removed if the volume of the NGT drainage was ≤ 300 c.c. and there were no gastrointestinal disturbances. Oral intake with a clear liquid diet was started usually before postoperative day (POD) 3. Abdominal X-ray after oral contrast intake was conducted for those with suspicious DGE.

Definitions of surgical complications

In this study DGE was referred to as a clinically significant grade B or C based on the criteria proposed by the ISGPS11. DGE was subdivided into ISGPS grade A B and C in order of increasing severity. Grade A was defined as requiring an NGT within POD 4–7 reinsertion of the NGT after removal on POD 3 or inability to tolerate a solid diet by POD 7. Grade B was defined as requiring NGT from POD 8–14 reinsertion of the NGT after POD 7 or inability to tolerate a solid diet by POD 14. Lastly grade C was defined as the inability to discontinue the NGT reinsertion of the NGT after POD 14 or inability to tolerate a solid diet by POD 21.

POPF was referred to in terms of a clinically relevant grade B or C pancreatic leakage based on the 2016 new grading system by the International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistula19. Postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) and chyle leak were classified using the standardized criteria proposed by the ISGPS2021. Resection radicality was stratified into three categories based on the resection margin status: R0 cancer-free margin without gross and microscopic evidence of cancer cells at the resection margin under a definition of margin > 0 mm instead of 1 mm defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network; R1 a resection with microscopically positive cancer cells at the resection margin but grossly negative; and R2 a resection with grossly positive cancer cells at the resection margin. Therefore R0 was curative PD while both R1 and R2 were palliative PD in this study. Surgical mortality was defined as death within 90 days after surgery including the same period of admission and hospital readmission after the operation.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was carried out by Statistical Product and Service Solutions version 21.0 software (SPSS Inc IBM Armonk NY USA). The mean continuous variables distributed normally were compared between groups using the two-tailed Student’s t test. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for continuous variables without normal distribution. All continuous data were presented as median (range) and mean ± standard deviation. Nonparametric statistical tests were used if the variables did not follow a normal distribution. Categorical variables were presented as the number (percentage) and compared using Pearson’s χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test contingency tables. Variables that were considered significant (p < 0.05) in the univariate analysis were entered into the multivariate analysis to perform binary logistic regression.

ATLANTA — Parts of metro Atlanta's infrastructure are coming apart as the blast of arctic weather continues across the state with residents and businesses alike are feeling the harsh impacts of the sub-freezing temperatures just one day before Christmas.

Burst water pipes are now one of the major consequences being felt by places such as Delta Sky Lounge Putt Shack Lenox Square Marietta Diner and residences across the metro.

A shopper at Lenox Square captured pools of water sitting on the first floor of the mall after pipes burst causing flooding which subsequently caused the entire wing of the floor to be closed.

Another viewer captured water spewing from the ceiling as she turned the corner of one of the hallways inside the popular shopping destination just a day before Christmas.

Lenox Square released the following statement regarding the burst pipes and subsequent flooding:

""Due to extremely cold temperatures a ruptured sprinkler head in Lenox Square’s ceiling leaked water onto the common area floor. For the safety of our patrons a section of the common area was roped off by security. This swift action prevented mall patrons from traversing a potentially hazardous area and allowed housekeeping to mitigate water from spreading. Lenox Square operations staff has successfully shut off the water to the ruptured sprinkler head and cleanup efforts continue. Closed tomorrow for the observance of the Christmas holiday Lenox Square will resume its normal operations Monday Dec. 26.""

A traveler at the Atlanta airport sent 11Alive the following video on Instagram of the Delta Sky Lounge -- with water pouring down from the ceiling onto computers at one of the lobbies.

In addition to popular places such as the ones listed above residents experienced severe flooding from burst water pipes at The Atlantic Brookwood apartment complex located at 2035Peachtree Road NE in Atlanta.

Another resident experienced devastating flooding in Cobb County at the Galleria Manor Senior Apartments in Smyrna.

11Alive spoke with Phyllis Thompson who lives at that complex. She said that she first heard the alarms and then describes what she saw out of her bedroom window.

""I just saw torrential water coming down"" she said. ""And then I heard the bathroom puttering water but within the course of 10 minutes the bathroom is flooded the kitchen is -- everything is flooded. So I don't know what to do now.""

Daphne and Ron Tardy live at Galleria Manor and felt horrified seeing their bedroom.

“She opened the door and it was raining cat and dog. I mean raining! The thump she heard was that clock. The clock fell off the wall. It was right there"" Ron said.

A burst water pipe on the roof of the building caused all the damage and flooding to numerous units.

“I looked out my balcony window at my bedroom window and I just saw torrential water coming down"" Thompson said.

Thompson's apartment is also covered in inches of water.

“It’s coming out of the light fixtures is coming out of the carbon monoxide detectors"" Thompson said. ""It's coming out of the ceilings. It's just coming from everywhere.”

Neighbors are helping her but this couldn't have happened at a worse time on Christmas Eve.

Most people who live in the apartments have renter's insurance and are filing claims to replace damaged furniture and other items.

“It's Christmas weekend so I really don't know. We're going to contact the insurance company and see if they can be of any assistance to us and maybe have to reach out to some friends and family"" Daphne Tardy said.

People who live at the Galleria Manor Senior Apartments in Smyrna are dealing with flooding on #ChristmasEve due to a burst water pipe on the roof.

Ron Tardy couldn't believe his eyes seeing his bedroom.

City of Smyrna Fire Department said the broken pipe was isolated to the sprinkler system. Fire officials said the apartment maintenance crew are working to fix the issue.

Take a look at Thompson's flooding issues below:

Residents in Douglas County have also experienced flooding as a county official released a statement saying that drivers should avoid the intersection of Highway 5 and Douglas Boulevard due to residential flooding that has iced over roadways.

In the statement officials said that drivers are experiencing ""gridlock traffic"" because of it.

It said in an official statement: “The company is currently assessing all the bids and constructive discussions are continuing with interested parties and their advisers.”

Matalan also explained that in addition the ad hoc group of existing First Lien Noteholders (the ‘AHG’) represented by Invesco Man GLG Napier Park and Tresidor which now holds over 70% of the First Lien Secured Notes has reconfirmed its commitment to a recapitalisation if necessary.

At the time of Matalan going up for sale its founder and chairman John Hargreaves announced his intention to step down in order to take part in the sales process as a bidder.

He said: “Matalan is a business that has been in my DNA since the day I founded it in 1985. I am stepping down as chairman so that I can participate in the strategic sales process as a bidder. My focus and absolute commitment will remain to do what I believe is in the best interests of the company and all its stakeholders in particular the 11000 people we employ. My intention is to be instrumental in positioning the business for long-term success.”

According to The Sunday Times Hargreaves remains in the running and has teamed up with private equity firm Elliott Advisers for a 50-50 bid however Matalan’s senior lenders and Alteri and OpCapita are also thought to have finalised their bids for the retailer.

Institutional investors have earmarked up to $110 billion to purchase or build single-family rentals Insider reported. The estimate comes from Zelman & Associates which hailed the amount as the most ever accumulated by investors to acquire U.S. homes. Of the $110 billion $30 billion has already been committed to properties being leased or developed a Zelman investment banker added.

The money is enough for roughly 400000 homes. Institutional investors already own about 700000. That is only 3 percent of the nation’s 20 million single-family rentals according to Roofstock but MetLife Investment Management predicts it will grow to 40 percent by 2030.

The players gearing up for a homebuying spree in the $4.4 trillion single-family rental market run the gamut but include major names. Invitation Homes Tricon Residential Blackstone and KKR are among them as are wealth managers and pension funds such as CalPERS and Invesco.

Investors are looking for a better bet than their traditional property holdings including office buildings which are struggling. In addition to single-family rentals they have been drawn to multifamily buildings and industrial assets.

Institutions pumped $50 billion into the single-family rental market during the first two years of the pandemic John Burns Real Estate Consulting estimated. But the market has shifted in recent months as rising mortgage rates sidelined not only individuals but institutions.

Single-family rental transaction volume was down 70 percent year-over-year through November according to an estimate by Adam Stern the CEO of Strata SFR.

The housing market is presenting an opportunity for investors though as many individuals want to live in houses but don’t want to buy at the moment because prices and mortgage rates have jumped — or they expect to move in the near future.

Prices could decline in 2023 as more homes are listed for sale. Investors are also working with builders on built-to-rent communities allowing investors to score deals and builders to ease inventory crunches.

By comparison 2021 saw a total of 18 multifamily sales hit the triple-digit mark according to data provided by CoStar.

There were only seven deals to reach $100 million over an eight-year period from 2013 to 2020.

“We joke that every deal now is a $100 million deal” Brett Moss managing director of the brokerage firm Berkadia told GrowthSpotter. “Evaluations have risen so quickly post-COVID. Rents were increasing at a pretty good clip and with rents going up like that values tend to follow.”

However as interest rates continue to climb while pushing debt levels up industry experts expect multifamily investment activity to cool off going into 2023.

The 389-unit Radius located just north of Lake Eola was acquired in October by California-based G.W. Williams Co. International Real Estate Investments with a closing price of $155 million according to Orange County deed records. That’s the highest-priced apartment sale of 2022.

“We can expect investment sales activity during the first half of 2023 to be slower than it has been for the last two years” said Lisa McNatt Director of Market Analytics with CoStar.

Moss and his team were involved in a recent high-dollar apartment sale. The brand-new 300-unit Ascend South Creek near Lake Nona sold to California-based Versity Invest for $100 million on Nov. 21. Berkadia represented the seller DHI Communities. The affiliate of D.R. Horton finished building the asset earlier this year.

At the time of the sale Ascend South Creek was about 95 percent occupied Moss said.

“People are looking for high-growth markets and Orlando continues to be at or near the top of the list for population growth and employment growth” he said. “Even in light of heading into a big slowdown in economic activity where folks are not being as aggressive as what we saw in the beginning of the year I still think Orlando from a fundamentals perspective just jumps off the page.”

Ascend South Creek is located at 3060 Southcreek Blvd just southwest of Boggy Creek Road and the Orlando International Airport. It’s also a short drive from Lake Nona one of Central Florida’s hottest residential submarkets.

Ascend South Creek is located at 3060 Southcreek Blvd just southwest of Boggy Creek Road and the Orlando International Airport. It’s also a short drive from Lake Nona one of Central Florida’s hottest residential submarkets.

The community features a 24-hour fitness center and yoga room resort pool business and game lounge and a spacious bark park and wash station according to its website. Units are available in two or three bedrooms and come with screened-in patios and large walk-in closets.

The seller DHI Communities nor the buyer Versity Invest could be reached for comment.

Versity Invest’s portfolio includes two other assets in the Orlando market both of which were snagged in the past two years. The 340-unit Vintage Horizon West developed by TDK Construction was purchased in April for $119.6 million while the 306-unit Astoria at Celebration in Osceola County was acquired in May of 2021 for $74.5 million.

For the Ascend South Creek purchase Versity took out a $45.9 million mortgage from commercial real estate financing firm Walker & Dunlop.

Versity isn’t the only company heading into the new year with a fresh addition to its portfolio.

The apartment building is seven stories stepping down to six stories with a variety of walk-up and live-work units on the ground floor.

Dallas-based Conti Capital paid $107 million on Dec. 20 for the 285-unit Alta Health Village apartments which were completed earlier this year by Ustler Development and Wood Partners. The Greystone provided financing in the form of a $56.58 million balloon mortgage. The urban-style project across from the AdventHealth Cancer Institute on N Orange Avenue is seven stories with structured parking and a rooftop pool deck with views of downtown Orlando.

This was Conti’s second acquisition in 2022 of an Orlando Alta-branded community following its purchase in April of Alta Winter Garden — also for $107 million.

On Dec. 12 Charleston S.C.-based The Beach Company made its entry into the Florida market by buying the 260-unit Marina Landing apartments.

The garden-style community built in 1991 is located at 6413 Westgate Dr. — between S. Hiawassee Road and State Road 435 — in West Orlando.

Marina Landing Apartments built in 1991 is located at 6413 Westgate Dr. — between S. Hiawasee Road and State Road 435 — in West Orlando.

The company is planning a premium-quality interior renovation as well as an upgrade to amenities according to a post on its LinkedIn page announcing the transaction.

For this transaction The Beach Company took out a $27.8 million loan from U.S. Bank National Association.

The year draws to a close with a number of high-end apartment sales.

Here’s a list of the top three most expensive according to CoStar:

The 389-unit Radius located just north of Lake Eola was acquired Thursday by California-based G.W. Williams Co. International Real Estate Investments with a closing price of $155 million according to Orange County deed records.

The asset’s original developer Banner Real Estate Group was the seller. Newmark‘s Executive Managing Director Scott Ramey led the team that brokered the sale.

The 384-unit Jefferson Lake Howell in Casselberry sold in March for $154.1 million to Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust. That sale was also brokered by Newmark.

The 372-unit Elan Ruby Lake sold for $153.6 million in June to New York-based BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation.

According to Ramey with Newmark there are two reasons why 2022 saw so many uber-expensive apartment deals.

“The majority of these sales were all of brand new construction assets which typically are achieving the highest rents in the market causing higher prices per unit” he said.

Two: Location.

“There is a ton of demand from investors looking to enter the Orlando market which led to record levels of competition particularly during the first half of the year and buyers who were willing to pay a higher price and accept a lower return in order to buy an asset in our market” Ramey said.

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration chief stated in a public filing on Thursday that she was therefore obligated to deny an application filed by a group of 11 major truckload operators seeking an exemption from federal regulations to require positive hair tests be reported into FMCSA’s Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse.

Those tests administered by carriers either randomly to their current drivers or as part of preemployment screening would have been made available to other carriers querying the database for drug test information on potential hires.

But Hutcheson affirmed what her agency had already asserted in August when the carriers’ application was posted for public comment: FMCSA lacks the authority to amend the rules.

“The applicant asserts that FMCSA does have the statutory authority to grant its exemption request citing [federal code] which requires that FMCSA adopt regulations permitting pre-employment hair testing for controlled substances as an alternative to urine testing” Hutcheson noted in her decision.

However “by ignoring the requirement that FMCSA follow the HHS [Health and Human Services] mandatory guidelines for hair testing … the applicant effectively argues that this provision be read in isolation. This approach disregards an accepted standard of statutory construction which provides that statutory text must be construed as a whole.”

Alliance considering HHS as next move

The decision to be published in the Federal Register on Friday marks the second time in three years that the carrier group known as the Trucking Alliance has failed to get FMCSA to tighten its drug-screening requirements prior to formal approval of mandatory guidelines from HHS. Those guidelines issued in September 2020 are still under review.

Asked to comment on the decision Robert Moseley of Moseley Marcinak Law Group one of the firms representing the alliance said it seems FMCSA feels hamstrung by the provision that it be required to wait on HHS before allowing for hair testing. Moseley points out that the provision language was part of a conference report accompanying the statute and therefore does not have the force of law.





“I think they feel powerless to deal with anything having to do with hair testing because of that provision” Moseley told FreightWaves.

“But I think we’re in a position now where we may bring this FMCSA decision over to HHS directly and request a temporary change in policy until they formalize the mandatory guidelines. It’s just not an acceptable answer to say the industry has all these positive hair tests but they can’t be shared with anyone.”

Big-carrier statistics support hair testing

Those in support of the Trucking Alliance including the Institute for Safer Trucking (IST) contend that despite statutory obligations FMCSA also has a mission to make trucking safer.

“In pursuit of this the [FMCSA] should empower motor carriers to make the safest hiring decisions” IST stated in joint comments filed with Road Safe America. “The Trucking Alliance and its members have demonstrated that hair testing can help achieve this by effectively preventing unsafe drug-using drivers from getting into their trucks and on our roads.”

One of those members J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT) has been using hair testing as a matter of company policy since 2006. Over those 16 years 191972 truck driver job applicants submitted to both the urinalysis test currently required by the U.S. Department of Transportation and a hair test the company told FMCSA in support of the exemption. Its hair test regime flagged 7159 of those applicants — 3.7% — for illegal drug use.

“Had J.B. Hunt only relied on the DOT test we would have likely hired 6443 of those drivers because 90% of them passed the DOT urinalysis” according to the company. “But while J.B. Hunt disqualified those drivers for employment most of them likely applied for and obtained work at other trucking companies that rely only on the DOT-required preemployment urine test.”

Owner-operators: Hair tests are a flawed approach

But many small trucking companies and owner-operators counter that while hair testing for drugs such as marijuana can likely show low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the tests do not indicate when the drug was used.

“Many individuals have never driven under the influence of any drugs or alcohol but because a hair test may show traces of a drug like marijuana for weeks it makes them an ‘abuser’ and greatly inhibits their ability to earn a living. This is unjust” commented OOIDA President and CEO Todd Spencer.





“Just because a small percentage of trucking companies opt to screen their drivers using hair testing does not mean the process should be used for the entire industry. Companies that must resort to these measures to compensate for excessive turnover rates may find hair testing appropriate; however that does not mean their methods which are not standardized should be implemented.”

The greenway is a 40-mile trail extending from south Fayetteville to Bella Vista according to the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission.

In 2000 the commission began a long-range planning process that included existing regional trails. The inaugural 36 miles of the greenway were designed and developed in 2009 and 2010 when the commission received $30 million in private money and public grants according to the website razorbackgreenway.org.

The original plan connected 19 shared-use paved trails into a continuous greenway from south Fayetteville to Lake Bella Vista. The 36-mile trail was officially dedicated May 2 2015. Since then under the leadership of the NWA Razorback Greenway Alliance 4 miles have been added to round out the Razorback Greenway's total to 40. The trail now begins at ""mile 0"" at Kessler Mountain Regional Park in Fayetteville and ends at Mercy Way Bridge in Bella Vista according to the website.

Josh Stacey recreation services manager with Bentonville Parks and Recreation Department said city crews take care of everything from mowing to sanitation services along the approximately 8.5-mile part of the greenway rolling through the city.

People who use the greenway want its appearance kept up he said. Consistency such as a cohesive look with signs also is expected he said.

""All the cities do their part to keep the greenway looking nice"" he said.

A brand refreshening for the greenway paid for by private donors will include the newly launched razorbackgreenway.org website and interactive map. An online merchandise store also is expected to go live soon and there will be improvements such as updated signs along the entire greenway. The work should wrap up next spring said Tristan Hill Razorback Greenway Alliance's greenway manager.

Consistency in signs along the greenway is important as it helps people in getting where they want to go on the trails Hill said.

""That's why we've introduced new tools like the city colorway system which labels signs with a distinct color unique to each city so that trail users can know where they're at and where they're headed at a quick glance"" Hill said.

There is a standard for upkeep many people expect when they step out on the greenway he said.

""The trail system was very ahead of its time at its inception and the cities of Northwest Arkansas have been and still are eager to continue to support active transportation"" he said. ""For those reasons I think people are well aware of what Northwest Arkansas is capable of when it comes to maintaining the region's elite trail systems. We set high expectations for ourselves when the greenway was planned and built several years ago and now we want to maintain those standards that we have created.""

Established in 2020 the purpose of the Northwest Arkansas Razorback Greenway Alliance is to provide a multi-jurisdictional approach to trail governance to ensure the greenway remains best in class nationally and continues to improve and innovate. The seven communities represented are Bella Vista Bentonville Rogers Lowell Springdale Johnson and Fayetteville according to the Razorback Greenway website.

The greenway connects three hospitals 23 schools the University of Arkansas and the corporate headquarters of JB Hunt Transport Services Tyson Foods and Walmart.

Rogers maintains a little over 7 miles of greenway said Jim White Parks and Recreation director.

""Mainly we mow and weed eat those 7-plus miles with a minimum of two 4-foot swipes on either side [of the trail]"" he said.

In the past couple of years the Walton Family Foundation granted the city $1 million for repairs and enhancements on the part of the greenway in Rogers White said.

""I can guarantee you that as far as Rogers goes there is a demand for these type of amenities"" White said. ""But it is high for all park amenities. The region is growing and we have many people moving to Northwest Arkansas from metropolitan areas with great park amenities.""

Chad Wolf Springdale Parks and Recreation director said his staff maintains about 9 miles of the greenway. About $40000 a year is used for that work he said.

The department's scope is to maintain 10 feet on either side of the trail which includes mowing edging trimming weed eating and anything else within that combined 20 feet. Irrigation and lighting within those parameters also is maintained by the city he said.

""We also take care of the maintenance in our downtown entertainment district which consists of Emma Avenue Shiloh Square and Turnbow Park"" Wolf said.

Byron Humphry Fayetteville Park maintenance superintendent said the city doesn't have a specific budget used to maintain the greenway. That work is figured into the overall parks budget he said.

About 13 miles of the greenway are in Fayetteville.

Humphry said there's certainly an expectation the greenway maintenance be consistent for the whole 40 miles.

""Since the greenway goes through many different jurisdictions that's why the Razorback Greenway Operations and Maintenance plan was drafted and adopted by the different cities"" he said.

There is a about 3 miles of greenway in Bella Vista with an additional 2½ miles of greenway under design said Cassi Lapp city communications director.

The city spends about $16000 to maintain the part of the greenway in its jurisdiction though that much is rarely spent due to a great volunteer base that helps out Lapp said.

Typical maintenance work includes sweeping; vegetation management including tree and branch trimming the removal of fallen debris mowing and erosion control; litter and trash removal; the repair of trail structures; the repair of signs/maps; pavement marking refreshing including trail crossings and trail centerline stripe; and servicing drinking fountains Lapp said.

The notice of rejection published Friday Dec. 23 on the Federal Register.

The TA applied for the request in August along with motor carriers Cargo Transporters Dupré Logistics LLC Frozen Food Express J.B. Hunt Transport Inc. KLLM Transport Services Knight Transportation Maverick Transportation LLC Schneider Swift Transportation US Xpress and May Trucking Co.

Hair testing is in use by employers and court systems across the continent but it hasn’t yet been approved for controlled substance testing by the FMCSA.

TA members currently utilize hair testing in addition to urine testing.

However regulations don’t recognize hair testing for FMCSA purposes including compliance with testing reporting and record keeping policies. Because of this carriers that test hair samples must also test urine samples adding considerable cost to the testing process.

Hair testing can detect the use of cocaine within the past 90 days and even longer in some cases. The same goes for amphetamines and other controlled substances.

In its denial the FMCSA said that the TA’s argument ignores the requirement that the FMCSA follow the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) mandatory guidelines for hair testing which have not yet been finalized.

“This approach disregards an accepted standard of statutory construction which provides that statutory text must be construed as a whole” the FMCSA wrote.

The agency said it can’t OK the use of hair testing as an alternative to urine tests until HHS establishes federal standards for hair testing.

The HHS issued proposed Hair Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs in 2020 for public comment but

has not issued a final version.

The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) heralded the FMCSA’s decision.

“The Clearinghouse should not accept the results of any hair follicle testing considering the inconsistencies and inaccuracies involved” OOIDA wrote in comments signed by President Todd Spencer. “Even under current Clearinghouse regulations drivers are not always assured of due process. Not surprisingly drivers have shared legitimate concerns about their employment status following false positives and other contentious results.”

Jay Grimes OOIDA’s director of federal affairs said that the FMCSA’s swift denial of another TA exemption request “highlights the unanswered questions and validity concerns with hair testing. Just because a small percentage of trucking companies opt to screen their drivers using hair testing does not mean the process should be used for the entire industry. OOIDA maintains our opposition to any hair testing mandate.”",,,,,,

(NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Following on from that line of thought we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St we have a full range of analyst estimates for Jack Henry & Associates going out to 2026 and you can see them free on our platform here..

They had until late April to decide whether or not to pick up the fifth-year options on the contracts of 2019 first-round picks Clelin Ferrell Johnathan Abram and Josh Jacobs.

The first two were obvious; there was no way the Raiders were going to pay Ferrell $11.5 million nor Abram $8.034 million for the 2023 season. The fifth-year option decision on Jacobs was slightly (yes only slightly) more complicated. A salary of $8 million or so for a running back is on the high side but you can live with it if it's only for one year -- so long as the player proves himself worthy of such a contract of course.

Jacobs had flashed talent during his first three seasons in the NFL but he was also a mainstay on the injury report and had seemed to take a significant step backward in his second and third seasons following a promising rookie year. After rushing for 1150 yards and seven touchdowns while averaging 4.8 yards per carry as a rookie Jacobs totaled 1937 yards and 21 scores through his next two seasons but did so while averaging just 4.0 yards a pop. His passing-game contributions were muted and despite his gaudy touchdown totals he ranked among the least efficient high-volume backs in the league.

So Josh McDaniels and Dave Ziegler decided not to pick up the fifth-year option on Jacobs' contract deciding instead to take the approximately $3.8 million cap hit for the 2022 season and then see what happens. Well what has happened is that Jacobs has put together the best season of his career and one of the best running-back seasons leaguewide (Jacobs and the Raiders face the Steelers on Saturday at 8:15 p.m. ET on NFL Network stream it on FuboTV).

Through Week 15 he leads the NFL in touches (a career-high 337) as well as rushing yards (a career-high 1495) and yards from scrimmage (a career-high 1858). His 5.1 yards per carry mark is a new career best as is his 6.6 receiving yards per target. He's been much more of a three-down contributor than ever before playing 75% of the Raiders' offensive snaps this season. His career-high prior to this year was just 63%.

Jacobs' six 100-yard rushing games this season are second-most in the league behind only Derrick Henry's seven; and he joined Henry Dalvin Cook Jonathan Taylor and Leonard Fournette as the only active players to rush for 200-plus yards in a game. The 303 yards from scrimmage he recorded in that overtime win against the Seahawks (which included a game-winning 86-yard romp in overtime) were the fourth-most in a single game since 2000.

With Jacobs blowing up this season and headed into free agency next March it's worth taking a deeper look at his season to see where he has improved which areas of improvement are most and least sustainable and what it all might mean for his future contract prospects.

Where Jacobs has improved

Let's start with where Jacobs has improved. He's been both more consistent (his success rate is a career-high 46.2% according to Tru Media) and more explosive (10.3% of his carries have created explosive gains) than ever before. That's a potent combination. He's been able to pull off that dual feat because he's averaging career highs in yards both before and after contact per carry this season. That's allowed him to avoid negative runs (career-low 13.4% of rushes have been stopped at or behind the line of scrimmage) while keeping the chains moving (42.2% of carries have gained 5 yards or more). He's also kept his broken tackle rate around where it was in his first and third seasons rather than the dreadful mark he posted in Year 2 of his career.

Year Success % YBCo/Att YCo/Att Gun YPC % 8-Box % Neg % 5+ Yds % Expl Avoid % 2019 40.5% 1.27 3.48 3.7 19.8% 15.3% 34.1% 9.1% 32.6% 2020 38.8% 1.08 2.82 4.4 25.0% 19.8% 33.7% 8.8% 22.7% 2021 40.6% 1.18 2.84 2.9 17.5% 15.7% 36.4% 6.0% 33.2% 2022 46.2% 1.53 3.61 5.0 18.9% 13.4% 42.3% 10.3% 31.6%

The Raiders have put his skills to their best use on draw plays and done so more often than any other team. According to Tru Media Jacobs has more than twice as many carries on run plays categorized as a draw (when the quarterback acts like he's going to pass to get the rushers up the field then hands it off up the middle) than the next-closest player. Jacobs has 33 such carries for 175 yards while Rhamondre Stevenson has 16 totes for 87 yards on those plays.

He's showcased a wonderful combination of patience and decisiveness in his running style this season. NFL.com's NextGen Stats pegs him as the league's second-most north-south runner this year behind only Khalil Herbert (he ranked 39th out of 52 qualifiers in the same stat last season) but he's also spent about a tenth of a second more behind the line of scrimmage on his average carry this year than last. In other words he's waiting the extra beat for a hole to open up then hitting the jets and bursting through.

He's also done a far better job of pressing the hole until a crease opens up then cutting back into the correct lane. He's done that on both inside and out runs and he's spotted cutbacks up the middle or all the way back across the formation.

When it all comes together on one play it can look pretty wild. His jaunt against Denver earlier this season where he pressed the hole to the right cut all the way back behind three offensive linemen made a jump-cut made three defenders miss in the hole then broke a tackle a few yards downfield and sped away from a safety to tip off a huge gain was a thing of beauty.

Yards after contact and tackle-avoidance are generally things under a running back's control. The ability to create explosive plays usually is as well. But yards before contact the lack of negative runs and even the share of runs that gain 5-plus yards can just as often be attributed to offensive line play and scheme. In other words it's a combination of skill and circumstance that has led to Jacobs' monster season.

The tough part about figuring out what is and isn't sticky from this year's performance is that he had been trending in the opposite direction in so many of these areas. He had been creating fewer and fewer explosive gains and gaining fewer yards after contact with each passing season for example.

What to expect from Jacobs in the coming seasons

So is this the new normal or should we expect a reversion to where he has been going in prior seasons? Annoyingly but predictably the answer is likely somewhere in between. We shouldn't expect this year's version of Jacobs to suddenly be what he is for the next several years. We have a much larger sample of him not being this type of player than we do of him producing at this level.

But we also maybe shouldn't underestimate the ceiling on his production anymore. It didn't seem like he had this type of season in him but clearly he does. So the potential for future payoff over the next few years is there if everything comes together the way it has for him this year. What does that mean for his future in free agency? Honestly I am not sure. Someone is probably going to pay him. You don't have this type of season and then not get a big-money contract. General managers for the most part can't help themselves even if plenty of them know it's not a smart idea to give a long-term deal to a running back. (Yes even one who will be 25 years old next season and is coming off the type of year Jacobs has had.)

As for how big that contract will be it's tough to say. In all likelihood any team giving him (for example) a four- or five-year deal is going to regret at least the last couple years of that pact -- especially if it carries an average annual value in the double-digits of millions of dollars per year. (He could potentially provide enough value over the next few seasons to justify the investment on the front end but even that is uncertain given how his career had gone prior to this season.) There are currently eight backs with contracts that have average annual values in excess of $10 million but I'd say at least four of those teams would like to get out of said contracts as soon as possible and the number figures to climb very soon. That might give teams pause about handing out a similar contract especially to a player who is not already on their roster.

It doesn't help Jacobs that this year's free-agency class is kind of stacked at running back: Saquon Barkley Tony Pollard David Montgomery Miles Sanders Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson Jerick McKinnon Kareem Hunt Jamaal Williams Samaje Perine Alexander Mattison Rashaad Penny Devin Singletary D'Ernest Johnson... all of these guys could hit the market this offseason. The most realistic option might actually be the franchise tag which would pay him a lot of money but for only one year. It wouldn't be a particularly good deal for Jacobs and given his history it might not even be a good one for the Raiders. But it also might be the most likely result after the way this season has gone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyZXN0bGluZ2luYy5jb20vMTE0Nzg5OS9qaW1teS1qYWNvYnMtZGV0YWlscy13aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLXRoZS1kYXktaGUtd2FzLWZpcmVkLWJ5LXd3ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jimmy Jacobs Details What Happened The Day He Was Fired By WWE,"Jimmy Jacobs Details What Happened The Day He Was Fired By WWE

Former WWE producer Jimmy Jacobs was fired for taking a photo. It sounds blunt and simple because it is. Jacobs posed for a photo with The Young Bucks Hangman Page and Marty Scurll during a Bullet Club invasion of the parking lot of Citizen's Business Arena in Ontario CA where WWE was broadcasting an episode of ""WWE Raw.""

""I knew it wasn't gonna be received well that's for sure"" Jacobs told Conrad Thompson on ""The Insiders"" podcast. ""I was in the arena and I think Kevin Owens texted me 'Hey are The Bucks there? Are they there?' And I hadn't heard anything about it from inside the arena. He goes 'Yeah I think they're outside. I think they're shooting something.' So I went out there and it's like 'Holy crap The Bucks are here' and I just saw them we exchanged pleasantries and just as I was getting ready to leave I said 'Hey guys let's take a picture' and I took a picture never intending to post it.""

Jacobs said the photo stuck itself in his mind while he was backstage. ""I was in gorilla position during segment 3 or 4 and I just go 'screw it' and I just post it. I knew there was a chance people wouldn't like it. I didn't care. I look back at it and I really see it almost like a child acting out. 'I want to get in trouble.'""

Jacobs explained that he wanted the same treatment that is supposedly given WWE Hall of Famer Michael Hayes backstage ""but I'm not Michael Hayes so I don't get it.""

According to Jacobs this means he wanted his work to speak for itself. ""I wanted to get in trouble and them be like 'well he's good at his job so let's keep him around.' I wanted to just expand my wings. I wanted to go [exasperated sigh] 'let me just be how I am however weird that is' so I took the picture.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VudGlhbGx5c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9lc3BvcnRzLW5ld3Mta2FybC1qYWNvYnMtcHVsbHMtb2ZmLWEtbXJiZWFzdC1sZXZlbC1zdHVudC1pbi1taW5lY3JhZnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karl Jacobs Pulls Off a 'MrBeast Level Stunt' in Minecraft,"There are some insane stunts YouTubers pull out that incite excitement and thrill.

Karl Jacobs pulls a MrBeast level stunt

Karl Jacobs who is a close friend of Jimmy Donaldson a.k.a MrBeast pulled off an insane stunt. In his recent video Jacobs can be seen playing Minecraft 15000ft above ground. Not only he is playing the Minecraft challenges mid-air but there were also certain insane rules that were set for the challenge.

He was accompanied by ‘Foolish’ and ‘Frank’ two of his friends. The rules of the games were simple. There were three Minecraft challenges- medium hard and extreme. If Karl losses the medium-level challenge ‘Foolish’ will have to jump out. The same goes for Frank if Jacobs dies in the hard challenge Frank has to jump. Finally if Jacobs loses the extreme level then he has to jump.

Among the three of them only Frank stayed on the plane. The others had to jump because Jacobs lost the challenge. Jacobs is innovating and bringing newer ideas to his stream. Like the video ‘Minecraft but I Can Feel Pain’. These are some innovative and risky challenges Jacobs is taking up.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

Johnson was placed on the 15-day injured list during the last road trip due to elbow inflammation.

Pierce Johnson is doing well Brian Snitker said. He was scheduled to throw a touch-and-feel off the bullpen mound today.



No update on Tyler Matzek. He’s been shut down from throwing for a brief period. — Justin Toscano (@JustinCToscano) May 10 2024

Brian Snitker had previously said that they didn’t think the situation with Johnson’s elbow was serious but they wanted to get ahead of it. Johnson has been a key piece of the Braves’ bullpen since he was acquired at the trade deadline last season. Johnson has appeared in 13 games and has a 3.00 ERA and a 2.83 FIP in 12 innings.

Per Toscano there was no update on Tyler Matzek who was also placed on the 15-day injured list with his own bout of elbow inflammation. Matzek has been shut down from throwing.

Matzek missed all of the 2022 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. There was initially talk of him beginning the season on the injured list but he showed enough during the spring to earn a spot on the Opening Day roster. Things haven’t gone well for Matzek though as he has allowed 11 runs in 10 innings across 11 appearances. He’s been hit particularly hard of late allowing six earned runs in his last three innings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tYWZpZ2h0aW5nLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM3MjMvZGVtZXRyaW91cy1qb2huc29uLXJldmVhbHMtaG93LW11Y2gtbW9uZXktaGVzLW1hZGUtZnJvbS1lYS11ZmMtZ2FtZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demetrious Johnson reveals how much money he's made from EA UFC games,"Demetrious Johnson didn’t make a king’s ransom from the EA UFC games but he’s happy with what he received.

A seemingly ever-present topic of conversation in the MMA world is the topic of fighter pay in the UFC. But while that conversation primarily focuses on fighters’ show money win money bonuses and pay-per-view points there are other instances that don’t immediately jump to mind like likeness rights. And while UFC is primarily a fight promotion the company also has a longstanding licensing deal with EA Games to produce the UFC video game series. So how does that work for the fighters?

Well Johnson recently described the entire thing on his YouTube channel.

“One day I’m at home I’m playing video games and I get an email stating that ‘Hey since your likeness is being used a lot in the video game we are sending you a check’” Johnson said. “Now the very first check I got for being in the UFC video game was $25000. A lot of you guys are like ‘That was it?’ Guys think about this $25000 to just be in a video game. I don’t think Ryu [or] Ken has ever gotten a check for $25000. [It’s] $25000 for not getting punched in the face $25000 for just being in a video game because you people love using me as a character. So I was ecstatic.

“How do they dictate how much money you’re going to get paid? I can’t dictate it. You guys actually dictate how much I get paid by how often you guys use me in the game. When you log onto your game let’s say you’re playing offline mode or you’re playing online mode each character you pick it does a little tick and sends the data to the mainframe computer. That’s how they keep track of it. ... They do it for all the games out there because they want to see what characters are being played the most and what game modes you like the most. They’re always tracking your data and keeping all the analytics.

“I think that’s fair. It’s based on your popularity in the game. So if everybody and their mom keeps playing me I will get a bigger check.”

Johnson is widely considered to be one of the greatest fighters in UFC history so it’s not surprising that he’s a popular character choice for fans. In fact Johnson was so popular that he also served as the cover athlete for a specialty edition of EA UFC 3 which “Mighty Mouse” explained came with a little extra money for him.

“So let’s fast forward: The next one that came out was UFC 3 and for this bad boy the next check that I ended up getting was $12500” Johnson said. “Now it’s a little bit lower but I was OK with that because the timeframe of the checks was coming every year or quarter. I wasn’t too worried about it because once again it’s free money just coming to me.

“Now after I did something after my Ray Borg fight they offered me the opportunity to be on the front cover. That’s when they came out with the Icon Edition with me on the front. ... So in order for me to be on the cover I signed an agreement to be on the front cover and with me signing I got a whopping $10000 — $10000 to be on the front cover and it’s pretty dope. I love every bit of it.”

There are currently five iterations of the EA Sports UFC titles with the most recent released this past October. Johnson has been in all of them aside from the first even after leaving the promotion in 2018. Johnson said he has yet to receive his check from the latest edition but for the three version of the game he has been in including his time as a cover athlete “Mighty Mouse” revealed his grand total of payouts comes to just under $75000.

“Let’s fast forward: UFC 4 comes out” Johnson said. “I leave the UFC I’m not part of the company anymore but my character is still in the game and you guys are playing as my character. The next check I get in the mail is another whopping $25000. For being in a game! And it’s absolutely amazing because to me it’s something where your likeness is being used and I think it’s cool where the UFC or EA keeps on paying the athletes for their likeness and that people are using me.

“Now after all that from the first iteration of me being in the game in 2014 all the way to 2024 the total money I have made is a whopping $72500. I think it’s absolutely amazing for me to make that type of money without getting punched in the face.

“Now I have not gotten a check yet for UFC 5 which I’m in the game. ... Obviously when you guys use me as a character and my popularity is still good I will also receive another check from EA or Zuffa or whoever the hell is in charge of the UFC now. So I think it’s pretty cool.”

Likeness rights in sports video games can be wide-ranging. For instance the NFL Players Association struck a deal with the Madden franchise that reportedly paid the players $500 million over a five-year extension while the NBA 2K deal was reportedly for $1.1 billion over seven years. Conversely EA Sports College Football 25 will reportedly only offer athletes featured in the game $600 and a copy of the game."

Our outlook is more challenged than we expected at the start of the year due to the Fed’s tightening campaign the war in Ukraine and rising COVID-19 cases in China.

Rising rates and inflation are impacting the Cincinnati market given the strong manufacturing base within the community. We are also seeing these factors affect M&A activity; however the deal flow remains healthy. While the current market volatility is concerning to investors opportunities remain for those who are focused on investing for the long-term.

Inflation rising rates and the impact on manufacturing

Inflation has dominated the headlines this year and consumers have felt it hit their wallets — to a significant degree as U.S. inflation is at its multi-decade high. And it’s not just consumers. Manufacturers too have felt the impact of inflation and have had to raise their rates to cover the increase in costs.

The headline-making inflation rate is driven in part by pandemic-era disruptions which have started to subside with inventory levels rising and inventory to-sales ratios recovering. Consumers have started shifting from goods to service purchases — just look at summer air travel as an indicator.

There is also growing evidence of excess supply in the trucking industry with global shipping rates rolling over suggesting a portion of the inflation we have seen over the last 18 months was related to COVID-19. Even in the absence of Fed policy action inflation may partially normalize as the pandemic wanes.

The Fed’s plan to aggressively raise policy rates is the fastest hiking cycle since the 1990s. Although the Fed has only just begun its hiking cycle we are already seeing the desired impact of slowing economic activity — one example being the housing market the U.S. economy’s most interest-rate-sensitive sector.

As we move into the second half of the year we will start to see more signs this rate-hiking cycle is accelerating an economic slowdown that was set to happen naturally as the pandemic era stimulus receded.

Prioritizing balance and quality in equity portfolios

We expect trend-like earnings growth through the balance of the year. Across a variety of sectors we see opportunities with high-quality businesses that provide earnings stability and visibility. Health care industrials and technology are our three favorite equity sectors.

Mature health care companies seem particularly compelling as they will benefit from a strong demographic tailwind solid drug development a history of defensiveness in volatile markets and the potential for merger and acquisition activity. Another reason: health care companies tend to have strong balance sheets and consistent earnings growth. Their management teams are reliable capital allocators and they are usually good partners to investors. Consistent dividend growth can be an indicator of quality.

Positioning for structural change

The next cycle will likely feature reconceived and restructured global supply chains with manufacturers bringing their factories onshore and more autonomous for efficiency as geopolitics and the potential for future pandemics prompt business leaders to add resiliency. For investors this means increased opportunities for robotics and related hardware and software.

Revisiting your plan during periods of volatility can provide an opportunity to help ensure you stay on track so that your near-term goals are more insulated while the long-term goals remain achievable.

The pay increases varied by bank and geography with the nation's largest banks paying the highest hourly wages to recruit and retain employees on the lower end of the pay scale. Still the turnover rate for frontline bank employees soared this year according to one survey.

Whether the favorable conditions for workers will persist into 2023 is an open question as many banks are preparing for a possible recession next year. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said earlier this month that the Charlotte North Carolina-based company is pulling back on some but not all of its hiring.

""We seek talent all the time"" Moynihan told Bloomberg Television on Dec. 6. ""We're just more careful about it in times like this.""

See the summary of activities below written and submitted by SGPS students:

“The SGPS community has been helping our local Table Soup Kitchen Foundation to stock their shelves this holiday season. The Grade 7/8 students set up a challenge this year to see which class could bring in the most items. Given the spirit and generosity that our Gators have SGPS was able to bring in over 1800 non-perishable items! The Gators are proud to be able to help out those in need this holiday season.

Students from SGPS’s Social Justice and Equity Committee made beaded bracelets to sell for charity. We are pleased to announce that our school raised about $206 which will also be donated to the Table Soup Kitchen Foundation. Way to go students and families!

One of the most cherished traditions at SGPS is “The Turkey Dinner.” The Grade 8 students organize and prepare a formal turkey dinner for the staff and special guests in the Board and our community. The last couple of years have been hard and we couldn’t host the annual dinner. This year we raised close to $800 with donations by staff students and various restaurants. The dinner was fun and there were over 70 guests.

None of this would have been possible without the help of families staff and students. Everyone got involved and wanted to make a difference to this year at Christmas time. We thank those who donated and gave their time to help support The Table Soup Kitchen including Bullocks Independent Grocer 3 Guys And A Stove Family Place Restaurant and Kimberly Clark.

This shift aims to enhance business opportunities profit-sharing structures and network security while ensuring openness transparency and censorship resistance

Consensus algorithm will be improved to allow for the participation of as many validators as possible without compromising Klaytn's performance

SINGAPORE Dec. 23 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Klaytn Foundation the non-profit overseeing the growth of the Klaytn ecosystem has announced the transition to a permissionless validator structure. In time anyone will be able to participate in the Klaytn ecosystem as a block validator alongside existing Governance Council (GC) node operators as long as they meet minimum qualifications that are currently being finalized. With network incentives now provided at the protocol level the transition to a permissionless validator structure will allow more to participate in the block validation process paving the way for greater decentralization of the Klaytn ecosystem.

Klaytn Announces Transition to Permissionless Validator Structure to Expand Network Participation and Decentralize Ecosystem.

Klaytn's consensus algorithm will be improved in order to allow as many validators as possible to participate without compromising network performance. Plans are also in progress to establish qualifications compensation and penalties for block validators in order to ensure network stability. Beyond maximizing network effects increased validator participation will also result in enhanced security and censorship resistance. By increasing KLAY transactions and diversifying the network of depositors Klaytn's permissionless validator structure will make it more difficult for malicious attacks such as hacking or censorship attempts to occur.

A crucial component of the Klaytn ecosystem validators function as Core Cell Operators (CCO) that operate both consensus and proxy nodes: verifying the accuracy of data contained in new blocks and ensuring that blocks are processed efficiently across the network. As Klaytn transitions to a permissionless system it will grant a wider range of privileges to end-users such as block validation rewards and node rights which can be leveraged to create new business opportunities. Node authority on the Klaytn network can be used to create decentralized finance (DeFi) services including public staking services or by integrating tokenomics into new business structures and operations.

""Permissionless systems like those used by well-known blockchain projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are essential for Klaytn as we strive for decentralization transparency and openness"" said Sangmin Seo Representative Director at Klaytn Foundation. ""With the shift to a permissionless validator structure and through future strategic business activities we hope to create a more competitive Klaytn ecosystem in the global market and ultimately share our successes with all participants.""

Klaytn's compensation system for block validators will be based on two factors: the performance of block validation and the amount of KLAY that is staked. Those who demonstrate strong validation performance and have a larger amount of KLAY staked will receive higher compensation. This is intended to incentivize positive behavior and influence on the platform as well as improve the profit distribution structure.

Put forth to the Klaytn Governance Council on 4 November 2022 the proposal to amend Klaytn's validator structure was approved by way of voting which concluded on 19 December 2022. 18 GC members participated in the vote with 6 abstentions 3 votes against and 9 votes in favour including those from Kakao Ground X and Netmarble.

Post-transition Klaytn will maintain its current governance structure with Governance Council members - an alliance of multinational businesses and organizations - remaining committed to platform governance consensus node operation and ecosystem growth.

Cebe is from Turkey and in her two-decade career in the fast-moving consumer goods market she had gained an intimate understanding of the potential the country had for brands like Kraft and Heinz to expand there.

“When I started this role Turkey was really one of our small businesses not in the top five” she says. “We didn’t have a team on the ground we didn’t have a proper business model.”

I thought moving to the food industry would be an amazing learning opportunity as the industry is very dynamic and locally driven. food is consumed every day very frequently by everyone.

“I had worked on categories in Turkey like shampoos and laundry detergents and I knew the growth potential of the market due to its increasing population GDP growth strong human capital” she adds. “I decided that Turkey should be one of our priority markets and set a plan to take it forward.”

Steep learning curve

However not having worked in the food industry before Cebe faced a steep learning curve. “I had worked in many categories earlier in my career – in home care products cosmetics and healthcare but I had never worked in food” she explains.

“I thought moving to the food industry would be an amazing learning opportunity as the industry is very dynamic and locally driven. Food is consumed every day very frequently by everyone.”

While the previous categories she worked on such as baby diapers and hair care were globally driven categories the food industry was very local. “Taste is king in food and taste is very local” Cebe says.

“What people expect in terms of taste is different so it stretches you to become more local in your thinking. And it’s more locally sourced. So for me the first opportunity was to enter the world of food which means being in touch with people on a day-to-day basis” she says.

The initial step was to put together an on-the-ground team in the country. Cebe went out of her way to find the best talent for this role.

“I recruited the team that was actually at the time more experienced than needed for the business that we had. It was a small business but we really recruited top-notch Turkish talent on the ground” she says.

Seeing results

The next stage in the overhaul of Kraft Heinz’s Turkey operations was to find the correct distribution partner so Cebe entered into a deal with a distributor working with other big names.

With distribution taken care of it was important to invest in research and development in order to develop a new product portfolio that catered to local tastes. “If you’re not selling the right product for the local consumers it’s very difficult to win with them” she explains.

Additionally Cebe set about ensuring that the food the company sold was made locally. This not only ensured that they reached the shelves fresh giving them a longer shelf life but also gave Kraft Heinz a cost advantage enabling it to be more competitive on price.

“If you want to compete with the strong local brands it is important that you produce locally for the local food palette of the consumers” she says.

If you want to compete with the strong local brands it is important that you produce locally for the local food palette of the consumers.

Rather than building a factory from scratch Cebe started by finding a local partner to produce the company’s products. This meant she did not have to convince global headquarters to make a huge investment in time and capital before seeing how the brand could perform.

That said it was important to make sure the local partner met stringent standards.

“I had to internally convince the key stakeholders that a partner could produce for us and I had to find someone with high standards. Because it’s food you cannot take any risks; safety is quite important” she says.

Once the local production strong distribution partner and most importantly the strong talent was on ground the company quickly saw results. “The growth started to come in a disproportionate manner” she adds.

Two years later things were going so well that Cebe was able to make the case that Turkey was now a key market and worthy of the capital investment required to enable the company to own its own production facilities.

“I convinced the global CEO there is room to grow it maybe 10 or 20 times more and I convinced them to do a local acquisition so that we have our own factory our own sales team and a big footprint to capture the potential of Turkey” she says.

After a meticulous search Kraft Heinz acquired Assan Foods in October last year taking ownership of its large production facility run by 600 employees.

“This acquisition is now helping Turkey to become a production hub for the rest of our Europe business too because cost-wise it offers advantages and logistically it’s easier” Cebe says. “Our business in Turkey has become really sizeable and we’re ready to push this growth even further.”

Fostering growth

Another country where Cebe’s leadership made a big impact was Egypt. While the company’s operations there were already quite large when she took on the role she nonetheless saw plenty of room for improvement.

“The business had stagnated for a long period of time; the growth was not happening” she says. “It was single-digit growth especially in terms of volumes.”

Cebe and her team responded by identifying two key opportunities. The first was to expand and improve distribution reaching a much wider network of retail outlets while also consolidating the company’s distribution partners.

“At the time we were not going into more stores” Cebe says. “If there were let’s say 100 outlets in the country we were only present in 14 of them. And if you’re not in all the outlets in all the grocery shops consumers don’t have that opportunity to see your product and buy you.”

Our business in turkey has become really sizeable and we’re ready to push this growth even further.

Kraft Heinz had about 60 distribution partners at the time all of them small-scale. After a large consolidation process they ended up with two much larger and better-equipped partners. “We went with two mega-distributors who could cover the entire country and who have the right infrastructure and the right mindset to do it for us” she states.

Because growth had been stagnant for so long Cebe also saw that a lack of investment had led to innovation drying up while productivity was also suffering.

“We didn’t have sufficient capacity to produce new innovation and new pack formats. My team and I were able to convince senior management to invest in our factory and we have injected more than US$50 million [€50.2 million] capital expenditure into the Cairo factory which allowed us to build lines that are much more effective efficient and can produce new innovations in line with the needs of the current world as well as more volume.”

These interventions have seen Egypt once again become a growth market for the company with the business there enjoying double-digit returns over the past two years.

“Hopefully this will continue in the years to come” Cebe says.

Equality agenda

Cebe’s desire to drive excellence is not just confined to investing in underperforming geographies. One of her proudest accomplishments in the role has been to increase the ratio of women working for the company.

“We work in the Middle East and Africa where unfortunately female contribution to the workforce is limited. It’s maybe a bit better in Turkey and in the UAE but it’s very much limited in other places.”

One key change Cebe made to address this was to expand paid maternity leave.

“In the United Arab Emirates the legal maternity leave that governments are asking from companies is 45 paid days which is really nothing” she says. “It’s very difficult for a mum to go back to work after only 45 days of breastfeeding or being with their baby.”

I worked so hard to come to where i am and i had to work maybe harder than my male colleagues.

So more than two-and-a-half years ago Cebe’s team began offering six months paid maternity leave. “Six months is a good amount of time for women to stay home with the baby” she says. “This is one major step we have taken.”

The other step has been to offer flexible work arrangements so that women who are tasked with looking after children and doing domestic chores can start and finish their workdays at times that are convenient for them.

Cebe has also brought in a new procedure whereby human relations teams are required to ensure they bring CVs for both women and men to recruiters and recruiters are required to interview at least one woman for every role.

Mentoring program

On top of that Cebe’s team has created a women’s mentoring program aimed at helping women employees to build a network within the organization. “There are coffee corners where we bring inspirational female leaders to share their stories” Cebe says.

These measures have all led to a significant increase in the proportion of women working for the company across the region. “Most importantly for me we’ve also seen this increase at the higher level” she reveals. “For our mid-level roles we have now reached 40 percent female presence. I’m also proud to say that in my leadership team who report directly to me we now have a 50–50 gender balance. This is one thing I’m really proud of.”

Outstanding Achievements Cebe is an agile resilient and solution-oriented leader with proven success in diversified roles in top fast-moving consumer goods organizations across geographies that include Turkey Middle East Africa Eastern Europe India Iran and Pakistan. She has worked in various categories such as cosmetics health care household care baby care electrical appliances and food. She is passionate about building iconic brands consumer-centric organizations and engaged teams and is a diversity and inclusion advocate. Despite all the macro challenges she has more than doubled the business while improving profitability.

As a successful female leader Cebe wants to ensure that women coming up behind her don’t have to face as many challenges as she did. “I worked so hard to come to where I am and I had to work maybe harder than my male colleagues” she says. “It’s not necessarily easy for our gender.”

She also wants to ensure she makes a positive social impact when it comes to the environment something she has begun tackling by driving a transition to local production of raw materials and packaging to reduce the company’s carbon footprint.

“We want to be the fastest-growing consumer goods company in the region and I want to be the fastest growing business unit within Kraft Heinz globally” Cebe says. “But I want to do it in such a way that we’re also caring for the world and for our employees.”

“I want to make sure that our supply footprint is more local” she adds “so that both I and the company can contribute to a more sustainable world. I can really make an impact in this role.”

Comically oversized snack foods. A cocktail infused with processed cheese. And a fine dining establishment for feline lovers.

In 2022 there were plenty of restaurants food manufacturers and at least one artist collective that tried to break through with their shenanigans.

These food stunts were often outrageous and sometimes regrettable. But only a few unleashed items that made us say “wait what? Why would you do that? Who would eat that?” And occasionally: “that actually sounds pretty good.”

Here’s what caught our attention this year.

Velveeta Martini

The Veltini in all it's glory. Kraft Heinz

Over the summer Kraft Heinz (KHC) introduced a new cocktail: The Veltini a martini made with Velveeta-infused vodka olive brine and vermouth garnished with Velveeta-stuffed olives and Velveeta-stuffed shells. The concoction was available for a limited time at BLT steakhouses in New York Washington D.C. Charlotte and elsewhere.

The drink was part of Kraft Heinz’s broader efforts to reinvigorate the Velveeta brand after it saw sales of the processed cheese jump during the pandemic. To help Velveeta stage a comeback the brand launched a new ad campaign made tweaks to its logo and sold a cheese-scented nail polish.

The Veltini made a splash even though (or perhaps because) those brave enough to try it were unenthused.

One Washington Post writer said it looked “like a deranged cheese monster with olives as beady eyes and a dripping Velveeta cheese rim as a lopsided mouth.” The Today Show’s Hoda Kotb tried it on air reluctantly and was not a fan. “Yuck” she said “No girl no.” Her co-host Jenna Bush Hager said it wasn’t bad.

Orange Juice + Cereal

To be clear this isn’t orange juice cereal: It’s cereal designed to be eaten with orange juice instead of milk. OJ-maker Tropicana sold the honey almond cereal for a limited time in May in honor of National Orange Juice Day.

The brand acknowledged that people might not be into the combination. “Whether you hate it or love it you won’t know until you try it” Tropicana said. “It may not be for everyone.”

One reviewer who gave the franken-breakfast a shot described it as “​​not bad” adding “I can’t imagine eating a bowl of this every day.”

Plus she said it didn’t taste like it was supposed to go with orange juice specifically. “There’s absolutely nothing different from other cereals.”

Hot Dog Popsicle

In August Oscar Mayer also owned by Kraft Heinz introduced the “Cold Dog”: A hot-dog flavored popsicle. The item was sold for a limited time at Popbar locations in New York City New Orleans and elsewhere.

The idea came from a June Instagram post by Oscar Mayer which asked followers whether the idea was “genius” or “stupid.” Comments on the post range from horrified to intrigued. Enough people were interested to give Oscar Mayer the green light.

“After the overwhelming fan excitement for our beloved Cold Dog it was a no-brainer to make this hot dog-inspired frozen pop a reality” Anne Field an Oscar Mayer spokesperson said in a press release at the time.

So how did it taste? In at least one reviewer’s opinion pretty good.

“I was beyond skeptical of how they could make a hot dog popsicle taste good. And somehow they managed to do it!” according to a writer at Delish who noted that Popbar uses gelato as the base for its pops. “The gelato is extremely creamy and has a strong smokey flavor that balances out the popsicle’s delicate sweetness. The sweet ‘mustard’ drizzle makes it taste more like a proper ice cream.”

Big Cheez-It Tostada

A Big Cheez-It is 16 times larger than a regular Cheez-It. Taco Bell

In late June Taco Bell tested out an item called a “Big Cheez-It Tostada.” As the name implies it’s a tostada which used a Big Cheez-It — specifically a Cheez-It 16 times larger than a regular one — as its base. The chain also tested out a “Big Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme” which included the giant Cheez-It within the wrap.

The items were available for a limited-time at one Taco Bell location. On July 3 within a week of the launch Taco Bell reported that the items had already sold out. “The Big Cheez-It Tostada and Big Cheez-It Crunchwrap are in such Big demand that our limited offer is no longer available” the chain said.

Reviewers who tried the item were mixed. “Very cheesy mmm” said one. Another concluded that “it’s not bad it’s just weird.” Some noted that the Cheez-It big though it may be was not strong enough to maintain the weight of the toppings.

A large Cheez-It was also utilized by Pizza Hut in 2019 when the pizza chain introduced its stuffed Cheez-It pizza. The limited-time item included “four baked jumbo squares” stuffed with cheese or pepperoni and cheese and came with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.

Big Froot Loop

We're gonna need a bigger boat. MSCHF.

Unlike the Big Cheez-It Tostada the Big Froot Loop is an unauthorized creation made by the artist collective MSCHF.

The loop weighs nearly half a pound is 930 calories and recently went on sale for $19.99. MSCHF tried to make the big loop taste as much as possible like the real thing according to MSCHF’s co-founder Daniel Greenberg.

“We look at things in culture and figure out how to make a twist on it” Greenberg previously told CNN. The thinking behind the project was straightforward: “Let’s make a big f—ing fruit loop and that was it.” According to the MSCHF site the item which went on sale December 19 is already sold out.

Kellogg’s which makes actual Froot Loops was not into it.

“Kellogg Company does not have a relationship with MSCHF and we were not involved in the creation of the Big Fruit Loop” Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner previously told CNN in a statement. “The campaign does not accurately depict the Kellogg’s brand.”

Bahner added that “given the trademark infringement and unauthorized use of our brand we have reached out to the company seeking an amicable resolution.”

Fancy Feast For Humans

Over the summer Fancy Feast invited people to answer the question: What does cat food taste like? Well sort of.

The cat food maker briefly opened a restaurant called “Gatto Bianco by Fancy Feast” in New York City in August. Gatto Bianco was open for just two nights with four seatings per night.

The restaurant dishes drew inspiration from Fancy Feast Medleys cat food that is itself inspired by human food like salmon primavera and turkey florentine. The restaurant’s menu was created by Amanda Hassner in-house chef for Fancy Feast as well as restaurateur Cesare Casella a Michelin star winner according to a Fancy Feast press release.

“Food has the power to connect us to others in meaningful ways and take us to places we have never been” Hassner said in a statement at the time. “The same is true for our cats.”

Hassner added that “the dishes at Gatto Bianco are prepared in ways that help cat owners understand how their cats experience food — from flavor to texture to form.” On the menu according to OpenTable were baked sea bass spare ribs salmon braised beef and for dessert panna cotta almond cake and affogato.

A Mashable reporter dined at the exclusive restaurant and reported that “the food is tasty” and the atmosphere feline. “The design of the restaurant itself is practically an Instagram installation for the cat-obsessed complete with ornate cat wallpaper gold-embellished Fancy Feast cloth napkins and cat art (as in artwork of cats not art made by cats).”

Honorable Mention: Papa Bowls

Papa Bowls are all topping no crust. Papa Johns

As a permanent addition to the Papa Johns menu the no-crust toppings-only Papa Bowls are technically not a stunt.

But the menu offering was so polarizing when it launched in August that we had to give it a nod.

The bowls were devised to help combat pandemic-induced pizza fatigue by giving Papa Johns customers an option that was let’s say pizza adjacent. The company also hoped that the bowls would eliminate the “veto vote” when a restaurant is ruled out because it doesn’t have enough options for everyone in the dining party.

The bowls come in three varieties: Chicken Alfredo; Italian Meats Trio with pepperoni sausage and meatballs; and Garden Veggie. There’s also a build-your-own option.

The announcement made quite a splash. Comedian Jon Stewart who has made repeated jabs at Arby’s said he owed an apology to the chain upon seeing news of the Papa Bowl. At least one YouTube reviewer panned the bowls saying it was gross and slimy. But some people thought it was a good idea.

And during a November analyst call Papa Johns CEO Rob Lynch said the bowls are “performing well and in line with our expectations.”

How insurance company supplanted Heinz as Steelers' stadium sponsor (and angered NFL fans),"The times they are a-changing...

2022 represented a rebirth of sorts for the Steelers. They have a new man under center a youthful bunch in the defense and fairly lowered expectations at least compared to their AFC North foes. They also have a different stadium name.

For 20 years the place where icons like James Harrison Troy Polamalu and Hines Ward called home was known as Heinz Field. Named after the famous condiment brand it was a moniker that just rolled off the tongue. And regardless of how one feels about Heinz's toppings (this writer for example can't stand ketchup) it seemed to suit the franchise well. So much so in fact that Pittsburgh made the playoffs in 14 of its 21 seasons prior to the latest name change to Acrisure Stadium.

DeCOURCY: Timing of Franco Harris' arrival in Pittsburgh was 'Immaculate' but he's left us too soon

That doesn't look to be the case this year. In the laundry list of issues that have popped up in Pittsburgh's season the name of its stadium likely doesn't rank first. But it hasn't helped matters particularly among a raucous fanbase anchored to many of its traditions.

So just what is Acrisure? The Sporting News gives you the skinny on the multi-billion dollar company and its (unpopular) foray into the sporting world.

What is Acrisure?

Based out of Grand Rapids Michigan Acrisure is one of the more prominent financial technology and insurance companies in the United States.

The company was founded in 2005 by Greg Williams and Ricky Norris a firm established to snatch up smaller insurance companies in its native Midwest.

Acrisure has seen stable growth over the past decade or so cementing its status as one of the most prominent insurance companies in the world. It offers tech for a number of different industries including asset management real estate and cyber services.

The company has made serious waves in recent years blossoming from a $28 million business to one that closed a $725 million Preferred Equity campaign earlier this year and received a valuation of $31 billion.

With all the capital its acquired over the years it was little surprise that Acrisure made the jump into the sporting landscape. Per Axios the company will shell more than $150 million over the course of its 15-year deal with Pittsburgh.

Williams a self-described Steeler fan vowed to “invest in the Pittsburgh community.”

It will take a long time for folks to get acclimated to the old digs with a new name. Commentators have mistaken the new title for its more famous past one. So too have fans many of whom have done that in an act of resistance from ownership's unpopular decision.

But with a 15-year deal on the cards Steelers fans — and NFL viewers as a whole — better get used to Acrisure.

Fallout of name change from Heinz Field to Acrisure Stadium

The name change left many Pittsburgh supporters who liked the Heinz Field name upset. Some players even weighed in including legendary Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.

I can't believe it it doesn't seem right or real! Home will always be Heinz Field! I will never forget the last game and all the amazing fans at FOREVER HEINZ! -- Ben.#ForeverHeinz

People even started a Change.org petition to have the stadium name reverted back.

Many wondered why Heinz didn't renew its sponsorship with the Steelers and keep its name in place. The company explained shortly after the new stadium deal was done that it all boiled down to one thing: money.

MORE: Steelers fans personalities react to stadium name change

The Kraft Heinz Company released a statement addressing their naming rights deal with the Steelers. They explained that they couldn't justify paying as much for the rights as Acrisure was willing to shell out.

While we worked diligently with the Steelers for several months around a new naming rights deal they found a new partner willing to pay significantly more than we could justify.

That said Heinz — a Pittsburgh company — isn't ending its sponsorship of the Steelers entirely. They are going to be a ""significant long-term partner"" for the organization and outlined some work that the company will do for the Pittsburgh community.

While our name will no longer be on the stadium Heinz will remain a significant long-term sponsor of the Steelers and we’re excited to announce the details of our new partnership in the days ahead. Kraft Heinz is committed to its ongoing support of the Steelers and the Pittsburgh community in a city that is our co-headquarters. In addition to our partnership with the Steelers we look forward to our continued support of organizations such as the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and Grow Pittsburgh as well as sponsorship of events like Picklesburgh among others.

So Heinz will still have a significant presence in Pittsburgh. It may just be a bit muted compared to when they had the stadium naming rights.

The Glenwood Avenue project situated just west of Glenwood Kroger began vertical construction earlier this year and recently topped out at a half-dozen stories beneath a roofline with many gables.

We’re still working to figure out what the development actually is which isn’t made easier by the holiday week. Property records indicate the formerly vacant 2.3 acres sold for $1.7 million in summer 2020 to an LLC called Enfold Glenwood.

The 860 Glenwood Avenue address matches the nearby Glenwood at Grant Park apartments.

The project stands adjacent to the hilltop GlenCastle complex an adaptive-reuse of Atlanta’s historic circa-1900 city jail by Urban Realty Partners completed in 2020.

GlenCastle now includes three structures (a stable and blacksmith shop were also converted) with 85000 square feet of creative office space across 4 acres. According to Urban Realty Partners GlenCastle was leased and stabilized earlier this year.

The Link townhomes and apartments by Charlotte-based Grubb Properties are also next door.

For Naomi Oligario of Port Orchard who has spent decades in retail with Safeway it’s deja vu all over again.

Oligario first got involved with Safeway in her days as a student-athlete at South Kitsap High School when the company worked with her to schedule shifts along with her sports seasons. It also had the benefit of being a popular job option at her age.

“If you were a kid Safeway/Albertsons grocery stores union jobs that was the job to get” she said. “You didn’t have to go to college at that point. That wasn’t what I had planned on doing but I remember it being a big deal.”

To her it’s still that same amazing job opportunity having served as a clerk and manager in several store departments for over 37 years. Despite long-standing seniority and experience in the company that opportunity could very well change after Kroger which owns Fred Meyer announced in October that it planned to merge with major competitor Albertsons which owns Safeway in a $25 billion deal.

Since the announcement several worker unions representing hundreds of thousands of employees have come out against the merger saying it benefits the shareholders more than the essential employees that keep businesses running.

The news of a possible merger was enough stress to bring Oligario to tears multiple times during an interview. “It’s the uncertainty of it all” she said. “It was an automatic throwback to Haggen.”

Oligario was referring to the disastrous series of events that saw Albertsons buy Safeway and Haggen Food and Pharmacy in a surprise expansion plan in 2015. After the dust settled Haggen was forced to declare bankruptcy and Safeway and Albertsons had begun divesting some locations as was agreed upon in the purchase.

Oligario was also forced to reapply for a job and was one of the last people hired back. She saw several longtime co-workers and friends leave or be forced to leave losing crucial benefits and job status. As to why she stuck it out she said it was the only option available.

“I could not afford to start all over after 30-some years and go back to the bottom” she said. “I essentially had no choice but to stay with what they had.”

Now there’s the possibility of having to fight the fight all over again. Oligario wanted herself and the other workers to feel heard and to have their issue taken seriously. That need led her and four other grocery workers to speak at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. She talked about her previous bad experiences as an employee involved with a merger and why business can’t be worth more than the lives of those who work for it.

“I understand growing and making money” she said. “I get that but they don’t have to do it to the point of being so detrimental to so many people.”

Oligario said she will continue to work with the unions and other workers to oppose the merger and is hoping that Congress and the public will respond to their cries for help.

“I felt like we were heard in a sense” she said “but I felt like the CEO’s were just lying just giving numbers to try and make it sound good.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2dyb2Nlcnktc3RvcmUtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWV2ZS0yMDIyLWhvdXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas Eve 2022 grocery store hours: Walmart Safeway Kroger open,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/12/24/grocery-store-christmas-eve-2022-hours on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI0L2dyb2Nlcnktc3RvcmUtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWV2ZS0yMDIyLWhvdXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Contract under this maintenance programme was awarded to L3Harris in January 2021.

Valued at $668m the contract was awarded to enhance and improve the operational readiness of the USAF’s C-130 tactical transport aircraft fleet.

Earlier this year in April L3Harris announced achieving a major milestone under the USAF C-130 Avionics Modernisation Programme Increment 2.

The company is providing parallel avionics modernisation on the USAF’s C-130 aircraft fleet at the L3Harris’ facility in Waco Texas US.

USAF C-130 Hercules Division chief Dr JP Peloquin said: “It is important that we have an industrial base that can meet these requirements.

L3Harris Technologies has secured a $29-million contract with Bahrain Jordan and Morocco to upgrade their F-16 fighter jets.

As part of the deal the American tech firm will integrate 105 smart weapon release systems into the F-16s.

The system enables the F-16 to carry double the number of smart munitions and makes it compatible with 500-pound (226-kilogram) and 1000-pound (453-kilogram) guided weapons.

“Our release systems provide extra offensive capabilities while giving commanders the versatility to deploy the right firepower for every mission” L3Harris president Ed Zoiss said.

He added that the “combat-proven” release system provides munitions overmatch allowing commanders to send the “right weapon at the right time to the right target.”

The F-16 Fighter

Designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin the F-16 is a multi-role fighter aircraft for air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack missions.

When in air combat mode the F-16 can locate targets in all weather and detects low-flying aircraft.

It can fly more than 500 miles (860 kilometers) in an air-to-surface role hitting targets with superior accuracy.

In 2019 Morocco was cleared by the US State Department to procure 25 F-16C/D Block 72 fighters at an estimated cost of $3.79 billion.

Jordan and Bahrain are poised to receive additional F-16 Block 70 aircraft from Lockheed Martin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdXJnZW50Y29tbS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9uZnBhLWNlcnRpZmllcy10aGF0LWwzaGFycmlzLW1vdG9yb2xhLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1kZXZpY2VzLW1lZXQtbGF0ZXN0LWZpcmUtc3RhbmRhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFPA certifies that L3Harris Motorola Solutions devices meet latest fire standard - Urgent Comms,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://urgentcomm.com/2022/12/23/nfpa-certifies-that-l3harris-motorola-solutions-devices-meet-latest-fire-standard/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdXJnZW50Y29tbS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9uZnBhLWNlcnRpZmllcy10aGF0LWwzaGFycmlzLW1vdG9yb2xhLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1kZXZpY2VzLW1lZXQtbGF0ZXN0LWZpcmUtc3RhbmRhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGFtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYS1jb3JuZXJzdG9uZS1vZi1sLWEtcy1oaXN0b3JpYy1kZWZlbnNlLWluZHVzdHJ5LXdhcy1zb2xkLXRvLWZsb3JpZGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Cornerstone of L.A.'s Historic Defense Industry Was Sold to Florida,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lamag.com/news/a-cornerstone-of-l-a-s-historic-defense-industry-was-sold-to-florida on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGFtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYS1jb3JuZXJzdG9uZS1vZi1sLWEtcy1oaXN0b3JpYy1kZWZlbnNlLWluZHVzdHJ5LXdhcy1zb2xkLXRvLWZsb3JpZGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmZXJsLm9yZy9hL3VrcmFpbmUtbWlzc2lsZS1kZWZlbnNlLXdlYXBvbnMtY2hhcnRzLXJ1c3NpYS8zMjE5MjEzMi5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmZlcmwub3JnL2FtcC91a3JhaW5lLW1pc3NpbGUtZGVmZW5zZS13ZWFwb25zLWNoYXJ0cy1ydXNzaWEvMzIxOTIxMzIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Protecting The Skies: How Does Ukraine Defend Against Russian Missiles?,"Over the past several months Russia has launched multiple waves of missiles and drone attacks across Ukraine. The heaviest attack so far came on November 15 when more than 100 missiles targeted a dozen cities and districts as well as the country’s critical energy infrastructure. Ukraine had relied mostly on Soviet-era defense systems such as the S-300. But now that air defense is Ukraine’s top priority Western countries have been pushed to provide more sophisticated devices. Here are some of the systems that are helping to defend Ukrainian skies. S-300: Old But Still Powerful The S-300 is a long-range surface-to-air system originally developed in the Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s. It is capable of targeting aircraft cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.

At least 17 countries -- including Ukraine Russia and several NATO members – have the S-300. While it’s technically a defense system Russia seems to have repurposed it to strike ground targets too. This is why there was initially some confusion over who was responsible for the missile that hit Poland in November. Before the invasion Ukraine had about 250 S-300 systems according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Several more have been delivered since then as part of military aid. It remains unclear how many have been destroyed by Russian missiles. IRIS-T: The First Modern System From The West On October 11 Ukraine received its first modern Western defense system from Germany: IRIS-T one of the world's most advanced air-defense systems. Back in June German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised that four of these systems would be delivered and the deal was expected to be finalized by the end of this year. However Russia’s deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities have sped up the process. Ukraine now has one battery that consists of a radar command-and-control system and three missile launchers carrying a total of 24 missiles. Three more batteries are expected next year mostly due to the long manufacturing process.

IRIS-T can purportedly protect an entire city from missiles that are up to 40 kilometers away. It also detects low-flying missiles (such as Kalibr) and drones thanks to its sensitive radar which integrates data from various sources. IRIS-T is manufactured in southern Germany and is relatively new. It has been in development since the 1990s and tests of the latest version were finalized in 2021. NASAMS: Western Deliveries Continue On November 7 Ukraine received another delivery of sophisticated air-defense systems: NASAMS sent from the United States. NASAMS was developed in the 1990s by U.S. and Norwegian companies and it is the same system that protects the airspace around Washington D.C. It is a middle-range defense system armed with three launchers that can carry a total of 18 missiles (up to six missiles each). Its radar uses multiple sources of data which enables it to intercept targets beyond visual range. The system can also engage multiple targets simultaneously so it is less likely to be overwhelmed by a large number of attack missiles.

The system uses AMRAM missiles with a range of 40 kilometers (the newer version could even reach 100 kilometers) capable of hitting various targets including unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles. The United Kingdom is set to donate hundreds of these to Ukraine. Patriot: At Long Last? For months Ukraine has been requesting another long-range air-defense system the U.S.-made Patriot. This system can destroy short-range ballistic missiles advanced aircraft and cruise missiles. It was first deployed in the 1980s and is considered one of the most advanced U.S. air-defense systems.

The West has been hesitant to provide the Patriot mostly due to its complicated technology. One battery requires about 90 personnel to operate so Ukrainian forces would need extensive training. Some governments were also concerned about escalating the conflict further. When Poland turned down Germany’s offer of two Patriot batteries and suggested sending them to Ukraine instead the proposal was rejected because the system would have been operated by NATO personnel and would therefore require NATO involvement in Ukraine.

However the United States has recently announced additional military assistance for Ukraine including a transfer of the Patriot defense system. Hawk In November Spain sent a total of six U.S.-made HAWK air-defense systems to Ukraine. The United States is also considering sending a few older HAWK systems from storage but these would probably need to be refurbished first. The HAWK was developed in the 1950s by Raytheon Technologies and was mostly phased out during the 2000s. It is a mobile system that provides defense against low-to-medium-altitude aircraft and is expected to be effective against Iranian drones.

The launcher vehicle is typically accompanied by a radar vehicle and a command-and-control vehicle. These vehicles may vary depending on the type of launcher. Smaller Defense Systems: Avenger Gepard And Vampire The United States also donated four Avenger air-defense systems which provide short-range protection against drones and helicopters. This system is mounted on a Humvee vehicle and is equipped with up to eight Stinger missiles and a machine gun. It can destroy targets up to 8 kilometers away. Avenger is not as sophisticated as some other systems such as NASAMS or IRIS-T. It uses optical sight and short-range laser to detect targets and the missile range is considerably shorter. However it is valuable thanks to its high mobility.

In July Germany supplied 30 decommissioned Gepards. These antiaircraft guns were developed in the 1970s in Germany to counter low-flying armored attack helicopters such as the Russian (then-Soviet) Mil Mi-24. They also seem to be effective in engaging small targets such as Iranian-made kamikaze drones that Russia uses.

The Flakpanzer Gepard (Flakpanzer is a German term for a tank-based antiaircraft vehicle) can spot targets up to 15 kilometers away and engage them within 6 kilometers.

Besides Gepards Germany has also provided approximately 6000 rounds of ammunition. On top of that another 12000 rounds are currently on hold. Germany bought these from Switzerland some decades ago on the condition that Switzerland would have a veto over future resale or donation. So far requests to lift the veto have been rejected. The United States has also committed to providing the Vampire system a laser-guided missile launcher. It is a portable weapon that can be mounted on most pickup-truck beds even on nontactical vehicles. According to its U.S. manufacturer the system is relatively small and can be installed within two hours by two people. Only one person is needed for operation.

The Vampire is effective against unmanned aerial systems but can engage ground targets too. Delivery is expected in the middle of next year. Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems Additionally portable missiles (also known as MANPADS) have played an important role in Ukrainian defense. The United Kingdom supplied Starstreak missiles while Germany the Netherlands and the United States sent Stinger missiles. Poland provided Piorun missiles.

All these systems can be transported by foot or vehicle and are shoulder-fired. They are effective against low-flying aircraft such as helicopters at a range of a few kilometers.

Stinger and Piorun missiles are so-called ""heat-seekers"". That means they use infrared homing to lock on to the hot engine exhaust that the target produces. Starstreak missiles on the other hand are guided by a laser beam."

A number of casino operators changed up their real estate portfolio this year with sales acquisitions and leasebacks — showcasing a flurry of activity after the short but steep economic fallout caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

And a number of those deals announced last year have closed in 2022.

Here are six of this year’s major deals on the Strip including one anomaly.

Las Vegas Sands shifts focus

Las Vegas Sands Corp. officially exited the Las Vegas market in February after Apollo Global Management Inc. took over the reins of its three Strip assets — The Venetian Palazzo and The Venetian Expo.

Las Vegas Sands is still headquartered in Las Vegas but it has turned its focus on investments in Macao where it is a market leader and Singapore. It is also concentrating on other investments in the U.S. with prospects in Texas Florida and New York.

Apollo Sands and Vici Properties Inc. first announced the $6.4 billion deal in March 2021.

Under terms of the deal Apollo paid a total of $2.25 billion. New York-based Vici a real estate investment trust affiliated with Caesars Entertainment Inc. paid $4 billion in the transaction. It now owns all of the real estate assets while Apollo operates the properties.

Apollo is no stranger to the gaming industry. It acquired Caesars Entertainment then called Harrah’s in 2008 with private equity firm TPG Capital then invested $2.4 billion into Caesars’ Las Vegas operations. The firms sold their remaining stake in Caesars in 2019 two years after Caesars’ main operating unit emerged from bankruptcy in 2017.

The new Venetian owners have since found the resort has substantially outperformed expectations since the acquisition which it shared during a recent Nevada Gaming Commission meeting. The company doled out $1500 bonuses to its 7000 employees in early December and told the commission that it plans to invest $1 billion in the property in the next three to four years.

Palms makes history

When the Palms reopened on April 27 it came back to much fanfare and it carved out a chapter in Las Vegas’ history book. After the off-Strip casino-resort was dark for more than two years it opened as the first resort in Las Vegas to be owned and operated by a Native American tribe.

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians the tribe that operates the Yaamava’ Resort and Casino in Highland California purchased the 21-year-old property from Red Rock Resorts for $650 million in May 2021.

It revamped the property with a new cafe furnishings and upgraded the back-of-house features.

Not much else was needed as the property underwent a $690 million facelift in 2019 while under Red Rock Resorts’ ownership. Red Rock invested heavily in the property’s daylife and nightlife components including the Kaos Nightclub.

Palms General Manager Cynthia Kiser Murphey told the Review-Journal in September that now the focus is on attracting Las Vegas locals as well as its Southern California clientele.

Cosmopolitan changes hands

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas officially became an MGM Resorts International property in May a deal that extended MGM’s footprint on the Strip.

Blackstone sold The Cosmopolitan for $5.65 billion in September 2021 with MGM purchasing the resort’s operations for $1.63 billion and entering into a 30-year lease agreement. The Cosmopolitan’s real estate was sold to a group of new investors though Blackstone retained an ownership stake in the property.

Blackstone purchased The Cosmopolitan in 2014 for $1.73 billion then invested $500 million into renovating its roughly 3000 guest rooms and luxury suites as well as upgrading the bar and restaurant offerings.

Bally’s takes over Tropicana

In another sale-leaseback agreement Bally’s Corp. closed on its $308 million purchase of the Tropicana Las Vegas from Penn Entertainment Inc. in September. The deal was first announced in April 2021.

Bally’s is expected to pay the property’s land owner Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. a REIT affiliated with Penn Entertainment $10.5 million annually in a 50-year lease agreement.

The Tropicana could also see another big change in its future. The 35-acre site on the south end of the Strip is being considered as the site for an MLB stadium project for the Oakland Athletics. Bally’s CEO Lee Fenton said last month that the Tropicana is still “very much in the cards” as a potential site.

The Mirage gets a new owner

On Monday Hard Rock International officially closed its $1.08 billion purchase of The Mirage from MGM Resorts International. The Nevada Gaming Commission approved its licensing to operate the hotel-casino last week.

Hard Rock owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida said it plans to gut the three-wing property and spend billions to expand and upgrade it with the Hard Rock branding starting in late 2023 or 2024.

When the resort expands it will go from 3044 rooms as The Mirage to 3640 rooms as the Hard Rock; 836 slot machines to 2000; and 51 table games to 212. The casino will be enlarged from 94000 square feet to 174000 square feet while the convention space will grow from 200000 square feet to 283000 square feet. The theater will go from 3278 theater seats to 6265 and 18 food and beverage outlets to 21.

The new owners also plan to replace one iconic feature — The Mirage volcano — with an all-suites tower in the shape of a guitar.

Caesars changes its mind

Caesars’ decision to not make a deal is what landed the company on the list.

For more than a year Caesars executives publicly floated the idea of selling one of its Strip resorts though it had talked about selling a Strip asset dating back to when Eldorado Resorts announced it was acquiring and merging with Caesars in 2019. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit a year later executives said at the time it would delay those plans while the hard-hit gaming and tourism industries bounce back.

Meanwhile Wall Street analysts identified the Flamingo and Planet Hollywood Resort as two prime candidates for a sale.

Caesars CEO Tom Reeg told investors it expected a sale announcement in early 2022 but no such announcement came. By summer Reeg shifted his tone when during its second-quarter earnings call he found investors and analysts’ focus on a deal “kind of amusing.”

“This is a change in you not in us. This has been discretionary for us from day one and it remains so” he said at the time. “If we have a trade that makes sense for us we’ll do it. If we don’t we’re fine waiting.”

In November Reeg announced the company decided against a sale because the market wasn’t favorable and the cash flow of the asset considered for sale had continued to increase.

“Despite us talking about how this was a discretionary process for us it created an unnecessary overhang in the stock” Reeg said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call while apologizing to shareholders.

It’s no myth that the mafia controlled the Las Vegas casino business from the mid-’40s until at least the late-’70s. The myth is that they buried hundreds of bodies in the Las Vegas desert while doing so.

“That is a reputation that Las Vegas has like you walk around outside out in the desert in Las Vegas you’re bound to run across a victim of the mob” Geoff Schumacher vice president of exhibits and programs for the Las Vegas Mob Museum told KNPR this week. “But if you look back in the records … the bodies found in the desert or dumped in the desert you can count them on two hands probably as opposed to the hundreds that people believe are out there.”

Myth Interpreted

The myth springs from a 1963 New York Times bestseller “The Green Felt Jungle” the first book to expose the secret criminal ownership behind most of the Las Vegas Strip casino resorts.

Nationwide people had a general sense of crime in the city but not the properties or the names until that book came out” Schumacher said.

So many bodies were supposedly buried in the desert outside Las Vegas the idea of someone who “knows where the bodies are buried” entered mainstream usage. Supposedly it’s even how “86” became a verb. That number is said to derive from the mobster order to drive a victim 80 miles out of town and put him six feet under.

Wait! Before you commit that last factoid to memory it’s another myth. According to the Oxford English Dictionary “86” was bartender code for being out of a menu item.

No Kill Zone

Mobsters made a concerted effort not to kill their foes in Las Vegas which would have been bad for the casino business. Mobster Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel was murdered in Beverly Hills. Gus Greenbaum his replacement at the helm of the Flamingo met his end in Phoenix. Anthony “Tony the Ant” Spilotro who operated the skim at the Stardust got whacked in Chicago and was buried in Indiana. Racketeer and bookmaker “Russian” Louis Strauss was picked up at the Desert Inn and driven to his murder site in California.

“They definitely tried to do that kind of nasty business outside the city limits” Schumacher said.

How Vegas Buried the Mob

The mafia was eventually evicted from the casino business by several trends. The most significant was Nevada’s passage of the Corporate Gaming Act. This 1967 legislation allowed corporations to own casinos without every shareholder having to be licensed thus paving the way for the Las Vegas Strip’s current roster of corporate resorts.

That same year billionaire Howard Hughes purchased the Desert Inn from Cleveland syndicate member Moe Dalitz just to avoid being evicted from his penthouse suite. Hughes got addicted to the business going on to purchase the Sands Frontier Silver Slipper Castaways and Landmark.

By the ’80s Nevada Gov. Michael Callahan helped to extricate the residual mob influence from the casino business. He did so by appointing members to the Gaming Control Board who would be more resistant to their bribes and threats.

According to Schumacher this could explain the body found in the barrel in Lake Mead last year.

(Maybe it) was somebody who had been discovered to have been an informant or government witness” he told KNPR. “There was a lot of paranoia in the mob at that time about who they could trust.”

The mafia is still around. Until the mid-2000s they even operated a successful Las Vegas strip club. But these days they’re relegated to the dark corners of Las Vegas commerce – side rackets such as illegal drugs prostitution and money laundering.",,,,,,

The extension to the existing agreement includes additional scope for the delivery of a Health Knowledge Management System. The new system is designed to ensure that critical relevant medical information can be shared between Defence and its allies in the treatment of ADF members and that a consistent longitudinal health record is available to clinicians regardless of the setting in which they are operating.

The extension to the initial contract with Leidos Australia will provide additional scope for the JP2060 Phase 4 project over 57 months comprising the addition of Miya Observations and Assessments modules as well as an expanded subscription for the Miya Precision platform.

Miya Observations previously known as Patientrack provides access to real-time vital signs data aligned with local workflows so that care teams can be responsive to patients most in need. Miya Assessments provides a standardised framework for risk assessment.

The Miya Precision platform is a smart clinical solution based on a FHIR-event platform that facilitates multiple clinical and operational applications allowing clinicians to gain actionable insight by combining AI with data from a variety of systems.

The agreement increases the number of Miya Precision modules that will be used by Defence with Miya Observations and Assessments now licensed for use in both Strategic Aeromedical Evacuation and Tactical Aeromedical Evacuation.

Alcidion will also provide ongoing support and maintenance services to ensure the successful delivery and adoption of this additional scope.

Alcidion Group Managing Director and CEO Kate Quirke said “We are proud to see Miya Precision play an increasingly crucial role in supporting the health outcomes of ADF personnel through the provision of consistent longitudinal health data for clinicians across varied care settings.”",,,,,,,,,

""Neal Schon should look in the mirror when he accuses me of causing harm to the Journey brand"" Cain said in a statement. ""I have watched him damage our brand for years and am a victim of both his — and his wife's — bizarre behavior.""

Cain 72 went on to offer a number of examples of how the 68-year-old Schon in his estimation has diminished the band's legacy.

""Neal sued Live Nation twice losing both times and damaging our ability to ever work with them again; Neal outrageously tried to take away trademarks from Steve Perry; Neal and his wife [Michaele] continually insult the professionalism of numerous accountants road managers and management firms with endless legal threats and their bullying toxic and incoherent emails; Neal argues online with fans who don't see eye to eye with him; and Neal and his wife recklessly spend Journey's money until there is none left for operating costs"" he said. ""If anyone is destroying the Journey brand it is Neal — and Neal alone.""

An attorney for Schon sent the letter to Cain after he performed ""Don't Stop Believin'"" at former President Donald Trump's Florida estate last month Variety reported.

Cain reportedly performed the hit which iconically capped the Sopranos series finale at an event in which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle and former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake performed in a backing ""chorus"" per the outlet.

""Although Mr. Cain is free to express his personal beliefs and associations when he does that on behalf of Journey or for the band such conduct is extremely deleterious to the Journey brand as it polarizes the band's fans and outreach. Journey is not and should not be political"" the letter read per Variety.

""Mr. Cain has no right to use Journey for politics"" the letter continued. ""His politics should be his own personal business. He should not be capitalizing on Journey's brand to promote his personal political or religious agenda to the detriment of the band"" calling it a ""harmful use of the brand.""

The inter-band dispute is not the first in recent months.

In October Schon filed a lawsuit against Cain alleging that he had been denied access to the group's American Express card and its records.

Cain's attorney in response said that Schon had allegedly put more than $1 million in ""improper personal expenses"" on the credit card.

A month earlier estranged lead singer Steve Perry took legal action against both men asking them to stop registering federal trademarks on the names of many of the band's hits per Rolling Stone.

It’s 6:30 in the evening on Dec. 22 in Fort Worth. It’s 13 degrees and the Baylor Bears are ready to receive the kick as die-hard football fanatics are settling into their frozen seats. The stage is set for everyone to endure one of the coldest bowl games in college football history.

With a wind chill of minus 1 degree and over 20 mph wind blowing these two run-dominant teams were not shy about pounding the rock. By the time the final whistle came the squads combined for 93 rush attempts and only 30 pass attempts. Air Force’s senior quarterback Haaziq Daniels ran the ball over twice as much as he passed carrying the ball 15 times and only throwing seven.

“It was cold” Daniels joked post-win. “My hands were freezing. All of the staff did a great job of making sure we had clothes on. On the sidelines we had those heated seats and I think that helped a lot but it was cold regardless. It was definitely tough.”

Despite the low attendance and even lower temperatures some Baylor fans didn’t hesitate to make the trip to cheer on the Bears. Class of 1974 alumnus David Wilson and his former Baylor roommate Patrick Malone made the trip from Temple to root for Baylor.

“I’m a season ticket holder and a fanatic Baylor fan” Wilson said. “I’d be here even if it were pouring down rain sleet or snow.”

With the majority wearing layers and most accompanied with hand warmers and blankets fans had a multitude of ways to prepare for the game time conditions — some unbelievably so. Class of 1997 alumnus and current Baylor employee Tim Webb made sure he was bundled up under what looked like most of the Baylor bookstore.

“I actually went out and bought a brand new coat for the game because my old coat wasn’t thick enough” Webb said. “I’ve actually got 22 items of clothing on to try and keep me warm. I have five pairs of pants on right now.”

Of course it wouldn’t be a true Baylor football game without the Golden Wave Band accompanying the team. Despite the weather resulting in some of the group’s instruments freezing drum major Jeremiah Green said the cold didn’t bring down the band’s charisma. That held true as the section stayed on the move through the final down.

“One thing we always preach is relentless energy” Green said. “We don’t let the outside elements affect who we are. I don’t have to do anything. This group is amazing; they energize themselves.”"

Trey was in a car accident at the during his freshman year in 2016 which ended his playing career at Temple. Read more

The life after basketball conversation came much sooner than Trey Lowe could have ever imagined.

His future plans were in his mind set in stone: play professional basketball – either in the NBA or overseas. That dream was crushed in the early morning hours of Feb. 28 2016.

Six years later he’s charting a new path – one that still involves hoops – as La Salle’s director of player personnel.

“I had to come to terms with everything and accept what happened. I feel like everything happens for a reason” Lowe said. Later adding “I just had to put my big boy pants on take it to the chest and deal with it.”

Temple played Central Florida at noon on Saturday Feb. 27. It was a normal gameday. Then-Temple coach Fran Dunphy had his team up early for breakfast and shootaround before squeaking out a 63-61 win over the Knights.

The Owls didn’t have another game scheduled until the following Thursday. So Lowe asked Dunphy if he could head home to Ewing New Jersey to have dinner with his family. To which Dunphy said of course.

Lowe a 6-foot-6 freshman guard at the time added a stop at Rutgers to visit some friends. On his drive back he fell asleep at the wheel resulting in a single-car accident. He woke up at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick surrounded by family teammates and his coach.

Lowe was one third of a highly touted Temple recruiting class alongside Shizz Alston Jr. and Ernest Aflakpui. Dunphy “not trying to exaggerate” endorsed Lowe’s pro potential. His career was cut short after 28 games with upper body injuries suffered in the accident.

“I told Trey on numerous occasions that unfortunately he has a wonderful story to tell.” Aaron McKie Temple men's basketball coach

“The following year he had this thought that he’s going to play again” Dunphy said. “He came to practice every single day. Practice gear sneakers ready to go. He could do right hand layups but then he kind of worked his way out. But he sat there every single day for three years.”

It took a while for Lowe to come to terms with what happened. He didn’t like talking about it. He didn’t like hearing about it. Thinking about what happened pushed him into a deeper depressed state mad at himself and mad at the world.

Getting his second shot

Lowe felt like he got over the final hurdle of acceptance after he graduated from Temple with his Master’s degree in 2020.

“Everybody played a part in pushing me and keeping me going” Lowe said. “But at the end of the day it came down to me. I feel like people can only do so much to help you get past it. If you don’t want to do it yourself it’s never going to happen.”

Conversations with his father Dunphy and then-assistant now Temple’s head coach Aaron McKie helped him settle on coaching as a viable next step.

Dunphy offered to help Lowe find a position somewhere after he graduated as a way to get a foot in the door. Once La Salle hired Dunphy out of retirement in April Lowe was in his former coach’s ear pitching himself for a job. The hire became official this season.

Lowe’s job puts his hands in different areas which he likes. Every day is a little bit different which he really likes. A prominent part of his workload is watching game film with players and building out scouting reports. Dunphy leans on him for advice as a recent player too.

Reaching the highest level of basketball is still Lowe’s dream now as a coach.

Where the accident used to be a source of pain it has since become Lowe’s driving motivation – something he thinks about every day. Sharing his journey has been another ancillary inspiring contribution to La Salle’s coaching staff.

“I told Trey on numerous occasions that unfortunately he has a wonderful story to tell” McKie said. “We talk to these guys about how lucky they are to get to be student-athletes and go to college and play basketball. For him all of that was just taken away in a blink…Trey is a great kid and he’s really going to help that program.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9pbnNpZGVyL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzUzMDU3MjQvbG93ZS0xMC1jaHJpc3RtYXMtZGF5LXRoaW5ncy1pbmNsdWRpbmctYWxsLWdyZWF0LWNhZ2V5LWNlbHRpYy1rbmlja3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lowe: 10 Christmas Day things including an all-time great a cagey Celtic and the Knicks!,"It's the Friday before Christmas and that means ... 10 things -- Christmas Day edition! This week we highlight two-time MVP Nikola Jokic making another MVP case Jayson Tatum's scary apex rise and -- holiday surprise! -- the New York Knicks?

1. Nikola Jokic always finding something new

The Denver Nuggets are No. 1 in the West. Jokic is averaging 24.7 points 11 rebounds 9.2 assists (what?) and 1.5 steals. He's shooting 62% overall and 67.5% on 2s. The Nuggets are obliterating teams when he's on the floor and helpless when he rests. He's No. 1 in almost every advanced statistic. It's too early to suss out the MVP race but it should go without saying that ""I just didn't feel like voting Jokic to the three-peat"" is not sufficient support for voting someone else. Start preparing better rationales.

That better rationale might be that someone else on an elite team -- Jayson Tatum Giannis Antetokounmpo Joel Embiid and Kevin Durant being the front-runners among that group right now -- is an amazing two-way player having an amazing season on par with what Jokic is doing. When it's close the ""how much do I trust them in the second round of the playoffs?"" test is not totally out of bounds as a tiebreaker -- depending on individual voting preferences -- even though the award is for the regular season.

But Jokic is absolutely this good. All-time-great good. And every season he arrives with new skills-within-skills that make him even more unguardable.

Denver runs a lot of typical big man sets designed to get Jokic the ball on the move -- usually for quick-hitting post-ups. But Jokic is hunting random cuts all over the floor and weaseling his way to more easy buckets:

The Jokic-Jamal Murray give-and-go contains infinite possibilities. Jokic is scoring more off cuts this season and hitting more 2s without dribbling per NBA.com. If the defense swarms on the catch no one is better making snap reads in traffic.

2. Yes Brook Lopez is that good on defense

If you want to boil Lopez's improbable late-career Defensive Player of the Year case into one 10-second clip this would do:

The perfect big-man defender is scheme proof -- capable of playing any style against any lineup. Lopez is closer to that platonic ideal than his gigantic frame and ground-bound game might indicate but he would have some issues against lineups featuring five 3-point shooters. (That concern drove skepticism in some corners about whether Rudy Gobert deserved three Defensive Player of the Year awards.)

That big man archetype is really hard to find. Prime Kevin Garnett could do everything in a very different NBA. I'd love to see Hakeem Olajuwon and Bill Russell play now. Draymond Green is the greatest and most well-rounded defender of the 3-point era. Is Evan Mobley next? What about Victor Wembanyama? Jaren Jackson Jr. might snatch Defensive Player of the Year from Lopez but he still fouls himself out of heavy minutes.

Prime Anthony Davis got close to this infallible big man dream but he's always injured. Bam Adebayo and Antetokounmpo approximate it. Adebayo can switch and protect the rim but switching early in possessions often leaves Adebayo away from the basket -- and effectively out of the action -- at go time. (The Heat have realized this; Adebayo is switching on 12 picks per 100 possessions -- down from 17.5 last season per Second Spectrum.)

Antetokounmpo appearing everywhere at once allows Lopez to hang in his natural habitat but that relationship is reciprocal; Antetokounmpo roams because Lopez lords over the paint. Playing more center would expose Antetokounmpo to more physical pounding.

Besides look at that clip! Lopez chases Stephen Curry above the arc and spreads those condor arms so Curry can't sneak any pass to Kevon Looney. (Lopez is underrated as a switch defender -- in the right doses.)

One fire extinguished Lopez retreats. Green rampages into a 2-on-1 facing Lopez as last line of defense. How many times have we seen Green outwit that defender?

Lopez turns predator into prey playing Green for the pass while standing tall to disrupt Green's layup.

Opponents are shooting 52% at the rim with Lopez nearby one of the stingiest marks in the league and they encroach much less often with Lopez in the game. He's averaging his most points and minutes since his final Brooklyn Nets season. Lopez has hit 39.5% from deep and 59% on 2s. He spaces the floor and his burly box-outs and post-ups define Milwaukee's ""pound the stuffing out of you"" ethos.

The Bucks are a league-best 22-9. Khris Middleton has missed most of the season. Jrue Holiday missed seven games. Lopez has an All-Star case.

3. Jayson Tatum expert screener

The Celtics are still in a virtual tie for No. 1 in points per possession despite their prolonged slump -- that's how blazing their first 20 games were. Some worrisome signs have dotted this slump; their turnovers are creeping up and they aren't generating enough shots at the rim. But they've had some injuries and reintegrating Robert Williams III -- after playing mostly with five shooters -- was always going to cause hiccups. This team will be fine.

How often Boston uses its two best players -- Tatum and Jaylen Brown -- in creative screening actions on and off the ball has always been Boston's bellwether. The best of those actions pair bigs or point guards (or both!) with Boston's stars -- forcing defenses to either switch into bad size mismatches or risk tough rotations. Joe Mazzulla Boston's new coach has introduced more of this.

Tatum is becoming a cagey screener varying his movement patterns to catch defenses off-guard:

Tatum sets the second of two picks for Malcolm Brogdon and lurches toward the foul line. That feint works because Tatum loves setting up shop there when teams switch smaller guys onto him -- as the Los Angeles Lakers do here with Kendrick Nunn. Nunn leaps toward the foul line but Tatum is gone having moonwalked to the arc for an open triple.

Boston has also used Tatum more as the back-screener in so-called ""Spain"" pick-and-rolls:

Normally Tatum's job there is to slam Al Horford's guy -- Domantas Sabonis -- with a back pick unlocking an open rim-run for Horford. Tatum sees Sabonis trapping Derrick White aborts the script and flares outside. Harrison Barnes sticks to Tatum freeing Brogdon for an open 3.

Tatum is setting 12.3 on-ball screens per 100 possessions easily a career high and up from 8.1 last season per Second Spectrum. He's both setting and cutting around off-ball screens at career-high rates.

Tatum is refining every subsection of his game. His vision anticipation and physical talents are rising toward an apex intersection.

The Knicks found themselves almost the instant Tom Thibodeau inserted Grimes into the starting lineup benched Derrick Rose and Evan Fournier and slotted Miles McBride into reserve units. Everyone in New York's nine-man rotation is an average defender at worst (at least when dialed in). Immanuel Quickley is thriving as something of a sixth starter. RJ Barrett eats as the lone starter on bench units.

The Knicks' revamped starting five is plus-75 in 255 minutes -- a complete flip-flop after two years of rollicking bench groups carrying punchless starting lineups. Grimes's 3-and-D skill set meshes around three ball-dominant starters in Jalen Brunson Julius Randle and Barrett.

Brunson is a stabilizer who fits New York's smash-mouth style. Having a competent point guard allows you to swap out ball handling (i.e. Fournier and Rose) for defense and spot-up shooting.

Grimes has hit 38.6% on 3s but he's more than a stand-still shooter. He can pump-and-go when defenders run him off the arc and make the next play. He's cutting and screening away from the ball relocating for open 3s with defenses in scramble mode -- injecting some needed unpredictability into New York's thudding offense:

Grimes is as advertised on defense. In the past week alone New York has used him on Zach LaVine DeMar DeRozan and Tyrese Haliburton. The Knicks are not afraid to switch him onto bigger players. (Randle seems to enjoy switching lately.)

Grimes is smart and stout with impeccable balance.

He diagnoses that set early. Grimes trails Haliburton around one screen and then flies out to Buddy Hield on an impromptu switch -- staying down and attached on multiple fakes before inhaling Hield's triple. (The Knicks on offense use Grimes as the back-screener -- Hield's role -- in this same action.)

Time will tell whether New York's (divided) brain trust was right to hold off on trading Grimes (and everything else) for Donovan Mitchell. I understood it at the time; New York did not have a ready-made contender around Mitchell as the Cleveland Cavaliers did. The Knicks' path after a theoretical Mitchell trade was murky.

Their path to real contention now is murky. They remain a middle-of-the-road team. They'll need a tentpole star either via free agency or trade. Extending Quickley and Obi Toppin could shut off their future cap space.

But keep this up and that's two solid seasons in three years. Small victories lead to bigger ones.

5. The zig-zaggy creativity of Jalen Brunson

Brunson is averaging 21 points and 6 dimes on solid shooting -- living up to his new contract. Few ball handlers combine Brunson's fire-hydrant physicality with so much creativity. He has a deep bag of moves and fakes and he strings them together in sequences -- sometimes very long ones -- that make sense to only him.

Like what even is this:

That is 11 seconds of continuous circular dribbling that somehow leads to a wide-open 3. Brunson stabs at defenders fades back hits them with hesitations and half-spins (he might be the reigning king of the Smitty fake spin) until something opens. Brunson is not super quick but he's really hard to grasp.

Look at him zig-zag through a zone defense!

Brunson might start possessions with an improvised guard-guard screen aimed at drawing a smaller defender he can overpower. The Knicks have scored 1.17 points per possession out of Brunson isolations -- 14th among 103 ball handlers who have run at least 50 such plays per Second Spectrum. Brunson going one-on-one more means Randle is doing it less -- and as a result with greater efficiency.

Brunson can screen for Randle and Barrett in inverted pick-and-rolls too. Switch and the Knicks choose between mismatches. Help and recover and someone pops open. New York has scored an astounding 1.33 points per possession trips featuring a Brunson ball screen -- sixth among 249 players who have set at least 50 per Second Spectrum.

New York's offense isn't pretty. It's still a blunt force weapon. But Brunson gives the Knicks more ways to aim that force in more directions. It's brutality with variety and it's working.

6. Christian Wood's defensive geometry

The only bright side of Maxi Kleber's injury -- and the Dallas Mavericks exiling JaVale McGee to the deep bench -- is that Dallas almost has to see if lineups with Wood as the only big man sink or swim. Jason Kidd has been reluctant to lean too far in that direction likely pessimistic those groups can survive on defense.

Wood has never nailed down a defensive position. At power forward he's not quite attentive or fast enough to chase stretchy shooters and execute help rotations. He's not a reliable rim-protector at center and can't seem to master the angles and timing of drop-back schemes. Wood is too high too flat too open toward the sideline too late getting back to his man. Either a driving lane or a pocket pass is open.

He sometimes does his work late -- waiting too long to rotate or yielding too much space to shooters on switches.

But when focused Wood can be a decent defender. He has looked good in switching schemes; he has nimble feet.

He's a fantastic offensive player especially as a stretch center. The Mavs with Doncic on the floor and Wood as the lone big have outscored opponents by 3.4 points per 100 possessions -- and done so as you'd expect: great offense slightly below-average (but workable) defense.

That's not a bad formula. It can make Doncic's life easier. There is no point trading a first-round pick for Wood if you're not going to give these groups some leeway.

But it's on Wood to gain Kidd's trust on defense. Wood is on an expiring deal eligible for an extension. He hasn't gotten one. Could he be a sneaky trade candidate? Dallas might feel more pressure to make a short-term upgrade than they had expected to before the season.

7. Finish it Steven Adams!

I love Steven Adams. You love Steven Adams. Everyone loves Steven Adams. He's delightful. He does his job. He's probably the best offensive rebounder in the league on pace for one of the highest single-season offensive rebounding rates in history. His screens hurt. He breaks up scuffles in hilarious big-boy fashion. He's indestructible. People run into him get hurt and smile.

He's a good passer with little interest in scoring. Teammates love that kind of player. He springs Desmond Bane on handoffs and backdoor cuts. Those two have rare precious chemistry. When the Grizzlies were searching against the Golden State Warriors in the postseason with Ja Morant injured they went back to Adams -- after benching him -- and rediscovered their bully-ball identity.

But sometimes points are there for the taking at the rim and Adams has to take more of them:

That would be a tricky finish around Yuta Watanabe but Adams is 6-11 with a cinder-block body that repels everything it touches. Power through and score.

One possible reason for Adams' hesitancy: His finishing has dropped off. Adams is shooting 60% at the basket for the second straight season -- toward the bottom among bigs. Adams sometimes volleyballs his own misses and comes up empty after two or three tips.

None of this really changes that Adams is a good player and A-plus teammate. But when the margins get smaller you need every tool to be sharp.

8. Free Zeke!

I ... like Zeke Nnaji? I don't understand why he so rarely plays? He's inexperienced and might be a tweener (between power forward and center) but he always seems to be doing something helpful:

That is tidy work from a big. Being alone on the weak side of a Doncic pick-and-roll is an NBA torture chamber. You have to help inside and scamper back to your guy without yielding an open triple or teetering so much that the Dorian Finney-Smiths of the world blow by you. Nnaji's balance is really good.

He then switches onto Doncic and contests Doncic's triple without fouling (according to the referees who can't call it every time Doncic falls).

Nnaji is 3-of-14 on 3s this season but he's 64-of-153 -- 42% -- for his career. He can shoot. Rebounding and fouling have been weak spots but there's something here. (For what it's worth advanced stats do not like Nnaji's defense.)

The Nuggets are plus-218 with Jokic on the floor. They are minus-174 with Jokic resting. That doesn't even seem possible. That is almost ""should we take shot clock violations and set our defense?"" bad.

Trying Nnaji as backup center in place of DeAndre Jordan is literally the least risky attempt at a fix (other than having both Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. on the floor.) Nnaji can work as a rim-runner in that role. He and Jordan can play together against opponents with size. (Nnaji can play alongside Jokic too and even in ultra-big lineups featuring both Jokic and Aaron Gordon.)

Nnaji finally got another chance Tuesday against the Memphis Grizzlies and was steady in 11 minutes backing up Jokic. More please!

9. De'Anthony Melton connector

In trading Danny Green and a first-round pick for Melton the Sixers knew they were getting an ace defender with a reliable 3-point shot and some off-the-bounce chops -- a chaos engine who would nudge them into transition and fortify perhaps the league's weakest rebounding team.

They've gotten all that plus more connective tissue in the half court than they might have anticipated. Melton has been a nasty screener for both James Harden and Embiid; he's already blown past his previous single-season high in on-ball picks per Second Spectrum.

Melton gets into Embiid's man -- JaMychal Green -- shoves him toward the paint and forces the Warriors into a painful temporary switch: Ty Jerome onto (gulp) Embiid. As Jerome and Green figure out how to escape this crisis Embiid slings the ball to Melton in open space. This is where guard screeners really sing. This is playmaking position and Melton has plenty of playmaking experience.

Embiid cuts and Melton finds him on a give-and-go. Philly has scored 1.20 points whenever a Melton ball screen leads directly to a shot -- 17th among 244 players who have set at least 50 such picks per Second Spectrum.

Melton enters to Embiid and slices to the rim the moment his guy leaves to double Embiid. That's the easy part. That inside-out dish to Harden is next level -- the ability to catch map the floor spin and kick it. (Harden recognizing that it's legal to take catch-and-shoot 3s is healthy.)

This is how the Miami Heat used P.J. Tucker last season. Tucker has supplied defense and second-chance points for the Sixers but has otherwise been a statue in the corners. I wonder if Philly at full health might explore the Tyrese Maxey/Melton/Harden/Tobias Harris/Embiid lineup -- the starters with Melton in Tucker's place. They sacrifice size and defense but gain real juice. Harris could defend power forwards -- more natural for him than defending wings -- full time. That group has played only four possessions together per Cleaning The Glass.

When they need more defense they could bust out the Tucker/Melton/Embiid trio -- with two of Harden Harris and Maxey. The Sixers will need all these groups (and others featuring Shake Milton Georges Niang their backup centers maybe Matisse Thybulle in some matchups) to challenge Milwaukee and Boston but they have the upside for it.

10. The best postgame victory in the NBA

Almost every team has a victory celebration song. The Lakers use Randy Newman's ""I Love L.A."" The LA Clippers go with ""California Love"" by Tupac and Dr. Dre. The contrast is perfect: classic sheen for the Lakers 1990s rap for the team that fashions itself cooler and brasher.

But the league's best victory song is Philadelphia's disco-infused 1970s classic ""Here Come the Sixers"" and it's not close. The beat is catchy and the tone is so cheerful. It doesn't matter that the lyrics are child-like. (As Scott Cacciola outlined in the New York Times ""Sesame Street"" helped inspire the song.) I mean the chorus is ""1 2 3 4 5 Sixers! 10 9 8 76ers!""

It's the perfect blend of funky and cheesy. You revel in the kitsch and not so secretly like the song on its merits. The first 20 seconds are all instrumental and the Sixers play that opening over live action if the game is decided. It's a fun buildup starting the party and priming fans to sing the opening lyrics. It is an audio version of Red Auerbach's cigar and if the Sixers ever change it we riot."

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFsY29sbS1hdy1jYW5jZWxlZC0xMDBtLW5lb20tY29udHJhY3QtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLWFidXNlLXNhdWRpLTIwMjQtNdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFsY29sbS1hdy1jYW5jZWxlZC0xMDBtLW5lb20tY29udHJhY3QtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLWFidXNlLXNhdWRpLTIwMjQtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CEO canceled $100M Neom contract after Saudis bulldozed villages,"The site of NEOM in Tabuk Province Saudi Arabia. NEOM

Malcolm Aw said he pulled out of a Neom contract because of alleged Saudi human rights abuses.

The CEO of Solar Water told BI that he had planned to build solar desalination plants.

Human rights campaigners say tribe members are being forcibly evicted to make way for the megacity.

A green energy founder pulled out of a $100 million Neom contract after he realized that the Saudis were bulldozing villages to make way for the megacity.

Malcolm Aw the CEO and founder of Solar Water told Business Insider that he initially got involved with Neom to help realize its ambitions as a pioneering green energy ""eco-city.""

Neom is the centerpiece of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 project to diversify the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels and transform it into a luxury tourism destination and innovation hub.

However Aw said he was so appalled at reports of human rights abuses that he canceled the Neom contract in 2022 despite having already built some of his desalination plants there.

""They just they bulldoze their way right through villages and everything which is just unbelievable"" said Aw.

Aw spoke to BI after BBC News reported that an exiled Saudi colonel said Saudi Arabia authorized the use of lethal force to clear the way for its Neom desert megacity.

Col Rabih Alenezi said he was ordered to evict people living on the land to make way for a part of the project called The Line . The area was mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe.

The BBC said it was not able to independently verify Alenezi's comments about lethal force.

However satellite images analyzed by the BBC showed three villages including schools and hospitals were destroyed to make way for Neom.

One of the villagers Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti was later reportedly killed by Saudi authorities said the UN.

""What it tried to do is turn the whole province into Dubai or Qatar or something but in doing so they are clearing the people who have been there for years out of the area"" said Aw.

""These people could be such a contribution to this whole development. You know the villages have all been removed.""







Aw who is a descendant of Tiger Balm founder Aw Boon Haw told BI that he had initially been drawn to work on the Neom project because of its commitment to green energy and ecology.

Aw's company uses solar energy for desalination while most desalination plants burn fossil fuels and have been found to pollute oceans. Neom had offered Aw's company Solar Water $100m for exclusive rights to use his technology.

Neom's planners say they want to be an""eco-city"" with the signature project ""The Line"" — a vertical mirrored skyscraper cutting through the desert — running on 100% renewable energy and 95% of the land preserved for nature. They claim to be committed to ""respecting existing communities and cultural heritage within our region.""

But Aw believes the promises are not being fulfilled and planners are performing a U-turn on their original vision for the city.

""What they're doing is not ethical and what they're doing is they're creating an exclusivity to house wealthy people in a wealthy touristic area. But that wasn't the original idea. The idea was to develop a green scenario"" he said.

""The whole idea we came in is to make the place green and for the people the local people the indigenous who have been there for ages for yonks to be able to share into development"" said Aw. ""But then they change course. Suddenly they are totally different from what we expect to do and in doing so they have done a lot of damage.""

Neom declined to comment on Aw's claims. The Saudi embassy in the UK did not respond to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia has been trying to quell public criticism about its Vision 2030 plans .

Last year BI reported that the crackdown extended to those criticizing the evictions on social media with Fatima al-Shawarbi sentenced to 30 years in prison for speaking out.

The project has been beset by problems in recent months with costs spiraling to an estimated $1 trillion and key projects delayed or cut back. In April Bloomberg reported that Saudi officials were reducing the number of people expected to be living in Neom from around one million to 300000 by 2030. The report also said the length of The Line could be cut from around 100 miles to one mile.

Aw urged planners to stand by their original ethical and ecological vision.

""You know we have the technology to solve the [green energy] problem that people are complaining about today. Absolutely. Absolutely. But there's just not the vision or the ethical commitment"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Orbits $52M-$55M Opening – Friday PM Box Office Update,"FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Knock on wood but this summer release looks to be meeting its tracking projections. Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

The rest of the top five is as follows:

2.) Fall Guy (Uni) 4008 theaters Fri $3.6M 3-day $14.5M -48% Total $50.5M/Wk 2

3.) Challengers (AMZ) 2609 theaters Fri $1.55M 3-day $5M -34% Total $38.3M/Wk 3

4.) Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Fri $1M 3-day $3.4M -48% Total $12M/Wk 2

5.) Godzilla x Kong (WB/Leg) 2531 theaters Fri $700K 3-day $3M -34% Total $192.3M/Wk 7

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL2dvcmRvbi1yYW1zYXlzLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtZW1waXJlLXRyaXBsZWQtbG9zc2VzLXRvLTM0bS1sYXN0LXllYXLSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8xMC9nb3Jkb24tcmFtc2F5cy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWVtcGlyZS10cmlwbGVkLWxvc3Nlcy10by0zNG0tbGFzdC15ZWFy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant empire tripled losses to £3.4m last year,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL2dvcmRvbi1yYW1zYXlzLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtZW1waXJlLXRyaXBsZWQtbG9zc2VzLXRvLTM0bS1sYXN0LXllYXLSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8xMC9nb3Jkb24tcmFtc2F5cy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWVtcGlyZS10cmlwbGVkLWxvc3Nlcy10by0zNG0tbGFzdC15ZWFy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226904700>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Last year FAMU asked Blueprint for $15 million more for Bragg improvements. The board in February denied the university's request for immediate funding but voted to explore the use of economic development funds rather than infrastructure dollars for the project.

Robinson in a Monday letter to Leon County Commissioner Carolyn Cummings who chairs the Blueprint board thanked the agency for the $10 million and consideration of the additional $15 million.

""However at this time we are withdrawing our request for additional assistance from the Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency for Bragg Memorial Stadium"" Robinson wrote in the letter obtained by the Democrat. ""We look forward to continuing to work with you the Blueprint Board of Directors and Blueprint staff in other ways going forward.""

The letter was dated two days after FAMU's spring graduation ceremony and surprise announcement of the purported nine-figure stock contribution from Gregory Gerami CEO of Batterson Farms Corp a little-known hemp company based in Austin Texas. The gift would have been the biggest ever for FAMU or any historically Black college or university.

But on Thursday FAMU put Gerami's donation on hold amid mounting questions about it. Gerami has a history of philanthropic overtures to other universities including Coastal Carolina University and the University of Texas at Austin that never materialized according to reporting by the Myrtle Beach Sun News.

It's unclear whether FAMU's decision to backtrack on its most recent Blueprint request was directly related to Gerami's would-be donation. The gift agreement between Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust stipulated that at least $100 million would go toward FAMU athletics.

A FAMU spokesperson was not available for comment on late Thursday on whether the now-paused donation would prompt the university to reconsider its abandoned request for $15 million in Blueprint funds.

News reports say cold weather has shut down several U.S. oil refineries causing crude prices to spike.

LyondellBasell Industries shutdown the large crude distillation unit and two hydrotreaters on Friday at its 268000-barrel-per-day Houston refinery due to extreme cold and the winter storm impacting much of the U.S. and Gulf Coast Reuters reported citing sources.

The global chemical company says Houston Refining is one of the largest refineries in the U.S. designed to process heavy-sulfur crude oil.

Data compiled by the U.S. National Weather Service showed temperatures in Houston fell 45 degrees on Thursday from a high of 63 degrees Fahrenheit to a low of 18 degrees Fahrenheit.

BRUTAL WINTER STORM KNOCKS OUT POWER FOR OVER A MILLION AMERICANS

A spokesperson for the Houston-based refinery told FOX News on Friday ""Our LyondellBasell U.S. Gulf Coast sites continue to conduct detailed assessments stemming from Winter Storm Elliott but for competitive reasons we do not provide specific details about units their operational status production figures or supply.""

""Our focus remains on ensuring the health and safety of our people and the communities where we operate. We may need to conduct some flaring to ensure safe operations"" the spokesperson continued. ""Flares are a safety feature designed to burn excess material resulting from certain routine operations as well as some non-routine situations such as power loss or equipment failure.""

""We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our community neighbors.""

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) today released the latest yearly editions of its Toxic 100 lists of the top corporate air and water polluters and top greenhouse gas emitters in the United States based on the most recent data available from the Environmental Protection Agency.

New this year is the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by the amount that their distribution of fossil fuels contributes to global climate change. This new list joins the Greenhouse 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their emissions responsible for global climate change according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the Toxic 100 Air and Toxic 100 Water Indexes which rank U.S. industrial polluters using the EPA Toxics Release Inventory. The indexes created as part of PERI’s Corporate Toxics Information Project once again include environmental justice indicators to assess impacts on low-income people and minorities.

“The Toxic 100 and Greenhouse 100 inform consumers shareholders regulators lawmakers and communities which large corporations release toxic and climate-altering pollutants into our environment” says Michael Ash professor of economics at UMass Amherst and co-director of the Corporate Toxics Information Project. “We assess not just how many pounds of pollutants are released but which are the most toxic and who is exposed. People have a right to know about toxic hazards to which they are exposed. Legislators need to understand the effects of pollution on their constituents.”

For the first time PERI has published a Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their 2020 supply of products that result in greenhouse gas emissions when the products are released combusted or oxidized. The top five companies on this year’s inaugural list in order are Marathon Petroleum Phillips 66 Valero Energy Exxon Mobil and Peabody Energy. The first four of these are primarily on the list because of their petroleum refining operations although the top two also conduct natural gas extraction. Fifth-ranked Peabody Energy is on the list due to its coal mining ventures. The top four each produced fossil fuels that resulted in 280 million metric tons or more of CO2-equivalent emissions. Rounding out the top 10 greenhouse suppliers are Enterprise Products Partners Chevron BP Arch Resources and Shell PLC.

The Greenhouse 100 Index ranks companies by 2020 direct emissions of greenhouse gasses from large sources. The top three companies are Vistra Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company the fourth year in a row in which these companies were in the top three spots. They each released more than 75 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Together these three companies released 4% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from all sources including non-energy sources.

The rest of the top 10 in the Greenhouse 100 are Berkshire Hathaway American Electric Power Energy Capital Partners NextEra Energy Xcel Energy the U.S government and Exxon Mobil the top company whose direct emissions are not dominated by electric power plants. Among the top 10 Energy Capital Partners has the highest weighted share of minorities living within 10 miles of its facilities.

In order LyondellBasell BASF Becton Dickinson Salzgitter Huntsman Dow Inc Canopus International Celanese Berkshire Hathaway and NOV Inc. lead the Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index which reports the top companies in 2020 in terms of total potential chronic human health risk from toxic chemical air pollutants. Five of these companies are in the top 10 almost entirely because of chromium or ethylene oxide released from one of their facilities. The Toxic 100 Air Index covers both publicly traded and privately held companies such as Koch Industries (No. 58) that appear on Forbes Fortune or S&P lists. The index includes environmental justice indicators that denote for example while minorities make up just under 40% of the U.S. population they bear 68% of the air-toxics risk from facilities owned by LyondellBasell.

The Toxic 100 Water Polluters Index which ranks the pounds of toxics released into surface water or sent to water-treatment systems in 2020 adjusted for chemical toxicity is led this year by Northrop Grumman LyondellBasell NextEra Industries Dow Inc. and Cargill. The Toxic 100 Water Polluters list also once again includes environmental justice indicators that show for example minorities bear 63% of the toxic hazard created by Dow from water releases and transfers to water treatment facilities.

In addition to the top 100 lists search functions for toxic air toxic water and greenhouse gas polluters provide information on all companies reporting releases or production to the Toxics Release Inventory the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program or the EIA-7A coal mine survey. Data related to Air Toxics at School and the Coal Producers Index is also searchable through the Corporate Toxics Information Project.

“In making this information available we are building on the achievements of the right-to-know movement” Ash notes. “Our goal is to engender public participation in environmental decision-making and to help residents translate the right to know into the right to clean air clean water and a livable planet.”

The new Marriott Bonvoy Bevy™ American Express® Card and re-energized Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card allow new customers to earn up to 150000 Marriott Bonvoy points with sign-ups and approvals before January 11 2023.

Currently that is the best direct new sign-up offer out there although like most point lures it comes with a spending challenge. This means new eligible Brilliant Card Members can earn 150000 Marriott Bonvoy points after they spend $5000 in eligible purchases on the Card in the first three months. Similarly new eligible Bevy Card Members can earn 125000 Marriott Bonvoy points after spending $4000 in eligible purchases in the first three months.

Possibly the only other offers that come close at this time might be the AMEX Platinum card that with some clever manipulations can turn a public offer of 80000 points into 150000 for qualified applicants. Similarly the Chase Sapphire Reserve adds up to much more than the 80k signing bonus when redeemed in various creative ways. And both cards come with steep annual fees.

The fleeting new Marriott credit card offers come when business travel returns to full swing and hotels are nearing full occupancy with spiking nightly rates. Many airline and hotel loyalty departments are curtailing or ending their pandemic programs that retained perks and extended membership levels during the down years of travel leaving consumers to seek out new loyalty programs and beef up their travel status benefits in various ways. And the quickest way to download points for the least amount of money is with an affiliated credit card.

As business travelers may be traveling within programs that require stays at Marriott-branded properties the Marriott Bonvoy Bevy™ American Express® Card or Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card can bring a stack of added advantages that would be unwise to ignore. For starters there are the points themselves.

Following the showering of points especially for signing up with the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card cardholders get complimentary Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite Status an 85000-point anniversary free night award $300 in cash credits for dining at restaurants 4x points for dining and grocery shopping purchases 1000 added Marriott Bonvoy Bonus Points with each qualifying stay 25 qualifying credits toward higher Elite Status and 6X Marriott Bonvoy Points for stays at participating hotels.

So what is new and noteworthy about the refreshed Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card in this offer?

NEW: Complimentary Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite Status

NEW: Up to 21X Marriott Bonvoy® Points on eligible stays at participating Bonvoy hotels

NEW: 1 Free Night Award each year after Card renewal month that can be used for one night at hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy. Certain hotels have resort fees.

NEW: Up to $300 back per calendar year (up to $25/month) on dining purchases at restaurants worldwide

NEW: 25 Elite Night Credits each calendar year

Up to $100 property credit towards qualifying charges at The Ritz-Carlton (excluding Ritz-Carlton Reserve) and St. Regis hotel brands when Card Members book direct using a special rate for a 2+ night stay.

NEW: Priority Pass Select Membership (enrollment required)

NEW: Application fee credit for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry (which comes with access to TSA PreCheck)

NEW: Up to 10X points for other qualifying purchases.

Savvy travelers can leverage their earnings by transferring Marriott Bonvoy points to an airline partner such as United where the MileagePlus program adds a 10 percent bonus for those transferred points and delivers a 1.1-cent valuation. By some published accounts Marriott Bonvoy valuations toward Marriott hotel stays come out to around $.84. However with the new Marriott credit card advantages that number is boosted by the added bonus points for each stay and the annual 85k free night award.

All those benefits are then complemented by the American Express partnership which comes with Priority Pass airport lounge access Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee credits generous travel insurance and purchase protections.

While the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card comes with a steep annual fee of $650 the Marriott Bonvoy Bevy™ American Express® Card may be more affordable at $250 and comes with many of the same benefits:

125000 Marriott Bonvoy points after spending $4000 in eligible purchases on the Card in the first three months

6X Marriott Bonvoy Points for stays at participating hotels (up to 18.5X with the new offer)

4X Marriott Bonvoy Points for dining and grocery purchases globally

Up to $15000 combined 2X Marriott Bonvoy Points on all other purchases

1000 Marriott Bonvoy Bonus Points with each qualifying stay

Complimentary Gold Elite status

A Free Night Award worth 50000 Marriott Bonvoy Points with $15000 in spend per year

15 Elite Night Credits toward higher Elite Status

However the Amex Marriott Bonvoy Bevy does not include Priority Pass lounge access nor the complimentary annual free night award.

The new Marriott credit card offers allow members to gain free stays perks and upgrades at more than 8100 hotels and resorts in 139 countries and territories including access to the most extensive collection of luxury properties.

Members also gain special access to multitudes of experiences through Marriott Bonvoy Moments celebrating art music sports food and fashion whether at home or traveling.

As new cardmembers receive automatic Gold Elite status with Marriott Bonvoy they enjoy upgrades to preferred-level rooms late checkout and a welcome bonanza of bonus points at check-in. In addition platinum Elite status might mean complimentary breakfasts or suite upgrades. All these elements add up to a positive trade-off for annual fees and a sky’s-the-limit upside for travelers who stay at Marriott as their preferred hospitality company or corporate program partner.

“With new and improved benefits like elevated status and even more ways to earn points the Marriott Bonvoy American Express Cards give Card Members benefits that were once only available to the most frequent traveler” said Jon Gantman Senior Vice President and General Manager Cobrand Product Management at American Express. “And with American Express Membership our Card Members get access to American Express Experiences and our best-in-class service.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvNDEwMDg5NzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Element by Westin® Debuts in Reno Nevada,"Element by Westin® part of Marriott Bonvoy's portfolio of 30 extraordinary brands has extended its footprint in Reno Nevada with the opening of Element Reno Experience District.

According to the FTC the world's second-largest payment-processing corporation intentionally blocked vendors' abilities to route ecommerce transactions through third-party payment networks such as virtual wallets.

This the commission alleges violates a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act which mandates banks allow vendors a choice of at least two unaffiliated payment networks.

""The Federal Trade Commission is ordering an end to illegal business tactics that Mastercard has been using to force merchants to route debit card payments through its payment network and is requiring Mastercard to stop blocking the use of competing debit payment networks"" the FTC said in a Friday statement.

The crux of the dispute is Mastercard's implementation of payment tokenization — the process through which payment networks replace sensitive cardholder financial information with alternative less sensitive IDs.

These numerical IDs can be held by third party services such as virtual wallets and payment applications.

Mastercard holds complete control over its cardholders' tokenization process forcing third parties to work with the company to utilize the cards.

A Mastercard spokesperson confirmed the agreement with the FTC telling FOX Business the company believes its practices have been lawful but that changes will be made to comply with the FTC's demands.

""We believe that our existing routing practices are lawful and have always provided choice to merchants. We will continue the work to update our processes to comply with the consent order and provide even greater choice."" the company told FOX Business in an exclusive statement.

Mastercard went on to tell FOX Business that it stands by its tokenization practices as a form of commercial security.

""While we are taking these steps to bring this matter to a close there should be no question that tokenized transactions provide an increased level of protection to both consumers and merchants"" Mastercard stated.

The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the FTC was investigating Mastercard and Visa over security tokens. People told the Journal the FTC had been investigating the two companies for years but recently widened the probe to focus on routing challenges stemming from security tokens.

The Inter Milan player posted a statement on his Twitter account saying “my story with the Cameroonian national team has come to an end.”

“Players come and go names are fleeting but Cameroon comes before any person or player” Onana wrote without citing reasons for his decision. “Cameroon remains eternal and so does my love for the national team.”

The last of Onana’s 34 international games was the 1-0 loss to Switzerland on Nov. 24 at the World Cup in Qatar.

Onana later released a statement referring to his disagreement with Song over team tactics that led to him being dropped for the next game a 3-3 draw with Serbia.

“I have put all my efforts and energy into finding solutions to a situation that a footballer often experiences but there has been no will on the other side” Onana said then. “Some moments are difficult to assimilate.”

Song later said he needed all his players to “show discipline and respect.”

Cameroon went on to beat Brazil 1-0 in its final Group G game but did not advance to the round of 16.

Both are public health nurses employed by Linn County Public Health in eastern Iowa. They’ve learned that dating apps are the most efficient way to inform users that people they previously met on the sites may have exposed them to sexually transmitted infections.

A nationwide surge in STIs also known as STDs — with reported cases of gonorrhea and syphilis increasing 10% and 7% respectively from 2019 to 2020 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — isn’t sparing Iowa. The duo has found that the telephone call a traditional method of contact tracing no longer works well.

“When I started 12 years ago we called everyone” said Meador the county health department’s clinical branch supervisor. “It’s getting harder and harder to just call someone on the phone.”

Even texting is ineffective they said. And people aren’t necessarily answering messages on Facebook. The dating apps are where they’re at.

Because many people are meeting sex partners online — through such sites as Grindr or Snapchat which are headquartered in West Hollywood and Santa Monica Calif. respectively — contact tracers often don’t have much information to go on just a screen name or a picture.

So about a year ago Meador and her colleagues got approval from their bosses at the local level to build profiles on the app through which they can contact the sex partners of infected people.

Traditionally contact tracers interview people infected with an STI about their recent encounters and then reach out to those partners to tell them about the potential exposure.

Linn County contact tracers use the apps throughout their workday. Grindr in particular relies on geolocation showing users matches who are close by. So the tracers use the apps when they’re out and about hoping to wander into the same neighborhoods as the person diagnosed with an STI. Sometimes users “tap” the contract tracers to see whether they’re interested — in dating that is.

When the public health officials spot someone they’re looking for they send a message asking for a call. It’s a successful method: Herber-Downey estimated they make an initial contact 75% of the time.

Linn County’s decision to move online comes as STI rates rise nationally funding to fight them falls and people adopt new technologies to meet people and seek fun. “STIs are increasing way faster than the funding we have” said Leo Parker director of prevention programs for the National Coalition of STD Directors all while public health departments — many underfunded — are grappling with new behaviors.

“Social media companies have billions; we have tens of thousands” said Jeffrey Klausner a University of Southern California public health professor who previously served as San Francisco’s director of STD prevention and control services. That funding disparity means few public health departments have staff members who can go online. “It’s only really in major cities that they have anyone who’s tasked for that” Klausner said.

Even when departments have enough employees to take on the challenge institutional support can be lacking. Some public health officials question employees who log into the apps. Klausner once testified on behalf of a Ventura County Calif. contact tracer who was fired for using sex sites for work.

But with people migrating online to meet partners following them there makes sense. “We’re now in a digital age” Parker said. Individuals might not be out or might be questioning their identity making online venues comfortable anonymous spaces for romance — which in turn means people are harder to reach face-to-face at least at first.

What’s more online spaces like Grindr are effective public health tools beyond contact tracing. They can be useful ways to get the word out about public health concerns.

Parker and the Linn County officials said public service announcements on dating apps — advocating for condom use or sharing the business hours for sexual health clinics — do seem to lead people to services. “We do have individuals coming in saying ‘I saw you had free testing. I saw it on Grindr’” Parker said.

Grindr which touts itself as the biggest dating app focused on LGBTQ+ people pushes out messages and information to its members said Jack Harrison-Quintana director of Grindr for Equality. That engagement intensified during a 2015 meningitis outbreak among LGBTQ+ communities in Chicago for example.

During that outbreak the app sent citywide messages about vaccination. Then Harrison-Quintana took advantage of the service’s design: Using the site’s geolocating capabilities Grindr workers targeted messages to specific neighborhoods. “We could go in and really go block to block and say ‘Is this where the cases are showing up?’” he said. If so they sent more messages to that area.

That campaign encouraged further efforts from the app which regularly sends public health messages about everything from COVID-19 to monkeypox to the platform’s base of roughly 11 million monthly users. Grindr also allows users to display their HIV status and indicate whether they’re vaccinated against COVID monkeypox and meningitis.

There are a couple of things Grindr won’t do however. The company won’t allow public health departments to create institutional accounts. And it won’t allow automated notifications about STI exposures to be sent to users.

That’s due to privacy concerns the company said despite calls from public health advocates to deploy better messaging features. Grindr believes that a government presence on the app would be too intrusive and that even anonymous notifications would allow users to trace infections back to their source.

When asked about public health officials who join the site on their own company spokesperson Patrick Lenihan said: “Individuals are free to say something like ‘I’m a public health professional — ask me about my work!’ in their profile and are free to discuss sexual and public health matters however they see fit.”

Grindr’s position — however disappointing to some in the public health world — reflects a longtime balancing act attempted by the private sector which aims to square government concerns with users’ privacy interests.

Klausner pointed to a 1999 syphilis outbreak in San Francisco as one of the first times he saw how those interests could be at odds. The outbreak was traced to an AOL chatroom. Based on his research Klausner said it seemed as though people could go online and “get a sex partner faster than you can get a pizza delivered.”

But persuading New York-based Time Warner eventually AOL’s corporate parent to cooperate was time-intensive and tricky — gaining entrée into the chatroom required help from the New York attorney general’s office.

The online industry has advanced since then Klausner said. He helped one service develop a system to send digital postcards to potentially exposed people. “Congratulations you got syphilis” the postcards read. “They were edgy postcards” he said although some options were less “snarky.”

Overall however the dating app world is still “bifurcated” he said. For public health efforts apps that appeal to LGBTQ+ users are generally more helpful than those that predominantly cater to heterosexual clients.

That’s due to the community’s history with sexual health explained Jen Hecht a leader of Building Healthy Online Communities a public health group partnering with dating apps. “Folks in the queer community have — what — 30 40 years of thinking about HIV?” she said.

Even though STIs affect everyone “the norm and the expectation is not there” for straight-focused dating apps she said. Indeed neither Match Group nor Bumble — the corporations with the biggest apps focused on heterosexual dating both based in Texas — responded to multiple requests for comment from KHN.

But users at least so far seem to appreciate the app-based interventions. Harrison-Quintana said Grindr has landed on a just-the-facts approach to conveying health information. He has never received any backlash “which has been very nice.”

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts.

Some consumers aren't loving it.,"McDonald's new test restaurant near Fort Worth Texas could be the future of fast-food operators: Instead of human workers handing you a bag at the drive-thru an automatic conveyer belt brings your order to the window. Ordering is done through kiosks or an app — no humans involved there either.

In a December blog post McDonald's said the test restaurant demonstrates its commitment to ""finding new ways to serve [customers] faster and easier than ever before.""

But not all customers are loving it.

""Well there goes millions of jobs"" one commenter on a TikTok video said about the new restaurant said.

""Oh no first we have to talk with Siri and Google [and] now we have to talk to another computer"" another one opined.

""I'm not giving my money to robots"" another commenter wrote. ""Raise the minimum wage!""

In this company photo a person demonstrates picking up an order from a fully automated McDonald's near Fort Worth Texas. McDonald's

Other customers had more personal concerns expressing worries about how they could get their order fixed if it was incorrectly prepared or how to ask for extra condiments.

""And if they forget an item. Who you supposed to tell the robot? It defeats the purpose of using the drive thru if you have to go inside for it"" one consumer noted.

The test of the automated location comes as companies struggle to hire amid a shrinking labor pool that's pushing wages higher and giving workers more bargaining power. At the same time automation is gaining a foothold in more industries with experts predicting that 10 million jobs may be at risk over the next few years — low-wage positions in the fast-food and service industries most of all.

McDonald's for its part said the technology will allow its (human) kitchen staff to prepare customer orders more efficiently.

""The technology in this restaurant not only allows us to serve our customers in new innovative ways it gives our restaurant team the ability to concentrate more on order speed and accuracy which makes the experience more enjoyable for everyone"" Keith Vanecek the franchisee operating the test restaurant said in the blog post.

To be sure not everyone had negative views about the concept. Some customers expressed optimism that the automated restaurant could improve service and their experience.

And a fair number of wags pointed out that machines aren't always the answer with references to the burger chain's frequently broken McFlurry machines.

""Yeah but the ice cream machine is currently broken"" one Twitter user joked about the new automated restaurant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzkzNzAzMTMvbWNkb25hbGRzLXJvYm90cy1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtcmVzdGF1cmFudC10ZXhhcy_SAVNodHRwczovL2dsb2JhbG5ld3MuY2EvbmV3cy85MzcwMzEzL21jZG9uYWxkcy1yb2JvdHMtYXV0b21hdGVkLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtdGV4YXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burgers fries and robots: McDonald’s opens 1st mostly automated location in Texas,"Send this page to someone via email

At one McDonald’s location in Texas robots are now serving up Big Macs.

Amid a growing desire for fast food giants to automate their processes the first mostly robot-run McDonald’s restaurant is currently being tested in Fort Worth Texas.

At this location there are no human cashiers in sight. Even the restaurant itself is smaller and has no seating designed to serve the grab-and-go crowd rather than sit-down diners.

Upon entry digital tills take customer orders and robots push food through on conveyor belts in designated pick-up areas.

Customers can order through the drive-thru the company’s mobile app or the touch screen kiosks in-store.

A TikTok video showing the new automated location is already on the way to virality. As of this writing the video has been viewed 1.3 million times.

A McDonald’s spokesperson told The Guardian that though the new store is highly technical it “is not fully automated.” There are still human workers employed in the restaurant though interaction between customers and human employees is very limited.

The spokesperson claimed that “enhanced technology” is in place to allow “the restaurant team to begin preparing customers’ orders when they’re near the restaurant.” This is ideal for McDonald’s orders picked up by delivery couriers or for customers who have ordered through the mobile app.

McDonald’s said the goal of the test location is to serve customers with improved speed and accuracy.

Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email as it happens.

Despite the company’s enthusiasm for the new automated location many people are not ‘McLovin” it.

In Texas minimum wage workers — like those who are employed by McDonald’s — make US$7.25 ($9.87) an hour. The living wage in Texas is $16.41 an hour.

Many people on social media felt the automation is a way for fast food giants to avoid paying employees higher wages a request that has been made by McDonald’s workers for years now.

William Melek the director of the RoboHub at the University of Waterloo in Ontario said the food supply chain is “one of the most exciting new application areas of robots we’re seeing today.”

Melek confirmed that today’s advanced robotics have indeed risen to the point of taking over some jobs.

Robots in the food service industry have been designed to handle repetitive tasks and excel in areas where labour shortages are constraining production capacity in the supply chain Melek noted.

The funding comes from the McKesson Foundation a corporate foundation dedicated to eliminating barriers to health care in vulnerable communities.

Grantee institutions include the historically Black Hampton University; the University of Michigan (U-M); the University of Minnesota; the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill; and the University of New Mexico a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Awardee institutions will use the funding which ranges from approximately $250000 to more than $1.5 million between the universities to invest in various pathway programs curriculum changes and community outreach initiatives.

The UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy received two three-year grants totaling more than $1.5 million to fund two new programs. The first — McKesson Leading Excellence Advancing Diversity (LEAD) — will recruit students from diverse communities by establishing pathway and mentorship programs with historically Black colleges and universities in North Carolina.

“[The LEAD] program will play a vital role in removing barriers promoting equity and increasing access to a range of backgrounds experiences and perspectives for our learners and encourage them to think broadly deeply and critically to solve real-world problems.” said Carla White associate dean of organizational diversity and inclusion at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy.

The second project McKesson Caring for the Underserved: Creating Awareness and Responsiveness through Education will develop online learning modules to teach pharmacy students and professionals how to identify and address health care disparities in underrepresented communities.

The U-M College of Pharmacy also received about $1.5 million. The funds will be spent over five years to support the Pharmacy Community College Connect (PC3) and McKesson Foundation Health Equity Seminar Series initiatives. The PC3 program is designed to attract students from community and tribal colleges into the profession through a 10-week summer program that includes a stipend academic advising course preparation and exposure to pharmacy careers. The health equity series will invite leaders from Black and Latinx communities in Detroit and health practitioners in rural areas to meet with students and discuss topics centered on disparities in health care such as food insecurity racism in health and access to care.●

“We have made a commitment to being physician-led and physician-owned” Dr. Scott Herbert said President of Nexus Health. “Too much of today’s healthcare is practiced in high-cost low-efficiency settings. Our community deserves choice and it deserves better and more affordable care. We are a group of doctors who care about our patients and our community.”

Nexus Health is announcing the construction of a new $116 million building with funding provided by McKesson to construct the 90000 square foot facility on the south side of Santa Fe which will house all the specialties in one convenient location. The main campus is scheduled to open in mid 2024. While the Nexus Health network will be entirely physician-owned McKesson will provide support to maintain the facility with state-of-the-art equipment and systems.

“Our engagement with McKesson one of the top health care operations in the U.S. will mean that we will have the best facilities the best systems and the best opportunities for doctors that health care can provide today” Dr. Kathryn Chan said oncologist at Nexus Health. “McKesson is committed to our practice being physician-owned and operated and that is why we chose to work with them. Our patients will see the benefits.”

New Mexico Cancer Care Associates (NMCCA) which has operated a medical oncology practice in Santa Fe for more than thirty years will join Nexus Health at the beginning of the year.

Nexus Oncology opens Jan. 3 2023 at its new location at 2085 South Pacheco Street in Santa Fe. Current patients of NMCCA will have a seamless transition to the new network and oncology services will be uninterrupted. The oncology practice will operate at the Pacheco Street location until the new building on Santa Fe’s south side is complete.

Well-known and well-respected NMCCA providers transferring to Nexus Health include Dr. Kathryn Chan Dr. Fei Gu Dr. Scott Herbert Dr. Clifton “Kip” Layman Dr. Karen LoRusso Dr. David Snyder and nurse practitioners Sara White and Ryan Commiskey.

Nexus Health also includes highly regarded and well-established orthopedic surgeons Dr. John Garcia Dr. Luke Bulthuis Dr. Markus E. Garard and nurse practitioner Margaret Gavin. They have been practicing at the Presbyterian Santa Fe Medical Center since March 2023.

Other doctors joining Nexus Health will be announced as their specialties launch.

“As doctors we were really frustrated with the high physician turnover in the community and the lack of collaboration and team-based care” Dr. John Garcia said an orthopedic surgeon at Nexus Health. “We’ve all been living the same frustrating healthcare story for so long that we’ve simply forgotten to ask ‘Why are things this way?’ But we don’t have to accept the status quo; we can create a lasting health care model for the communities of northern New Mexico. Healthcare can be more convenient. Care can be coordinated rather than disparate and divided which can also make it more affordable.”

In addition patients of Nexus Health will be able to go to either hospital in Santa Fe as Nexus Health physicians will maintain privileges at both hospitals in Santa Fe a big advantage for patients.

Costs are another advantage for Nexus Health patients. Nexus will not be tied to any hospital system so costs will be lower which could result in lower premiums lower co-pays and lower costs overall for the patients.

“I joined Nexus Health because of their vision their dedication to patients and their dedication to the community” Dr. Kip Layman said. “I am honored to be a part of something bringing positive change to Santa Fe and I’m excited to serve northern New Mexico with Nexus Health for years to come.”

A reader asks: ""Can I use an electric blanket or heated jacket if I have a pacemaker?""

Chloe MacArthur Senior Cardiac Nurse at the BHF says:

Many people are looking for ways to stay warm in winter and with rising energy bills there has been new interest in heated blankets and clothing. If you have a pacemaker or an ICD (implanted cardioverter defibrillator) you might be wondering whether these can cause problems for you.

Many heating devices are safe to use if you have a pacemaker or an ICD. If in doubt check your manufacturer’s guidance or ask your pacing clinic. Most cardiac device manufacturers have guidance online about which items could cause a problem for your device.



For example two of the largest device manufacturers Boston Scientific and Medtronic list electric blankets and heating pads as “safe under normal use” or “no known risk”. Boston Scientific also lists heated motorcycle vests as “safe to use” (Medtronic does not include guidance about heated clothing).

If you’re thinking of using something that sits directly over your pacemaker or ICD such as a heated jacket check with your pacing clinic to make sure.

Remember that your implanted device will return to the settings that your doctor chose as soon as you step away from any electronic equipment that affects its function.

My name is Brooke Lenning. I am the Topels neighbor.

Justine Ida Dexter and Xander need our help. On December 8th Ida was admitted into the hospital. This week it was determined that she is suffering from Chronic Graft vs Host Disease.





Below is a summary from Justine





“Ida began her journey to a cure for Beta Thalassemia in February 2021. That’s when I found out she qualified for a Bone Marrow Transplant. As she is adopted it is a non-relative transplant.





There was a perfect match in the US that had agreed to donate. Unfortunately he changed his mind last minute.





Next step was to find a not perfect match. And a 27 year old female from the UK agreed to donate. We were a go for transplant! Ida was admitted to the hospital Sept 2021. She went through many surgeries including harvesting her bone marrow as an emergency back up total body irradiation and chemotherapy to prepare her body for transplant.





October 5 2021 was transplant day. Unfortunately after weeks of waiting and multiple bone marrow biopsies it was determine that transplant failed.





Ida went through total body irradiation and chemotherapy a second time. This increases her risk of being infertile or developing cancer later in life. Life changing decisions were made.





The team was able to set up a second transplant with the same donor who said yes a second time. On December 9 2021 Ida received her second bone marrow transplant. Within a week we knew it was successful and she had counts. She got to go home January 10 2022 after spending 109 days in the hospital.





She thrived at home and recovered so quickly. She remained home bound and my sister and I took care of her at home 24/7.





Unfortunately I lost my job on April 5th. The company won’t admit it but they let me go because of my needing to care for my daughter and we’re unwilling to let me work from home twice per week plus be flexible for Ida’s doctor appointments.





I’ve been unemployed since April due to needing flexibility to work from home twice a week. There is a position opening up at Medtronic on February 24th that I will apply for and hopefully get. I’ve been working with the hiring manager and I have the skill set they are looking for yay!





Ida became Jaundice in December after having no complications post transplant. On December 8th Ida was admitted to the hospital.





Ida had biopsies done of her skin liver colon and large intestine to rule out or confirm chronic Graft vs Host Disease. She also had a bronchioscope and flush of the lungs.





The results were positive for Graft vs Host disease (GVHD). This is where the donor cells reject Ida’s own cells as foreign and attack them.





As soon as it was confirmed treatments with steroids antibiotics antifungals were started. Unfortunately her breathing has continued to deteriorate.





On Thursday she had another bronchioscope procedure done and the team decided to intubate her to protect her lungs as they recover. Her team wants to rule out infection as they continue to treat her for GVHD.





Ida will have this disease for the rest of her life. However once it is well managed she will get to go home. We have a long way to go. I do not know what the future looks like with a child with GVHD but one day at a time is our motto.





Ida is 10 years old. She has two big brothers. Xander is 15. Dexter is 13. We have one bird at home Kikoa which is a Sun Conure.”





Friends family neighbors and strangers we are asking for prayers prayers above all. But if you can if you have capacity for more please consider donating.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='health.economictimes.indiatimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/pharma/pharma-industry/mercks-endometrial-cancer-therapy-fails-trial/109982496 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227841300>, 'Connection to health.economictimes.indiatimes.com timed out.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

Thomas: Yeah thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

It is the ""largest recovery ever achieved in a data privacy class action and the most Facebook has ever paid to resolve a private class action"" Keller Rohrback L.L.P the law firm representing the plaintiffs said in a court filing late Thursday announcing the settlement.

The class action lawsuit was prompted in 2018 after Facebook disclosed that the information of 87 million users was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica a consultancy firm linked to former President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.

The case was broadened to focus on Facebook's overall data-sharing practices. Plaintiffs alleged that Facebook ""granted numerous third parties access to their Facebook content and information without their consent and that Facebook failed to adequately monitor the third parties' access to and use of that information"" according to the law firm behind the lawsuit.

Judges overseeing the case in the Northern District of California will now have to approve the settlement.

Join Mashable as we look back at everything that's delighted amazed or just confused us in 2022.

Meta has had a tough 2022.

To be fair no tech company has been immune to macroeconomic struggles this year. But even when it's dealt a bad hand Meta somehow finds a way to make it worse. Sure TikTok is a serious threat to Meta's survival but there's no bigger threat to Meta than its own missteps. Whether it's doubling down on recommended content on Instagram or trying way too hard to make the metaverse happen here are six times Meta was its own worst enemy.

Losing billions of dollars overnight

In February 2022 Meta made stock market history but not in a good way. Overnight Meta lost $237 billion  making it the biggest one-day valuation drop in U.S. history . This came after Meta's disappointing Q1 earnings which were attributed to macroeconomic downturn fierce competition from TikTok and Apple iOS privacy changes which hampered Meta's targeted advertising business.

Some of this loss was outside of Meta's control. It's not Meta's fault that the global economy is in the toilet. But Meta hasn't done itself any favors either. Even after the billion dollar loss Meta continued to operate by the M.M.H. or ""make Mark happy"" philosophy . That means pouring more and more money into Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse vision.

Letting Sheryl Sandberg escape

In June 2022 Sheryl Sandberg licked her index finger held it up in the wind and declared ""it's time."" After 14 years Sandberg quietly left the company she'd help turn into what it is today.

To quote The Dark Knight “You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" Meta (formerly known as Facebook) had been in its villain era for quite some time when Sandberg made her escape. There was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 and the rampant misinformation problem and France Haugen's whistleblower revelations . In her farewell post Sandberg spoke of the challenges of the social media landscape and Meta's role: ""The products we make have a huge impact so we have the responsibility to build them in a way that protects privacy and keeps people safe.""

But Sandberg was ready to pass the responsibility baton and ""write the next chapter"" of her life which includes focusing on her foundation and philanthropy.

Sandberg had been good for Meta. As COO she was a top female executive in a male-dominated industry made Meta profitable through its advertising business and served as a voice-of-reason counterpart to Zuckerberg's tech-bro inexperience. But with Sandberg gone Zuckerberg is off-leash and free to "" lean into "" his metaverse dreams.

Doubling down on recommended content

About your complaints of Instagram being nothing but ads Meta said ""we hear you but we're gonna do that even more."" In an effort to compete with TikTok Zuckerberg announced in its Q2 earnings call that Meta would be doubling the amount of recommended content which includes Reels its TikTok imitation.

Meta's strategy is to improve engagement by whatever means necessary. Its algorithm-led content is what drives its monetization strategy. "" We are all but money piñatas in the dead eyes of Big Tech "" wrote Mashable's Amanda Yeo. In other words it doesn't really care what posts you're seeing as long as it's getting ad-revenue.

Head of Instagram Adam Mossieri seemed to think the problem isn't that we don't want all of this recommended content foisted upon us but that the algorithm isn't doing a better job of recommending content we want. But what we really want is an app that shows photos of our friends  not a TikTok carbon copy.

Introducing a racist chatbot

In August 2022 Meta unleashed ""BlenderBot 3"" its AI chatbot to the internet public with catastrophic results. The intent was for BlenderBot 3 to ""learn from a diverse wide-ranging perspective with people 'in the wild'"" per the announcement . But BlenderBot 3 ended up becoming an anti-semitic Jan. 6 ""truther"" who even managed to get in a few digs at Mark Zuckerberg.

Within a few days of its release  BlenderBot 3 shared anti-semitic conspiracy theories claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 U.S. presidential election and said Zuckerberg was ""too creepy and manipulative"" per Bloomberg . According to a conversation with Mashable's Elizabeth de Luna BlenderBot 3 thinks ""Elon Musk is amazing"" but acknowledges that ""he seems to have some personal issues though.""

Interactions ""in the wild"" didn't go as smoothly as this example. Credit: Meta

But it's not all bad. BlenderBot 3 called out Facebook (owned by Meta) for propagating fake news and as de Luna found out is a huge K-pop fan saying ""my Stray Kids bias Bang Chan because he's adorable and funny at the same time lol."" BlenderBot 3's disastrous debut is a little on us because the chatbot is merely a reflection of the internet humanity created. But Meta probably should've known better.

Just all of Horizon Worlds

Poor Mark Zuckerberg. Can't a guy just release his metaverse platform without getting completely dunked on ? Apparently not. When Meta launched Horizon Worlds in August 2022 the internet was not kind. Zuckerberg feels so strongly about the metaverse that he changed Facebook's name to Meta earlier in the year. But if this is Zuckerberg's vision it's… underwhelming.

People described Horizon Worlds as a "" The Sims but worse "" and like "" Animal Crossing but you’re being hunted by Mark Zuckerberg ."" To add insult to injury not even Keke Palmer's charm could get people using the platform. As of October Horizon Worlds reported less than 200000 users  which was far below its launch goal. Maybe adding legs to the floating torsos would make the avatars less terrifying? Just a suggestion.

Legs… psyche!

At Meta Connect Zuckerberg finally seemed to answer the plea of the dozen or so people using Horizon Worlds and gave the avatars legs. For a brief moment people kind of maybe started to get excited about Zuckerberg's metaverse.

But this turned out to be a hoax. A few days after the announcement it was revealed by UploadVR editor Ian Hamilton that the legs demonstration was achieved using motion capture technology aka CGI. For the record Meta still plans to give people legs in the metaverse but the fake demo kind of undercut the whole announcement.

To make matters worse Zuckerberg said during the announcement that the reason avatars didn't have legs yet was because the technology wasn't there yet: ""Legs are hard which is why other virtual reality systems don't have them either."" But virtual reality game VRChat has had legs and full body tracking for years .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N0ZXZlLWJhbm5vbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWJ1c2luZXNzLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtMTNkMDFlMDViNDIzOThmYjQ5YWNlZDFhMWU4ZGNjMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook parent Meta will pay $725M to settle user data case,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N0ZXZlLWJhbm5vbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWJ1c2luZXNzLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtMTNkMDFlMDViNDIzOThmYjQ5YWNlZDFhMWU4ZGNjMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225929F00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Marissa the wife of Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence celebrated Jacksonville’s 19-3 victory over the Jets at MetLife Stadium where she and her family and friends enjoyed the rainy matchup from a private suite.

“Thanks for the early Christmas Win Santa 🎅🏻” Marissa wrote in an Instagram post including a collage of photos that showed her kissing Lawrence after the win. The quarterback was pictured wearing an ugly Christmas sweater after defeating the Jets.

Marissa also shared the PDA snap to her Instagram Story writing “Couldn’t love you more if I tried.”

Marissa traveled to the game with her family and friends in a lit-up party bus after they spent the day in New York City — making stops at Central Park Times Square and Krispy Kreme. The group also enjoyed a horse and buggy ride and took in a broadway play: “The Phantom of the Opera.”

The former Clemson quarterback and the Anderson University soccer alum tied the knot at a chapel in South Carolina last April weeks before the Jaguars selected Lawrence first overall in the NFL Draft.

Thursday’s game was a lopsided matchup between last year’s first two draft picks. Lawrence didn’t have his best performance but still led the Jags to a Week 16 win amid their playoff surge.

Lawrence finished 20-of-31 for 229 yards and ran for 51 yards on seven carries for the Jags. Jacksonville has a 4-1 record since Thanksgiving.

Meanwhile Wilson the No. 2 pick in the 2021 draft couldn’t find his rhythm which led to raucous boos by the home crowd. Wilson was benched late in the third quarter replaced by practice squad QB Chris Streveler after leading the Jets to only three points and fewer than 100 net yards.

“It’s just a big win” Lawrence said after the game. “It shows this team is growing. We don’t have to have 40 points to win. We don’t have to have all these yards. Whatever it takes to win we’re able to do. To be able to adjust was really good for us.

Wilson completed just nine of 18 passes for 92 yards and an interception.

He was later benched for Chris Streveler and booed off by the crowd at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford New Jersey.

Sherman gave a strong analysis of Wilson's showing during Amazon Prime Video's halftime show.

Sherman a former Seahawks cornerback said: ""You're seeing him being off target with his passes you're seeing him not recognize the blitzes you continue to see the immaturity in his play.

""This defense is 27th overall and he's not moving the ball at all.""

Sherman was later asked if that was Wilson's last start in the NFL.

And he brutally responded: “I would hope so.”

Jets legend Darrelle Revis summed up the mood on social media with his tweet.

The ex-defensive star wrote: ""Zach Wilson has lost the trust of the Jet fanbase.

""I'm not saying it’s impossible. It will be very hard to regain their trust again.

""I witnessed these same boos when Brett Favre was under center.""

The former number two overall draft pick has struggled in New York - to say the least.

He lost his starting job to Mike White earlier this season before an injury handed him another opportunity.

Wilson spoke to the media after the demoralizing game.

He said: ""I’ve got to look myself in the mirror I’ve got to go back and watch this tape and you’ve got to be hard on yourself and just say ‘Why are we not moving the ball?’ It starts with me.

Florida-based Hard Rock International owned by the Seminole Tribe said it plans to reshape the property at the center of the glittery Las Vegas Boulevard casino corridor by replacing its volcano attraction with a huge guitar-shaped hotel tower.

Company Chairman Jim Allen said in a statement that the property's 3500 employees were absorbed Monday into Hard Rock's 45000-member workforce. The company has cafes hotels casinos and concert properties around the world.

“We are excited to create an integrated resort on the Strip that will make this legendary entertainment community proud” Allen said. The statement specified there were no immediate plans to close The Mirage or lay off employees.

Hard Rock and MGM Resorts announced plans for the operational takeover a year ago. The deal became official following Nevada Gaming Commission approval at a special meeting Friday.

“We're thrilled to welcome Hard Rock to the neighborhood and wish them all the very best” Bill Hornbuckle CEO and president of casino giant MGM Resorts International said in a statement.

The more than 3000-room hotel on 80 acres becomes the first on the Las Vegas Strip to be run by a Native American tribe.

East of the Strip the Connecticut-based Mohegan Tribe operates a casino that opened in 2021 at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas after that property – named Hard Rock Hotel & Casino – was purchased in 2018 renovated and rebranded by Virgin.

West of the Strip an affiliate of the California-based San Manuel Band of Mission Indians owns and operates The Palms.

Seminole-owned Hard Rock International had no previous involvement with the former Hard Rock Hotel & Casino that operated from 1995 to 2020. It bought licensing and naming rights in May 2020. The Mirage redevelopment plan is projected to run through 2023. Costs have not been disclosed.

Daily operations “are set to continue under The Mirage brand for the foreseeable future and all room reservations and group bookings will be honored with no action required by guests or group organizers” the company said.

“The process. ultimately will dramatically reimagine every aspect of the resort and change the Las Vegas skyline with the addition of a guitar-shaped hotel tower” the company promised.

Hard Rock International also entered into a long-term lease agreement with VICI Properties Inc. a real estate investment trust that acquired MGM Resorts properties this year in a $17.2 billion deal with MGM Growth Properties a publicly traded landowner of holdings in eight states. New York-based VICI owns properties and leases them back to hospitality and entertainment operators.

The sale marks the end of an era for a Polynesian-themed property built by former casino mogul Steve Wynn and credited with helping transform Las Vegas from a gambling hub into an ultra-luxury resort destination with broader appeal.

It opened in November 1989 with a sidewalk-side volcano spewing fire years before gondoliers began plying canals at the Venetian and fountains started dancing at the Bellagio. For years The Mirage hosted Siegfried & Roy taming white tigers. It remains home to a Cirque du Soleil show set to a Beatles soundtrack.

The change-of-hands is one of several involving well-known properties on Las Vegas Boulevard. Rhode Island-based Bally's Corp. completed its acquisition in September of the Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. Bally's Corp. does not own Bally's Las Vegas on the Strip.

Caesars Entertainment Inc. which owns Bally's Las Vegas is rebranding the 2800-room property as the Horseshoe Las Vegas.

When The Mirage changed hands this week it marked the beginning-of-the-end for its iconic volcano attraction.

The sale also shed more light on a growing lucrative real estate trend on Las Vegas Boulevard: Casino landlords are collecting hefty rents.

MGM Resorts International announced Monday that it closed its nearly $1.1 billion cash sale of The Mirage’s operations to Hard Rock International which assumed control of the property as of 6 a.m. that day.

Also Monday Vici Properties which owns The Mirage’s real estate said it entered a lease with Hard Rock that calls for initial annual rent of $90 million.

Real estate ownership along Las Vegas Boulevard has dramatically changed in the past several years as casino resorts up and down the Strip are now leased to rent-collecting landlords. Vici is now by all appearances the biggest property owner in the famed corridor boasting 660 acres as of this spring.

As casino property ownership changed hands it resulted in little if any visible effect for customers. But landlords paid billions of dollars to own the huge hotels along the Strip — and lock sellers into high-priced leases.

Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon said casino operators who sell a property get “immediate funds” they can use to invest in other properties or businesses or pay down debt.

But he noted they are also obligated to pay rental rates that are structured to climb over time.

“It’s a fixed and rising expense” Beynon said.

It’s not cheap either.

Caesars Entertainment Inc. said in a regulatory filing that it expected to shell out more than $1 billion in lease payments in 2022. MGM Resorts disclosed that it was required as of Sept. 30 to make $1.9 billion in “cash rent payments” over the next 12 months.

Don’t feel too bad though as MGM in particular has made mountains of money selling its real estate in sale-leaseback deals.

It sold the Bellagio for $4.2 billion in cash to financial giant Blackstone in 2019 and raked in $2.4 billion in cash from the 2020 sale of MGM Grand as part of a deal that also involved Mandalay Bay.

Last year MGM paid more than $2 billion for full ownership of Aria and Vdara — and then sold the towering resorts to Blackstone for nearly $3.9 billion in cash.

MGM still operates all of those properties.

Vici a Caesars spinoff vastly expanded its holdings on the Strip with the $17.2 billion buyout of MGM’s real estate spinoff. As part of the deal which closed this spring it acquired several MGM-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

Hard Rock owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida announced in December 2021 that it was buying The Mirage’s operations. It has since outlined plans to gut the resort and expand its casino floor convention space and theater.

It’s also looking to build a guitar-shaped hotel tower on the site of the outdoor volcano attraction an idea it first floated a year ago.

It could get some help with The Mirage’s overhaul from its landlord. Vici said Monday it “may fund” Hard Rock’s planned redevelopment of the property but added specific terms remain under discussion.

Posted on: December 23 2022 04:53h.

Last updated on: December 23 2022 07:10h.

Billionaire Phil Ruffin didn’t make a run at the Mirage when MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) was shopping the casino-resort. That’s because he wanted the land not just the operating rights.

The Treasure Island owner made those remarks in an interview with the Las Vegas Advisor noting he doesn’t like operating agreements.

The reason we didn’t bid on the Mirage is that you don’t get the ground and the building. All you get is the operational side” he told the Las Vegas Advisor. “When we buy something we want the ground and building and that’s been sold VICI Properties.”

VICI Properties (NYSE: VICI) acquired the property assets of the Mirage when it wrapped its purchase of MGM Growth Properties earlier this year. This week the real estate investment trust (REIT) announced a new master lease with Hard Rock International on the venue. Hard Rock is operating the Mirage and will pay VICI $90 million annually for 25 years with three 10-year tenant renewal options.

Hard Rock Paid Pretty Penny

About a year ago MGM announced the sale of Mirage’s operating to Hard Rock — the gaming arm of the Seminole Tribe — for $1.075 billion.

The value of the land the integrated resort wasn’t revealed simply because the property wasn’t for sale. But it’s likely that if the building and land were sold alongside the operating rights the transaction price would have swelled to $2 billion or beyond.

“What Hard Rock has is an operating agreement and we don’t like operating agreements. That’s why we didn’t bid. The [Seminoles] have a lot of money. They make a lot of money out of Florida so they can afford to do whatever the hell they want to do” added Ruffin in the Las Vegas Advisor interview.

While there’s something to be said for operating companies monetizing real estate assets — namely an upfront influx of capital — there are valid reasons supporting Ruffin’s way of doing things. Primarily a casino operator can eventually own the land on which its venue resides eliminating long-term obligations in the process. Conversely buying operating rights without receiving a building and land creates long-term payments to a landlord for the buyer.

Ruffin’s Other Holdings

In addition to Treasure Island Ruffin owns Circus Circus for which he paid $825 million to MGM three years ago. He owns the land of both venues. He also holds a 50% interest in the non-gaming Trump International Hotel Las Vegas.

Speaking of Ruffin’s affinity for property ownership the Circus Circus deal include a massive chunk of undeveloped Strip land. While plans for that acreage haven’t been revealed there’s chatter that the land could eventually be a site for a Major League Baseball (MLB) stadium which affords Ruffin the opportunity to draw substantial value from the parcel.

Worth an estimated $3.2 billion Ruffin also owns the New Frontier Hotel and Casino the Nassau Marriott and the Greyhound Park as well as 13 hotels among other commercial real estate holdings."

The U.S. Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen has called upon the U.S. and its allies to strengthen supply chain resilience in response to ‘unfair trade practices’ from China with a particular focus on developing stronger supply chains for key components such as semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries.

As a result of COVID-19 the geopolitical crisis in Ukraine and increased reliance on China businesses are searching for ways to stabilize the global supply chain and avoid further economic complications. The pandemic also resulted in the eye-opening realization that many countries no longer have the capacity or expertise to manufacture their own goods; making the U.S. and many other parts of the world heavily reliant on a country that promotes corrupt trade and labor practices. While globalized specialization has historically led to more stabilized supply chains and deeper production capabilities now is the time to rethink the model for the most critical products components and raw material created by nations with guiding principles that do not align with the West’s.

Supply chain redesign is critical – a sentiment which is reinforced by Yellen’s call to action. Practices such as friend-shoring (limiting supply chain networks to allies and friendly countries) can stabilize global supply chains through increased insulation from external geopolitical and economic threats.

Replacing the Dependency on China

An enormous amount of goods are manufactured in China from electronics and fast fashion to cleaning products and home appliances. In 2021 the United States imported a whopping $541.53 billion worth of goods from China making the U.S. one of China’s biggest trading partners. However the various supply issues experienced during the pandemic from toilet paper to critical technologies highlighted just how heavily the world relies on China for everyday items. With this immensely powerful global position China’s monopoly on the market is not only an issue during critical times but also informs massive areas of weakness – for both commercial business and national government security - when it comes to managing risk within our supply chain systems.

The U.S. government is increasingly prioritizing the enforcement of regulations and policies that encourage domestic investments to drive growth. On December 21 2021 President Biden passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). This regulatory act targets forced labor within the global supply chain by preventing trade between the United States and providers in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) – a region accused of criminal workplace practices such as torture forced labor and genocide.

To further decrease reliance on China countries can prioritize friend-shoring to redefine their position in the global supply chain. These alliances will allow countries that have lost their positioning in the global economy to utilize their unique offerings while also giving them a newfound competitive advantage. Additionally because the supply chain runs very deep it is difficult to monitor every aspect of the production journey. The line between cheap products and ethical consumerism is often blurred. The shift to friend-shoring will refocus the contribution of other countries into the supply chain and decrease economic risk.

Economic restructuring

The supply chain disruptions experienced in recent years have led more businesses to explore onshoring operations giving them more control over how and where their products are produced. Likewise the Biden administration recently finalized a rule that increases domestic content requirements for Federal government procurements governed by the Buy American Act (BAA). This change is intended to align Federal procurement policy with the Biden Administration's recently published strategy to improve supply chain resiliency in critical sectors such as information and communications technology (ICT) clean energy defense public health agriculture and transportation. Similarly friend-shoring offers countries the opportunity to not only re-establish their position in the global supply chain but also strengthen relationships with nations that maintain shared values.

With friend-shoring companies are encouraged to move their operations within allied territories. When businesses maintain close relationships with trade partners they can not only closely monitor operations but also help utilize offerings specific to their region. In her speech Yellen emphasized the importance of the relationship between the U.S. and South Korea-- which have long maintained a strong economic and political alliance. With a strong global reliance on exports from China such as batteries and semiconductors the U.S. and South Korea can work together to strengthen the supply chain through tactics that seek to combat economic displacements such as increased prices. By deploying friend-shoring operations countries can better regulate supply chains and monitor economic restructuring from a more friendly standpoint.

Strategic partnership with allies

Beyond strictly economic factors friend–shoring also promotes consumer relationships and deepens strategic partnerships. According to a 2021 Label Insight Food Revolution Study 94% of customers consider how transparent brands are about themselves. Transparency can be achieved through implementing allied partnerships within the supply chain that will ultimately improve customer experience.

When deploying friend-shoring operations businesses are able to closely regulate manufacturing processes and monitor production creating more security. As stricter regulations on supply chain standards are being enforced within the U.S. consumers are given a greater piece of mind when purchasing goods produced domestically. With a growing emphasis on ethics within the workplace consumers are prioritizing the purchase of goods from brands that promote an ethical environment.

Furthermore friend–shoring allows countries to grow alongside their larger counterparts and maintain more control over regional resources. Even if countries were to replicate a specific material it is likely that the costs of production would be even higher than the industry is worth. For example the United States can utilize its advancements in manufacturing technology with natural resources from allied nations to create high-demand products under more ethical conditions. It is no secret that countries that do not have access to advancing technology are likely to fall behind socially and economically. Because many smaller countries do not have the technological advances and funding required to manufacture goods friend–shoring offers the potential for these countries to work with larger countries that can capitalize off their unique offerings. This creates a two-way benefit for both under-developed countries and world leaders such as the U.S. to deepen their relationships.

Friend-shoring for a Transparent Supply Chain

Although it will be difficult to completely eradicate reliance on China friend–shoring is a strategic approach when reevaluating supply chains. As tensions continue to rise globally it is important for companies to properly evaluate and remain transparent as to where and how their products are manufactured.

Knollo operates three core services: Knollo Play a content-oriented community service; Knollo Store a commerce mall; and Knollo Square a complex offline space.

The newly released Knollo app is an integrated service that combines content-based community service Knollo Play and companion animal commerce Knollo Store and was developed to provide everything necessary for companion life in daily life.

Knollo Play provides play content developed by Seol Chae-hyun a behavioral veterinarian for deep communication with companion animals and various quizzes and video content necessary for behavioral education. The community function app can be performed multiple missions using content and sharing it with other companions.

Seol Chae-hyun a veterinarian who oversees Knollo’s customer experience said “Through lectures and broadcasts I learned that guardians love their pets very much but find it difficult because they do not know how to play with them. Knollo Play will continue to provide specific and differentiated education and play methods for these pet parents.”

Doo-yeol Choi CEO of Sparkpet said “Since the launch of Knollo Square a complex companion culture space in May of last year we have been preparing to build an integrated online and offline platform that can communicate directly with numerous customers and expand the customer experience online. The goal is to grow into the largest integrated platform in Korea for companion households by upgrading services that do not exist.”

Clare Valley winemaker Jeffrey Grosset founded Enseal to ensure consumers aren’t sold lesser quality illicit or fake wine with five South Australian wineries trialling the technology.

The technology works by passing a mobile phone over the cap where a chip inside will indicate if the bottle’s contents actually match the wine label and if it has been opened.

“This is all about enforcing the integrity of Australian wines anywhere in the world” Grosset said.

“The idea is to have immutable information like when the fruit was picked where it was made and then where the wine is now.”

People could be scammed into buying fraudulent wine when the bottle’s label had been tampered with to include misinformation about the drink’s ingredients variety or region.

Wine fraud could also involve the contents of the bottle being replaced with a cheaper product.

In 2017 Food Innovation Australia estimated food and wine fraud cost the industry almost $17 million dollars although researchers said it was difficult to obtain up-to date data because of under reporting.

Clare Valley Winemaker Jeffrey Grosset has been designing the microchip over three years. Credit: 7NEWS

The chip’s designer Andrew Rogers said it took three years to create the caps with individual serial numbers which made them “impossible” to be remade fraudulently.

“As soon as the cap’s opened the chip’s status changes” he said.

Grosset described the bottle-chip technology as a world-first adding that similar technology created previously was incapable of detecting if bottles had been opened.

He said he hoped the trial would lead to a manufacturer mass-producing the caps so they could be sold internationally.

He said the technology could also be adapted for other goods like food medicine and art.

Sales will be about US$3.8bil (RM16.8bil) in the fiscal second quarter Micron said in a statement.

That compares with analysts’ average estimate of US$3.88bil (RM17.2bil) according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The company projected a loss of about 62 US cents (RM2.75) a share excluding certain items in the period ending in February compared with a loss of 29 US cents (RM1.29) expected by analysts.

Semiconductor makers are suffering plummeting demand for their products less than a year after being unable to produce enough to meet orders.

Consumers have shelved purchases of personal computers and smartphones amid rising inflation and an uncertain economy.

Makers of those devices the main users of memory chips are now stuck with unused stockpiles of components and are slowing orders for new stock.

The industry is experiencing its worst imbalance between supply and demand in 13 years according to chief executive officer Sanjay Mehrotra.

Inventory should peak in the current period then decline the rest of the year he said.

Customers will move to more healthy inventory levels by about the middle of 2023 and the chipmaker’s revenue will improve in the second half of the year Mehrotra said on a conference call after the results were released.

Micron is cutting its budget for new plants and equipment and now expects to spend from US$7bil to US$7.5bil (RM31bil to RM33.3bil) for the fiscal year a reduction from an earlier target of as much as US$12bil (RM53.3bil).

The company is also slowing the introduction of more advanced manufacturing techniques.

Micron predicts that overall industry spending on new production will also decline.

Unlike other parts of the chip sector products from Micron are built to industry standards meaning they can be swapped out for those of its competitors.

Because memory can be traded like a commodity its makers are exposed to more pronounced price swings.

Micron’s pledge to reduce output from its factories and slow expansion projects won’t ease the glut of chips available unless rivals including Samsung Electronics Co and SK Hynix Inc follow suit.

That step can help support prices but comes with the penalty of running expensive plants at less than full capacity something that can weigh heavily on profitability.

It will be difficult to generate a profit in the memory chip industry in the coming year Mehrotra said.

In addition to its planned workforce reductions the company has suspended share repurchases is cutting executive salaries and will skip company-wide bonus payments executives said on the call.

In the three months ended Dec 1 Micron’s sales declined 47% to US$4.09bil (RM18bil). The company had a loss of four US cents (18 sen) a share excluding certain items.

That compares with an average estimate of a loss of one US cent (4.4 sen) a share on revenue of US$4.13bil (RM18.3bil).

Micron’s shares declined about 1.5% in extended trading after closing at US$51.19 (RM227.16) in New York.

The stock has dropped 45% this year a worse decline than most chip-related equities.

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is down 33% in 2022.

MANILA – Fears for global slowdown given the tightening moves of central banks resulted to the decline of the Philippines’ main equities index on Friday but the peso ended sideways against the US dollar.

The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) shed 0.55 percent or 35.91 points to 6541.03 points.

All Shares followed with a drop of 0.28 percent or 9.79 points to 3432.47 points.

Most of the sectoral indices tracked the main index namely Holding Firms 0.95 percent; Financials 0.85 percent; Property 0.78 percent; and Mining and Oil 0.38 percent.

On the other hand industrial gained by 0.42 percent and Services by 0.36 percent.

Volume reached 1.91 billion shares amounting to PHP3.14 billion.

Decliners led advancers at 94 to 72 while 46 shares were unchanged.

“Philippine shares were sold off ahead of the long weekend as investors worried that over tightening from central banks worldwide could force the economy into a downturn” Luis Limlingan Regina Capital Development Corporation (RCDC) head of sales said.

For one US Federal Reserve’s key rates have been hiked by a total of 425 basis points to between 4.25-4.5 percent since last March as monetary authorities hasten to address the four-decade high inflation rate in the world’s largest economy.

Relatively the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) key rates have been increased by a total of 350 basis points to 5.5 percent for the overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility.

Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort on the other hand said the main index registered a healthy correction due to profit-taking in line with its US counterparts.

“Market sentiment especially on tech shares was weighed by a bleak outlook from chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. (the largest US maker of memory chips) which will reduce its workforce by about 10 percent over the next year thereby indicated the slump in demand for computer components will drag on” he said.

Meanwhile the decline of the PSEi was countered by the sideways close of the local currency which finished the week at 55.15 from its 55.09 close on Thursday.

It opened the day at 55.25 weaker than its 55.045 start in the previous session.

It traded between 55.35 and 55.15 resulting to an average of 55.271.

Volume rose to USD1.02 billion from the previous day’s USD774.2 million.

Ricafort said the peso continues to get a boost from higher inflows of remittances in line with the Christmas spending and the year-end holiday expenditures.

“The peso exchange rate has been relatively insulated by the recent volatility in the local stock market largely due to the seasonal surge in OFW (Overseas Filipino Workers) remittances and conversion to peso less than a week before Christmas” he added. (PNA)"

(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Bing)

France’s privacy watchdog fined Microsoft €60 million ($64 million) for not offering clear enough instruction for users to reject cookies used for online ads as part of the move to enforce Europe’s tightening data protection law.

CNIL France’s digital privacy regulator said Thursday that it carried out several investigations on the Microsoft search engine Bing in September 2020 and May 2021 and found that the site dropped advertising cookies in users’ terminals without their explicit consent.

The website also lacked a button for users to reject cookies as simply as accepting them CNIL said where two clicks were required to refuse all cookies while only one was needed to accept them.

Cookies are small files that track and monitor the sites users have visited and are often used to help personalize online ads. According to CNIL the $64 million fine against Microsoft is justified partly because of the scope of revenue the company made from advertising indirectly generated from the data collected via cookies.

Microsoft has been ordered to solve the issue within three months by implementing a simplified cookie refusal mechanism or it could face additional fines of €60000 a day CNIL said.

A Microsoft spokesperson noted in a statement shared with SC Media that the company had already made changes to include a button for advertising cookies even before the investigation started but it remained concerned with the CNIL’s requirement to collect consent for cookies used to detect advertising fraud.

“We believe the CNIL’s position will harm French individuals and businesses by allowing fraud to spread online” the statement noted.

The Microsoft spokesperson told SC Media that the company has not yet decided whether to appeal the CNIL order on advertising fraud.

The fine is a part of broader efforts for the French regulator pushing tech giants to comply with new rules on cookies. Earlier this year CNIL fined Google €150 million and Meta €60 million over the same issue."

Steven Ferdman/Getty Images

Personalized cancer vaccines could provide a new way to fight early cancer cases.

The COVID-19 vaccine developer Moderna just announced positive results for a skin-cancer vaccine.

Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel told Insider he thinks cancer vaccines can upend cancer care.

A lack of confidence has never been an issue for Moderna and its CEO.

An unwavering belief in messenger RNA or mRNA the genetic technology at the core of its technology platform helped Moderna develop a coronavirus vaccine in record time in 2020. Now Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel is outlining another audacious goal: upending how cancer is treated including the idea of finding and treating cancer in seemingly healthy people at their annual physicals.

On Tuesday the Cambridge Massachusetts-based biotech said a midstage study in skin cancer succeeded as its vaccine reduced the likelihood that people would die from the cancer returning. The $77 billion biotech saw its stock price jump 20% Tuesday after the results were announced.

In an interview Bancel shared his vision on how these personalized cancer vaccines could transform cancer care. Similar to how Bancel talked about the need to spend billions on manufacturing capacity or how Moderna planned to price its COVID-19 vaccine in the early months of 2020 he is now talking about the future for these cancer programs well before they are commercially approved.

In addition to launching a flurry of late-stage studies for its cancer vaccine in 2023 Bancel said his team is also interested in taking advantage of the emerging field of blood-cancer tests called liquid biopsies.

Companies like Illumina's Grail Exact Sciences and Freenome are now developing these cancer-screening tests which could be a $50 billion-plus market according to analysts at the investment bank SVB Securities.

""Maybe potentially as liquid biopsy improves as a technology you could see a world maybe in a few years where you do your blood work for your physical a liquid biopsy is run on your blood it sees an early sign of cancer we make a cancer vaccine for you and you get the vaccine"" Bancel said.

The goal would be to kill cancer in its infancy before it even grows into a tumor that can be seen by typical imaging techniques like PET scans. Based off the blood work Moderna would design vaccines that target the genetic mutations in cancerous cells that stand out from healthy cells. Like the COVID-19 vaccine these shots use mRNA to get inside immune cells and instruct those cells to produce particular proteins that help fight that person's cancer.

Bancel didn't specify exactly how Moderna could work with liquid biopsies such as partnering with diagnostic companies.

Bancel says mRNA could be 'a big change in cancer care'

If this works out — a big if that will likely take years to play out — liquid biopsies and cancer vaccines could change the way cancer is detected and treated. The blood tests could find cancer before it grows too much and mRNA vaccines could squash it.

Bancel acknowledges a lot of work still has to be done to realize that vision. The blood tests still face questions about their usefulness in the real world particularly their accuracy in detecting cancer. And the skin-cancer results for Moderna's vaccine are preliminary as the data has yet to be published in a journal or presented at a medical conference. Moderna will likely have to run a larger study to confirm that result as well before seeking approval.

Still Bancel said he will invest aggressively in cancer research with Moderna's $17 billion balance sheet.

Shoppers slam 'vile' Cadbury's Milk Trays as it's pulled from shelves over taste concerns

Festive shoppers who have purchased a box of Cadbury's Milk Tray are furious after claiming the chocolates taste strange.

Certain varieties of the seasonal family favourite were quietly pulled from shelves as the festive season approached after it was flagged that the packaging was having an effect on its taste.

However there are concerns that those who already purchased the chocolates could gift a bad batch to someone during Christmas celebrations this week.

Boxes bought before November 2 are a ""food quality issue"" according to a spokesman for the world's second largest confectionery brand.

Cadbury's is owned by Mondelez and has withdrawn both 180g and 360g versions of the chocolate box recently.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.

A monopoly is defined as a market arrangement in which a single seller dominates the market and offers a unique product. In its purest form a monopoly has a 100% share of the market. Numerous industries are dominated by prominent players with significant market shares. These firms enjoy economies of scale and create barriers to entry for any new potential player to come up and break their domination. Companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have entered a sector and absorbed a sizeable amount of the market share are considered near-monopolies. These businesses frequently diversify their product lines in order to increase market share and revenue. Although the businesses allow some room for competition they yield significant market power over the industry.

Monopolies enjoy strong pricing power and famous investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett considers it a factor when he shortlists a stock for his portfolio that is followed and tracked by millions of investors globally. Back in 2011 when the Oracle of Omaha was asked to testify in front of the US Congress and provide the reason for investing in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) he highlighted that pricing power is one of the most integral criteria for evaluating a business. He added that if a business can increase prices without losing its market share to an industry peer it has a strong business model. Moody's along with two other credit rating agencies owns 95% of the credit rating market. The New York-based entity is still the eighth biggest investment in the portfolio of Omaha Nebraska-diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B) with a value of nearly $6 billion as of Q3 2022.

Interestingly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest holding in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway with a value of over $123.6 billion as of Q3 2022. The tech giant holds a monopoly or near monopoly position in numerous industries. Meanwhile American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is the fifth biggest investment in the portfolio of Warren Buffett. The New York-based company provides credit and debit cards along with Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Together these three entities hold a 99% share in the credit and debit card industry. All these monopolies or near-monopolies generate healthy profits and receive a positive response from experts. Another example is Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which occupies the fourth biggest position in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway. Together with PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) these three companies hold a market share of 57% in the soda industry.

MS,Morgan Stanley,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL21vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5LXNob3J0Y2hhbmdlZC1jbGllbnRzLTgwMGstaW4tZnVuZC1mZWUtcmViYXRlcy1maW5yYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley Shortchanged Clients $800K in Fund Fee Rebates: Finra,"Morgan Stanley has agreed to pay roughly $802000 restitution to customers holding more than 2000 accounts but avoided a fine for its “extraordinary cooperation” in an investigation by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

The wirehouse’s paybacks are based on the industry self-regulatory organization’s findings that due to prior flaws in Morgan Stanley’s supervisory systems it shortchanged some customers on mutual fund fee waivers or rebates between 2015 and 2021.

Morgan Stanley accepted Finra’s findings which cited supervisory failures without admitting or denying them according to a letter issued Thursday.

“Morgan Stanley is pleased to resolve this matter” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “The Firm has improved its systems and agreed to compensate impacted clients.”

While not imposing a fine on Morgan Stanley Finra censured the wirehouse for the supervisory failures.

Between January 2015 and December 2021 Morgan Stanley’s supervisory system “did not provide certain customers with mutual fund sales charge waivers and fee rebates to which they were entitled through rights of reinstatement offered by mutual fund

Companies” the Finra letter said. “Consequently eligible customers across more than 2000 accounts paid approximately $802000 in excess sales charges and fees during that period.”

The wirehouse violated Finra’s Rule 3110 which requires brokerage to establish and maintain supervisory systems and its catch-all Rule 2010 which requires “commercial honor” the letter said.

Finra’s 2020-scheduled examination of Morgan Stanley triggered its investigation and led to a targeted examination the letter said. The regulators found that the wirehouse’s systems were failing to honor swaths of customers’ rights to sell and purchase mutual fund shares from the same families of funds during a set time—often 30 to 120 days but sometimes two years—without incurring front-end sales charges or alternatively extended a recouping of those charges the letter said.

Morgan Stanley “failed to reasonably supervise” that all its customers’ mutual fund “reinstatement” rights were honored the letter said.

Morgan Stanley’s system’s use of sale settlement dates rather than execution dates prompted some of the shortchanging the letter said. Also coding errors “incorrectly excluded” four qualified plan account types from the fee waivers or refunds it said. Additionally an outside vendor that Morgan Stanley relied upon between 2017 and 2020 “to identify and provide” the rebates “failed” to process them the letter said.

Since January 2021 however Morgan Stanley has “enhanced its procedures” and resumed responsibility for the waivers rather than relying on the outside vendor as well as introduced “a logic change to correct the account coding” errors the Finra letter said.

In November 2021 Morgan Stanley began issuing “daily reports to help it identify transactions impacted by the settlement window limitation” as an interim measure the letter said. At the start of this year Morgan Stanley began shortening the settlement period for all domestic mutual fund transactions from two days after the trade date to one day the letter said.

As part of its “extraordinary cooperation” Morgan Stanley hired an outside consulting firm to expand that review and volunteered to extend the time period under review implemented remedial measures as the review unfolded established a plan “to efficiently identify notify and repay customers” and “provided substantial assistance” to Finra’s investigation the letter said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItZnVuZGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's who helped Elon Musk buy Twitter - The Washington Post,After slashing half the company’s 7500-member staff he’s driven away advertisers and created a bigger financial hole for the company.

It is on track with price increases to wean the ongoing cost pressures. This led to sales growth of 15.2% and 20.2% on a reported and currency-adjusted basis in third-quarter 2022.



Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gained 15.7% in the past three months outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.2%.



Let’s delve deeper

Factors Narrating MNST’s Growth Story

Monster Beverage has been witnessing continued strength in its energy drinks category for a long time. In third-quarter 2022 the Monster Energy Drinks segment's net sales advanced 13% year over year to $1.5 billion. On a currency-adjusted basis net sales for the segment rose 18%. Sales for the company's energy brands including Reign rose 2.9% in the 13-week period ended Oct 22 2022. Sales for the Monster brand improved 11.2% year over year in the quarter.

Management is optimistic about strength in the global energy drinks category. It is poised to gain from growth in the Monster Energy family of brands and strength in Strategic and Affordable energy brands.



The company remains committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. In third-quarter 2022 the company launched many products and expanded distribution in international markets. In the quarter it launched Predator in Kazakhstan Malaysia and Jordan along with the continued rollout of Predator in India.



Consequently MNST intends to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the last quarter of 2022 and the first half of 2023.



The company launched Monster Super Cola in a can in Japan in August and Monster Rehab Tea Plus Lemonade in October. In EMEA it launched Monster Assault and Monster Reserve White Pineapple in certain countries. Also MNST introduced Juiced Monarch Juiced Chaotic Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon in a few countries.



The company launched additional SKUs of Burn Predator and Rain in certain countries in the said quarter. In July it introduced its first 16-ounce 12-pack ultra-variety packs in Puerto Rico. In August the company launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and Reserve White Pineapple.



Monster Dragon Tea Lemon was launched in Honduras and El Salvador in August while the same was launched in Guatemala in September. Monster Juice Monarch was launched in August. Its juice portfolio witnessed an expansion in Mexico in August. In Australia the company expanded its Mother portfolio and launched Mother Lava Guava.



The company is on track to launch Monster Energy Zero Sugar in fourth-quarter 2022 initially in the United States. Monster Energy Zero Sugar is developed to provide a zero-sugar variant of its original Monster Energy Green flavor.



MNST revealed plans to launch pure unflavored water namely Monster Tour Water in the United States in still and sparkling variants in the first half of 2023. The company intends to launch Rainstorm in 4 flavors in the first half of 2023. Also Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar Energy Drink is likely to enter select EMEA markets in the fourth quarter of 2022 with a rollout to 20 additional markets in the first quarter of 2023.



The company remained optimistic about the launch of its first flavored malt beverage alcohol product known as ‘The Beast Unleashed.’ Gains from the CANarchy acquisition and a robust line-up of product launches for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks make it well-placed for long-term growth.



MNST has been making efforts to overcome supply-chain challenges. Some of the notable actions taken to navigate through the challenges are decreasing its reliance on imported cans. The company is purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in the United States and EMEA. MNST also rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long-distance freight to meet consumer demand. It is returning to its orbit strategy of producing closer to customers.



Meanwhile Monster Beverage is implementing pricing actions to overcome the ongoing cost pressures. In third-quarter 2022 the company was on track with the mitigation of higher production and distribution costs through pricing actions and lowered promotional expenses. It implemented price increases for its products in the United States on Sep 1 2022. It also brought effective price increases in certain international markets in the third quarter.

Headwinds to Overcome

However the company continues to grapple with inflationary operational costs for aluminum cans shipping freight and other inputs. This along with elevated ingredients and other input costs comprising secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees hurt the margins. The company’s third-quarter 2022 gross margin contracted 460 basis points (bps) to 51.3%.



Operating expenses grew 20.6% year over year to $415.8 million due to higher warehousing and other logistical expenses elevated payroll expenses increased selling and marketing expenses and increased general and administrative expenses. Also operating income of $417.9 million declined 6% year over year driven by a decrease in the gross margin as well as higher operating expenses. The operating margin contracted 580 bps to 25.7% in the reported quarter. Consequently third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of 60 cents per share declined 3.9% year over year.

Conclusion

Monster Beverages appears to be in good shape despite the industry challenges driven by the introduction of innovative products across the Monster family to suit consumers’ needs as well as strength in its energy drinks category. Topping it a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.4% raises optimism about the stock. Also the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has moved up 0.9% in the past 60 days.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.

A monopoly is defined as a market arrangement in which a single seller dominates the market and offers a unique product. In its purest form a monopoly has a 100% share of the market. Numerous industries are dominated by prominent players with significant market shares. These firms enjoy economies of scale and create barriers to entry for any new potential player to come up and break their domination. Companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have entered a sector and absorbed a sizeable amount of the market share are considered near-monopolies. These businesses frequently diversify their product lines in order to increase market share and revenue. Although the businesses allow some room for competition they yield significant market power over the industry.

Monopolies enjoy strong pricing power and famous investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett considers it a factor when he shortlists a stock for his portfolio that is followed and tracked by millions of investors globally. Back in 2011 when the Oracle of Omaha was asked to testify in front of the US Congress and provide the reason for investing in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) he highlighted that pricing power is one of the most integral criteria for evaluating a business. He added that if a business can increase prices without losing its market share to an industry peer it has a strong business model. Moody's along with two other credit rating agencies owns 95% of the credit rating market. The New York-based entity is still the eighth biggest investment in the portfolio of Omaha Nebraska-diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B) with a value of nearly $6 billion as of Q3 2022.

Interestingly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest holding in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway with a value of over $123.6 billion as of Q3 2022. The tech giant holds a monopoly or near monopoly position in numerous industries. Meanwhile American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is the fifth biggest investment in the portfolio of Warren Buffett. The New York-based company provides credit and debit cards along with Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Together these three entities hold a 99% share in the credit and debit card industry. All these monopolies or near-monopolies generate healthy profits and receive a positive response from experts. Another example is Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which occupies the fourth biggest position in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway. Together with PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) these three companies hold a market share of 57% in the soda industry.

The owner of Budweiser Bud Light Stella Artios and numerous other brands has the distinction of being the biggest brewing company in the world and has a 40% market share in the US beer industry. The company's market share is significantly higher than the other players in the industry. Jared Dinges at JPMorgan gave a double upgrade to Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) stock on November 28 from an Underweight to an Overweight rating and increased the target price from $45 to $70.

Broyhill Asset Management shared its outlook on Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Shares of ABI struggled to buck the double-digit decline in emerging market indices in the second half of the year. Consensus concerns around commodity cost headwinds certainly didn’t help matters but beyond short term margin pressures both businesses continue to grow their profits as well as their economic moats. ABI controls over a quarter of the nearly $600 billion global beer market based on Euromonitor data and remains well positioned for a rebound in post-pandemic industry sales.”

Cycles can be influenced by numerous circumstances including but not limited to the economy breakthroughs or failures asset allocation the strength and weakness of other industries and the Food and Drug Administration FDA. During periods of lower economic activity like 2022 biotech stocks may suffer as funding becomes scarcer. The economic impact becomes evident when you consult a two-year chart of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI:

XBI is lower by 45% over the past two years while the S&P 500 ETF SPY is higher by 8.3% over the same period:

One may look at the poor performance recently and conclude that investing money in the biotech space at this juncture is akin to throwing good money after bad. However if you look closely enough some subtle changes are developing in the biotech sector. Below are five reasons biotech may have a blockbuster 2023:

1. Relative Strength: Though relativity in the stock market is a powerful indicator of the future many investors overlook it. Often when one sector leads the market on the way down it tends to lead the market on the path up. XBI topped in February of 2021 while SPY topped nearly a year later in January 2022. Conversely XBI made a low in June while SPY registered its recent low in October five months later.

Time frame is another critical factor to consider when determining the near-term relative strength of an industry group. In December SPY is -4.9% the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ is -6.6% and XBI is slightly lower by 1.3%.

Not only is XBI flashing relative strength but the iShares Biotech ETF IBB is also flashing bullish price confirmation. While the Nasdaq Composite threatens to make new lows the IBB which seeks to track the Nasdaq Biotech Index retook its 50-moving average. Furthermore the 50-day moving average crossed over the 200-day moving average to form a bullish “golden cross”. As of Thursday the ETF was green on the week bucking the overall market weakness in a big way.

2. FDA Approvals are on the Rise: Generally speaking basic logic tells us that the more drugs approved by the FDA the more money the biotech industry will rake in. For whatever reason in recent years the number of drugs approved by the FDA has been on the rise according to data from Statista. For example from 2017 to 2021 the lowest number of drugs approved was 46 and the most was 59. On the contrary from 2012 to 2017 the lowest number of drugs approved in a year was just 22 while the highest was 45. If the trend continues it will be a bullish development for the biotech sector.

3. Large-Cap Leadership:Over the past few months large capitalization biotech stocks have done a complete 180. Gilead Sciences GILD was stuck in a frustrating range for years but is now up nearly 40% over the past six months. Meanwhile mega-cap group peer Merck & Co MRK has gained an impressive 22.5% over the same period.

Pictured: Large cap biotech favorites like GILD (green) and MRK (red) have outperformed the S&P 500 Index handily.

Meanwhile Moderna Inc MRNA a beneficiary of the Covid-19 pandemic is regaining momentum. The stock is up over 50% in just six months and has a catalyst in the form of a potential FDA drug approval set for early 2023.

4. Valuations are more Attractive: Though biotech stocks have marched higher over the past few months the steep decline over the past few years and the subsequent rebound in earnings has made the industry-wide valuations much more attractive. Gilead has a P/E of 12.57 for the forward twelve months undercutting the 17.28 of the S&P 500 Index.

5. EPS Estimates: The Zack’s Medical - Biomedical and Genetics is a top 25% group based on consensus estimates provided by Zacks. Zack’s studies show that top-ranked industry groups tend to outperform the overall market drastically.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand soaring 2022 earnings estimates and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares retail investors could jump in at any time.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Put simply there is a lot to watch on Netflix to the point that even seemingly big-name series and films can get buried by the algorithm that’s trying to show you the latest in reality TV. So to help you out we’ve curated 10 excellent new titles that run the gamut from zombie thrillers to stop-motion family movies to an incredible whodunit.

With Cabinet of Curiosities Guillermo del Toro (The Shape of Water Pan’s Labyrinth) has curated a terrifying anthology of hour-long episodes from some of the most exciting folks working in horror. There’s a fun romp about killer rats from Cube director Vincenzo Natali a very trippy sci-fi story from Mandy director Panos Cosmatos and even a short about the horrors of beauty products directed by Ana Lily Amirpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night). This being a del Toro-helmed collection there are of course also a few Lovecraft adaptations. What’s most impressive about the anthology though is how it’s both incredibly consistent (there isn’t a miss amongst the eight episodes) and extremely varied showing just how many different ways there are to approach a scary story.

Love Death & Robots is a collection of animated science fiction shorts that can get both pretty weird and pretty gruesome and the third season from this year is arguably the best yet. It includes a terrifying story about sailing alien seas from David Fincher an unsettling piece about a siren tracking a deaf soldier from Alberto Mielgo and my favorite a Moebius-inspired fever dream called “The Very Pulse of the Machine” from director Emily Dean. And in an age of hour-long prestige dramas it’s refreshing to binge a series where everything is less than 20 minutes long — and manages to pack a lot into those short runtimes.

The charming first season of Russian Doll is a tough act to follow. It put a new spin on the Groundhog Day formula in which Nadia (Natasha Lyonne) died on her 40th birthday repeatedly until she teamed up with another looper named Alan (Charlie Barnett) to figure things out. Season 2 picks up a few years later and ditches the loop for a time travel story where riding the MTA can literally take you back in time. It takes a little longer to get going but once things click the second season is every bit as compelling as the first without forcing you to hear “sweet birthday baby” every 15 minutes.

I thought I was sick of zombie shows until I watched All of Us Are Dead. The Korean series breathes some new life into the genre by mixing undead horror with classic high school drama. The show follows a group of students trying to survive an outbreak while trapped in their school amidst their flesh-eating peers. This means that in the middle of all the heart-pounding escapes and tragic deaths there’s still blossoming teenage romance discord among the jocks and nerds and even some humor to cut the tension. It’s a combo that works really well and turns All of Us Are Dead into the kind of show that’s hard not to binge — you just have to see what happens next.

Netflix made a big bet when it scooped up the sequels to Knives Out and at least initially it seems to have paid off. Glass Onion is the kind of sequel that just makes everything bigger from the ensemble cast to the mystery itself. It once again sees Daniel Craig pick up his questionable Southern accent as the detective Benoit Blanc and this time he’s invited to a murder mystery party hosted by a tech billionaire played by Edward Norton. Of course the fake murder party eventually turns deadly and watching the pieces fall into place as Blanc solves the mystery is very satisfying. Just as importantly it’s a lot of fun with some hilarious writing and ongoing jokes that really pay off by the end.

The House might look like a cute and fuzzy stop-motion movie but it’s something much darker. The film is split into three stories each of which tells a different tale about a specific house and the people (and animals) who lived in it over the years. You start out with its creation before settling into a renovation decades later and eventually shifting into a future apparently decimated by climate change. It’s not exactly horror — don’t expect any spooky monsters or jump scares — but there’s an unsettling tone lurking beneath the surface of The House which makes its cuddly aesthetic all the more disarming.

It’s a good year for del Toro on Netflix. In addition to his horror anthology he also helmed a stop-motion musical adaptation of Pinocchio. It is as you’d expect nothing like the Disney classic. Instead this version of Pinocchio is kind of like a family-friendly version of Pan’s Labyrinth a combination of childlike wonder heartbreaking drama and the sinister backdrop of rising fascism. (It’s not subtle — Mussolini even makes an appearance.) It also just looks incredible with a world that looks like it was carved from wood by a master craftsman including a completely unique take on the titular character.

It’s not very often that director Henry Selick releases a new movie — the last was Coraline in 2009 — and his latest already feels like an instant classic. For Wendell & Wild he teamed up with Jordan Peele (Nope) for another dark stop-motion tale this time about a young girl with special powers who makes a deal with a pair of demon brothers. It’s a story about trauma and loss (familiar subject matter for Selick) that also takes a stab at the prison industrial complex. So there’s something for everyone.

Netflix had a surprisingly good year for original anime releases and the most memorable might be Thermae Romae Novae a goofy time-travel story about an ancient Roman architect who is obsessed with bathing. In each episode the architect Lucius finds himself stumped by a design problem but then is mysteriously transported to modern-day Japan where he’s inspired by our futuristic bathing technology and uses it to create something new in the past. It’s both extremely silly and heartwarming and there’s even an educational aspect: each episode ends with author Mari Yamazaki who wrote the original comic the show is based on visiting a Japanese hot spring or public bath to learn more about the history and culture of bathing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3RyYXZpc2JlYW4vMjAyMi8xMi8yMy90aGUtYmVzdC1uZXctbW92aWVzLWFuZC1zaG93cy10by1zdHJlYW0tb24tbmV0ZmxpeC1odWx1LWRpc25leS1wZWFjb2NrLWhiby1wYXJhbW91bnQtYW5kLW11YmktdGhpcy13ZWVrZW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best New Movies And Shows To Stream On Netflix Hulu Disney+ Peacock HBO Paramount+ And Mubi This ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3RyYXZpc2JlYW4vMjAyMi8xMi8yMy90aGUtYmVzdC1uZXctbW92aWVzLWFuZC1zaG93cy10by1zdHJlYW0tb24tbmV0ZmxpeC1odWx1LWRpc25leS1wZWFjb2NrLWhiby1wYXJhbW91bnQtYW5kLW11YmktdGhpcy13ZWVrZW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212273DE8C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But now that Netflix with ads is here it seems like the company is pushing it quite hard to the point where it appears to be hiding the equivalent ad-free tier.

If you go through Netflix’s sign-up process you’ll find that you’re given three subscription options by default: Premium Standard and Basic with Ads. The ad-free Basic option is missing and only visible when you click the tiny “See all plans” option towards the bottom of the screen.

(Image credit: Netflix)

Above is the default screen everyone will see. Below is the option if you saw and clicked the See all plans option. The standout observation is that Netflix shows all four plans here instead of three.

(Image credit: Netflix)

The major difference of course is that the Basic tier is totally ad-free and has the option to download content for offline viewing. However both are limited to 720p resolution and content can only be watched on a single device at any given time. The question is why would Netflix hide one of its tiers like this?

The question is why would Netflix hide one of its tiers like this?

If I were to guess it would be that Netflix is really pushing to promote its ad-supported tier — especially after reports that it only achieved 80% of its viewing targets. By pushing Basic with Ads over the ad-free Basic tier it could help inform potential subscribers that they can get a cheaper subscription if they’re willing to accept commercials as part of the deal.

If anyone is not OK with advertising then hiding the $10 Basic tier might just push them to the more expensive Standard tier — which costs $15.49 a month. Standard also has the added bonus of offering content in 1080p on up to two devices simultaneously.

That's a win for Netflix but a loss for anyone that would have otherwise picked the $10 option.

Interestingly this isn’t the first time this sort of thing has happened. Earlier this month Reddit users spotted that Netflix had hidden the Standard subscription tier by default. Obviously that has since changed but the reasons why are similarly unclear. In fact hiding the Standard plan in favor of the ad-free Basic tier is a really bizarre move.

(Image credit: u/dendofyy/Reddit)

While it could be a mistake this sort of practice does feel incredibly misleading — regardless of which tier has been hidden from sight. And if Netflix wants to keep three tiers on show for whatever aesthetic reason I feet it needs to make the “See all plans” option a lot more obvious.

I’ve emailed Netflix to enquire about this change and will update this story when I hear back. In the meantime anyone hoping to sign up for Netflix needs to be aware that there are four subscriptions to choose from. No matter how well hidden one of them might be."

The Non -Governmental Organisations which includes Charities Co-operatives and all other Community Based or so called Non Profit Organisations (NPO)  like all other businesses are under great threat of survival.

In Apartheid South Africa NGO’s delivered services to communities that the government didn’t care about. These communities were in disadvantaged settlements meaning mostly black townships.

Come the advent of democracy it was hoped that the NGO’s would be assimilated into government structures and continued their work of serving their once neglected communities. Yes NGOs are still in the mix in the democracy but are not even though there is a remarkable collaboration not part of government official structures.

The advent of democracy left the NGOs in a lurch as they continued outside government structures. The work that these NGOs is doing is still needed in those communities and the challenges are getting bigger.

Where do we go as NGOs from now. That’s the challenge.

THREE Cape Town based Development Agencies are embarking on refining the model of funding the NGO sector globally.

Phandulwazi Educational & Development Center; Space Academy and Business Exploration Company (PTY) Ltd and Think Twice organisation are calling on society to join them on a new venture and journey for the NGO sector.

The move comes after the groups’ experiences during the Covid-19 global pandemic when the NGO sector was found wanting when those in need the most could barely access assistance from many NGOs locally and abroad.

Of course the funding problem has been around for some decades now and seems to be a problem going into the future unless drastic changes are made. Hence the three groups’ commitment to finding alternatives comes to being.

The three groups believe that the sharing of information resources and ideas greatly influences the Collaborative Learning & Development model. And if the NGO sector was to adopt such measures a lot of empowerment would come to life as a result.

There is a need to bring new idea strategies and systems into the table of how poverty and inequality can be eradicated.

But of the challenge is to get NGOs to work together in their communities and elsewhere to address the social ills affecting their communities. The current NGO funding model and system is broken and unsustainable.

Bringing people industries sectors organizations institutions etc in all communities to bounce idea off each other and plan for implementing projects and programmes to develop everybody in our communities is long over due.

At the moment the NGO sector in various communities around the world lacks a comprehensive plan that all communities should aspired to achieve. Structures like Community Development Forum are mired in political squabbles rather funding solutions to the problems facing their communities.

These forums where they exist done seek to unite mobilize organize everyone in the community to participate and be involved in matter affecting the community.

Exclusion rather inclusiveness characterizes the state of affairs in many communities in Africa and the world. To the detriment of our communities.

The few run the show while the majority are not even invited.

And that is why we are looking at a number of projects programmes and campaigns in addressing the challenges we face in our country; and especially Cape Town with the special focus being on the under-served communities these are clearly areas that suffer the most from everyday hardships of urban & rural lifestyle due to historical and current imbalances.

We are investing big on enterprise and skills development and the transfer of skills information knowledge and resources promoting networking participation & involvement and the boosting of capacity building for the business and the private sector broadly.

Research shows that countries like Germany and the Netherlands retired people don’t just sit home and do nothing after they retire. They join Co-Operatives in their communities. That means all the skills knowledge and experience will not be lost as they reinvest it back to their communities.

Imagine this happening in South Africa and the rest of the continent for that matter.

In Africa and elsewhere in the world the so-called ‘underdogs’ perform miracles daily be it in business innovation or the creative sector.

Most commercial media in Africa is filled with these moving stories of people who come from humble beginnings and have gone on to beat the odds in building empires that are impacting millions of people positively.

At least 400 businesses in Africa make a $1Billion or more in our great continent.

That should inspire the rest of us to dig deep some more. We can start small by creating businesses that can uplift society through Co-operatives in cleaning or providing security services.

A new business model where businesses can pay you for bringing more customers to them.

As society we must constantly strive to build our communities everyday working hand in hand an seeking to support each from all sectors of our society.

Phandulwazi is one of the early enterprises in South Africa to be formed on the basis of the Black economic empowerment (BEE) programme.

On this front we call on investors businesses industries to partner with groups like Phandulwazi for mutual benefit and to create jobs for locals while these enterprises stand to thrive an example here are retail giants Boxer Shoprite among others.

And community ownership should be around 49 – 51% agreement subject to negotiations.

We strongly believe that every human being matters everybody has a story to tell and everybody must be supported to fulfill their God given purposes.

That is why we encourage people organisations institutions industries sectors to engage and interact with us through advice suggestions partnerships donations proposals business plans etc on how to rebuild our society for the benefit of everybody.

Speaking at the commissioning Mr Adama Issah Union President of the Bia West Mondelez International Cocoa Life Corporative stated that production at the factory would be done in phases with the first phase aimed at the production of liquid and solid natural soaps.

According to him the second phase would focus on the production of organic potassium carbonate while the final phase would be looking at toothpaste and organic fertilizer production.

He explained that the organisation had the objective of mobilizing farmers within the district to work together towards achieving a common interest that to improve upon yields ensure community development environmental sustainability youth engagements women employment and financial empowerment.

He said the cooperative which was made up of cocoa farmers and marketing union limited was established in 2015 with less than 1000 members but could now boast of more than 9909 members.

According to him premiums received from MONDELEZ International were strictly adhered to development plans agreed by the general assembly to ensure that their outlined objectives were achieved.

Mr Issah mentioned a few school projects undertaken at Tepakrom New Nsuatre Otengkrom Dansokrom and teachers Bungalow at Kwasi NkrumahBianoand New Nsuatre as some of their achievements in the educational sector.

On health and sanitation he mentioned the construction of a clinic at Papaase CHIPS Compound at Amoakrom New Wenchi and Kroboman among others.

He emphasized that MONDELEZ international through the premium and other incomes from traditional livelihoods has been their source of fund for making this a reality.

For her part Nana Yaa Appiah Amekudze Country Lead Cocoa Life International asked farmers especially cocoa farmers to invest in their various communities since without the community there would be no farmers.

She also asked other corporative groups to emulate what MONDELEZ had done in the Bia district and promised that her outfit would continue to support any group that reached out to them for support.

Mr Matthew Annor Bia West Organizer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in a message read on behalf of the Bia West Member of Parliament (MP) Mr Augustine Tawiah commended the NGO for setting up the factory in the area stressing that it would help reduce unemployment in the area.

He also pledged a GHS10000 to support their operations.

Mr Benard Gyebi Blay Bia West DCE on behalf of the District Assembly also expressed joy about the initiative and commended the organization for their continuous support to the assembly.

He further asked them to maintain the edifice for future use.

Nana Ofori Ahenkan II Chief of Sefwi Bonzian also commended the organization for the initiative and asked them to venture into other areas as the traditional council was poised in supporting them.

He appealed to the youth who would be employed to take the factory as their personal property and work hard to sustain its operations.",,,,,,

While his father Rupert Murdoch the billionaire co-chairman of both businesses preferred to let his executives compete against each other his eldest son had a different plan. The companies needed an empire-wide initiative to tackle Web 3.0 a more decentralized internet that could have a big impact on Murdoch outlets like Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.

But the biggest takeaway for those attending the meeting wasn’t the future of media according to Australian journalist Paddy Manning. It was more simple: “Lachlan’s in charge.”

The anecdote is the last chapter in Manning’s new book The Successor an unauthorized biography of Lachlan Murdoch published Tuesday by Canada’s Sutherland House Books.

Manning’s timing couldn’t have been better. Last month the Murdochs said that the boards of Fox and News Corp. had formed special committees to examine putting the two businesses together again after almost a decade as separate companies. Many Murdoch observers see the move as an effort by Lachlan who serves as executive chair and chief executive officer at Fox and co-chair at News Corp. to further consolidate his power.

What that means for the conservative media empire that Rupert Murdoch built over seven decades is what Manning tries to answer. The answer is as elusive as its subject.

Family Business

Lachlan Murdoch 51 was born in London but raised in New York along with his younger brother James 49 and sister Elisabeth 54. He attended prep schools and studied philosophy at Princeton University and enjoyed rock climbing before giving up the sport. After graduation he worked for the family newspapers in the UK and Australia while Elisabeth and James focused on TV.

Disagreements with Dad prompted Lachlan to leave News Corp. in 2005 and start his own investment firm in Australia. A series of deals followed some successful like Nova Entertainment a radio station group he still owns. Others were not most notably Australia’s Network 10 a TV station which Murdoch tried to turn around but failed.

Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 after a nearly decade-long absence and has been the heir apparent since his brother James left with the sale of most of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney Co. in 2019. The following year James quit the News Corp. board as well saying he disagreed with the editorial direction and strategy. The real-life drama within the Murdoch family was beginning to look even more like Succession the HBO show it inspired.

Luxurious Lifestyle

Much like the characters in the series Lachlan leads a luxurious life with multiple estates custom-built Porsches and a $30 million yacht he acquired this year. Another $175 million ship is on the way. Like his father he hobnobs with prime ministers and fellow titans of industry but doesn’t love the limelight. He’s sued Australian media multiple times over their articles about him something his father has never done according to Manning.

Murdoch doesn’t weigh in on editorial decisions the way his father historically has. But his overall political leanings are conservative and he’s been there to defend Fox News hosts like Tucker Carlson even over their most controversial statements. An avid outdoorsman he identifies with the rugged individualism most associated with America’s red states even though he relocated his family to Australia during the pandemic.

Just as he runs his private investment firm Lachlan makes smaller bets at Fox than his father. In the past few years the company has acquired businesses as disparate as Tubi an ad-supported streaming service and Credible Labs Inc. an online loan broker. Fox is still heavily dependent on broadcast and cable TV two businesses losing viewers to online options.

The largest shareholder of both companies is a family trust over which Rupert 91 has the most say. On his death his votes will pass to his four oldest children including Prudence from his first marriage. Two younger children are beneficiaries but don’t have a vote. Whether Lachlan has the support of the three elder siblings to stay on as CEO remains to be seen. It’s just the kind of drama to keep people tuning in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9tZWRpYS10ZWxlY29tL21lZGlhLW1vZ3VsLWJsb29tYmVyZy1leWVzLWRvdy1qb25lcy1vci13YXNoaW5ndG9uLXBvc3QtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tbm8tdGFsa3MteWV0LTIwMjItMTItMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bloomberg owner eyes Wall Street Journal or Washington Post acquisition Axios reports,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/media-mogul-bloomberg-eyes-dow-jones-or-washington-post-acquisition-no-talks-yet-2022-12-23/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9tZWRpYS10ZWxlY29tL21lZGlhLW1vZ3VsLWJsb29tYmVyZy1leWVzLWRvdy1qb25lcy1vci13YXNoaW5ndG9uLXBvc3QtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tbm8tdGFsa3MteWV0LTIwMjItMTItMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL2RlYy8yMy9tZWRpYS1tb2d1bC1taWNoYWVsLWJsb29tYmVyZy1sb29rcy10by1idXktZG93LWpvbmVzLW9yLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tcG9zdNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL2RlYy8yMy9tZWRpYS1tb2d1bC1taWNoYWVsLWJsb29tYmVyZy1sb29rcy10by1idXktZG93LWpvbmVzLW9yLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tcG9zdA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Media mogul Michael Bloomberg looks to buy Dow Jones or Washington Post,"Billionaire Michael Bloomberg the owner of Bloomberg LP is interested in acquiring either the Wall Street Journal parent company Dow Jones or the Washington Post Axios reported on Friday citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter.

Shares of News Corp were up 3% in a broadly weaker market.

In October Rupert Murdoch started a process that could reunite his media empire News Corp and Fox Corp (FOXA.O) nearly a decade after the companies split.

The proposal has however met with stern opposition from several shareholders who say a combination on its own would fail to realise the full value of News Corp and have instead suggested a spin-off of the media company’s digital real estate business or Dow Jones as an alternative to the merger.

Craig Huber a media analyst at Huber Research Partners said he would be “shocked” if Murdoch sold the Wall Street Journal and has probably told his family not to sell it either.

“The WSJ is a trophy property to the Murdoch family” he said adding that the speculation is possibly a result of his plan to reunite his media empire.

Citing sources “familiar with Bloomberg’s thinking” Axios reported Friday that Bloomberg wants to expand his namesake media empire and sees Rupert Murdoch’s Dow Jones as a perfect fit.

While the former mayor of New York sees a Dow Jones acquisition as “ideal” he also would be interested in acquiring the Washington Post if owner Jeff Bezos is interested in selling believing the combination would create “a formidable potential competitor to the New York Times” according to the report.

The combination of Dow Jones and Bloomberg Media would create a business news juggernaut bringing together Bloomberg News and its lucrative terminal business with Dow Jones the publisher of financial titles such as the Wall Street Journal Barron’s and MarketWatch.

Dow Jones is owned by News Corp. which also owns the New York Post. Axios said Bloomberg has yet to approach Murdoch about his interest and has not engaged any third parties such as bankers to evaluate the opportunity.

A rep for Bloomberg dismissed the speculation and said: “There’s nothing to comment on.”

“The Washington Post is not for sale” a company spokesperson said.

News Corp declined to comment.

As for Bezos Bloomberg is friendly with the Amazon founder but “not close” a source said.

The Washington Post is expected to lose money this year after losing web subscribers following a Trump-era subscription surge. Last week the company said it expects to impose layoffs in the first quarter of 2023.

Two big software initiatives under Bezos — who bought the paper in 2013 for $250 million — have been sidelined and could be sold which has led some to “wonder how invested Bezos continues to be in the property” Axios reported.

According to Axios Bloomberg who is close to Murdoch believes efforts to merge News Corp. and its sister company Fox Corp. “will fail creating a possible opening.”

Activist investor Irenic Capital Management which holds 2% of News Corp.’s Class B shares said last month that it would rather News Corp. spin off parts of its business such as its real estate platform or Dow Jones to unlock value for investors."

On the surface it would seem like NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) and The Southern Company (SO -0.14%) are very similar since they are both large U.S. utilities. Once you get past that top level however there are a lot of important differences. Is one better than the other or are they just meant for different types of investors? Here's a quick comparison.

1. Dividends

When investors look at the utility sector often the goal is to find a reliable dividend stock. Both NextEra and Southern would fall into that category. However they reside in different camps. The average utility using the Vanguard Utility Index ETF (VPU -0.19%) as a proxy has a 2.8% dividend yield. Southern's yield is 3.9% and NextEra's yield is 2%. If your goal is maximizing your income stream right now Southern wins hands down.

That said Southern has increased its dividend annually for 21 consecutive years with an annualized rate of 3% over the past decade. It gets kudos for the streak's length but dividend growth is pretty modest. NextEra has increased its dividend annually for 28 years and the annualized pace of increase over the past 10 years was an enticing 10% or so. So if you are a dividend growth investor NextEra will likely be your choice.

2. Valuation

NextEra's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently sits at around 43 times. That's rather lofty for a utility even one that provided material dividend growth over time. Southern's P/E ratio is around 22 times which isn't exactly low either but it's far more attractive than 43 if you have any kind of value bias at all. That said the average utility's P/E is around 21.5 times so Southern's ratio isn't out of line with the peer group.

For investors seeking a reasonably priced dividend-paying utility Southern gets the nod here. NextEra is most appropriate for dividend growth investors willing to pay full price or maybe more for large annual dividend hikes.

3. The future of things

Electricity generation is changing with a huge push away from dirty fuels toward cleaner and renewable options. Both NextEra and Southern are well aware of this. But they aren't taking advantage of the shift in the same way.

Southern so far has been happy to be a regulated utility that produces power and sells it to customers. Its big effort right now is to complete a pair of nuclear power plants that have been long delayed and over budget. The goal is to have them both up and running by the end of 2023. Given the history of their construction though it wouldn't be a shock if the completion date were moved into 2024. This will provide the company with years of baseload clean energy.

NextEra is really two businesses in one. It owns Florida Power & Light the largest utility in Florida a pretty simple regulated utility operation. However it is also one of the largest wind and solar power producers on Earth. It is essentially using its regulated arm to help support the growth of its renewable power business. This is largely why NextEra has managed to grow its dividend at such a rapid clip.

It wouldn't be fair to suggest that Southern is falling behind the industry as the world shifts toward clean energy but it certainly isn't trying to be a leader. NextEra is a leader. If that type of ESG positioning matters to you then NextEra is the name to pick. If you prefer a company that just plays it safe then Southern will probably be your favorite here.

Dividend growth vs. maximizing income

When you look into these two utility stocks it is very clear that Southern is a stodgy old income stock and NextEra is an exciting income growth stock. Both are fairly well-run companies at least when you look past Southern's costly and delayed nuclear power project (nuclear power plants are notoriously difficult to build).

NKE,Nike,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL25pa2UtaXMtZG93bi0zNC1mcm9tLWl0cy1oaWdoLXRpbWUtdG8tYnV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Is Down 34% From Its High. Time to Buy?,"The athletic footwear and apparel giant still faces near-term headwinds.

Nike's (NKE -2.62%) stock surged 12% in late December in response to its latest earnings report. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023 which ended on Nov. 30 the athletic footwear and apparel maker's revenue rose 17% year over year (27% in constant currency terms) to $13.3 billion and exceeded analysts' expectations by $740 million. Its net income stayed nearly flat at $1.3 billion but big buybacks boosted its diluted earnings by 2% to $0.85 per share -- which also cleared the consensus forecast by $0.21.

Nike's earnings beat allayed some inflation-related fears but this blue-chip stock remains 34% below its all-time high of $175.30 from last November. Is it finally time to hop aboard the bullish bandwagon again?

Why did the bulls rush back to Nike?

To understand why Nike's stock soared we should look back at its recent history. Nike's revenue declined 2% in fiscal 2020 (which ended in May of the calendar year) on a constant currency basis as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted its brick-and-mortar sales. However its revenue rose 17% in constant currency terms in fiscal 2021 as those headwinds dissipated.

That acceleration convinced many investors that Nike was poised for big post-pandemic gains so its stock surged to a record high during the broader market rally throughout 2021. Unfortunately that enthusiasm waned over the following year as China implemented rigid COVID lockdowns and inflationary headwinds curbed consumer spending across the world. As a result Nike's revenue only rose 6% in constant currency terms in fiscal 2022.

But in the first half of fiscal 2023 Nike's prospects brightened. The growth of its Nike Direct (online and brick-and-mortar) business which brought in over 40% of its revenue accelerated again. Its strong sales in North America Europe and other markets also offset its declines in China.

Period FY 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Nike Direct Revenue Growth (YOY) 15% 14% 25% Nike Total Revenue Growth (YOY) 6% 10% 27%

For the full year Nike expects its revenue to rise by the ""low teens"" on a constant currency basis which represents a slight improvement from its prior guidance for ""low double-digit"" growth.

During the conference call Nike CFO Matt Friend attributed its accelerating growth and rosier outlook to its market share gains across the wholesale market ""record highs for demand and traffic"" during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in North America ""strategic pricing increases"" across its higher-end products and the stabilization of the Chinese market as it gradually ends its draconian zero-COVID policies.

But mind the inventories and margins

Nike's sales are stabilizing but its inventories rose 44% year over year in the first quarter and 43% in the second quarter. The company attributed that increase to volatile transit times in North America tough comparisons to its factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia last year (which had lowered its inventories) and a decision to stock up on future products ahead of schedule.

However Nike also admitted that it was aggressively clearing out its excess inventories with markdowns. That pressure along with higher production costs and logistics expenses caused its gross margin to decline 260 basis points year over year to 43.6% in the first half of fiscal 2023. Friend expects Nike's gross margin to contract 200-250 basis points to 43.5%-44% for the full year as it executes ""ongoing liquidation actions in the second half"" of the year.

Therefore some of Nike's accelerating sales growth this year was clearly driven by those markdowns. To offset that pressure Nike has been reining in its sales and marketing expenses which only rose 10% year over year in the first six months of fiscal 2023 and consumed 30.9% of its revenue -- compared to 31.1% of its revenues in the first half of fiscal 2022. It also repurchased $2.6 billion in shares in the first half of the year to boost its EPS even as its net income growth stalled out.

The company didn't provide any exact earnings guidance for the full year but analysts expect its EPS to decline 20% this year before rising 26% in fiscal 2024.

Is it the right time to buy Nike's stock?

Nike's stock got a bit overheated last year but it still doesn't seem particularly cheap at 34 times forward earnings. Adidas and Under Armour -- which face many of the same challenges -- trade at 26 and 23 times forward earnings respectively as of this writing. Nike's paltry forward dividend yield of 1.3% also won't attract any serious income investors when the 10-year Treasury pays a safer and meatier yield of 3.7%.

In addition even though Nike's stock has declined more than 30% from its all-time high it remains up more than 60% over the past five years. Adidas and Under Armour both declined nearly 40% during the same period.

It's encouraging to see Nike stabilize its top-line growth but it isn't out of the woods and its stock isn't a screaming bargain yet. So for now investors should stick with more recession-resistant plays until Nike's gross margins improve its inventories stabilize and its valuations align with its near-term expectations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9mYW5uYXRpb24vc25lYWtlcnMvbmV3cy9uaWtlLWtvYmUtOC1wcm90cm8tcmVsZWFzaW5nLWluLWZhbGwtMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Kobe 8 Protro Scheduled to Release in Fall 2023,"Thanks to a slew of new and retro releases it has been a banner year for basketball shoes.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Newly unsealed surveys paint a bleak picture of the toxic culture for women inside the Portland-based sportswear giant Nike.

The surveys known as the Starfish Surveys are an explosive part of 5000 pages of unsealed legal documents about an ongoing lawsuit against Nike for gender-based discrimination. Although employees took the surveys in 2018 the contents were only revealed to the public last month after a legal challenge from Insider The Oregonian and the Portland Business Journal.

Nike employees filled out the surveys after being fed up with the company culture. According to the New York Times the surveys were then delivered in a packet to the CEO Mark Parker.

The surveys expose sexual intimidation bullying and other toxic behavior in the Nike workplace.

""Maybe if you dressed nicer I would be on time"" a man at the company reportedly told a Nike female employee. ""Take that baggy jacket off and show some skin.""

A bad look for Nike

Nike is among the most successful athletic apparel companies in the world. The company reported quarterly earnings this week that surpassed investors' expectations and boosted their stock some 10% on the news per CNBC.

But the company's reputation was upended in 2018 in the wake of the #MeToo movement when women employees began speaking out internally and externally about a culture that was often belittling and demanding to them per NYT reporting at the time.

Ten Starfish Surveys are now publicly available but employees say some 100 were collected per Insider.

The surveys provide information about what employees experienced at the company. Per Insider many women said that HR was a ""joke"" and that women had no power to affect change society at the company ""that has been and continues to be disrespectful to women"" and that it is a ""boy's club.""

Another woman said she walked into the company gym and saw an employee receiving oral sex from an employee who was not as high up the corporate ladder. One employee reported that a manager ""phoned in a favor"" to avoid getting in trouble for calling an employee under him a ""bitch.""

As Insider noted Nike lost several executives after the 2018 internal investigation. But one person Laura Salerno Owens an attorney for the victims in the gender discrimination case pushed back on the idea that the toxic behavior only applied to a small group of people which Nike said in 2018.

""It wasn't limited to one vertical or one department… And it wasn't limited to one manager. This was a common experience throughout the company.""

Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJhZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9uaWtlLWFpci1tYXgtMS04Ny1jb2NvbnV0LW1pbGstd29tZW5zLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1yZWxlYXNlLWluZm_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"The Nike Air Max 1 87 ""Coconut Milk"" Is a Women's Size Exclusive","The Nike Air Max 1 87 ""Coconut Milk"" Is a Women's Size Exclusive And its the creamiest colorway yet.

Nike just unveiled its upcoming Air Max 1 87 silhouette arriving in a creamy “Coconut Milk” colorway that we can’t get enough of.

What’s even more exciting about the subtle-yet-striking silhouette is that it’s dropping exclusively in women’s sizing. Kitted out in a smooth Coconut Milk-colored upper complete with accents of “Alabaster” and “Saturn Gold” the silhouette features an off-white upper comprised of mesh suede and leather. The sneaker also boasts an embroidered tiger-striped pattern on its midfoot rounded out by safari-printed mudguards and textured heel overlays reminiscent of reptile skin.

The sneaker is likely to be priced at around $150 USD and comes shortly after Nike unveiled a “Coconut Milk” colorway for the Dunk Mid which features vivid orange accents and brown overlays.

On Thursday Dec. 22 we reported that our efforts to learn about the specific provisions of the grant request that was filed pursuant to a settlement of the dispute between Amtrak on one side and CSX NS and the Port of Mobile on the other over future passenger service between New Orleans and Mobile had faced difficulties. At that time there was only one actual report we could cite.

Then the same evening the situation changed. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari had advised this writer that if Amtrak receives a sufficient number of requests through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for a certain document it posts that document in the FOIA section of the Amtrak website www.amtrak.com. Late Thursday the condition had been met and the document is now available for viewing. There are actually two posts “Submitted Core Application Gulf Coast” and “Submitted Attachments Gulf Coast.” Both are in PDF format and can be downloaded below. In a sense Amtrak had given all of us who have inquiring minds and want to know an early Christmas present.

Now it’s time to look at what the documents say especially the grant application. Of course our space is limited so we encourage you to go to www.amtrak.com and examine the documents for yourself.

What the Grant Application Says

The grant application itself runs 54 PDF pages and bears the date of Dec. 2 2022. According to the Cover Sheet (at 8) the Federal Funding Requested Under this NOFO (Notice of Funding Opportunity) is $178535333 while the Proposed Non-Federal Match would be $44608834 for a Total Project Cost of $223044167. The cover sheet also noted that there had been a previous funding request for a FY2018 CRISI (Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements) grant that 75% of the project’s cost would be based in rural areas and that the project was noted in the 2016 Mississippi Rail Plan along with “freight-specific elements.” Its Competition ID number is FR-CRS-22-004-101051. There were nine attachments and future page references will use Amtrak’s pagination.

The Official Summary

The opening sentence of the “Project Summary” (at 1) shows that the parties have settled their differences and are now working together to get the grant that would pay for 80% of the costs: “The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and The Southern Rail Commission (SRC) (collectively Grant Applicant) with the full support of CSX Transportation (CSXT) Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR) the Alabama State Port Authority (the Port) (CSXT NSR and the Port collectively the ‘Supporting Parties’) and the states of Louisiana and Mississippi (collectively the ‘Participating States’) are pleased to present The Gulf Coast Corridor Improvement Project (GCCIP or the Project) for consideration under the Federal Railroad Administration’s (FRA) 2022 Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement (CRISI) Program.”

The document then summarized the scope of the project: “The Project will be a series of infrastructure improvements in the rail corridor from the New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal to the Port of Mobile that will support the introduction of intercity passenger rail where passenger rail service has not operated since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 while maintaining freight service reliability along the Gulf Coast Corridor (the corridor)” (Id.). After mentioning the projected costs the document went on to say that the money would: “allow for Project Development (including Preliminary Engineering and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review) Final Design and Construction to lengthen sidings extend main tracks install new switches and turnouts construct additional crossovers and improve stations yards and grade crossings. Initiating passenger rail service while maintaining the efficiency of freight service along the Gulf Coast will create pathways toward social equity disaster resilience regional productivity employment accessibility sociocultural exchange and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the climate-impacted Gulf Coast region” (Id.). Thus it would serve a number of purposes some of which were mentioned during the hearings before the Surface Transportation Board (STB).

The document then discussed the history of the SRC and the Gulf Coast Working Group (GCWG) convened by the FRA under §11304 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act and how the GCWG had recommended the proposed service on the proposed route. Some of the benefits expected from the service were mentioned including: “This service is also expected to expand Gulf Coast markets for tourism and business travel reduce I-10 vehicular congestion improve access to jobs education and health care in an area that is predominantly Historically Disadvantaged/Transportation Disadvantaged and serve as an evacuation route in a region susceptible to storm events.” The Summary portion of the document mentioned the settlement agreement only once stating: “That settlement agreement included several other terms conditions and concessions that work in conjunction with the projects outlined in this application to support passenger and freight service in the Gulf Coast Corridor” (Id.).

Funding for the Project

The next section concerned funding mentioning the numbers stated above and saying that funding is split 80/20 between the CRISI grant and non-Federal sources. It also gave some detail about a previous grant application in FY2018 for $33 million on a 50/50 match. That money was not obligated and the SRC is now including those requested funds into the present application with an 80/20 formula (Id.).

Page 2 contains a table of sources and uses with construction taking up 88.62% of the total. The other items were engineering (6.00%) Project Management and other Support Services (4.04%) and NEPA (1.35%). The application explained how the applicants and the project are eligible for funding (at 2-3).

The Project Itself

The next topic was a detailed description of the project which began: “This section provides a detailed description of the Project including the Project background and current challenges the proposed Project elements and scope its users and beneficiaries readiness and proposed performance measures once the Project is complete” (at 3). The big challenges to restoration of passenger service (at 4-5) are the “Complex Freight Corridor” between New Orleans and Mobile and the “Lack of Passenger Rail Services” since Hurricane Katrina pounded the region in 2005. The report also noted the need for greater resiliency and the difficulties with essentially no non-automobile transportation in the region: “Rebuilding passenger rail service with an improved structure will increase individual mobility create jobs improve the quality of life and bring transportation options back to communities impacted by Katrina. This will in turn attract more businesses and visitors creating a cycle of growth” (at 4). The “Expected Outcome” section (at 5) noted the proposed running time of 3:23 between the two endpoints “while simultaneously maintaining freight service quality after the introduction of the proposed Gulf Coast intercity passenger trains.” One infrastructure improvement that was mentioned specifically will be longer sidings for freight trains.

Under the subhead “Introduction of Intercity Passenger Rail Service” (at 5) the report listed the benefits to the region that will result when the new trains begin to run. The first one mentioned was connectivity: “This new Gulf Coast intercity passenger rail service will integrate into a vast regional and national transportation network of non-vehicle modes.” The points of connectivity that were listed specifically were the airports in the region local transit providers and long-distance trains serving New Orleans. The next benefit was increased mobility for persons who depend on transit or live in one-vehicle households. Other benefits are safety reliability shorter trip times and Amtrak meeting its goal of running at an average speed of 60mph along the route.

The document also mentioned benefits for freight (at 6) particularly on NS’s Back Belt in New Orleans and at Mobile including the Port of Mobile’s Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks (TASD).

The next section (also at 6) contains a list of “Expected Users and Beneficiaries.” The list is comprehensive with ten categories. The include business users (real estate and other businesses) job seekers and tourists the states and localities where economic development resulting from the trains will enhance tax revenue and economic development and “low-income residents who do not own a vehicle and older adults who are no longer able to drive.” In presenting this list the application repeated many of the arguments often made by advocates for new passenger trains and better transit particularly rail.

Project Components in Detail

Pages 6-12 contain a detailed description of each of 13 project components. The locations of these projects are described at Pages 13-14 and they are shown on a map at the top of Page 14.

While there is not enough space to describe each component in detail in this article here is a list:

Gentilly Bypass (New Orleans) Claiborne Siding Extension (New Orleans) Beauvoir Siding Extension (Mississippi) Orange Grove Siding Extension (Mississippi) Theodore Power Turnouts (Alabama) Brookley to Mobile Siding Extension (Mobile) Mobile Station Track (a CSX project not part of the CRISI grant) St. John’s Crossovers (New Orleans) Elysian Fields Crossovers (New Orleans) Terminal Junction Crossovers (New Orleans where NS’s Back Belt meets CSX’s NO&M) Station Improvements (at Bay St. Louis Gulfport Biloxi Pascagoula and Mobile) Virginia Street Lead (Mobile) Mississippi Grade Crossings

Evaluation and Selection Criteria

This section (at 14-23) gives detailed information about the benefits of the overall project as each component fits into applicable selection criteria which are used for evaluating grant applications. Other provisions concern Project Implementation and Management Planning readiness and design issues. While much of that information is too technical to present within the space available the information is now available for anyone concerned to see by going to the FOIA section at www.amtrak.com.

The main body of the document concluded with a table of “DOT Strategic Goals” (at 25). It summarized the details on Safety Equitable Economic Strength and Improving Core Assets Equity and Barriers to Opportunity Climate Change and Stability and Transformation. The comment regarding the last-named issue is instructive and appears to act as a two-sentence summary: “All Project improvements will take place to enable passenger service for a region eager to see passenger trains serve their communities again. This Project will not only improve the economy and communities in the region.”

There are also some attachments to the main document. Only a few were reproduced along with it. They include Project Area Diagrams (Attachment H) required FRA certifications budget information an “Applicant Financial Capability Questionnaire promulgated by the FRA with Amtrak’s answers and a Certification regarding lobbying.

This application could prove to be a critical document in Amtrak’s efforts to expand its network of corridor-length routes with state support as proposed in its ConnectUS plan to add a number of such routes to the existing network by 2035. It was known throughout the time the Mobile matter was before the STB that it is the “test case” for other new services that Amtrak has placed onto the drawing board.

It’s too early to tell whether the settlement that was reached in the matter will clear the track for more such agreements between Amtrak and potential host railroads and other concerned parties to plan for new routes or whether it will merely move the red signal that would stop other routes from developing and getting needed funds a few blocks down the track.

At the moment though signals are green and indications are clear for the construction that will allow the long-awaited trains to run along the Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Mobile for the first time since 2005. With Amtrak’s release of the document described in this report we now know what Amtrak and the other parties are planning and we can report some details as well as how you can get more of them for the first time. It’s true: What a difference a day does make!

We’ll count down the Top 10 stories of the year as voted on by Trains editors columnists and correspondents beginning Dec. 26. As a prelude we’ll be looking at major stories that didn’t make that list. Today: The freight rail industry.

How the mighty have fallen.

A year ago the battle between Canadian Pacific and Canadian National for ownership of Kansas City Southern was the top News Wire story of 2021. This year the ongoing developments in the CP-KCS merger didn’t even make the News Wire Top 10 list.

It came close however finishing 11th in our balloting. And there was certainly enough going on as the two railroads move toward what could be the last merger of Class I railroads that it deserves further review along with the pending BNSF takeover of Montana Rail Link CSX’s completion of its purchase of Pan Am Railways and CEO changes at three Class I roads.

CP-KCS: Ask and see what you receive

The regulatory process involved in merging KCS covered most of 2022 with other railroads lineside communities and other interested parties weighing in with regulators — generally to ask for conditions to be imposed if the Surface Transportation Board does as expected approve the deal. A decision is expected sometime in January.

Spurned KCS suitor Canadian National raised objections to the deal at every turn claiming the CP-KCS merger application was based on fatally flawed data would hurt competition and could lead to rail network meltdowns in Chicago Houston and elsewhere. CN also said it should receive the KCS Springfield Line connecting that Illinois city to St. Louis and Kansas City to create a route to Chicago Detroit Toronto and Montreal to compete with the merged company CPKC [see “Canadian National warns regulators …” Sept. 29 2022]. Relatively late in the game it offered a milder alternative of trackage rights [see “CN would accept trackage rights …” News Wire Oct. 24 2022].

The other Class I railroads had their own requests for conditions. BNSF and UP want CPKC to be prevented from increasing traffic in the Houston area until it identifies funds and completes projects to increase capacity and want guarantees protecting interchange at the important Laredo Texas gateway [see “UP BNSF say CP-KCS traffic will melt down Houston terminal” News Wire Sept. 30 2022]. Norfolk Southern and CSX both raised questions about the current KCS-NS Meridian Speedway venture with NS concerned the merger might hurt the operation and CSX wanting access to the Speedway route [see “STB gets an earful …” News Wire Oct. 3 2022].

Others seeking conditions or raising objections include Chicago commuter operator Metra which wants a host of infrastructure improvements and other conditions to avoid service disruptions and a group of Chicago suburbs who have sought to block the deal entirely over traffic increases that CP and KCS estimate will go from three to eight freight trains a day but the suburban group the Coalition to Stop CPKC has estimated could be as many as 14 trains. Failing a complete halt to the merger that group originally sought more than $9 billion to mitigate the impact of the deal but eventually scaled that back to $400 million [see “CP and KCS tout and defend …” News Wire Sept. 28 2022].

Reclaiming the Link

Montana Rail Link announced in January that it had agreed to early termination of its lease of BNSF lines in Montana Idaho and Washington allowing BNSF to regain control of the former Northern Pacific track that predecessor Burlington Northern had leased to MRL in 1987 [see “BNSF needed to end …” Jan. 21 2022]. BNSF may have paid as much as $2 billion to buy out the lease which was not set to expire until 2047 [see “BNSF Railway paid around $2 billion …” News Wire March 3 2022].

A timeline for the BNSF takeover was contingent on BNSF reaching agreement with MRL’s unions; with that completed MRL began the regulatory process in November asking the STB for permission to discontinue service. A board decision is expected in 2023’s second quarter [see “Montana Rail line seeks regulator permission …” Nov. 21 2022]

CSX completes Pan Am deal

Regulators approved CSX Transportation’s acquisition of New England regional Pan Am Railways in April with CSX taking over operation of the 1700-mile road in June. CSX had announced its intent to purchase Pan Am in November 2020 [see “CSX to acquire …” News Wire Nov. 30 2020]. After approving the deal STB Chairman Martin J. Oberman said he looked forward to “improvements in the rail network with respect to reliable service and competitive transportation options in New England and beyond.”

CSX had pledged to spend more than $100 million to upgrade Pan Am’s infrastructure and aging locomotive fleet over the first three years of ownership [see “Regulators approve CSX Transportation’s acquisition …” News Wire April 14 2022].

New faces at the top

Three Class I railroad welcomed new CEOs in 2022. The changes began in February when former Canadian Pacific executive Tracy Robinson was named Canadian National CEO. That was followed by Alan Shaw’s ascension to the top spot at Norfolk Southern effective in May but announced the previous December; and the selection of former Ford Motor Co. executive Joe Hinrichs as CSX CEO in September. The selection of Hinrichs generated the most discussion because hiring a CEO from outside the rail industry is a relatively rare move [see “Shippers railroads and analyst praise CSX’s selection …” News Wire Sept. 22 2022.]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ0YW5kcy5jb20vcGFzc2VuZ2VyL2hpZ2gtc3BlZWQtcmFpbC9jaHNyYS1vcGVucy10aHJlZS1uZXctc3RydWN0dXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CHSRA Opens Three New Structures,"The California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) in collaboration with Dragados-Flatiron Joint Venture recently announced the completion of three new high-speed rail structures in Fresno and Kings Counties.

The Adams Avenue grade separation in Fresno County the Cairo Avenue structure in Kings County and the Fowler grade separation located between Elkhorn and Davis avenues in Fresno County are now open to traffic CHSRA says.

The Adams Avenue grade separation which is located between Cedar and Maple avenues south of the City of Fresno spans 357 feet long is 40 feet wide and takes traffic over the existing BNSF and future high-speed rail lines.

The Cairo Avenue structure is between Eighth and Ninth avenues in Kings County and will take high-speed trains over Cairo Avenue. It spans 84 feet long and more than 43 feet wide and is built to accommodate two sets of tracks for future high-speed trains.

The Fowler Avenue grade separation which spans 299 feet and 40 feet wide will take traffic over the future high-speed rail lines. The structure is comprised of 12 pre-cast concrete girders manufactured at the DFJV Pre-Cast Girder Facility in Hanford.

Throughout 2022 CHSRA says progress has continued across the 171 miles under construction and development including ongoing progress at the Cedar and Hanford viaducts and the completion of other high-speed rail grade separations at Kent and Jackson avenues in Kings County South Avenue in Fresno County and at Avenue 15 ½ in Madera County.

CHSRA recently announced that the project has created nearly 9800 construction jobs since work building the nation’s first high-speed rail line began. This includes 3269 jobs going to residents from Fresno County 1826 from Kern County 977 from Tulare County 424 from Madera County and 353 from Kings County.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjEzYWJjLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL3BhcnQtaG9sbGFuZC1zeWx2YW5pYS1jbG9zZWQtZHVlLWNhci10cmFpbi1jcmFzaC_SAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xM2FiYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9wYXJ0LWhvbGxhbmQtc3lsdmFuaWEtY2xvc2VkLWR1ZS1jYXItdHJhaW4tY3Jhc2gvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Part of Holland Sylvania closed due to car and train crash,"TOLEDO Ohio (WTVG) - Part of Holland Sylvania is closed after a crash that the Ohio State Highway Patrol says involved a car and a train on Friday.

The crash occurred at the railroad tracks on Holland Sylvania just south of Angola Road. OSHP says one of the warning arms was damaged in the crash.

According OSHP a driver tried to drive around the warning arms when the vehicle got stuck on the tracks. The driver got out of the car before a train struck her vehicle. The driver sustained minor injuries.

According to OSHP that portion of Holland Sylvania will be closed for an extended period of time while Norfolk Southern fixes the warning arm. OSHP says to avoid the area until the road reopens.

What were the key theme(s) for your business in 2022?

Volatility and correlated returns. From our clients’ perspective the biggest trend this year was the near universal challenge of extreme volatility and high correlation in performance returns. Few managers we know have dealt with successive periods of -20% drawdowns in equities and none have experienced negative returns for both equities and fixed income (something that’s only occurred four times in the past 100 years). This experience will impact how they think about their future be that in terms of operating models and asset allocation.



Linked to this a big theme for us this year was recognizing that our clients’ challenges don’t stop at cost but extend to performance and returns as well. For years Asset Servicers have focused principally on removing cost and complexity from their client operating models. But that is no longer enough. Asset Servicers now must go further into new areas like the Front Office and move beyond data to dealing and decision making in order to offer holistic solutions to their whole office problems.



What trends are getting underway that people may not know about but will be important?

I think the one of the biggest trends will be asset managers looking to become even more capital-light by renting fixed-cost infrastructure from scale providers. This will provide greater margin resiliency in the face of asset volatility more agility in the face of change greater resiliency and of course improved scale economics. Outsourcing in other words will accelerate to where the fund manager retains the core intellectual property (decision making) and all post-decision functions are outsourced. If that sounds like the software sector – trust your instincts! Much the way fintechs retain their IP (developers designers) and outsource all the rest to a mega-provider like one of the major cloud services financial firms want to do the same.

For Asset Owners the big trend will be further questioning of where they can find uncorrelated returns forcing some to look at their balance sheet as an asset class. Given the size of the numerator the balance sheets of many allocators could be a significant and largely untapped source of alpha.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXBsZXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvbmFwbGVzLWx1bWluYXJ5LWRvbHBoLXZvbi1hcngtbWFkZS1hLWh1Z2UtaW1wYWN0LWluLXNvdXRod2VzdC1mbG9yaWRhLzY5NzQ3MjQ5MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Naples luminary Dolph von Arx made a huge impact in Southwest Florida,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='subscribe.naplesnews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /restricted/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naplesnews.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2F2022%2F12%2F23%2Fnaples-luminary-dolph-von-arx-made-a-huge-impact-in-southwest-florida%2F69747249007%2F&gps-source=CPROADBLOCKDH (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212273DF4C0>, 'Connection to subscribe.naplesnews.com timed out.

What were the key theme(s) for your business in 2022?

Our mission is to replace the outdated infrastructure being used across capital markets. We’ve gone down to the bare metal to build a completely cloud-native system designed for the modern needs of a complex global market. In May 2022 Clear Street raised $165m in our Series B funding round and we’re using that funding to turbocharge growth expand our engineering capabilities and reach new markets and asset classes. Three themes defined Clear Street’s 2022: Business Product and People.

Clear Street’s business growth in 2022 has been monumental. We achieved a milestone reaching 2.5% equity market share have seen a 220% increase in financing balances and are now valued at $1.7 billion. We launched our capital introduction and repo businesses enhanced our securities lending capabilities and updated and refined our client-facing position risk operations and reporting portals.

In the last 12 months Clear Street has introduced a swath of new products and improvements to enhance the client experience. In April we replaced our core transaction processing system with a faster more scalable model to support our growing business. In October we launched ATLAS (Automated Trading Locates Allocation System) our proprietary stock loan trading system which allocates stock loan inventory to incoming customer requests.

None of this would be possible without our people. In 2022 we grew to almost 400 employees and opened five offices globally. We expanded our sales and engineering teams and welcomed Wall Street industry veterans to support our rapid growth strategy. These hires bring credibility and knowledge to our already diverse sales team and we look forward to broadening our reach to clients in the U.S. and in international markets.

What are your clients’ pain points and how have they changed from 1 year ago?

2022 presented a challenging environment for our clients. Recent market conditions place more weight on investment performance than usual. With the average YTD drawdown at 5% for all hedge funds and 12% for equity funds some funds will not be receiving performance fees for 2022 and potentially for quarters to come. Many managers will only have management fees to finance their operating activities and working capital requirements. In this environment it can be harder to maintain the staff and discipline required to properly manage risk. Clear Street helps managers through these difficult times by providing more real-time access to data and saving costs on third party systems.

On the regulatory side 2022 was an exceptionally active year for the SEC which proposed 30 new rules in the first 11 months of 2022 the most in over a decade. Whether and how all of these rules will be implemented has yet to be determined. However 2022 has proven that when the SEC writes about a rule advisers and investors alike should take it seriously and create compliance policies and procedures sooner rather than later.

What are your expectations for 2023?

Market uncertainty and volatility will continue and those funds best positioned to prosper and thrive are those that have invested significantly or work with service providers that can provide the real-time structured data needed to manage risk capitalize on opportunities run efficient and compliant businesses and communicate opportunities and risks with their investors. Clear Street’s cloud-native proprietary technology platform adds significant efficiency to the market while focusing on maximizing returns and minimizing risk and cost for clients.

Olympus the broader Clear Street Securities Finance Stack (of which ATLAS is a part) will soon expand to include a marketplace for Stock Loan called Agora. In its first phase Agora will be available for customers and existing partners of Clear Street. Agora aims to modernize the Securities Lending marketplace by introducing a standing order book streaming prices and a seamless customer experience.

Additionally Clear Street is rolling out a multi-asset and multi-market inventory and contract management system in 2023 that will improve the efficiency of our securities finance desk. It’s all part of our plan to modernize the market infrastructure across capital markets and improve market access for all participants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjbi5vcmcudWsvbmV3cy1hbmQtZXZlbnRzL1ByZXNzLVJlbGVhc2VzL3N0cmlrZS1kYXRlcy1mb3ItamFudWFyeS1hbm5vdW5jZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More hospitals to take part in strikes in January RCN announces after UK Government fails to open NHS pay talks,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjbi5vcmcudWsvbmV3cy1hbmQtZXZlbnRzL1ByZXNzLVJlbGVhc2VzL3N0cmlrZS1kYXRlcy1mb3ItamFudWFyeS1hbm5vdW5jZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212273DE0B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Despite the broader market’s abysmal performance this year traditional A&D companies have outperformed phenomenally. Companies like Lockheed Martin Raytheon Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems are trading 15%–37%+ YTD. The sector has strengthened on increased demand in response to Russia’s longer-than-expected war in Ukraine and the growing threat posed by China a military and space near-peer adversary.

Commercial space companies meanwhile that SPAC’d…have been decimated. The entire group is down 60% market cap-weighted.

What happened?

Space is still new: Pure-play space companies are a new area of investing for the public markets. Most investment banks have scant research coverage of the industry so it’s hard to see how broader market participants would know how to trade them.

R&D isn’t meant for public markets: The public markets are no place to build your first product—especially when your financial projections were based on technical milestones that were ambitious to begin with. By our estimates only one company that has gone public via SPAC actually came close to its original projections. Fee-driven investment bankers led companies astray as they built comp tables and valuation models that were inherently flawed.

M&A Activity

There were two major A&D acquisitions this year and they both happened in the last week.

Maxar agreed to be acquired by global private equity firm Advent International in a $6.4B all-cash deal ($4B excluding debt) representing a 129% premium to its last closing stock price.

Aerojet Rocketdyne agreed to be acquired by defense prime L3Harris Technologies for $4.7B (a 7% premium to Lockheed’s original offer in late 2020).

The recent M&A activity is no doubt an indicator that there is institutional capital focused on the space. The Aerojet transaction alone had many interested buyers including GE Textron and a number of PE shops. The Maxar deal has a 60-day “go shop” period running through Valentine’s Day that allows the company to find a more favorable deal for shareholders. We could easily see a competitive process heading into Q1.

The Aerojet transaction falls into the broader trend of consolidation among the few large defense contractors. Remember there were 51 prime contractors in the ’90s. Now there are five: Lockheed Martin Raytheon General Dynamics Northrop Grumman and Boeing.

The Maxar deal is a reminder that high-margin cash-flow generating businesses continue to be a focus for private equity firms that are willing to pay hefty premiums over public multiples or what defense primes are used to paying.

Circling back to space SPACs we think that there will almost definitely be some consolidation or take-private transactions that occur next year. We’re already seeing a number of deals in broader tech SPACs and a number of the existing public space companies are starting to look like ripe targets for both financial and strategic buyers. Our popcorn is ready.

Private Capital

Source: Pitchbook | 11.30.22

Fundraising trends for space has followed the broader tech sector.

Both deal count and total capital raised are down considerably YoY. Relative to historical trends starting in Q4 2020 all stages have seen a significant dislocation of deal activity. This is most pronounced in growth and late-stage businesses. Companies that didn’t need to come back into the market to raise capital either A) didn’t need to or B) were able to meaningfully reduce opex and burn. This is why down rounds this year were fairly limited. We think this will change next year.

Two key predictions for 2023

We expect a number of high-profile down rounds next year. For example there are many launch companies with significant valuations from prior rounds that will have to come back to market. We don’t see how those companies will be able to maintain their prices without substantial technical progress (i.e. orbital success). The new reality of higher interest rates and stricter deal terms will set in quickly.

Seed financing and valuations should remain strong. There’s still a significant amount of cash sitting on the sidelines. That cash will need to be put to work and seed-stage startups tend to be more insulated from public market volatility (particularly because their time to exit typically extends beyond the current market cycle). We expect the seed stage to remain healthy both in terms of size and valuations.

Bottom line: It’s been a turbulent year for the markets. Space companies aren’t exempt from this trend and we haven’t seen the end of this shakeout. Winter is coming as is more consolidation and companies shutting their doors. Still the space industry has strong secular tailwinds. Those who can weather the storm will come out stronger than ever on the other side.

The United States is the only country in the world with the ability to field stealth bombers that can carry heavy payloads like thermonuclear weapons in its hull. America’s B-2 Spirit bomber began development in the mid-1970’s and was intended to operate as a unique weapon for America in the Cold War against the Soviets. The only problem was by the time the bomber entered into service in the 1990’s the USSR was long gone. The wind was taken out of the sails a little bit and given that each plane cost more than $2 billion it’s understandable that the government only ordered the making of less than two dozen of these bombers. So what exactly is a stealth bomber and why are they so expensive to build and maintain?

Stealth bombers like the B-2 Spirit and its descendant the B-21 Raider are intended to function precisely how the name suggests: They are invisible to radar and thermal sensors (mostly). The unique shape of the bombers and the radar absorbing coat of paint it wears makes it difficult even for the most advanced detection systems to find. Ultimately however the B-2 Spirit is a pain in the neck to maintain and while it is fully capable of remaining undetected refueling ships that accompany it mid-mission are not. So what did the Defense Department upgrade? Quite a few things actually and though much of the specifics remain classified there are many inferences to be made about the B-21 Raider based on the statements of the US Air Force at the bomber’s unveiling.

America’s stealth bombers have a unique wingspan that makes it difficult to keep in hangars outside of the US so the capability to make round trips without stopping is a key feature in the aircraft’s capabilities. As mentioned previously tankers that often perform mid-flight refueling for these long distance missions are not nearly as stealthy as their partners so it is quite likely the B-21 Raider is capable of completing its mission without refueling. It stands to reason that refueling will occur on the return trip at which point stealth won’t be so high a priority. But aside from the upgrades in tech the US military placed two values high on their list that I hold to be crucial improvements in America’s military industrial efficiency: Cost and Upgradability.

The B-2 Spirit costs upwards of $2 billion apiece but the Air Force made it clear to Northrop Grumman Corp. the contractor responsible for the design that it was aiming to pay no more than a quarter of that price and it appears like Northrop Grumman is on track to meet it. Additionally the Defense Department tackled a recurring problem with new military tech and that is by the time a project reaches completion new and improved tech is already in the market. The military can’t upgrade their new vehicles because their designs made them too expensive to change around. Not with the B-21 Raider though. The US is implementing a new design principle that requires all the individual pieces that go into its systems to be easily replaceable making it cheap to upgrade to new technologies. The name of the game here is efficiency and affordability which is the tried and true method of military industrial development for the US since the days of World War II and it’s poised to return to form ahead of the brewing conflict with China in the Pacific. The hope for many is that this bomber will never need to be used for its intended purpose.

December 23 2022—On Thursday state regulators approved hundreds of millions of dollars in rate increases for Puget Sound Energy electric and natural gas customers beginning January 1 2023. PSE services natural gas to Snohomish County.

The Utilities and Transportation Commission approved three settlement agreements establishing a multi-year rate plan for the company as required by recently enacted legislation. The approved settlements cover a two-year period beginning Jan. 1 2023.

PSE’s electric net revenue will increase by $223 million on Jan. 1 2023 followed by an additional increase of $38 million on Jan. 1 2024. PSE’s natural gas net revenue will increase by $70.6 million on Jan. 1 2023 and by $18.8 million on Jan. 1 2024.

The typical residential electric customer using 800 kWh of energy per month can expect an increase of $7.75 or 8.7% per month in 2023 for an average monthly bill of $96.65 and an additional $1.67 or 1.7% increase per month in 2024 for an average monthly bill of $98.32.

The typical natural gas residential customer using 64 therms per month can expect an increase of $4.87 or 6.4% per month in 2023 for an average monthly bill of $80.56 and an additional $1.34 or 1.7% per month in 2024 for an average monthly bill of $81.90.

The three settlements address issues around establishing the company’s overall revenue requirement; credits for customers of PSE’s Green Direct program which provides clean power to corporate and government customers; and the recovery of costs for a portion of the Tacoma Liquified Natural Gas Facility.

In October PSE filed with the UTC to increase natural gas rates effective on November 1 2022.

Revenue Requirements Settlement

Under the settlement PSE must improve the distribution of low-income assistance map and address long-term overdue bills and improve low-income conservation and weatherization incentives.

PSE also agrees to a partial write-off of certain costs associated with the coronavirus pandemic. To support low-income customers the settlement requires PSE to work with its Low-Income Advisory Committee to develop and submit to the commission for approval a plan for low-income discounted rates and managing increased customer debts due to the pandemic.

Additionally the settlement addresses environmental and clean energy considerations allowing recovery for:

costs to increase public access to electric vehicle charging

decarbonization research

a pilot program to promote electric heat pump use for home and building heating and

reporting requirements to measure PSE’s carbon emissions.

Parties to the revenue requirement settlement are UTC staff Puget Sound Energy the Alliance of Western Energy Consumers Federal Executive Agencies Walmart Inc. The Energy Project Kroger Co. the Northwest Energy Coalition the Sierra Club Front and Centered Microsoft and Nucor Steel Seattle Inc.

The Public Counsel Unit of the Attorney General’s Office – which represents residential and small business customer interests before the commission – supported the revenue requirement settlement with certain exceptions. King County did not join or oppose this settlement. The Coalition of Eastside Neighborhoods for Sensible Energy opposed the portion of the settlement relating to transmission investments in King County east of Lake Washington which the commission approved.

Green Direct Program Settlement

PSE’s Green Direct program allows corporate and governmental customers such as cities or counties to voluntarily purchase 100% of their energy from dedicated local and renewable energy sources. The costs of this program must be funded by Green Direct customers and PSE may not shift costs to other PSE ratepayers.

PSE serves its Green Direct customers statewide using dedicated wind and solar facilities in Thurston Lewis and Klickitat County. Because the power generated from these facilities does not precisely match the customers’ power needs the company uses any excess power for its system and pays an energy credit to Green Direct customers. The settlement provides Green Direct customers a credit of $47.826 per MWh increasing by 2% annually.

The agreement does not make any changes to the Green Direct energy charge or the program’s cost and benefits tracking.

Parties to the Green Direct Settlement include UTC staff Puget Sound Energy the Public Counsel Unit of the Attorney General’s office and Green Direct customers King County and Walmart Inc.

Other parties to PSE’s rate case who neither joined nor opposed the settlement include the Alliance of Western Energy Consumers The Energy Project the Northwest Energy Coalition Front and Centered the Sierra Club Federal Executive Agencies and Kroger Co.

Tacoma LNG Plant Settlement

The commission approved the Tacoma LNG Plant Settlement which allows PSE to begin recovering costs subject to later review and possible refund for the portion of the Tacoma Liquefied Natural Gas facility that serves customers of PSE’s natural gas utility. The approved settlement relates only to the allocation of costs to PSE’s utility customers and is designed to ensure that PSE’s gas customers are not subsidizing PSE’s unregulated activities such as providing LNG to marine shippers.

The commission is not responsible for siting or permitting the LNG facility and its order focuses only on the allocation of costs. The company must file a request to recover additional costs when it files its annual Purchased Gas Adjustment in 2023. Parties to the Tacoma LNG settlement are UTC staff Puget Sound Energy the Alliance of Western Energy Consumers Walmart Inc. Kroger Co. and Nucor Steel Seattle Inc.

Customer advocate groups The Energy Project the Northwest Energy Coalition the Sierra Club and Front and Centered did not join or oppose the Tacoma LNG settlement. The Puyallup Tribe of Indians and the Public Counsel Unit of the Attorney General’s Office opposed this settlement agreement. Other parties to the rate case did not participate in the Tacoma LNG settlement.

Bellevue-based PSE provides electricity service to more than 1.1 million electric customers in eight Washington counties: Island King Kitsap Kittitas Pierce Skagit Thurston and Whatcom. PSE also provides natural gas service to more than 800000 customers in six Washington counties: King Kittitas Lewis Pierce Snohomish and Thurston.

The UTC is the state agency that regulates private investor-owned electric and natural gas utilities in Washington. It is the commission’s responsibility to ensure regulated companies provide equitable safe and reliable service to customers at reasonable rates while allowing them the opportunity to earn a fair profit.

However because of the raw power on offer along with Nvidia’s Studio drivers that come with features and tweaks to improve performance with creative applications this is a graphics card that may be of interest to professionals looking for the best graphics card for their needs.

While we concentrated on gaming performance in our Nvidia RTX 4080 review here we’ll look at if it’s worth investing in if you’re a content creator.

Better value for money?

In our review of the RTX 4080 we noted that the new GPU offers pretty poor value for money for gamers. Part of this is because despite its undeniable power its launch price of $1199 (£1269 around AU$1740) is extremely high for a gaming GPU. In fact it’s a whopping 71% more expensive than the RTX 3080 GPU it’s supposed to be replacing.

This price actually puts it on par with the RTX 3080 Ti – a high-end GPU that we’ve previously looked at from both a gaming and creative angle.

Perhaps the biggest issue facing the RTX 4080 is its bigger sibling: the RTX 4090. At $1599 in the US (about £1359/AU$2300) the RTX 4090 is more expensive but not by a huge amount. In fact there are some third-party RTX 4080 models that sell for more than the Founders Edition RTX 4090.

This closeness in price introduces a dilemma; while prices are close performance isn’t. So if you’re looking to spend a lot of money on a GPU saving up a bit longer for the RTX 4090 may end up being worthwhile.

However it’s also worth pointing out that there are rumors swirling that Nvidia could drop the price of the RTX 4080 in early 2023. An early price cut so soon after launch would normally not be even remotely likely but the rumor suggests that RTX 4080 sales haven’t been stellar – and a price cut could change that.

There’s also the fact that the RTX 4070 Ti is rumored to arrive soon – and it could just be a rebadged RTX 4080 12GB (a weaker version of the 4080 that Nvidia ended up ‘unlaunching’ after a vocal outcry. Rumors suggest the RTX 4070 Ti will launch at a cheaper price than it was advertised when it was the RTX 4080 12GB and to justify that Nvidia may lower the price of the regular RTX 4080.

This seems a bit like wishful thinking but if you can hold on until CES 2023 to see what Nvidia has planned you may be able to get the RTX 4080 at a lower price – making it even better value for digital creatives – especially when compared to the high prices of professional-grade GPUs.

Specifications

As you’d probably expect the RTX 4080 comes with some of Nvidia’s most cutting-edge tech including stuff found on the more expensive 4090 as well. It comes with 9728 CUDA Cores for rasterized graphics plus 304 fourth-generation Tensor Cores for AI and DLSS.

The memory has been boosted to 16GB of GDDR6X which makes the RTX 4080 a powerful performer when it comes to heavy-duty creative tasks such as rendering complex 3D scenes or editing ultra-high-resolution video.

According to Nvidia the RTX 4080 offers twice the performance of the RTX 3080 Ti for the same launch price and using 10% less power. That power consumption saving is going to add up for people planning on using their PCs for sustained high-intensity workloads.

Yeah but how does it actually perform?

In our own benchmarks we were pleasantly surprised to see the RTX 4080 broadly live up to Nvidia’s claims when using creative tools.

Blender is an incredibly popular 3D render engine and modeling tool and it also comes with a host of benchmarks. In the Blender 3.3.0 Monster benchmark the RTX 4080 scored 4812 almost twice the score of the RTX 3080 Ti’s 2747. Impressively it also handily beats both the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti – both flagship models that went on sale for a lot more. In the same test for example the RTX 3090 Ti scored 3077.

It was a similar story with the Blender Junkshop results and while the RTX 4080 didn’t quite score twice the amount of the RTX 3080 Ti at 2238 vs 1559 it still provided a hefty performance boost.

In fact in all of our Blender benchmarks the RTX 4080 came out well on top – only being beaten by the RTX 4090.

This means for 3D artists and creatives if money is no object the RTX 4080 is currently the second-best GPU you can buy right now.

However if money is a consideration the RTX 4080 is going to be a better investment than the 4090 – especially if a price cut is coming.

We also ran the PugetBench benchmark for Adobe Premiere Pro. Premiere Pro is a popular tool for video editors and content creators and the benchmark checks to see how well hardware can run various tasks.

In the tests the RTX 4080 unsurprisingly scored quite a bit higher than the RTX 3090 Ti 3090 and 3080 Ti. What was a surprise however was that the gap drastically narrowed in our tests with the RTX 4090. The more expensive GPU still came out on top but with a score of 967 compared to the RTX 4080’s 946 it’s incredibly close – to the point where you’d not notice the difference.

Even more interestingly the RTX 4080 actually scored slightly higher than the RTX 4090 in the PugetBench benchmark for Adobe Photoshop – arguably the best photo editing software photographers can use.

The Ada edge?

Ada-series GPUs don’t just build upon the features found in previous consumer GPU architecture such as Ampere and Turing but also take elements of Nvidia’s enterprise-class Hopper GPUs particularly with the 4th generation Tensor Cores which feature Hopper’s FP8 Transformer Engine.

So what’s behind the big leap in creative performance for the RTX 4080 compared to the RTX 3080 Ti? The RTX 4080 like the 4090 is built on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture which adds new features that help boost creative tasks.

There’s an improved eight-generation encoder including AV1 and AI live streaming for content creators. We had a play around and while results will vary depending on your own and your viewers' internet connections live streaming quality was impressive. The extra gaming chops of the RTX 4080 certainly help in this regard ensuring gameplay is smooth and responsive.

Jargon aside the exciting implication is that you’re getting the kind of features you’d expect in an enterprise GPU in a far cheaper consumer GPU.

The RTX 4080 also comes with two video encoders that support the AV1 video codec and Nvidia claims it’s 40% more efficient than the H.264 encoder that the previous Ampere generation used.

With dual video encoders video rendering can be up to twice as fast as previous generation GPUs. For professionals this could have big positive repercussions – the faster your work renders the more projects and commissions you can take on.

As with previous GPUs Nvidia has also released Studio drivers that have been specially designed for creative applications (rather than its ‘Game Ready’ drivers which focus on gaming performance). New features such as RTX Remix allow modders to add ray tracing effects to older games. It’s tools like this that really impress us.

Modding games takes a huge amount of effort and creativity but it’s often dismissed as ‘just’ a hobby for hardcore fans – so it’s good to see Nvidia giving modders the respect they’re due.

Verdict

As we noted in our main review of the RTX 4080 the GPU struggles to justify its price tag for gamers due to its high price tag which puts it out of the reach of mainstream users even those who would have splashed out on the RTX 3080 while also coming enticingly close to the price of the RTX 4090 – which means enthusiasts may skip the 4080 and go for the much more powerful GPU.

When it comes to creatives however the RTX 4080 is a much more competitive proposition. It offers a big leap in performance over more expensive previous-generation GPUs in creative workloads and includes features found in enterprise-grade GPUs – and while the 4080 is certainly expensive for a gaming GPU when you compare it to professional GPUs it offers far better value for money.

As our own tests showed the gap between the 4080 and 4090 isn’t as pronounced with creative workloads as it is with gaming. Don’t get us wrong the 4090 is a beast when powering through creative tasks but the 24GB VRAM – arguably the biggest difference between the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 (which has 16GB) – could be overkill for all but the most intense creative workloads (such as rendering extremely high-resolution 3D graphics).

If that’s the case then the RTX 4080 will be much better value. As a gaming GPU the RTX 4080 struggles to make a case for itself when it comes to value for money. As a creative GPU it’s a much more compelling buy with the advanced and improved features of the Ada Lovelace architecture making a noticeable difference when using creative apps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtY29ycG9yYXRpb25zLW5hc2RhcS1udmRhLXAtMTEwMDUwMTg4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) P/E Is On The Mark,"NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 63.4x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Nonetheless we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.

While the market has experienced earnings growth lately NVIDIA's earnings have gone into reverse gear which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.

Keen to find out how analysts think NVIDIA's future stacks up against the industry? In that case our free report is a great place to start.

Does Growth Match The High P/E?

In order to justify its P/E ratio NVIDIA would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.

Taking a look back first the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 28%. Even so admirably EPS has lifted 144% in aggregate from three years ago notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time even though it had some hiccups along the way.

Turning to the outlook the next three years should generate growth of 17% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.3% per annum which is noticeably less attractive.

With this information we can see why NVIDIA is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.

What We Can Learn From NVIDIA's P/E?

Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.

We've established that NVIDIA maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.

You should always think about risks. Case in point we've spotted 3 warning signs for NVIDIA you should be aware of.

I wanted to find out how to make the most of the hardware especially the dual encoders – Nvidia having included two encoder chips this time around.

Some background on presets

It is often said “Good Fast Cheap – Pick Two” and it fits post production pretty well. Encoding has a similar relationship between quality speed and file size.

For example if you fix the file size by fixing the bitrate as is common you can have higher quality by taking longer to make the encode. If you fix the quality (using say the constant quality slider in Handbrake) you can get the file size a bit smaller by taking longer with the encode. The way you go about this is by choosing a different preset – seen here for the x264 encoder in Handbrake for example.

A preset is defined as follows:

A preset is a collection of options that will provide a certain encoding speed to compression ratio. A slower preset will provide better compression (compression is quality per filesize). This means that for example if you target a certain file size or constant bit rate you will achieve better quality with a slower preset. Similarly for constant quality encoding you will simply save bitrate by choosing a slower preset (source).

The real question though is whether taking that extra time is worth it to you. Some people will just choose the slowest preset knowing they want the highest quality and are prepared to wait for it. Personally I would always like to know if it’s worth doing something slower – what if you’re waiting an extra 10 minutes every day for a 0.01% improvement that no-one will ever see? Well it turns out it’s exactly like that – not only for software encoders like x264 but also for the new RTX 4000 series which I’ll get to later.

A while back I came across some great research from Jan Ozer called “Choosing an x264 preset” which clearly shows that you gain almost nothing by using anything slower than the “faster” preset in terms of quality yet cost yourself a good bit of time if you do.

Presets for Nvidia’s NVENC in Davinci Resolve

The Nvidia hardware encoder (NVENC) also has presets – officially called P1 (fastest) through P7 (slowest) which according to Nvidia “determine for example GOP structure B frames look-ahead encoding and so on” – stuff most of us don’t have time to understand but it’s the same deal – spending a bit more time to get a bit more quality or a smaller file.

And it turns out the export time is massively different across these presets. I ran some tests on the RTX 4080 exporting a 5 minute DNxHR UHD 25fps clip to all three output options (H.264 H.265 and AV1) across all 7 presets. For H.265 and AV1 the fastest preset was around 6 times faster than the slowest one going from around 50 FPS to around 300 FPS. To put that into some context if you have a 30 minute timeline the “Very Slow” preset will take over 15 minutes and the “Very Fast” preset will take 2.5 minutes. That kind of time adds up if you’re doing this every day. To get this export speed the input codec does have to be ProRes or DNxHR (or equivalent mezzanine codec) with effects already cached/rendered – otherwise the encoder is not fed fast enough.

The dual encoders

There’s also a reason why the encoding speed jumps up sharply for the two fastest presets – it is here that the dual encoders come into play. Apparently under certain conditions the new cards can split a video into two halves and pass each half to each encoder and then recombine them. In order to use the dual encoders on the new RTX 4000 series you need the following to be true:

Resolution is UHD or above

Preset is “Faster (P2)” or “Very Fast (P1)”

Tuning is set as “High Quality” (this is the default anyway)

Export codec is AV1 or H.265

I was also only able to achieve this in Davinci Resolve (not Premiere Pro or Shutter Encoder for example). It’s interesting that the H.265 encode is now overall faster than H.264 – I think it is time to start using it if you’re not already.

But what about quality?

Of course the big question is what is the tradeoff in quality for these speeds? While you can and should use your eyes to see if an export is at the quality you require for more subtle differences it’s best to use something like PSNR or VMAF to assess the visual quality.

VMAF is an “Emmy-winning perceptual video quality assessment algorithm developed by Netflix”. And you can use it for free within FFmpeg – I followed this guide (again by Jan Ozer). The really good thing about VMAF is that it’s a score out of 100 which makes it quite easy to understand and according to Netflix a score of over 85 is good.

While there is a small drop-off in quality across the presets it really is very small – less than half a VMAF point & not visible to the naked eye. Really with any score over 90 I find it hard to see any artifacting at all. A much bigger difference is seen by using H.265 instead of H.264 (and AV1 is even better). Of course the actual numbers will depend on the source material but I did a few other tests and got similar results.

While speed of encode doesn’t affect the quality that much the bitrate/filesize does. You can see here a 1080p test file encoded to H.265 at bitrates from 10Mbps down to 1Mbps – the quality varies little across the presets but a lot across the bitrates. To my eye I was very happy with the encodes above 6Mbps.

Given most people are not short of drive space or internet speed upping the bitrate is definitely the way to push the quality up whilst keeping the benefit of getting the encode done quickly with the fastest presets.

Premiere Pro

In Premiere Pro there are more limited options but you still can speed up your exports by some judicious tweaking of settings. Presets are not available in H.264 and AV1 is not available at all yet (aside from using 3rd party plugin Voukoder) but if you choose HVEC (H.265) as the format and you dial down in the Video settings you see five options listed as “Quality” – why there are five and not seven I have no idea (my guess is trying to keep it simpler by leaving off the outer two). You also need to make sure you have chosen one pass hardware encoding which uses the Nvidia NVENC encoder.

Again there are substantial time savings to be made here though sadly none of them seemed to access the dual encoders. But I saw about a 67% speed increase going from the default “Good” to the “Lower” setting – and this time the drop off in quality was completely negligible (only 0.1 VMAF points across all the presets). And getting to 167 FPS is pretty impressive even if not quite the 300 FPS of Davinci Resolve.

Shutter Encoder is a popular free encoding tool so I thought I’d give it a look too. It’s very useful and better than Handbrake in lots of ways (e.g. keeps timecode intact). It’s a front end for FFmpeg and by default it’s using the CPU encoders like x264. This is great if you have an older graphics card or you are after the best possible quality. You can force it to use NVENC if you want to for much faster speeds – in my tests getting a 10x speed increase by changing from the default settings to NVENC “veryfast”. It performed similarly to Premiere with 183 FPS and again didn’t seem to be able to use the dual encoders.

I did find the software encoders gave 1 or 2 more VMAF points for the same material in general so again it depends if you are trying to squeeze out the last bit of quality and don’t mind spending the time doing that.

Conclusions

The Nvidia hardware encoder (NVENC) has been of a very high quality for many generations – close enough to the quality of software encoders to make it worthwhile and much much faster. In this RTX 4000 series it is even better and the inclusion of dual encoders is quite exciting. Being able to access them in Davinci Resolve is fantastic bringing encoding speeds up to an impressive 300 FPS by using the fastest presets. And those speeds involve very little drop off in quality plus you could make up for that anyway by bumping up the bitrate a little to no real disadvantage.

I also think it’s time to ditch H.264 for H.265. Hardware on the receiving end is now easily able to play it back and it’s now quicker to make as well as better quality. H.264 is coming on 20 years old now and H.265 can now be seen as the “safe” choice against AV1 if that makes you feel better.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vc3RyZWFtLWdhbWVzLW9uLW52aWRpYS1zaGllbGQtdHYtdmlhLXN0ZWFtLWxpbmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Stream PC Games on Your NVIDIA Shield TV via Steam Link,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vc3RyZWFtLWdhbWVzLW9uLW52aWRpYS1zaGllbGQtdHYtdmlhLXN0ZWFtLWxpbmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212272F1000>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Gets Ampere GA107 GPU Same Performance At 15W Lower Power

A year ago NVIDIA introduced the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card which featured the GA106 GPU for $249 US. The graphics card was meant to offer entry-level RTX performance in a 130W package but it looks like it was originally intended to use the GA107 GPU which at the time was shipping to notebooks and NVIDIA had to reuse GA106 silicon for the time being.

Now a year later NVIDIA's AIBs are introducing the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card with the GA107 GPU. NVIDIA's GA107 GPU has a smaller core than the GA106 which offers 3840 CUDA cores. There will be no reason to replace the PCB as both versions are identical pin layouts allowing for both to be compatible.

MSI has released its new GeForce RTX 3050 VENTUS 2X XS 8G OC which is expected to offer 2560 CUDA cores. The graphics card will be capable of overclocking with the boost clock anticipated to be 1807 MHz. Memory speeds are expected to be 14 Gbps and utilize the 8GB GDDR6 memory onboard and a 128-bit memory bus. The total power consumption level will be 115W 15W less than the GA106 variant.

Display outputs on the new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 VENTUS 2X XS 8G OC graphics card will have a single DisplayPort 1.4a port one HDMI port that is expected to support 4K resolutions at 120 Hz with the 2.1 specifications and a single DL-DVI-D connector which is interesting that they are adding an older display connector onto the GPU. DL-DVI-D cables are seen with LCD connections and only provide a digital output.

NVIDIA won't be launching an RTX 4050 any time soon since they are still focused on the RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 series for the majority of early 2023. The successor to the RTX 3050 might appear by mid of 2023 but we will have to see so for users who want to wait the RTX 3050 is a decent entry-level option for now and can be found at decent prices too.

The consumer discretionary sector is down about 37% for the year. Companies in this sector tend to suffer during times of economic downturn since consumers prioritize paying for necessities such as rent or food over discretionary purchases when their budgets are tight.

But ""while most consumer discretionary stocks have been horrendous this year we've had some pools of strength too and many of them can work in 2023"" according to Cramer.

Here are his picks:

Genuine Parts  O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone

Cramer highlighted these three auto parts stocks as potential buys stating that AutoZone is his favorite. With used car prices coming down and new car prices likely to follow consumers are more likely to fix up their old car next year than purchase a new one he reasoned.

Ulta Beauty

While the company reported a solid earnings beat and boosted its outlook earlier this month investors shouldn't be greedy with the stock especially if it sees a big gain Cramer advised.

TJX Companies

The parent company of T.J. Maxx Marshalls and HomeGoods will benefit from the excess inventory the holidays will leave behind he said. He added that because TJX operates discount retailers its stock is a winner during times of recession when consumers tend to trade down.

Yum! Brands

Cramer called the parent company of KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut a great value proposition for consumers.

Starbucks

He said he expects Starbucks to make a powerful comeback in China once the company's economy fully reopens.

As much as 2021 might have led you to believe that the stock market only goes up 2022 has served as an abrupt reminder that this path to prosperity isn't a straight line. All three major U.S. stock indexes have plunged into a bear market with growth stocks really taking it on the chin.

But don't tell that to Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) CEO Warren Buffett. When the closing bell rang last week shares of the Oracle of Omaha's company were outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 by 20 percentage points and were higher on the year by 1%.

One of Buffett's keys to outperforming in turbulent environments is to lean on the safety of dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend are almost always profitable and have stood the test of time.

Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is on track to collect more than $6 billion in dividend income. The shocker is that $2.8 billion of this annual dividend income is slated to come from just three stocks.

Chevron: $964107966 in annual dividend income

The leading dividend stock for Berkshire Hathaway is none other than global energy giant Chevron (CVX 0.22%). Chevron is a dividend stock that has increased its base annual payout for 35 consecutive years and is currently doling out $5.68 a share which is good enough for a market-topping yield of almost 3.4%. Including the Chevron shares owned by Buffett's secret portfolio New England Asset Management this position is generating more than $964 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway.

Let's be clear: Buffett and his investment team wouldn't have plowed into energy stocks in 2022 if they didn't strongly believe that energy commodity prices would remain above their historic averages for the coming years. Certain global dynamics do support this thesis although a U.S. recession would likely weigh on near-term oil and gas demand.

The biggest positive for crude oil and natural gas prices has been the underinvestment in drilling exploration and infrastructure by most energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Paring back capital expenditures means it'll be difficult to quickly increase energy commodity supply anytime soon. When coupled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine which has cast doubt on Europe's energy supply needs there's a real likelihood that crude oil and natural gas prices will stick above their historic norms.

Buffett's fascination with Chevron probably also involves its integrated operating model. ""Integrated"" oil and gas companies operate midstream assets such as pipelines and downstream assets like chemical plants and refineries. These midstream and downstream assets help provide predictable cash flow and can be used to hedge against energy commodity price weakness.

Big oil is also known for its hefty capital-return programs. In addition to its juicy dividend Chevron has pledged to repurchase up to $15 billion worth of its common stock this year.

Occidental Petroleum: $901062858 in annual dividend income

Have I mentioned that energy stocks are playing a big role in anchoring Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in 2022 and bolstering its dividend income?

Since the year began the Oracle of Omaha and his team have purchased more than 194 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%). This common stock is providing more than $101 million in annual income. However Berkshire Hathaway also owns $10 billion worth of Occidental Petroleum preferred stock that doles out an 8% yield ($800 million a year). Altogether Buffett is collecting north of $901 million in annual dividend income from Occidental.

As you can probably imagine the catalysts fueling Occidental Petroleum are really similar to Chevron. Years of underinvestment in drilling and infrastructure (for the energy sector when examined as a whole) combined with Russia's actions in Ukraine create a scenario where higher energy prices can significantly boost operating cash flow. But there are some differences between the two companies.

For example even though Occidental is an integrated operator like Chevron more of its annual revenue is tied to its higher-margin drilling operations. If crude oil and natural gas remain elevated Occidental can reap the rewards even more so than Chevron.

But there's a flip side to this benefit. Whereas Chevron has what can arguably be described as the best balance sheet among large oil and gas companies Occidental was sitting on more than $35 billion in net debt less than two years ago. The good news is the company has whittled away $15 billion in net debt and reignited its share repurchase program as oil prices soared. Whether a tidier balance sheet allows for earnings multiple expansion remains to be seen.

Bank of America: $908909765 in annual dividend income

The third high-octane income stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio is Bank of America (BAC 0.44%). Including shares owned by New England Asset Management the more than 1.03 billion shares of BofA held by Berkshire will help Buffett and his team rake in close to $909 million in annual dividend income.

Usually bank stocks perform poorly during bear markets and struggle when U.S. economic growth slows or shifts into reverse. But this time could really be different. Whereas the Federal Reserve often comes to Wall Street's rescue by lowering interest rates to spur lending the nation's central bank is instead raising interest rates at the fastest pace in decades to combat historically high inflation. Even if a recession were to occur in the U.S. the benefit of rapidly rising rates on Bank of America's outstanding variable-rate loans should more than offset loan losses.

Among money-center banks Bank of America is the most interest-sensitive. Not only did its net interest income jump 24% to $13.9 billion during the third quarter but BofA has estimated that a 100-basis-point parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve will produce $4.2 billion in added net interest income over the next 12 months.

Despite its size Bank of America is making headway with its digital transformation as well. More than 70% of its 56 million verified digital users are active customers. As a result 48% of total sales were completed online or via mobile app and 51 million more transactions were completed via digital peer-to-peer app Zelle (167 million) than traditional check (116 million) in the September-ended quarter. Digital transactions cost banks just a fraction of what in-person interactions run.

And to keep with the theme of this list bank stocks like BofA have a storied history of sizable capital-return programs. When the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders Bank of America can often be counted on to return well in excess of $20 billion to its shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYmFua2luZ3JhdGVzLmNvbS9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvc3RvY2tzL3N0b2Nrcy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1ib3VnaHQtc29sZC1oZWxkL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYmFua2luZ3JhdGVzLmNvbS9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvc3RvY2tzL3N0b2Nrcy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1ib3VnaHQtc29sZC1oZWxkL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are the Stocks Warren Buffett Bought and Sold in 2022,"For Berkshire Hathaway chief Warren Buffett the 2022 bear market was one big Black Friday sale — and the Oracle of Omaha went on a shopping spree.

And the three 13-F filings that Berkshire submitted in 2022 show that this was one of the busiest and most consequential years in the company’s history.

Building off a 2015 master plan the Fairfax County Park Authority board approved a scope for the approximately $2 million project at its final 2022 meeting on Dec. 14 the agency announced on Wednesday (Dec. 21).

Staff recommended that the 7.2-acre site at 2445 Idylwood Road get a picnic pavilion an open play area an accessible loop trail a nature-themed playground a “fitness cluster” and vehicle access and parking improvements. The project will also fund invasive species management efforts at the park.

“This is a valuable parcel inside the Beltway that came to us at an exceptional bargain” Ken Quincy the board’s Providence District representative said. “The community has been very energetic and engaged throughout the process of defining the vision for the future. We’re very excited to move this project forward.”

Located just north of I-66 the parcels that make up Ruckstahl Park were previously occupied by a residential farm owned by Dr. Lillian Ruckstahl who gave the land to the Northern Virginia Conservation Trust in her will when she died in 2008.

The park authority acquired the property from the NVCT for $250000 in 2011. The transfer established a conservation easement that prohibits athletic fields among other conditions according to the master plan.

Noting that it’s “increasingly rare” to find land suitable for a public park in Idylwood the master plan envisioned Ruckstahl as a mostly neighborhood-serving park designed to “preserve a sense of the open landscape” and provide “low impact community recreation opportunities.”

The conceptual development plan shows a trail looping around the park with exits onto Dunford Drive and Idylwood Road. Placed to accommodate a potential future widening of Idylwood Road the trail could be connected to nearby Idylwood Park and the Washington & Old Dominion Trail with additional pedestrian and bicycle facilities the plan says.

The proposed vehicular amenities include a new parking lot with up to 20 spaces. Access would be provided off Idylwood Road in the same location as the former residential driveway.

The plan also calls for an existing field to be retained as an open space for recreation and community gatherings an educational nature playground for kids a picnic area or outdoor classroom benches and other furnishings and intepretive signs about the site’s environment or history.

Well before Ruckstahl moved in during the 1950s the land had been part of a plantation called “The Mount” that lasted from the mid-1700s to around 1900 when it was broken up and sold off for smaller farms in the Civil War’s wake according to the FCPA.

The property also became one of the county’s first formally recorded archaeological sites in the 1960s after archaeologists found artifacts dating back to the Archaic Period though the master plan says “little can be gleaned from the records about how the site was used.”

Funded by the county’s 2020 park bond developing Ruckstahl Park could produce $7000 in annual revenue for the park authority while costing $4000 a year to maintain with an estimated lifetime cost of $1 million after 20 years.

The FCPA says permitting will begin in “the first part” of 2023 and construction could start in the first quarter of 2024.

Few can argue the Internet of Things is helping drive the hardware craze and non-OEM components manufacturers like Qualcomm Intel Broadcom and others all want to participate and sell more chips.

Opportunities abound for semiconductor makers to penetrate OEM supply chains where lots of money can be made and so they go to great lengths to get onto OEM approved vendor lists (AVL) – a step in the right direction for then (hopefully) getting onto circuit boards and onto embedded computing modules and inside the fast-growing number of connected devices driving how we work play and live.

Below are six (6) critical steps how a semiconductor company gets their chipset onto an OEM hardware product AVL.

Step 1: Supplier qualification (v component tech/spec qualification)

How this process occurs is related to the size of the OEM. Smaller OEMs usually have a less robust qualification process.

Small OEMs and startups will usually opt for components with the biggest technology advantage and often choose components vendors regardless of supplier track record and financial strength

Larger OEMs will usually have more formal qualifying processes and procedures but these can also creates obstacles and hoops to jump over and through for man component manufactures.

Step 2: Identifying specific requirements

After a components manufacturer becomes qualified the vendor then reaches out to the ‘buyers’ staffed inside the OEM looking for OEM buyers with specific chipset features/functions needs and requirements. These OEM buyers are divided into two camps:

The report notes that Oracle Hospitality OPERA Cloud PMS “sets the bar as an example with all modules within the platform sharing a common data set and end-user experience and are secure scalable and globally available.”

Where hoteliers have previously been hindered by siloed-systems OPERA Cloud provides a simple and intuitive user experience and unified solutions on a single cloud-native platform with modular connected components that “support all the various and vital areas of hotel operations sales and marketing distribution and financials – with a single view of the guest.” The report adds that “Oracle’s strategy around the company’s property management system puts the company in a strong position for the next phase of connected hospitality systems.”

“As property needs become more complex the right PMS is key to ensuring hotel managers and frontline staff have the tools needed to operate more efficiently without detriment to guest service” said Dorothy Creamer research manager hospitality & travel digital transformation strategies for IDC. “Oracle Hospitality’s OPERA Cloud PMS is architected to address the pressing issues hoteliers face on a daily basis while helping to navigate fresh challenges and introduce new business models without technology friction to consistently deliver an elevated guest experience.”

Setting the bar

The IDC MarketScape assessment evaluated current capabilities and strategies of property management system technology vendors their ability to meet customer needs and how well their future strategy with an emphasis on innovation aligns with what customers will require in three to five years.

The report notes that OPERA Cloud is being utilized for hotels of all sizes from single-location to multi-property enterprises and features a “UX/UI that can be customized based on any hotel employee’s needs.” This includes giving properties flexibility with multiple levels of customization at the chain brand property role and even user level to allow process to drive the technology rather than the technology driving the process.

“Being recognized as a Leader in the IDC MarketScape Hospitality PMS report and positioned above all other vendors on our dimension capabilities and strategy reaffirms our investment

in and continued dedication to the global hospitality market” said Alex Alt senior vice president and general manager Oracle Hospitality. “The PMS has always played a key role as the heart of a hotels’ operations and has only grown in importance as guests return to travel with different expectations. Oracle Hospitality is committed to providing technology that helps hoteliers adapt to the changing needs of the industry and deliver exceptional guest and staff experiences.”

OPERA Cloud’s integration capabilities and global network of technology partners were specifically recognized by customers as a strength of the platform. The report adds that “Oracle’s API-first strategy allows customization and extensions of products to allow customers — even those with multi-PMS strategies — to tailor workflows rapidly innovate and differentiate themselves in the marketplace.”

AWS’ recent win of a five-year enterprise software license contract which was awarded by the United States Navy remains noteworthy. This highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS' innovative cloud products and services.



Notably the contract will provide the U.S. Navy access to AWS’ commercial cloud environment and professional services. It will also be able to avail AWS training and certification courses.



This $723.9 million deal comes right after the Pentagon’s recent declaration of Amazon Alphabet GOOGL Microsoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL as the winners of the multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract for the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability.

Portfolio Strength – Key Catalyst

AWS’s growing efforts toward expanding its portfolio offerings are likely to continue adding strength to its customer base.



Recently AWS introduced a new data management service namely Amazon DataZone which eases the data management process and enables data producers to govern data access seamlessly.



Further the company bolstered its ML strength by introducing eight new capabilities for Amazon SageMaker namely Role Manager Model Cards Model Dashboard new data preparation collaboration across data science teams automated model validation geospatial capabilities and Automatic conversion of notebook code into production-ready jobs.



The company announced a new service called Amazon Security Lake which is a purpose-built security data lake. It automatically centralizes an organization’s security data from cloud and on-premises sources into a purpose-built data lake.



It also announced a fully managed compute service namely AWS SimSpace Weaver that enables customers to deploy spatial simulations to model dynamic systems with many data points.



Further it announced a new cloud application called AWS Supply Chain which provides improved supply chain visibility to businesses.



Additionally it introduced a new analytics service called AWS Clean Rooms that helps customers analyze and collaborate on collective datasets without revealing underlying data.

Bottom Line

We believe that portfolio strength will continue to drive AWS’ customer momentum which in turn will aid Amazon in sustaining its cloud dominance. This will instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.



Notably Amazon has lost 43.6% on a year-to-date basis.



Recently AWS was selected by Yahoo as the preferred public cloud provider for the latter’s advertising technology business Yahoo Ad Tech.



Further it was picked by Brookfield Asset Management as the preferred cloud provider. Also Stability AI selected AWS as the preferred cloud provider. With the aid of AWS’s robust portfolio of cloud technologies and global infrastructure Stability AI strives to build and scale its AI models.



We believe that the expanding customer base will continue to drive AWS’s top-line growth. In third-quarter 2022 AWS generated revenues of $20.5 billion (16% of total sales) which grew 27% year over year.



Further expanding its portfolio and customer base will likely continue to aid Amazon currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in gaining a competitive edge against its peers Microsoft Alphabet’s Google and Oracle which are also making strong efforts to strengthen cloud footprint.



You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.



According to the Canalys report AWS accounted for 32% of global cloud spending in third-quarter 2022 maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.



Microsoft’s Azure which is currently riding on the robust adoption of its cloud offerings increasing number of global availability zones and regions and strength in its consumption-based business was marked as the second-largest cloud-service provider as it accounted for 22% of worldwide cloud spending.



Alphabet’s Google Cloud which is strongly gaining from a solid portfolio expanding data centers availability zones and cloud regions represented 9% of cloud spending making it the third-largest cloud provider.



Meanwhile Oracle continues to benefit from the solid momentum across its cloud business driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management remains a positive.

That’s a bad sign for the economy,"Bloomberg

Mills that churn out cardboard are slashing production worldwide a worrying sign that global trade is slowing down.North American companies that make the raw material for corrugated boxes shut down nearly 1 million tons of capacity in the third quarter and a similar scenario is expected for the fourth quarter Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ryan Fox said. Prices are falling for the first time since 2020.“Severe weakness in global box demand is an indication of how weak many parts of the global economy are” said KeyBanc analyst Adam Josephson . “The recent history shows a significant amount of economic stimulus would be necessary to provide meaningful box demand and we do not see that coming.”Investors are watching closely for any harbingers of what is to come as fears mount that many of the world’s biggest economies will tip into recession next year. Paper boxes are present at nearly every step of a good’s journey through the supply chain  which makes paper a key indicator of how economies are faring. The signals are not encouraging.Global demand for packaging paper is showing weakness for the first time since 2020 when economies reignited following the first hit of the Covid-19 pandemic. US prices fell in November for the first time in two years and the US the world’s biggest exporter reported 21% lower volumes sent overseas in October versus the previous year.WestRock and Packaging Corp. have announced mill closures or idled machines. Klabin  Brazil’s biggest packaging-paper exporter is considering cutting its exports by as many as 200000 metric tons next year Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Teixeira said. That’s almost half the amount exported in the twelve months ended September.Much of the fall off in demand is attributed to the shrinking effect inflation has on consumer wallets. Companies that produce everything from consumer staples to apparel are bracing for a pullback. Procter & Gamble Co. has raised prices for products from Pampers diapers to Tide laundry detergent several times to offset higher expenses fueling the company’s first quarterly decline in unit sales since 2016 earlier this year.US retailers discounted heavily on Black Friday in hopes of clearing out excess inventory but shoppers responded with only modest traffic and sales fell in November by the most in almost a year. Moreover the meteoric growth of e-commerce — an avid user of cardboard boxes — has receded.Sluggish demand is also hitting pulp the raw material for paper. Top global exporter Suzano recently announced a price cut for its eucalyptus pulp in China the first decline since late 2021. European demand is decreasing and a long-awaited recovery in China hasn’t materialised yet said Gabriel Fernandez Azzato a director at consultancy firm TTOBMA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy8yNTc5MTg1LzAvZW4vQWx1bWluaXVtLUZvaWwtUGFja2FnaW5nLU1hcmtldC13aWxsLXdvcnRoLVVTRC01Mi05Ni1iaWxsaW9uLWJ5LTIwMjktaXQtd2lsbC1ncm93LWF0LWEtQ0FHUi1vZi00LTQtdGlsbC0yMDI5LUdyZXlWaWV3cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aluminium Foil Packaging Market will worth USD 52.96 billion by 2029 it will grow at a CAGR of 4.4% till 2029 ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiwQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy8yNTc5MTg1LzAvZW4vQWx1bWluaXVtLUZvaWwtUGFja2FnaW5nLU1hcmtldC13aWxsLXdvcnRoLVVTRC01Mi05Ni1iaWxsaW9uLWJ5LTIwMjktaXQtd2lsbC1ncm93LWF0LWEtQ0FHUi1vZi00LTQtdGlsbC0yMDI5LUdyZXlWaWV3cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224E234C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The attackers used the incursion into the clerk’s system to steal files and system credentials install cryptocurrency mining software malware and remote tools and create new users with administrative access. By August they had gained “lateral access” to other county networks from the clerk’s system including the county’s main computer environment as well as the health department and sheriff’s department. They then used that access to install malware and other malicious tools and steal sensitive data stored on county servers.

This activity continued through Sept. 8 when the attackers encrypted files — rendering them inaccessible to county staff — and demanded ransom of $2.5 million. The county refused to pay the ransom officials said.

The attackers a professional hacking group that calls itself BlackCat and ALPHV posted some stolen personal information on the dark web. They claimed to have encrypted more than 4 terabytes of data from county computer systems and those of government contractors.

The Sept. 8 ransom demand set the county scrambling to shut down servers and systems in a too-late attempt to stop an attack that had already been going on for months. The county’s response disabled county email systems and internet access forcing government operations to fall back on methods and procedures used before digital era.

Though some systems and operations have been restored in the nearly four months that followed the discovery of the attack others remain offline including the county’s main public-facing websites.

On Wednesday Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone released a memorandum by the incident response contractor investigating the attack Unit 42 by Palo Alto Networks. The document provides a timeline and summary of “key events” in the incident as determined by the investigation.

Hackers exploited a vulnerability in a popular software product

Investigators found that on Dec. 19 and Dec. 20 2021 the attackers exploited a known vulnerability in Log4j2 a popular software library used for logging error messages. The vulnerability enables a remote attacker to gain control over a string of code and trick an application into executing malicious code under the attacker’s control. This allows attackers to remotely take over any internet-connected service that uses certain versions of the library.

The vulnerability is a very serious threat because it affects Java a ubiquitous software used in most digital environments — everything from video games and smart TVs to Google Amazon and Microsoft cloud storage. The vulnerability was discovered Dec. 9 2021 and software vendors very quickly began publishing security fixes. But the sheer volume of vulnerable systems meant tens of thousands of publicly accessible systems remained at risk even months after the discovery. And malicious actors took advantage of it launching millions of attempted exploits according to security researchers.

The cybercriminals that exploited the vulnerability to attack the county’s systems installed cryptocurrency mining software on multiple county clerk servers in January investigators learned. They continued to use cryptocurrency miners in January and February the report states.

There is no known connection between this incident and another cryptocurrency mining operation allegedly run on county servers from February to August 2021 by an assistant manager of information technology operations in the county clerk’s office according to Chief Deputy County Executive Lisa Black. The employee Christopher Naples of Mattituck was charged in September 2021 with grand larceny computer trespass and official misconduct. The case is still pending in Southampton Town Justice Court.

Digital forensic investigators find serious security lapses in clerk’s network

In March the hackers installed remote monitoring and management tools and began harvesting user credentials on the county clerk’s systems. In April they created a user named “John” and added it to the administrators group on the county clerk’s servers. This behavior continued with new users given administrator access allowing the hackers to poke around the clerk’s network undetected looking for sensitive data to steal and other systems that could be accessed according to investigators.

Among the stolen files were credential files — text files with names like “SvcAccounts.txt” and “TMpasswords.txt” — that were stored in a folder named “IronKey.” Iron Key is the brand name of an encrypted USB portable storage device used by governments to securely store password credentials and sensitive information. The encrypted portable storage device is supposed to be taken off premises for security reasons Black said in an interview yesterday.

“Why do you keep a folder on your server called ‘IronKey?’ And it gets better — when you open up that folder there’s a file that says ‘passwords’” Black said. “I don’t know why you’d put that in a text file that’s not encrypted or secured in any way. Storing it on your network is wild to me” she said.

“In three hours they had control of the clerk’s network” said Deputy County Executive Peter Scully who also sat in on yesterday’s interview with RiverheadLOCAL.

The digital forensic investigation determined that the “SvcAccounts.txt” file was deleted from the clerk’s server on Sept. 29 Black said.

The investigation has been complicated by a lack of cooperation from the internal IT department at the county clerk’s office according to Black. The clerk’s office has its own internal IT department separate from the county’s main IT department and the clerk’s office has not been allowing investigators from the county’s main IT department to access the clerk’s systems to investigate Black said.

Investigators have therefore been unable to determine if files containing sensitive information remain in existing backups on the clerk’s servers because the clerk’s office has prevented the county’s main IT staff and even the digital forensic incident response team from accessing the clerk’s systems Black said.

“We do know that every other domain in the county has been deemed validated and clean” Black said.

Without access to the clerk’s systems the digital forensic incident response team said there was nothing else it could do.

“They said ‘Look if we don’t get in there we have to we’re gonna have to close out.’ We said ‘You can’t do that. If there’s something still out there. We’re responsible for it and we have a moral obligation to our residents to to provide the information.’ The investigators need to get in there and do the work they’ve been able to do countywide thus far” Black said.

That prompted the county executive to reassign the clerk’s IT staff to the main county department of information technology Black said. In addition the clerk’s information technology director has been put on paid administrative leave a move that was announced by the county executive Wednesday.

County Clerk Judith Pascale who is leaving office Dec. 31 did not return a phone call yesterday seeking comment for this story.

County lacks central control over IT security systems

To this point there has not been one central protocol or central control over information technology and security in departments run by independently elected officials such as the county clerk and comptroller.

The county legislature has supported the administration’s request for a Central Information Security Officer Black said so there will be one central team monitoring security for all county domains.

“Anything that’s a dot-gov domain should be governed by CISA standards” Black said referring to the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. “For example if there is a patch that comes out if there’s a vulnerability on any one software the federal government requires you to patch it in two weeks. If you do not patch it within two weeks you lose your domain. That’s it” Black said. “We just don’t have that level of governance” at the county level.

Tip about potential malware from court officer to DA’s office in June mishandled by clerk’s IT director officials say

On June 21 the DA’s office received a tip about “potential malware” and referred it to the county’s IT security officer according to Scully.

“The DA’s office had gotten a call from a court officer who got a call from a retired detective who got a call from an FBI agent” Scully said. “The county’s IT security officer immediately contacted the FBI agent and the court officer and was able to determine based on that conversation that the activity that was being referenced was not in the county system but was in fact in the clerk’s office — between the clerk’s office and the court system.” The clerk’s office files judgments and other documents filed by county and state courts in Suffolk.

“And because the clerk’s office has insisted that our central IT not have the ability to monitor their system the only recourse they had was to reach out to the clerk’s office and ask if there was anything to it” Scully said.

The clerk’s IT director responded on June 22 saying there was “nothing going on on our side” Scully said.

Six hours later the same official sent out an email to his clerk’s office staff saying effective July 1 virtual clients would not be able to use the system remotely because of a significant security flaw Scully said.

No county central IT security staff was copied on that email Scully said.

“When the county’s central IT security learned of the email they reached out to the county clerk’s office and said ‘What can you tell us about the significant security flaw’ they got no response” Scully said.

Since that was a full two months before the hackers moved into the county’s central systems the county had an opportunity to prevent the expanded hack officials believe.

“It’s entirely possible we could have arrested the problem before they got into the other systems but we’ll never know because the information wasn’t shared on June 21 and 22” Scully said.

Bellone on Wednesday also released the emails Scully referred to in the interview.

Digital forensic investigation to continue now with access to clerk’s network

The digital forensic investigation needs to continue because “there are still some outstanding items that they know to have been taken that we know exist in the clerk’s office that we just haven’t been able to find” Black said. “And it’s incumbent upon us to be able to investigate what that is and determine whether or not it had PII (personally identifiable information) on it” Black said. To do that requires access she said.

“It’s not only read-only access. We need to go in there and do some assessments ourselves so that we can bring the digital forensics team back in and then they can get started. Not to mention the restoration. There’s quite a bit of restoration that still exists in the clerk’s network that we need to pursue” she said.

“The next step is to really dig down and see what of their systems was accessed and what did they take from it what was exfiltrated what was put on the dark web. And if we can’t find something we know or believe was there was it deleted” Black said.

The county executive announced on Nov. 24 that the personal data of individuals who were issued nearly half a million moving violations in the Suffolk County Police District during the past decade may have been accessed by hackers. Earlier this month Bellone announced the Social Security numbers of 26000 county employees and retirees were exposed in the attack.

County officials do not believe town systems that interact with the clerk and other county systems were affected by the hack.

“I don’t think you can ever say no unequivocally” Black said. “It depends on what kind of systems that they’re operating too… We have to figure out how the municipal systems are speaking to the clerk’s office” she said. “We don’t have enough of an understanding of the operation of the clerk’s office at this stage to make a comment on that right now.”

Black said the administration has been making a push to centralize IT security. But only 80 out of the 180 IT titles in county government today are in the county’s central IT office.

Time frame for full restoration still uncertain

County officials still aren’t sure when its websites will be up and running again.

“We want to want to make sure we do the website when we have every domain clean” Black said. “So it really depends on what they would they find over the next few days and give us an estimate on either restoration rebuild” she said. It’s going to take some time to assess before they can get starring on a restoration plan according to Black.

“Optimistically by the end of January” Black said but she acknowledged she still can’t say for sure.

The FBI is separately investigating the attack county officials said. They have briefed county officials but really haven’t shared a lot of detail.

Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said in a statement Wednesday evening his office continues to cooperate with the FBI and Suffolk County Police regarding the ongoing criminal investigation. He said no criminal prosecutions were compromised in the attack because his office had “additional internet technology defenses in place.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzb29ubGluZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS81NzE4NTEvdG9wLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktbWFuZGEtZGVhbHMtZm9yLTIwMjIuaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzb29ubGluZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS81NzE4NTEvdG9wLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktbWFuZGEtZGVhbHMtZm9yLTIwMjIuaHRtbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top cybersecurity M&A deals for 2022,"Investment firm Thoma Bravo to acquire identity security firm Sailpoint for $6.9 billion

The Challenge Global Tournament has officially completed filming after seven weeks on location in Cape Town South Africa. Details are starting to emerge about this iteration of the series — including who will be competing for the $500K prize and how they are pairing up. It’s also been leaked that TJ Lavin will not be the only host.

‘The Challenge Global Tournament’ will feature ‘legends’ and ‘MVPs’

According to spoilers on Vevmo the cast of The Challenge Global Tournament will reportedly be loaded with some of the reality competition series’ biggest names — both from the MTV flagship series and the spinoffs from America and around the globe.

The competitors from the MTV version will be the “legends” while the players from the spinoffs will be the “MVPs.” The teams at the beginning of the season will consist of one legend paired up with one MVP.

The “legends” who are reportedly competing include Amber Borzotra Darrell Taylor Jodi Weatherton Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio Jonna Mannion Jordan Wiseley Kaycee Clark Kellyanne Judd Nelson Thomas Nia Moore Theo Campbell Tori Deal Wes Bergmann and Yes Duffy.

The “MVPs” are Ben Driebergen Danny McCray Justine Ndiba and Sarah Lacina from The Challenge: USA. Benjamin Alfonso Claudia Albertario Rodrigo Cascon and Sofia Jujuy Jimenez from The Challenge: Argentina. Kiki Morris Emily Seebohm Grant Crapp and Troy Cullen from The Challenge : Australia. And Kaz Crossley Nathan Henry Tristan Phipps and Zara Zoffany from The Challenge UK.

TJ Lavin will not be the only host of ‘The Challenge Global Tournament’

TJ Lavin will be hosting this new tournament featuring competitors from America and around the globe but he will have some help along the way. Mark Wright from The Challenge: UK Brihony Dawson from The Challenge: Australia and Marley from The Challenge: Argentina will also be involved in some capacity.

Wright is a former reality star who became famous in the United Kingdom when he appeared on The Only Way is Essex Strictly Come Dancing and I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!. He’s also hosted Extra TV in the United States and currently works as a radio DJ.

“Mark really impressed the producers on The Challenge and they signed him up immediately. It is a big deal as it is the first time the show is being made with UK stars” an insider told The Sun.

“It is a role that was made for Mark because he loves fitness and is competitive. He got really stuck in during filming and if a second series is commissioned the production wants Mark on board again.”

Who are Brihony Dawson and Marley?

The Challenge just made its way to Australia this past year and they hired singer Brihony Dawson to be the host of the “down under” version of the reality competition series.

”I hadn’t actually seen the show before” Dawson admitted per Now To Love. ”When I was approached to host and finally watched it the smile on my face just kept growing bigger and bigger. I was like this is amazing!”

The host of The Challenge: Argentina is Alejandro Wiebe a well-known Argentine TV presenter and game show host who goes by the name Marley. He just hosted the first season of The Challenge: Argentina this past summer before participating in The Challenge Global Tournament.

The Challenge Global Tournament will be exclusively on Paramount+.

More than six million album-equivalent copies of her most recent album ""Midnights"" are said to have been sold globally with three million of those sales occurring in the US.

According to NME the ""Lavender Haze"" singer sold that many units in 60 days shattering the previous record for music sales.

Additionally Taylor's most recent album had the distinction of being the first since 2015 to sell over a million physical copies.

The ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"" singer now holds the record for being the only performer to have five albums that sold more than a million copies in their first week of release.

The 33-year-old Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter is a ""multidimensional creative powerhouse whose achievements position her among the most successful performers in the history of music"" according to a statement published by Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge.

We are happy and privileged to collaborate with her over such a wide range of her career he exclaimed.

The ""Anti-Hero"" singer also rejoiced over her nomination for ""Carolina"" from the film ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" for Outstanding Song from A Drama or Documentary from the Society of Composers and Lyricists Awards.

She will be competing against fellow musicians Lady Gaga's ""Hold My Hand"" and Rihanna's ""Lift Me Up"" from the film ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.""

Her song is now on an unofficial shortlist for the Academy Award.

She received a lot of praise for her short film ""All Too Well"" which went on to become 2021's most significant moment in pop culture and win an MTV Video Music Award and an American Music Award. Unfortunately though it was not nominated for an Academy Award in the ""Best Live Action Short Film"" category in 2023.

Because the little video had previously generated some Oscar buzz fans were disappointed.

However because ""Carolina"" is also up for Best Original Song Taylor Swift hasn't been totally disqualified from consideration.

Following the announcement of the Oscar nominations one Taylor fan expressed their dissatisfaction on Twitter writing ""You can ignore her all you want. I am aware that Taylor can accomplish everything she sets her mind to. Sooner or later she'll take home the Oscar. You have my word.

Some of Taylor's followers were reportedly devastated by the news since they knew how proud she was of ""All Too Well: The Short Film.""

Beginning in March Taylor Swift will perform 52 concerts in stadiums across North America as part of her ""The Eras"" tour.

Expect This Tax Form if You're Paid Through PayPal Cash App or Venmo,"It's time to start thinking about tax season especially if you have a complicated return or earn income through a side hustle. And if your freelance gig paid you via Venmo CashApp or PayPal this year you'll get a tax form reporting those earnings.

Robert Rodriguez/CNET

Starting this year third-party payment platforms are required to deliver a 1099-K to all users who made more than $600 in freelance or business income in 2022 according to a tax reporting rule from the IRS. That's a dramatic change in income threshold. Previously digital payment platforms were only required to send a 1099-K if you had over 200 business transactions totaling more than $20000 in earned income for the year.

Today the average side hustle pulls in $12589 annually and many Americans get started with a business idea through these freelance gigs and odd jobs. Even if you never form an official business the IRS still classifies you as a business for reporting purposes.

This means freelancers and side hustlers will need to be extra vigilant about compliance according to Wendy Walker a member of the Internal Revenue Service Advisory Council and solutions principal with Sovos an enterprise tax compliance consultancy. The IRS received nearly $80 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act mainly for tax enforcement -- that is identifying and collecting unpaid taxes and ""closing the tax gap"" said Walker.

Keep in mind that the digital payment platforms are reporting transactions to the IRS in their own filings so a red flag will go up if the income is unreported on your end. ""Unless your neighbors are handing you cash for cutting their lawn the IRS is going to know because the activity is reported on official reports from Venmo and CashApp themselves"" said Krystal Pino certified public accountant and founder of Nomad Tax a tax consultancy for digital nomads. If any business activity is happening the tax agency is aware of it.

Here's what to know about the 1099-K how to report your Venmo CashApp or PayPal earnings and how to avoid tax mistakes getting audited or hefty penalties.

What to know about the 1099-K form

The 1099-K is one of many types of 1099 tax forms that are used to report nonemployment income. It's a specific reporting document for anyone who uses a peer-to-peer or P2P payment platform -- such as PayPal Venmo or CashApp -- to receive payments for goods or services and is sent by the platforms themselves according to Kathy Pickering chief tax officer at H&R Block.

Some other types of 1099 forms you might be familiar with are:

1099-INT : Documents interest income such as interest earned from a high-yield savings account.

: Documents interest income such as interest earned from a high-yield savings account. 1099-NEC : Documents earned income you made as an independent contractor via cash check or direct deposit.

: Documents earned income you made as an independent contractor via cash check or direct deposit. 1099-MISC : Documents miscellaneous income such as rent from a rental property or prize money.

: Documents miscellaneous income such as rent from a rental property or prize money. 1099-R: Documents income that came from an IRA distribution or a pension.

A 1099-K form can be a bit tricky for anyone who has never reported nonemployee income before according to Walker. Because the 1099-K reports only gross amounts and not net transactions you might see discrepancies between what the 1099-K says you made and your actual take-home income. The earnings reported on the form do not factor in business expenses such as payment processing fees or equipment which you may be able to itemize as deductions to lower your overall tax burden.

""You shouldn't technically take the amount on the K and put it on your tax return despite the fact that 90% of taxpayers do that"" said Walker.

For example if you're paid by a vendor that charges a processing fee you could receive a smaller payment than the total you billed for say $500. If the platform charges a 2.70% processing fee you would only receive $486.50. Your 1099-K could reflect the full $500 which you would report but you should be able to deduct platform processing expenses.

Get organized to simplify your self-employment tax return

In recent years online platforms like Venmo CashApp and Paypal have emerged as an easy way to exchange money for services facilitating the point-of-sale process for side hustlers and business owners alike. (Note: Venmo is owned by Paypal and CashApp is owned by Block Inc. the company formerly known as Square.)

The platforms have added features to help users distinguish between business and personal transactions. You'll want to familiarize yourself with these tools if you plan to use an app for both business and personal payments throughout the year. According to a PayPal spokesperson both PayPal and Venmo payments between two consumer accounts default as a Friends and Family transaction ensuring they are not taxable or reportable to the IRS.

It's also a good idea to log your transactions in some way -- whether that's a Google sheet free accounting software or through QuickBooks which lets you integrate PayPal and Venmo -- so you have your own records according to Pino. ""The sooner you can get organized the more helpful for yourself it's going to be when it comes tax time"" she said.

The same goes for tracking business expenses that you'll need to deduct according to Jessica Shults a New York-based hair stylist of over 20 years and owner of Twisted Scissors Salon. Prior to opening a brick-and-mortar location Shults used Venmo as her payment processor and maintains her account for out-of-salon bookings such as weddings. Rather than trying to compile everything later Shults keeps a record of everything she purchases that is related to her business transactions.

How to report taxes on earnings from Venmo Paypal and CashApp

To recap you'll receive a 1099-K from Venmo PayPal CashApp or other payment processing apps if you conducted more than $600 in business activity in 2022. All 1099s are required by law to be distributed to recipients no later than Jan. 31.

Your freelance side hustle or independent contractor income is subject to self-employment taxes which means you'll likely have a higher tax bill. You'll be classified as a sole proprietorship the simplest business formation and you'll report your business earnings by attaching a Schedule C form which documents both your income and expenses from all your business-related activities for the year. Your 1099-K earnings should be reported on the Schedule C which then gets added to your personal tax return before you file.

How to avoid penalties when reporting 1099-K earnings

Remember that the platform is reporting your activity to the IRS so if your business earnings are significantly different from what the platform reported you're more likely to get audited. You could also end up paying penalties if your information is reported incorrectly or if you underpay your taxes.

If you haven't been separating or categorizing your third-party transactions as you go along you might find some personal transfers as part of your 1099-K. If you spot personal payments on your 1099-K like money sent by a friend to cover their portion of the dinner bill the IRS recommends reaching out to the payment processor to report the issue and request a corrected 1099-K. You can find the processor's contact information in the top upper left-hand field of your 1099-K. If you do not receive a correct 1099-K in time you can attach an explanation of the error along with your tax return.

Second anyone with a side hustle or self-employment income should pay estimated quarterly taxes as they earn income throughout the year. If you did not make estimated tax payments in 2022 (or if you underpaid) you could get hit with an IRS penalty. Making payments in 2023 can help you avoid this penalty in the future. (Note: they're due on April 18 June 15 and Sept. 15 in 2023 and Jan. 15 2024.)

To ensure your self-employment taxes and payments are squeaky clean it may be time to start working with a tax professional particularly if you plan to maintain a side hustle or small business in future years. An accountant or other tax professional can help you stay tax-compliant while making sure you take advantage of any relevant deductions and credits to lower your tax bill. By taking proactive steps now you'll be in a better position for tax season.

Correction 9:56 a.m. PT: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated how much the IRS received from the Inflation Reduction Act.

The agency on Friday said that such third-party platforms won't have to use that threshold for when they report 2022 tax-year transactions on a Form 1099-K which goes to both the IRS and taxpayer. Instead they can rely on pre-2022 threshold of more than 200 transactions worth an aggregate above $20000.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 dropped the threshold to just $600. And even a single transaction can trigger a form.

""To help smooth the transition and ensure clarity for taxpayers tax professionals and industry the IRS will delay implementation of the 1099-K changes"" Doug O'Donnell acting IRS commissioner said in a statement.

""The additional time will help reduce confusion during the upcoming 2023 tax filing season and provide more time for taxpayers to prepare and understand the new reporting requirements.""

The agency said it will issue additional details on the delay as well as guidance for taxpayers who may have already received a 1099-K as a result of the American Rescue Plan changes.

Even without the new reporting requirement in place income from business transactions through such platforms is still taxable which means sellers must report it. The delay only means business activity won't generate a 2022 tax form at that low threshold.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tb25leS9pcnMtZGVsYXlzLW5ldy10YXgtcmVwb3J0aW5nLXJ1bGUtdmVubW8tcGF5cGFsLXBheW1lbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IRS delays new tax-reporting rule on Venmo PayPal payments over $600,"The Internal Revenue Service on Friday said that it is delaying by one year a new tax reporting requirement targeting Americans who made more than $600 online through third-party payment apps like Venmo or PayPal.

""The IRS and Treasury heard a number of concerns regarding the timeline of implementation of these changes under the American Rescue Plan"" said Doug O'Donnell the acting IRS commissioner. ""To help smooth the transition and ensure clarity for taxpayers tax professionals and industry the IRS will delay implementation of the 1099-K changes.""

The delay comes after fierce backlash from Republican lawmakers small business owners and tax professionals to the lower reporting requirement.

The rule change – approved by Democrats in March 2021 with the passage of the American Rescue Plan – would have required payments platforms including Venmo PayPal Etsy and Airbnb to send Form 1099-K to the IRS and users if their transactions totaled more than $600 over the course of the year. Previously the payment apps were required to send users Form 1099-K if their gross income exceeded $20000 or they had 200 separate transactions within a calendar year.

STILL MISSING YOUR TAX REFUND? THE IRS WILL SOON PAY YOU 7% INTEREST

""The additional time will help reduce confusion during the upcoming 2023 tax filing season and provide more time for taxpayers to prepare and understand the new reporting requirements"" O'Donnell said.

The change was intended to crack down on Americans evading taxes by not reporting the full extent of their gross income. However critics say that it amounts to government overreach at its worst and that it could ultimately hurt small businesses. In recent weeks lawmakers rushed to try to increase the reporting threshold to $10000 in order to reduce the scope of the new rule; however they ultimately failed to add it to the $1.7 trillion government funding package.

The Treasury Department has faced pressure to delay the implementation of the rule including from industry group the National Association of Tax Professionals amid concerns that it could cause severe confusion for taxpayers and further bog down the IRS.

In a memo this week the NATP slammed the rule as ""overly burdensome"" and warned that it could create ""undue issues for taxpayers"" as well as the already overwhelmed IRS which is still wading its way through a backlog of unprocessed tax returns from previous years.

To be clear business owners are already required to report that income to the IRS. The new rule simply means that the IRS will figure out what business owners earned on the cash apps regardless of what that individual actually reports on their 1099-K because it broadens the scope of the threshold.

IRS SAYS YOUR TAX REFUND COULD BE SMALLER IN 2023 – HERE'S WHY

Form 1099-K is used to report goods and services payments received by a business or individual in the calendar year but there are certain exclusions from gross income that are not subject to income tax including amounts from selling personal items at a loss amounts sent as reimbursements and amounts sent as gifts.

""This transitional guidance applies only to information returns filed or furnished by brokers"" the IRS said. ""In contrast taxpayers are still required to report any income they receive from transactions involving digital assets.""

Holiday Plans Canceled – More Than a Million and a Half Without Power

The hardest hit thus far has been the Northeast and South. As of Friday morning 152915 were without power in Virginia 201243 in North Carolina and 182637 in Tennessee. The entire country is watching Texas one of the largest pool markets in the nation. The deep freeze encountered in 2021 caused many to lose power which led to catastrophic damage in pools. Currently 73324 consumers in Texas are without power.

A powerful Arctic front continues to spread through the eastern third of the nation. Consequently the National Weather Service has issued a travel advisory. As the nation prepares for a hard freeze roughly 60% of the country is under some sort of weather advisory.

Hard Freeze Has Pool Owners Scrambling

The news of a hard freeze over the holidays has had many homeowners scrambling to prepare their pools. According to the National Weather Service a hard freeze occurs when temperatures remain at or below 28 degrees for an extended period of time. On both Saturday and Sunday mornings temperatures in the teens and twenties are expected in many areas of the country.

How a Hard Freeze Can Damage Swimming Pools

When the water in a pool or its equipment freezes it can cause significant damage. The expansion of water as it freezes can put a lot of pressure on the various components of the pool. Freezing temperatures can also damage equipment such as pipes filters and pumps. This pressure can cause these components to crack or break which can be costly to repair.

One of the most common problems that occurs when a pool freezes is damage to the pool’s plumbing. The pipes that carry water to and from the pool’s pump and filter system are particularly vulnerable to freezing. If these pipes freeze and then thaw they can become damaged or burst which can lead to serious water damage.

Another potential problem is damage to the pool’s filter system. The filter is responsible for removing contaminants and debris from the water. If it becomes damaged it can be difficult to get the pool clean and clear.

Freezing temperatures can also damage the pool’s pump. The pump is responsible for circulating water through the pool and its equipment. If the pump is damaged it can be difficult to keep the water moving and maintain proper circulation.

In addition to these problems freezing temperatures can also cause the pool’s liner to become damaged or even rupture. This can be a costly repair. The liner is a crucial component of the pool and is responsible for holding the water in place.

Power Outages Can Cause Serious Damage To Pools

Power outages can have significant impacts on pool owners during a freeze. They can disrupt the functioning of pool heaters and filtration systems. In addition power outages may prevent pool owners from being able to use electricity. Without power it becomes difficult to prevent their pools from freezing.

There are a few practical steps one can take to help prevent or reduce the risk of freeze damage to pool equipment. Manufacturer Hayward has been sharing the following advice to pool owners.

Pool Freeze Protection Advice

Content originally posted in: Pool Protection Tips For Freezing Weather

Run Your Pump When Below Freezing

During deep freeze conditions it will be imperative that all pumps run while temperatures are below freezing. If you have a controller it should automatically take over and turn on the pump(s) and rotate between the pool and spa mode on its own. If you do not have a controller you will need to manage this process on your own.

Cold Weather And Power is On

If you do have power to your home and are not being affected by power outages keep your pool equipment operating at all times (24/7) until temperatures increase above freezing.

If your power is out or your home is being affected by power outages keep reading below or contact your local pool professional for assistance:

Cold Weather But Lost Power

If your power is out and the temperatures are below freezing:

Turn off all pool equipment breakers. Even if your power is off you must still turn off all breakers that supply power to your swimming pool equipment.

Open the air relief on your filter and remove the drain plug on the bottom of the filter.

Open the inline chlorinator and let it drain down.

Turn off auto-fill and make sure the feed line is wrapped.

Open the salt cell to remove any water inside the pipe.

Remove the lids of check valves to keep them from cracking.

Unplug and remove your salt chlorine generator cells from the system if you’re able if not open the salt cell to remove any water inside the pipe

Wait for Ice to Melt Naturally

If ice has formed on your equipment don’t turn the power back on. Wait for any ice that has formed to melt naturally. This will help prevent damage to the equipment once power is restored.

Reinstall Removed Items

Once the ice has melted re-install the drains and salt chlorine generator cells. Turn on the power to your pool equipment.

Pool Industry Prepares For Hard Freeze

Is the hard freeze here? It certainly looks that way. Professionals in the pool industry have already been taking steps to prepare for the deep freeze by winterizing pools and ensuring that equipment and pipes are protected from cold temperatures.

Pool builder Luke Norris tests a frozen water feature.

Again the attention is on Texas which has a tendency to fall victim to sudden freezing temperatures but does not historically winterize its inground pools. During Uri a sustained freeze accompanied by mass power outages was responsible for much of the damage we saw in 2021. Pool professionals are eager to avoid a similar reoccurrence.

In the event that a pool does freeze it is important to handle the situation carefully to avoid damaging the equipment or the pool structure. If the water in the pool has frozen it is generally best to wait for it to thaw naturally rather than trying to force it to melt. If you notice damage to pipes or cracked pool equipment or any structural damage to the pool the best advice is to contact a pool contractor immediately.

And the condition is getting worse! Water level dropping in pool pipe is frozen to add water to the pool and filter is… Posted by Joanne Pisano Di Bella on Friday December 23 2022

It is not uncommon for pool equipment and pipes to be damaged during a deep freeze and many have already begun posting photos on social media to show the extent of the damage and to help educate others about the importance of winterizing their pools. If you own a pool it is important to take steps to protect it from the cold weather to prevent damage and ensure that it is ready for use when the weather warms up.

PepsiCo partner and Pepsi-Cola portfolio bottler Simonds Farsons Cisk has rolled out a new refillable single-serve bespoke glass bottle for flagship brands including Pepsi-Cola and Pepsi Max 7up and 7up Free and Mirinda.

This introduction the first redesign since 1996 comes shortly after the new bottle’s global debut.

According to the Malta-based firm the bottle’s strong swirl and elevated profile will be appealing to younger consumers and the twisted bottom of the bottle will offer a visible and tactile brand experience.

This new glass bottle style will complement a related new PET 1.5 and 0.5-litre bottle design that was introduced in the local market last year Simonds Farsons said.

Simonds Farsons Sales & Marketing head Susan Weenink Camilleri said: “The PepsiCo portfolio in Malta has gone from strength to strength over the years and we are confident that the latest investment in this striking and bold new glass bottle will serve to further enhance our clients’ and consumers’ overall brand experience.

“We are also proud to endorse and participate in PepsiCo’s recently announced global goals regarding Sustainable Packaging Vision.”

Earlier this month PepsiCo announced a new plan to double the percentage of all beverage servings it sells through reusable models from 10% to 20%. The revised goal will involve expanding its refillable plastic and glass products.

By collaborating with partners and franchisors this enhanced packaging objective will enable PepsiCo to cut virgin plastic usage per serving by 50% by 2030 and become net zero by 2040.

Sinha who became the face of PepsiCo during the onset of the cola wars in India serving as its chairman between 1992 and 2002 was reputed both for driving business results and for his ability to navigate the corridors of the government at a time when much of the policymaking that would shape India’s FMCG sector was underway.

Tributes poured in on alumni groups of these companies through Thursday. Colleagues recalled how Sinha bridged the gap between managers and the frontline salesforce how he spent time in the marketplace travelling routinely into the hinterlands braving all kinds of inconveniences.

“I joined PepsiCo in 1994 and over the next decade got to know Suman the person… a great leader a mentor and coach a master politician a loving husband and father who then became a trusted advisor and a friend to me"" former PepsiCo chairperson and CEO Indra Nooyi told Mint.

“He steered the PepsiCo business in India masterfully in spite of the headwinds that foreign companies faced then and the intense competition in the beverage space. Suman showed up at work… looking stern and earnest but behind that exterior was a warm caring dedicated person who had great followership from everyone he touched. I was privileged to have learned the India beverage business from Suman"" she added.

Sinha’s decade at PepsiCo saw multiple business challenges — foreign companies trying to foray into the market were faced with resistance. Meanwhile rival Coca-Cola too was making aggressive bets in India. Under Sinha’s reign the company launched some of the beverage company's most iconic marketing campaigns including “Yeh Dil Maange More"" and “Nothing official about it"". He was also credited with launching bottled water brand Aquafina in India. He also helped the company acquire local beverage maker Dukes in Mumbai.

However under his reign rival Coca-Cola ended up acquiring homegrown beverages - Thums-Up and Limca.

R Gopalakrishnan who spent three decades at Hindustan Lever Ltd. and whose association with Sinha dates back to the early 1970s said Sinha was a skilled networker who was also demanding and task-oriented.

“At HLL he joined Aspie Moddie’s department in Delhi. Very soon he became ‘Delhi’ to all Lever managers. There was not an officer he did not know — IAS batch number college cohorts interests and so on. He was the first to establish to me what I later came to understand as less than six degrees of separation"" he said.

Sinha and Gopalakrishnan worked together when Sinha became general sales manager detergents; Gopalakrishnan was general sales manager foods. “So we worked together a lot. He had an indefatigable field and people orientation which could be perceived by his critics as bordering on fulsomeness. However Suman had a heart and intent of gold for the company’s interest"" he added.

Harish Manwani former chief operating officer of consumer goods giant Unilever recalls Sinha as a “towering"" and “legendary"" leader.

“He was responsible for some big watershed moments in HUL’s history —notably the retention of 51% majority and generally raising the profile of HUL as a responsible company and integral to India’s nation-building efforts. I got to know him when he was the Sales Director — demanding and rigorous yet caring and a lot of fun after office hours"" he said.

Varun Berry now executive vice-chairman and managing director Britannia Industries Ltd who worked with Sinha in PepsiCo India between 1993 and 2001 said Sinha would often take on the toughest of tasks suggesting a great appetite for risk.

Sinha is survived by his daughters Pooja and Anjali.

The campaign was meant to neutralise Coca-Cola’s Rs 10 crore sponsorship of the 1997 Cricket World Cup.

Former PepsiCo India Chairman Priya Mohan Sinha Suman to his friends passed away on Wednesday. He often said he loved three things all of which were in Kolkata. An early morning walk past the gothic monument at Prinsep Ghat a ride in a country boat on the Hooghly and a walk down Park Street the city’s happening hotspot brimming with restaurants bars and books. “These are my roots. This is what I want to do when I settle in Calcutta after retirement” he told me. He loved Calcutta and refused to call it Kolkata.

And then almost instantly he asked me at his expansive Gurgaon home: “Which club do you belong to?” I thought I would first say Manchester United as PepsiCo had once sponsored the club. But within seconds I changed tack and replied: “East Bengal.”

That was Sinha very earthy and one of the most respected CEOs of his time. He never lacked the human touch. Whenever Sinha bought gifts for his friends or business associates it reflected their individual interests. It could be a golf kit a cricket bat or a clock mounted in a case with blue crystals and so on.

Sinha knew the importance of the CEO’s chair at Pepsico India and he also knew about life without the chair. He had purged a lot of inefficiency at Pepsi and normalised what many felt was a grandiose corporate culture that had problems fitting with the Indian psyche. No wonder the big guys of the exceptionally high-profile PepsiCo remember him as a remarkably low-profile Chairman.

Sinha nephew of firebrand opposition leader Jayprakash Narayan believed in taking the bull by the horns. He loved hard work and leadership by example. Both stayed with him throughout his working life.

As a Director with Hindustan Unilever he was posted in Delhi for nearly a decade and knew the intricacies of babucracy as well as the influencers. Sinha took over from former PepsiCo President Ramesh Vangal and pushed the head office to give him a purse of $1 billion. He called it his war chest and started expanding aggressively. By the time he called it a day PepsiCo had 44 plants in India including ones owned by franchisees.

It was Sinha who offered interest-free loans to bottlers to expand. He even bought over some of PepsiCo’s partners and big bottlers. When Sinha was trying to acquire local drinks maker Duke’s to get its plant outside Mumbai Sinha worked overtime and held around 27 meetings with the owners the Pandole family. The deal was eventually sealed for Rs 46 crore in 1994.

Some of his moves drew flak. One was when he hawked a tomato processing unit in Punjab to Hindustan Lever. Many felt PepsiCo’s real strength was soft drinks not developing agriculture in India. Sinha took criticism on the chin like he did when he pushed PepsiCo India to export seaweed and rice. He told his critics that he had introduced contract farming in India which had improved tomato and potato yields.

Then there was the big fight with Coca-Cola. The Atlanta-based bosses of Coca-Cola launched the drink in Agra in 1993 and posed for photographs with the majestic Taj Mahal in the background. PepsiCo executives lined soda fountains all the way from Delhi to the launch site. In another instance Sinha once pushed his company to destroy 250 ml bottles worth Rs 60 crore when an insider informed him that Coca-Cola would sell 300 ml bottles at the same price.

Sinha felt the heat when Coca-Cola picked up all the brands from Ramesh Chauhan and gained instant market share. He said once: “I fight two brands Coca-Cola and Thums Up. Coca-Cola only fights Pepsi.”

One of the high points in Sinha’s career was when he spent around Rs 10 crore on a guerrilla marketing campaign that said Nothing Official About It. The campaign was meant to neutralise Coca-Cola’s Rs 10 crore sponsorship of the 1997 Cricket World Cup. The campaign captured the imagination of the people and also got a lot of press and helped PepsiCo gradually narrow the market share gap with Coca-Cola.

This was followed by Yeh Dil Maange More a campaign that stole the thunder from Coca-Cola. When a Major of the Indian Army used the line after a victory on one of the peaks at Kargil Sinha was over the moon.

Peter Thompson former President PepsiCo wrote a lovely memo when Sinha called it a day after nine and a half years. “The mark of a strong leader is to chart a winning course build a great organisation and deliver outstanding results. Suman has accomplished all of that and more.”

Thompson was possibly referring to the time when Sinha took charge. MPs probably egged on by domestic businessmen would ask dozens of questions in Parliament about PepsiCo agitations filled the streets in big cities and in the hinterland where farmers felt the big bad wolf would eat them up. The powerful Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) called PepsiCo a traitor that should be chased away like Coca-Cola and IBM.

Sinha led PepsiCo India for nine-and-a-half years.

Sinha remained unfazed. As a nephew of Jaiprakash Narayan Sinha understood India’s political underbelly. He made India PepsiCo’s second-largest market outside the US.

Seasoned communicator Deepak Jolly remembers some of Sinha’s bold decisions.

In 1990 during Jolly’s stint at Unilever ULFA threatened to kill the key executives at the Doom Dooma tea estate in Assam if the ransom wasn’t paid. An estate manager of Tata Tea had already been gunned down over an unpaid ransom. Sinha led the rescue operation of 139 people as HLL refused to pay the ransom.

“He was able to leverage his strong relations with the government the air force and the Assam Chief Secretary and managed a most difficult rescue operation with a plane landing on the Doom Dooma airstrip which hadn’t been used in years. Before the deadline for the ransom expired 139 staff members and their families were flown out of danger to Calcutta” said Jolly.

When injured soldiers returned from the Kargil War FICCI decided to raise money to help them start alternative careers. Sinha organised a large event with actors singers and other Bollywood artistes. “The entire Pepsi marketing team worked with him. There was no Pepsi branding. The PM the President and the Chiefs of the Army Air Force and the Navy were among the 25000 people that attended the event. It was organised in five days flat.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jb20ubXQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMi0xMi0yNC9mb29kL1BlcHNpQ28tYnJhbmRzLW5vdy1hdmFpbGFibGUtaW4tbmV3LXN0cmlraW5nLXJlZmlsbGFibGUtZ2xhc3MtYm90dGxlLTY3MzYyNDg0MjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PepsiCo brands now available in new striking refillable glass bottle,"Simonds Farsons Cisk plc proud partners of PepsiCo Inc and bottlers of the Pepsi-Cola portfolio for the local market since 1978 have just launched a new refillable single-serve bespoke glass bottle for flagship brands Pepsi-Cola and Pepsi Max 7up and 7up Free and Mirinda.

This launch closely follows the global release of the new bottle design and is the first design update since 1996. The etched twisted bottom of the bottle allows for a visible and tactile brand experience and the bold swirl and elevated profile of the bottle reflects the brand's youthful spirit and appeals to younger consumers.

This new glass bottle design complements a similar new design for the PET 1.5 and 0.5 litre bottle range launched on the local market just last year.

""The PepsiCo portfolio in Malta has gone from strength to strength over the years and we are confident that the latest investment in this striking and bold new glass bottle will serve to further enhance our clients' and consumers' overall brand experience"" said Ms Susan Weenink Camilleri Head of Sales & Marketing. ""We are also proud to endorse and participate in PepsiCo's recently announced global goals regarding Sustainable Packaging Vision.""

This month PepsiCo announced a new global goal to double the percentage of all beverage servings it sells delivered through reusable models from 10% to 20% by building out refillable plastic and glass offerings amongst others. By working with partners and franchisors this updated packaging goal will help PepsiCo meet its target of reducing virgin plastic per serving by 50% by 2030 and to become net zero by 2040.

Pepsi 7up Mirinda together with their no-sugar variants are produced marketed and distributed by Simonds Farsons Cisk plc and are available nationwide in a variety of packages."

Copyright © AFP 2017-2024. All rights reserved.

Conservative commentators and websites claim the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech causes blood clots. This is misleading; a study conducted by researchers affiliated with the agency did find a potential link between the shot and pulmonary embolism in older Americans but cautioned the findings do not prove causality.

""So the FDA finally came out and said that Pfizer's Covid shot causes blood clots? Only 2 years late!"" says a December 17 2022 tweet from the Hodgetwins a pair of conservative political commentators in the US.

The post accumulated more than 35000 shares and drew the attention of Twitter owner Elon Musk who replied: ""Much will come to light as (Anthony) Fauci loses power.""

The assertion which spread amid a winter surge of Covid-19 cases has also circulated among conservative influencers on Facebook and Instagram -- as well as on websites such as the Republic Brief and the Gateway Pundit which AFP has fact-checked numerous times.

""After two years FDA finally admitted Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine had been linked to blood clotting in older individuals based on the result of one of the largest studies of elderly persons aged 65 years and above"" the Gateway Pundit said in its December 18 article.

The claims come on the heels of a debunked film that featured embalmers connecting the Covid-19 vaccines to blood clots. The more recent allegations are based on a study co-authored by researchers affiliated with the FDA but the social media posts misrepresent their findings.

The study titled ""Surveillance of Covid-19 vaccine safety among elderly persons aged 65 years and older"" and published December 1 in the peer-reviewed journal Vaccine analyzed data from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The researchers ""evaluated 14 outcomes of interest following Covid-19 vaccination"" among ""30712101 elderly persons.""

According to the study four of those outcomes -- including pulmonary embolism a blood clot that blocks blood flow in the lungs -- ""met the threshold for a statistical signal"" following vaccination with Pfizer's shot BNT162b2. But that does not mean the vaccine causes blood clots.

""Our new findings of statistical signals for four important outcomes for the BNT162b2 vaccine should be interpreted cautiously because the early warning system does not prove that vaccines cause the safety outcomes"" the study says.

The authors noted several limitations including the fact that the analysis ""did not adjust for underlying risk factors"" that could have led to ""falsely positive or negative signals."" The results also ""may not be generalizable to those younger than 65 years and adults who are uninsured or received only commercial health insurance"" the study says.

""Because an early warning system does not prove that the vaccines cause these outcomes more robust epidemiologic studies with adjustment for confounding including age and nursing home residency are underway to further evaluate these signals"" the paper adds.

AFP reached out to the corresponding study author for additional comment but a response was not forthcoming.

FDA recommends Pfizer vaccine

Researchers affiliated with the FDA CMS and private entities conducted the study cited in the social media posts. But the FDA still recommends Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for children and adults.

""The FDA continues to find that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine meets the FDA's rigorous standards for safety and effectiveness and the agency strongly believes the potential benefits of Covid-19 vaccination outweigh the potential risks of Covid-19"" said Abby Capobianco an agency press officer in a statement emailed to AFP on December 21.

She added: ""The FDA has not found any new causal relationships between the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine and potential adverse events of special interest identified in 2021.""

The study notes the FDA is ""currently not taking any regulatory actions based on these signal detection activities because these signals are still under investigation and require more robust study."" In an online statement updated December 22 the agency said it plans to release additional findings in ""early 2023.""

A Pfizer spokesperson told AFP the company is cooperating with the FDA and other regulatory authorities as they ""independently monitor the safety profile of our vaccine.""

""The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has been administered to hundreds of millions of adults adolescents and children generating robust data demonstrating a favorable safety profile and high level of protection against severe Covid-19 disease including death and hospitalization"" the spokesperson said in a statement emailed December 20.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring some rare ""adverse events of interest"" reported after Covid-19 vaccination -- including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome which causes blood clotting. However the condition has occurred in approximately four cases per one million doses administered of Johnson and Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine not Pfizer's.

The CDC says on its website that ""severe reactions after vaccination are rare.""

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

British smokers expected to get through extra 124 cigarettes in December study finds

British smokers are expected to get through an extra 145 million cigarettes during December - due to a packed socialising schedule and festive stress.

A poll of 2000 smokers found they usually puff through an average of 13 cigarettes a day but 17% admit they smoke an average of four more during December as their resolve weakens.

This amounts to an extra 124 each over the course of the month.

More than four in 10 (41%) of those who will smoke more than usual blamed this on Christmas parties or socialising but 36% put it down to trying to wrap up hectic work schedules before the year is out.

Others smoke thanks to the stress of trying to find perfect presents (22%).

A spokesperson for Philip Morris Limited (PML) which commissioned the study for Unsmoke UK said: ""Everyone deals with stress differently. While the holidays are a wonderful time of the year it can also be stressful time compared to other months so smoking increases as smokers’ resolve weakens.

""Cigarettes however don’t actually help you to de-stress and in fact according to public health experts could just be making your stress levels higher.

""Quitting is always the best option but for those who don’t quit switching to smoke-free alternatives is a better choice for adults this December compared to continuing to smoke.”

The study also found 69% admitted a cigarette is the first thing they turn to when they’re stressed but then 56% end up feeling more worried at how smoking could affect their health.

But while 66% have had conversations with people about quitting 36% have never tried to stop.

Of the 64% who have attempted to quit 53% have gone ""cold turkey"" and 42% switched to vaping.

But 66% said December would be a hard month to try and quit smoking because it’s ""so stressful"".

It also emerged 59% were unaware smoking can cause stress but 43% claim they are more likely to quit knowing this.

Exercising (44%) listening to relaxing music (43%) and breathing exercises (34%) were the top alternative methods people have tried in a bid to de-stress.

Cleaning (31%) meditation (33%) and going for a drive (22%) also made the list.

Of those who took part in the study by OnePoll on behalf of PML and Unsmoke UK 51% also admitted their smoking habit stresses out close family members and friends.

WHY BRITS SMOKE MORE IN DECEMBER:

Festive parties or social occasions The stress of trying to wrap up hectic work schedules before the year is out The stress of the season finally getting to them Struggling to find the perfect presents Worrying about getting everything done in time Pressures from other people who smoke

Further the leading upstream energy firm carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is likely to record earnings growth of 134.4% in 2022.

Factors Working in Favor

West Texas Intermediate crude price trading at more than $75 per barrel is extremely favorable for upstream activities. Being a leading exploration and production company globally ConocoPhillips is well-positioned to capitalize on handsome crude prices. ConocoPhillips has a strong footprint in prolific oil-rich plays like the Permian Basin Eagle Ford and Bakken brightening up the company’s production outlook. For 2022 the company expects production at 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoE/D) suggesting an improvement from 1.6 MMBoE/D for 2021

COP is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. Apart from increasing quarterly ordinary dividend by 11% ConocoPhillips also lifted its share buyback authorization by $20 billion.

Risks

Being an upstream energy player the overall operations of the company are strongly exposed to volatility in oil and natural gas prices. Moreover significantly increasing expenses related to purchased commodities are hurting its bottom line.

Stocks to Consider

Some better-ranked players in the energy space are Phillips 66 PSX Precision Drilling Corporation PDS and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. NEX. All the stocks carry a Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

To make its operations more stable Phillips 66 is giving more attention to midstream (pipelines) renewables and chemicals businesses. It also has strong refining operations.

Precision Drilling is a well-known name in the energy space for offering its clients access to an extensive fleet of Super Series drilling rigs. Its services also include offering well-service rigs. With high commodity prices demand for PDS’ drilling rigs is favorable.

NexTier Oilfield Solutionsis also a well-known U.S. land oilfield service player. With higher exploration and production by upstream companies demand for NexTier Oilfield’s diverse set of well completion and production services is handsome.

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) today released the latest yearly editions of its Toxic 100 lists of the top corporate air and water polluters and top greenhouse gas emitters in the United States based on the most recent data available from the Environmental Protection Agency.

New this year is the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by the amount that their distribution of fossil fuels contributes to global climate change. This new list joins the Greenhouse 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their emissions responsible for global climate change according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the Toxic 100 Air and Toxic 100 Water Indexes which rank U.S. industrial polluters using the EPA Toxics Release Inventory. The indexes created as part of PERI’s Corporate Toxics Information Project once again include environmental justice indicators to assess impacts on low-income people and minorities.

“The Toxic 100 and Greenhouse 100 inform consumers shareholders regulators lawmakers and communities which large corporations release toxic and climate-altering pollutants into our environment” says Michael Ash professor of economics at UMass Amherst and co-director of the Corporate Toxics Information Project. “We assess not just how many pounds of pollutants are released but which are the most toxic and who is exposed. People have a right to know about toxic hazards to which they are exposed. Legislators need to understand the effects of pollution on their constituents.”

For the first time PERI has published a Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their 2020 supply of products that result in greenhouse gas emissions when the products are released combusted or oxidized. The top five companies on this year’s inaugural list in order are Marathon Petroleum Phillips 66 Valero Energy Exxon Mobil and Peabody Energy. The first four of these are primarily on the list because of their petroleum refining operations although the top two also conduct natural gas extraction. Fifth-ranked Peabody Energy is on the list due to its coal mining ventures. The top four each produced fossil fuels that resulted in 280 million metric tons or more of CO2-equivalent emissions. Rounding out the top 10 greenhouse suppliers are Enterprise Products Partners Chevron BP Arch Resources and Shell PLC.

The Greenhouse 100 Index ranks companies by 2020 direct emissions of greenhouse gasses from large sources. The top three companies are Vistra Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company the fourth year in a row in which these companies were in the top three spots. They each released more than 75 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Together these three companies released 4% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from all sources including non-energy sources.

The rest of the top 10 in the Greenhouse 100 are Berkshire Hathaway American Electric Power Energy Capital Partners NextEra Energy Xcel Energy the U.S government and Exxon Mobil the top company whose direct emissions are not dominated by electric power plants. Among the top 10 Energy Capital Partners has the highest weighted share of minorities living within 10 miles of its facilities.

In order LyondellBasell BASF Becton Dickinson Salzgitter Huntsman Dow Inc Canopus International Celanese Berkshire Hathaway and NOV Inc. lead the Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index which reports the top companies in 2020 in terms of total potential chronic human health risk from toxic chemical air pollutants. Five of these companies are in the top 10 almost entirely because of chromium or ethylene oxide released from one of their facilities. The Toxic 100 Air Index covers both publicly traded and privately held companies such as Koch Industries (No. 58) that appear on Forbes Fortune or S&P lists. The index includes environmental justice indicators that denote for example while minorities make up just under 40% of the U.S. population they bear 68% of the air-toxics risk from facilities owned by LyondellBasell.

The Toxic 100 Water Polluters Index which ranks the pounds of toxics released into surface water or sent to water-treatment systems in 2020 adjusted for chemical toxicity is led this year by Northrop Grumman LyondellBasell NextEra Industries Dow Inc. and Cargill. The Toxic 100 Water Polluters list also once again includes environmental justice indicators that show for example minorities bear 63% of the toxic hazard created by Dow from water releases and transfers to water treatment facilities.

In addition to the top 100 lists search functions for toxic air toxic water and greenhouse gas polluters provide information on all companies reporting releases or production to the Toxics Release Inventory the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program or the EIA-7A coal mine survey. Data related to Air Toxics at School and the Coal Producers Index is also searchable through the Corporate Toxics Information Project.

“In making this information available we are building on the achievements of the right-to-know movement” Ash notes. “Our goal is to engender public participation in environmental decision-making and to help residents translate the right to know into the right to clean air clean water and a livable planet.”

George Cohen who lifted the World Cup with England in 1966 has sadly died at the age of 83 his former club Fulham have announced.

""Everyone at Fulham Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of our greatest ever players – and gentlemen – George Cohen MBE"" a statement from the Cottagers read.

Cohen who was born in Kensington in 1939 spent his entire playing career with Fulham racking up 459 appearances between 1956 and 1969 and scoring six league goals. The pinnacle of his career - and remarkably his only major honour - came in 1966 when he started against West Germany in the World Cup final at Wembley Stadium.

Gary Lineker paid tribute to the England hero writing on Twitter : ""Sorry to hear that George Cohen has died. Another of the heroes of the ‘66 World Cup winning team leaves us. He’ll always have footballing immortality. RIP George.""

Having played every minute of the tournament for the Three Lions Cohen helped England to a 4-2 victory to clinch their first World Cup triumph. The right-back formed part of a formidable defence alongside Jack Charlton captain Bobby Moore and Ray Wilson.

Cohen earned a total of 37 caps for England between 1964 and 1967 and he served as Sir Alf Ramsey's vice-captain for the showdown with West Germany. After hanging up his boots in 1969 Cohen served as a youth coach at Fulham and worked with England's under-23s while he also spent time as manager of non-league side Tonbridge.

He was awarded an MBE in 2000 and a statue of Cohen was unveiled at Craven Cottage 16 years later as a tribute to Fulham's iconic former player and the 50th anniversary of England's World Cup triumph. Cohen attended the ceremony and was also made an honorary freeman of Hammersmith and Fulham.

""This is a richly deserved honour for a sporting hero who is Fulham through and through"" councillor Stephen Cowan said at the time. ""It not only marks his achievements on the football field but also his ambassadorial role and his tireless campaigning for research into cancer and dementia especially to help his fellow players.""

Astonishingly Cohen's nephew Ben was part of the England squad which won the Rugby World Cup in 2003 after defeating Australia in the final. The elder Cohen's sad death means that two members of the England starting XI which beat West Germany are still alive - and five members of the squad in total.

Fulham's touching obituary for their legendary former player concludes: ""All of our thoughts are with Daphne his beloved wife of more than 60 years sons Anthony and Andrew his grandchildren and extended family as well as George’s many many friends.""",,,,,,

Regional President Central Pennsylvania

Hoehn has served as regional president for 12 years.

He said his leadership style has evolved from a “lead by example” approach to a coaching style. “By developing others we leverage the culture capabilities and attributes of PNC to a greater scale for the benefit of all of our constituents. It’s my job to define success for the team and help chart course. At PNC we don’t prioritize quick wins over long-term success. Good leadership means making the next right decision in the near-term to plant seeds that will grow into sustainable prosperity for our clients and community” Hoehn said.

Technically his first job in the industry was cleaning a bank branch while in high school and working part-time in the mail room of a bank while attending college. “But in earnest my banking career began at the Federal Reserve Bank where I worked as a bank examiner focused on banking safety and soundness. I examined many banks both large and small which gave me key insights into what drives success and failure in the sector. I’ve never been afraid to ask questions and take on new challenges” he said.

He enjoys spending time with family and being outdoors whether it’s golfing or fishing.

Path forward stalled by FEMA.,"Plans to rebuild a public gym and swimming pool destroyed by Hurricane Ida are on hold awaiting word from FEMA on how much money the federal agency will pay toward the work.

For years Recreation District 7 has been looking to consolidate its facilities now spread throughout the Chauvin area to a 55-acre site at 4373 Bayouside Drive it bought in 2015. Officials say that would cut travel time for maintenance and make a one-stop area for all its services.

The property at the intersection of Klondyke Road already has a walking track skate park pavilion and some playground equipment.

But other facilities — the Little Caillou Gym Smithridge Gym and Little Caillou Swimming Pool — were damaged by the Category 4 hurricane when it hit the area Aug. 29 2021. The Smithridge Gym was patched up and is usable but the other two are now under review by FEMA.

Recreation board members expect the gym and pool are total losses and if they are will replace them with the structures in the district's master plan. However until the board has FEMA's decision plans are on hold said Rec 7 Vice Chairman Jay Duplantis.

""Once we know what kind of commitment there is on the FEMA side we know what kind of commitment we need to kick in and that's all going to determine what we will be able to replace it with"" Duplantis said. ""In the grand scheme of things money is everything.""

""And that's such a I don't want to say a disappointment to me but it's really frustrating that when you go down there and our fire department is in the same situation"" he said. ""They've got a firehouse — Upper Little Caillou — looks like the day after the hurricane.""

A structure must sustain at least 50% of its value in damage for FEMA to declare it totaled. Once a structure is rebuilt FEMA can reimburse up to 90% of the cost if the process is approved. To avoid complications pre-approval is sought before committing to a rebuilding process. The number of steps involved can delay the recovery process.

The Bayouside Drive property has a master plan that includes five phases. Two phases have already been completed and the third includes a splash park and fishing pier. Phase 4 includes a footbal-soccer field as well as outdoor concession stands. Phase 5 includes the large recreation building with two basketball courts and a 10-lane competitive swimming pool.

The estimated cost of the 10-year plan was around $18 million Rec 7 Chairman Donald Tivet said and about $12 million of work remains. The project was stopped by the pandemic and is now further complicated by Ida's aftermath.

""The hurricane caught us off guard and really set us back on that part of it but in all honesty we're dead set on moving our facilities up to that location"" Duplantis said.

Tivet said each of the old facilities' properties was going to be returned to their former owners or sold to community groups and that's still the plan.

For example the Little Caillou Gym was given to the rec district to build the gyms so the buildings would be demolished and the land returned to St. Joseph Church. The Smithridge Gym will be kept open as long possible but weill eventually be demolished and the land returned to South Coast Corp. And the Little Caillou Swimming Pool will be filled in and new playground equipment added to the property.

More:Some local fire stations destroyed by Ida remain leveled amid debate over insurance claims

More:Effort underway to merge 3 libraries in Terrebonne's bayou communities. Here's the plan.

Rec District 7 sold a corner of the property to the Terrebonne Parish Public Library for its planned South Regional Branch. Another portion is being used by the Little Caillou Fire Department as a temporary staging area until its stations are rebuilt.

The gyms act as community centers storm shelters and hubs for supplies after hurricanes.

By building a few miles north the structures are safer from hurricanes and more centrally located Duplantis said. He said the master plan didn't include baseball fields because the surrounding rec districts in Montegut and Bourg have those. Instead of duplicating Rec 7 members thought they could use the space for other uses. Duplantis is excited about the swimming pool.

""I'm going to go to my deathbed advocating for swimming"" he said. ""I'm not wavering on that one.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMDExbm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1wb3dlci1wb29sLXNlZXMtcmVjb3JkLXdpbnRlcnRpbWUtZWxlY3RyaWNpdHktdXNlLWlzc3Vlcy1hZHZpc29yaWVzLXJlc3BvbnNlLWV4dHJlbWUtY29sZC_SAZYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuMTAxMW5vdy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9zb3V0aHdlc3QtcG93ZXItcG9vbC1zZWVzLXJlY29yZC13aW50ZXJ0aW1lLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LXVzZS1pc3N1ZXMtYWR2aXNvcmllcy1yZXNwb25zZS1leHRyZW1lLWNvbGQvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Power Pool sees record wintertime electricity use issues advisories in response to extreme cold,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMDExbm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1wb3dlci1wb29sLXNlZXMtcmVjb3JkLXdpbnRlcnRpbWUtZWxlY3RyaWNpdHktdXNlLWlzc3Vlcy1hZHZpc29yaWVzLXJlc3BvbnNlLWV4dHJlbWUtY29sZC_SAZYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuMTAxMW5vdy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9zb3V0aHdlc3QtcG93ZXItcG9vbC1zZWVzLXJlY29yZC13aW50ZXJ0aW1lLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LXVzZS1pc3N1ZXMtYWR2aXNvcmllcy1yZXNwb25zZS1leHRyZW1lLWNvbGQvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225BBC610>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

A statement of claim filed by the family of Dumitru Serbulenco earlier this year says that on Dec. 12 2020 he was performing repetitive breath-holding exercises at the Suncor Community Leisure Centre in Fort McMurray Alta. and had asked lifeguards to watch him.

After being unconscious for six minutes lifeguards rescued the 34-year-old man and administered CPR says the statement of claim filed in February. Serbulenco was taken to the Northern Lights Hospital and died six days later.

His three-year-old daughter Zinovia was with him at the pool that day. The family's lawyer said Serbulenco was a stay-at-home dad at the time.

'Avoidable loss'

The family is suing the Regional Recreation Corporation of Wood Buffalo and four staff members alleging they neglected to adequately supervise and rescue him.

The statement of claim says the operators of the pool failed to develop a policy concerning repetitive breath-holding exercises citing the Alberta Public Swimming Pools Regulation.

""No family should have to go through such an avoidable loss"" widow Elena Serbulenco said in a written statement provided by her lawyer.

""His pride in fatherhood and marriage was extraordinary.""

None of the claims have been tested in court. The defendants deny all allegations and dispute the manner in which Dumitru Serbulenco died.

The defendants argue ""they met and exceeded any such duty of care at all material times"" says the statement of defence.

Neither the lawsuit nor the family statement said why Dumitru Serbulenco was practising the breath-holding exercises but free divers often use them as training to venture deep under water without a breathing apparatus.

A statement of claim alleges that Dumitru Serbulenco was performing repetitive breath-holding exercises at the Suncor Community Leisure Centre in Fort McMurray and had asked lifeguards to watch him. (Regional Recreation Corporation of Wood Buffalo)

The Lifesaving Society's Alberta Public Pool Safety Standards recommends all public aquatic facilities develop a policy to restrict repetitive breath-holding activities.

""Repetitive breath-holding prolonged breath-holding and prolonged underwater swimming is not permitted by the general public pool user"" the society says.

Both national and Albertan standards say repetitive breath-holding may be permitted in public pools but they must be under the direct supervision of a qualified instructor or coach.

Jonathan Kusyanto acting executive director of the Alberta and Northwest Territories branch of the Lifesaving Society said the society provides guidelines but doesn't have any legislative power.

""The standards are ultimately there to help support and educate pool owners and operators on what they can do to safely operate their facility"" said Kusyanto. ""But they're ultimately recommendations.""

The Alberta Public Swimming Pools Regulation states that ""owners must develop and maintain written policies and implement plans for those policies in accordance with pool standards"" which includes the safety and supervision of all patrons.

In an email the Regional Recreation Corporation of Wood Buffalo declined to comment given the legal process.

""The RRC has co-operated fully with the investigation of this incident"" said a spokesperson.

The drowning also led to a criminal case against a man who was working as a lifeguard at the time. In October RCMP charged a 25-year-old man with criminal negligence causing death.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Premiums loss ratio rise

The direct incurred loss ratio for U.S. homeowners lines rose to 98.0% in 2022 from 90.2% in the prior year as widespread inflationary pressures and the impact of Hurricane Ian contributed to the financial woes felt by the property and casualty insurance market.

Direct premiums written for the 10 largest U.S. homeowners insurers came in at $23.77 billion in the third quarter rising 11.65% in the period from $21.29 billion a year earlier.

Progressive posts largest loss ratio

Despite having the smallest market share among the 10 largest U.S. homeowners insurers The Progressive Corp. recorded the largest direct loss ratio by far totaling 236.2% for the third quarter. Progressive unlike most other large U.S. homeowners insurers underwrites in Florida where damage from Hurricane Ian was the most severe.

In its third-quarter earnings release Progressive cited $175 million of net property losses after reflecting the catastrophe reinsurance coverage on its property business which writes residential property insurance for homeowners other property owners and renters.

According to the company's Nov. 1 Form 10-Q filing Progressive retained $25 million of allocated loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance. On a gross basis prior to reinsurance Progressive estimated property catastrophe losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses from Hurricane Ian were $1.4 billion.

Because Progressive ""heavily"" reinsures its catastrophe exposure in its property business the insurer retained ""only $200 million of loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses from Hurricane Ian"" according to the report.

Progressive reported $760 million in losses for the quarter related to the hurricane with its property business incurring 23% of the losses net of reinsurance and vehicle losses accounting for $585 million including boats and recreational vehicles.

Among the 10 largest U.S. homeowners insurers only Progressive and USAA Casualty Insurance Co. logged loss ratios above 100%. Chubb Ltd. logged the lowest loss ratio among the largest U.S. homeowners writers at 55.7%.

Double-digit premium change

More than half of the 10 largest homeowners insurers in the U.S. — The Allstate Corp. Liberty Mutual Group Inc. USAA Casualty Insurance Co. The Travelers Cos. Inc. and American Family Insurance Group — posted double-digit premium increases year over year.

During a November earnings call Mario Rizzo Allstate's president of property-liability said the insurer is increasing homeowners prices through both rates and the inflationary adjustment factor embedded in Allstate's homeowners product to improve underlying margins going forward.

American Family rose by the largest percentage growing by 17.4% to $1.66 billion in direct premiums written.

Here is what you shouldn’t do when trying to remove snow from your ride.

Example video title will go here for this video

Anyone who has lived in snowy conditions knows snow can pile up on and around cars parked outside trapping vehicles and posing a safety hazard if not properly cleared before driving.

Tips have been circulating online for years claiming there are certain “hacks” to de-ice your windshields – like with vinegar or hot water. A VERIFY viewer also texted to ask us if they should raise windshield wipers to keep them from freezing.

While some people may have at-home tricks they use to clear snow or ice in the winter VERIFY fact-checked that you shouldn’t do these three things:

THE SOURCES

WHAT WE FOUND

1. Don’t use hot water or homemade solutions to clear snow or ice from your car

Pouring hot water over snow or ice might seem like an efficient way to melt it away but your windshield’s glass might crack from the sudden temperature change car dealership Rochester Mazda says on its website.

Stable Vehicle Contracts a UK-based car company says sometimes there are small unnoticeable cracks in windshields and pouring hot water over it could cause more damage in the long run.

This is because some water can get stuck in the cracks and should the windshield re-freeze it could expand causing the small cracks to get larger and more noticeable the Stable Vehicle Contracts website says.

Some people have recommended using a homemade solution like mixing water with ammonia or vinegar to remove ice or snow but a AAA spokesperson says this isn’t a good idea. AAA says you also shouldn’t use this type of solution as a preventative for build-up.

Using any chemical solution that is not manufactured for snow removal could result in paint damage and the chemicals could cause micro-pitting in the windshield which are small craters. These small craters could cause cracks in the windshield or distort light coming through your windshield.

Also don’t use any road salt on your car in order to melt the snow or ice faster. According to Progressive insurance it can speed up the oxidation process that causes rust.

What you can use:

A de-icing spray or liquid ice melt sold commercially

After your car is cleared off make sure you have de-icing windshield wiper fluid in the tank for use once you hit the road.

2. Don’t use the wrong tools

Just like how you shouldn’t use hot water or DIY solutions to clear your car you also shouldn’t use any tools that aren’t specifically made for snow removal.

State Farm insurance says to never use items like a screwdriver or metal key or other sharp item to chip ice away. These can scratch or shatter the glass.

1A Auto an auto-repair company says to never use a shovel to clear snow because most snow shovels both metal and plastic have a metal blade that will scratch the paint. T1A Auto also says not to use a broom because the bristles are stiffer than a regular snow brush and can also damage the paint.

Using your gloves is also not a good idea 1A Auto says because anything with hard or metal features could scratch the paint.





What tools you can use:

A proper snow brush or ice scraper that is made for removing snow and ice

A soft foam broom is another alternative to a snow brush

Snow blankets can be placed over your windshield before it snows and are easily removed

A leaf blower can be used from a distance to blow some of the snow off of your vehicle or from around your vehicle

3. Don’t use windshield wipers to clear your snow or ice

Don’t use your windshield wipers to remove ice snow or frost from your windshield before clearing off your windshield using other tools like ice scrapers or snow brushes Performance Honda a dealership in Fairfield Ohio advises.

The wipers are not strong enough to scrape off solid ice and may damage the rubber Performance Honda says. It may also damage the wiper motor if windshield wipers are used while the windshield or the blades themselves are frozen.

When you are driving it is safe to use windshield wipers with the appropriate fluids says Auto Glass Express an auto glass repair shop based in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. When your car is parked you can pull your windshield wiper blades away from the windshield if the vehicle is uncovered. This prevents the blades from icing to the windshield an article from AAA says

But lifting the blades from the windshield isn’t without risk.

Batteries Plus a retail chain says it’s not a good idea to lift and lower them repeatedly because it stretches out the spring used to adhere to the windshield.

They also say you shouldn’t snap the blades to get ice or snow off. If the spring is tight enough it can cause the wiper to crack the glass in your windshield.

December 24 2022 Connor Richards Editor & Live Reporter U.S.

Christmas came early for one lucky New Jersey poker player and her dealers at an Atlantic City casino. Earlier this week the Monmouth County woman hit a progressive poker table ganes mega jackpot at Harrah's Resort Atlantic City that earned her $1681458 off a $5 bet.

The woman who casino officials identified as a ""longtime customer"" of the Caesars Entertainment-operated casino was apparently in the holiday spirit as she tipped her dealers a handsome $77000 according to NJ.com which first reported the heartwarming tale.

The five-figure cut for the dealers made for 4.6% of the total prize not a bad tip that arrived just in time for the holiday season. The lucky winner meanwhile can go Christmas shopping comfortably after seeing a 33629060% return on her $5 investment.

Conveniently several poker players debated earlier this year how much pros should tip dealers after a controversial tweet from poker vlogger Lex Ozias (@LexOpoker1). PokerNews wrote about that debate which you can read about here.

Plenty of Big Jackpots Hit This Year

The $1.7 million jackpot hit in Atlantic City was big but there have been no shortage of big jackpots in 2022.

In August West Virginia's Benjamin Flanagan lost a hand with quad aces against a royal flush at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh to hit the poker room's $1.2 million bad beat jackpot the largest bad beat jackpot in US live poker history.

Bad beat jackpot at Rivers Casino Pittsburgh

In June a record-setting $2.2 million jackpot hit at Playground Poker Club in Canada when a player lost with quad tens to win approximately $845000.

Back in January GGPoker paid out the biggest ever Omaha Bad Beat Jackpot of $593177 that had Ibai Delgado walking away with the lion's share worth $366159.

A Dauphin County judge has reversed that vote and has approved the land development plan.

Dauphin County Judge John J. McNally III handed down the ruling in the fall. The board’s 2-2 vote with one abstension in February meant that the land development plan was denied. Prologis then appealed the decision in April.

“The court finds that West Hanover Township failed to address Prologis L.P.’s application for the approval of the plan in good faith and by such abused its discretion” McNally wrote in his ruling. “It is clear to this court that the board ignored the recommendations of its staff its engineer and its own planning commission regarding the plan.”

McNally ordered that the plan together with the waiver requests be approved.

So what’s next?

In order to proceed with construction Prologis will still have to obtain permits from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protections and PennDOT as well as zoning and building permits from West Hanover Township according to Dana Mitro assistant zoning and planning administrator at West Hanover Township.

It’s not clear what Prologis’ plan is moving forward. Mattie Sorrentino a spokesperson for Prologis said the company doesn’t have anything to share at this time.

In February 2021 the property was rezoned into the industrial zoning district. Previously some of the property was zoned agricultural and the rest of the property was zoned industrial. The land development plan was recommended by the township’s planning commission in October of that year. West Hanover Township residents came out to a number of meetings to protest the warehouse. They also held a protest near the property as well.

Residents had said they were worried about increased traffic stormwater requirements fire safety and potential noise from the project among other things and expressed their concerns at meetings.

Prologis has three warehouses across the street from the proposed property.

Officials for Prologis had said they had been planning the project since mid-2019 but did not identify the tenants only that there would be no hazardous materials in the warehouse.",,,,,,,,,

In a recent announcement BIS revealed that the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision met on December 16 to endorse the “global prudential standard for banks’ exposures to cryptoassets.” The GHOS settled on January 1 2025 as the date on which the new standard will take effect globally.

Under the new prudential standard commercial banks can only have 2% exposure to ‘unbacked’ digital assets stablecoins “with ineffective stabilization mechanisms” or even tokenized traditional assets. The BIS believes this will promote responsible innovation while preserving financial stability.

“The Committee’s standard on cryptoasset is a further example of our commitment willingness and ability to act in a globally coordinated way to mitigate emerging financial stability risks” Pablo Hernández de Cos who’s the Governor of the Bank of Spain and the Chair of the Basel Committee commented.

While it wants to limit banks’ exposure to digital assets BIS doesn’t think they pose a challenge currently to the global financial system. It said that the global banking system’s direct exposures to digital assets remain relatively low.

However this could change in the future and recent developments in the sector have shown that the banking industry could become contaminated by the ‘crypto contagion’ the Basel-based bank stated.

“Today’s endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary” commented Tiff Macklem Chair of the GHOS and Governor of the Bank of Canada.

While it limits banks’ exposure to digital assets the BIS has continued to foster cooperation in CBDC development. As CoinGeek reported it wrapped up its mBridge cross-border CBDC pilot with China Hong Kong Thailand and the United Arab Emirates in October.

By nearly every metric digital banking adoption has soared in Hong Kong since the Covid-19 pandemic.

The volume of Fast Payment System transactions almost tripled from 2019 to 2021 according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Over an 18-month period from 2019 to the first half of 2021 the percentage of personal banking accounts opened via digital channels and the percentage of credit card applications completed online nearly doubled.

Consumers shifted their banking behaviors out of necessity but are staying with digital channels for the experience. That means online and mobile banking aren’t secondary channels or value-added services; they are the bank for an increasing number of Hong Kong consumers. Digital channels—and an impeccable digital experience—must attract retain and earn new customers.

To learn more about digital banking experiences and preferences Bain & Company surveyed 1400 retail banking consumers in Hong Kong in September 2022. We used the proprietary Net Promoter System℠ to measure customers’ experiences with traditional and virtual retail banks. Customers reported on multiple facets of experience such as relationship (rNPS) channel (cNPS) product (pNPS) and episode. As part of the analysis we classified respondents as brand “promoters” or “detractors.”

Companies that earn high NPS scores deliver great experiences according to their customers and that translates into quantifiable benefits. In this research on average promoters purchase 20% more product categories from their primary financial institution than detractors. Promoters are also more loyal customers (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Promoters deliver more value to their primary financial institutions

Our study covered seven major retail banks in Hong Kong. The average rNPS was 19 although there was a 17 percentage-point spread between the highest- and lowest-scoring institutions. The delta between the highest- and lowest-scoring institutions was even wider for other dimensions of NPS such as channel (cNPS) and product (pNPS).

Those gaps are opportunities. Customer experience is paramount in and across every channel especially as physical and digital channels blend. By focusing on customer experience banks can create more economic value via higher lifetime customer values and lower customer acquisition costs.

What makes a digital retail banking experience delightful?

Our research identified four key themes surrounding customer experience in digital retail banking. Customers want mobile-centricity digital wealth management rewards and compelling value propositions.

1. Customers want mobile-centricity and connected branch experiences

Over the past 12 months mobile banking apps and online banking were the most-used channels across different age groups and asset levels. Mobile banking penetration reached nearly 80% while less than half of consumers stepped into a branch in the past year. On average customers interacted with their bank via mobile slightly more than once per week. Customers with more investable assets used digital channels more frequently than the mass market.

Mobile banking experience had the highest correlation to positive overall customer experience ahead of online banking and traditional channels. Hong Kong retail banking customers say they value a smooth mobile banking app transparent terms and conditions and robust privacy protection (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Hong Kong consumers value smoothness clarity and privacy in their mobile banking apps while mainland customers want “super app” functionality

Extensive app functions and nonfinancial lifestyle features were less important to Hong Kong consumers despite being attractive to customers in mainland China. Financial institutions that operate in both regions may need separate apps or customized solutions to address unique market preferences.

Despite customers only visiting branches once a month on average branches have the highest chance of winning over customers—or pushing them away. “Customers value ‘human touch’ when dealing with complex or emotionally charged financial needs” says Rannie Lee head of wealth and personal banking at Hang Seng Bank. She says many customers still prefer in-person service for assistance with mortgage applications wealth planning and large international fund transfers. These so-called moments of truth can delight or disappoint customers and often define their overall relationship with or attitude toward a bank (see Figure 3).

Figure 3 Positive branch experiences can convert customers into promoters

At the same time Lee says younger and digitally savvy consumers don’t want to wait for counter service to sign paperwork in a branch. Physical locations need to provide on-site digital channels as part of a seamless omnichannel experience.

In the future branches must evolve to become engagement- and experience-centered. That may mean smaller footprints but deeper ties to digital channels.

2. Digital wealth management is taking off

Consumers are adopting digital banking products at different paces. Specifically payments and consumer finance products have progressed quicker than wealth and insurance products.

However many customers are ready to click “buy” on digital wealth and insurance products. We asked consumers how they purchased mutual funds and insurance last year. Of those who purchased from a bank 45% of mutual funds and 40% of life insurance policies (by value) were purchased through their bank’s mobile app.

Major banks and fintechs are already offering digital wealth management services to the market. AQUMON rolled out “robo-advisor as a service” to help financial institutions build customized investment strategies for their clients. “Our sweet spot is serving ‘long tail’ customers that traditional human advisory services cannot cover” says Kelvin Lei founder and CEO of AQUMON. Digital capabilities such as these allow financial institutions to bring investment advisory solutions to the mass market.

Digital tools are integral to the customer journey but so is human support. And most customer journeys cross multiple channels. Even though 75% of respondents completed their mutual fund customer journey digitally almost 10% needed human support for part of the process. Moving forward a digital-human approach is the best model for retail wealth management.

The balance of human touch vs. digital will vary by customer segment and phase of the journey (see Figure 4). For example major banks could offer human-delivered services to their most affluent consumers in any stage of the journey or channel but use digital self-services or robo-advisory solutions for the mass market.

Figure 4 Wealth management services will blend digital and human touch based on segment

Under an omnichannel service model high-touch human services can transition into blended interactions. Financial consultation can start in a branch with a relationship manager then move to texts or video calls through a secured platform on the bank’s mobile app explains Dick Ho deputy general manager at Bank of China Hong Kong (BOCHK). At BOCHK financial consultations can be initiated by video calls through the mobile app or through traditional face-to-face meetings in a branch.

More players will launch and expand their digital wealth management services in the coming years hoping to ride the market boom. It’s important for banks to get their strategy and customer experience right. As more customers become comfortable managing their wealth online the rate of adoption will accelerate. The sector is ready to take off.

3. Benefits and rewards delight customers

In Hong Kong customers say attractive rewards lead to great experiences. Benefits and discounts are the top rNPS drivers ahead of channel experience product range and bank reputation.

We analyzed how customers ranked nonbanking mobile app features from news feeds to health trackers and chatbots. Reward features have the highest likelihood to delight customers when offered or to annoy customers if absent (see Figure 5). Customers appreciate all forms of rewards—vouchers instant cash back points—and find them similarly attractive.

Figure 5 Customers value rewards and benefits the most among all nonfinancial services features on mobile apps

Customer service modules like chatbots are expected must-have functions. But some features such as health and wellness trackers or user communities have little effect on attracting customers.

To drive engagement ZA Bank combines rewards and gamification on its mobile app. By spending with their ZA card customers are entitled to rewards including chances to win HKD$1 million in cash. Customers click on “PowerDraw” in the bank’s app to claim their offers.

“Gamification allows us to continuously enhance user engagement” says Calvin Ng ZA Bank’s alternate chief executive. “It is definitely a win-win. We can understand users’ behavior while they get to know more about our products. We value every moment to delight our users and deepen the relationship.”

4. Virtual banks are creating innovative and attractive value propositions

Since launching in 2020 eight virtual banks have opened more than 1.5 million new accounts. That’s an impressive number for a city with a population of 7.4 million.

How did virtual banks attract new customers so quickly? First and foremost they offered attractive new customer rewards and referral incentives. Those tactics were highly effective because Hong Kong customers value rewards.

Virtual banks also offered unique (and often stronger) value propositions and were laser-focused on customer experience. Compared to some traditional banks virtual banks offer faster loan approvals lower interest rates more flexible repayment terms and easier-to-use platforms for consumer finance products.

WeLab Bank Chief Executive Tat Lee thinks personalized advisory services can help differentiate virtual banks. Although lending is a relatively “plain vanilla product” he says virtual banks can provide services that help customers get better financing plans. WeLab Bank uses data intelligence to offer speedy and customized financial solutions.

Lending has been a boon for virtual banks. Loan volume shot up around 380% CAGR from 2020 to 2021. Despite the exponential growth there’s still upside potential. Among all virtual banks in Hong Kong the total loan book was only HKD$11.2 billion by midyear 2022 compared with an overall consumer finance market of HKD$683 billion.

Virtual banks also outperformed traditional banks in customer experience in specific product areas according to the NPS ratings. For consumer loans the average pNPS for the eight virtual banks we studied was 52% which was significantly higher than the average for traditional banks (20%).

To keep the momentum going virtual banks should continue to create attractive value propositions expand their product offerings and build reputable brands.

By focusing on customer experience many virtual banks have established a virtuous cycle to earn business—and the flywheel is taking off. Social and digital marketing distinctive branding compelling offers and competitive pricing draw customers in. Those customers are rewarded with engaging and stress-free experiences that plug directly into their lifestyle and other services they use. Then word of mouth referrals and repeat customers help virtual banks grow further (see Figure 6).

Figure 6 Customer experience is a flywheel for virtual banks to attract retain and grow customers

Offering attractive rewards and incentives gave virtual banks a strong start but at a high cost. Now virtual banks are gradually shifting their focus from bought growth to earned growth to achieve critical scale and improve their bottom lines.

Right now most virtual banks’ products are relatively simple which reinforces ease of use. To expand and become profitable virtual banks must explore new products and verticals without complicating the process. To deliver delightful customer experiences banks should keep mobile app navigation intuitive and “stress free” even as products and services become more complex.

Virtual banks need accurate customer insights and ways to evaluate new product launches. Livi tests concepts and ideas with a group of 200 targeted customers (Livi Circle) before launching any new products according to Carol Hung Livi’s alternate chief executive and chief product officer. “After launch we closely monitor every step of the customer journey so we can collect feedback and improve” she says. Livi also closely tracks customer sentiment through NPS surveys and competitive benchmarking.

Embedding finance into everyday life

To be delightful banking experiences need to be seamless for users. Virtual banks may need ecosystem partners (or parent companies) to help them embed banking services into other platforms that customers regularly use.

Ant Bank (Hong Kong) leveraged a partnership with mobile wallet provider AlipayHK to create a mini-app inside the digital payments platform. It allows users to open a high-yield savings account and make payments to local merchants through the e-wallet. Customers can also link their savings accounts to the AlipayHK platform for online and offline payments. “The experience is convenient and seamless so we don’t need to spend much effort pushing customers to use our services” says Yvonne Leung chief executive of Ant Bank.

Connecting into other platforms is also a priority for Fusion Bank according to Chief Technology Officer Flying Wu. Fusion Bank embedded its services into different payment scenarios and gained access to merchants through its parent company Tencent.

Traditional banks are also active in embedded finance. “Embedding non-financial or partner services into the banking experience must add value for customers. It needs to make sense and complement their existing lifestyle” says Kim Lay head of digital banking at Hang Seng Bank. For example partnering with a dining platform could make it easier for credit card customers to manage reservations rewards and payments through a seamless process.

Key actions for traditional banks

Virtual banks changed the dynamics of retail banking in Hong Kong and to some extent redefined how financial institutions deliver value. Both traditional and virtual banks must focus relentlessly on customers and pursue the best value propositions possible. How they deliver value—the customer experience—will set them apart.

Traditional banks have long-standing relationships and deep customer knowledge to their advantage but they face more organizational system and capability challenges as they transform into customer-centric players. There are three stages of development that traditional banks can follow to improve customer experience (see Figure 7). The starting point may vary based on how sophisticated and customer-centric a bank is today.

Figure 7 Banks can become more customer-centric in three stages

Stage 1: Develop segment-based customer insights and propositions

In this phase banks need to build core capabilities in customer insights and analytics to understand their position in the market. Examine the bank’s culture strategy and performance benchmarks to identify gaps and opportunities. Use all available data to establish your position ideal customer segments and segment-led value propositions. From there digital channels and the ecosystem needed to deliver value will come into focus.

Research and analysis are not “one and done” events. Use measures such as NPS to continually collect feedback and adapt the customer experience strategy.

Stage 2: Create a seamless customer journey

Next apply customer insights to create seamless omnichannel customer journeys. Start with products or performance areas with the highest potential to affect NPS scores such as mobile wealth management. Create a customer experience roadmap to identify priority use cases then determine how and when to scale technologies.

Remember technology isn’t supposed to digitize the traditional banking process. Rather it’s intended to enhance the experience and value for customers. Continuous feedback loops and sentiment monitoring can keep development efforts on the right track.

Stage 3: Optimize digital and human engagements

By leveraging advanced data analytics banks can blend digital and human engagements to create ultra-personal interactions and delight customers.

Real-time data and analytics can be applied at the individual level whether customers are at the counter or on a mobile device. To achieve personalization at scale traditional banks need experience-led operating models and customer-driven cultures. Some banks may also need to upgrade their data and IT infrastructure to support more advanced customer experience capabilities.

As the dimensions of customer experience become more complex traditional banks will need new ways to measure customer relationships across products channels and journeys. Continual higher-velocity feedback loops will be necessary to benchmark performance make timely and effective decisions and “win on purpose.”

Lay offers an example in which Hang Seng’s accelerated customer feedback cycle helped the bank identify and resolve an issue with a system upgrade more quickly. “We picked up on the drop in NPS within a week and swiftly implemented corrective actions” says Lay. “Responding quickly and effectively to customer feedback is central to maintaining trust.”

Customer-based accounting can help traditional banks measure earned growth that results from customer experience. Combined customer-based accounting and dynamic sentiment tracking (such as NPS or NPS Prism℠) can help traditional banks create delightful experiences.

Key actions for virtual banks

After a two-year period of rapid growth virtual banks are under pressure to become profitable. Under the current macro environment investors are increasingly risk averse and focused on pathways to profitability over “growth at all cost.”

The eight digital-native banks we studied are pursuing different development paths (e.g. products customer segments personal vs. business banking). Will they steal a sizeable share of the market away from traditional banks? Or will they remain specialists only winning certain customers and product niches? The jury is still out. But to succeed in the next stage of development virtual banks must take three critical steps.

Step 1: Focus on the path to profitability

Every virtual bank has to take profitability seriously. To break even the basic formula is to achieve high-enough scale at a low-enough unit cost. Virtual banks should revisit their unit economics since costs and complexity may have accumulated during periods of rapid growth.

Management should also determine and track sources of the bank’s growth and categorize them as “earned” or “bought.” From there leaders can ruthlessly prioritize strategies that drive profitable growth (e.g. the right segments or customers who will buy more from them).

Advanced analytics are key to this step. Use analytics to optimize marketing activities and spending so they are directed toward the highest impact and returns on investment.

Step 2: Introduce products that enhance customer experience and lifetime value

Selectively introduce new products focusing only on those that increase customer lifetime value and NPS. Every new product has to be a blockbuster that enhances customer experience.

To do that virtual banks should leverage immersive customer insights. Listen to customers to identify in-demand products and go-to-market strategies. Stay focused on addressing unmet customer needs and strengthening the bank’s value proposition. Use strict financial discipline and track operational key performance indicators in real time to issue timely responses as customer needs and sentiments change.

Step 3: Achieve experience-driven profitable growth at scale

Ultimately success is about delivering superior customer experiences at scale. Virtual banks can leverage real-time customer data and advanced analytics to deliver personalization at the individual level (e.g. recommending the best consumer finance plan at the time of need). They can also leverage high-velocity customer NPS feedback loops to refine the customer experience.

Growing profitable business at scale should be a strategic priority. Products with favorable margins and high customer advocacy will help virtual banks achieve economies of scale more quickly.

Finally efficient technology and operating platforms can lower operating costs and create competitive advantages over traditional banks. Virtual banks can turn the flywheel into a true profit engine.

Conclusion

Digital acceleration has paved the way for a new and exciting era of retail banking in Hong Kong.

Without the burden of legacy technology and processes fintechs and virtual banks can be more nimble and innovative. Traditional banks are also leveraging digital technology to play both defense and offense. What’s the right strategy for your bank?

Ask your customers.

Customers are the best source for feedback opportunities and sustainable growth. Banks that delight customers—on any channel—will find exciting ways to grow.

Methodology This report examines the digital banking market in Hong Kong post-Covid-19. The findings and recommendations in this report were informed by Bain & Company’s analysis of the results plus industry expertise. We surveyed about 1400 retail banking consumers in Hong Kong in September 2022 to learn about their digital banking experiences and preferences. Our survey included consumers with accounts at traditional and virtual banks and across a distributed range of genders ages income levels and investable assets. About 79% of respondents reportedly use mobile banking apps. We also conducted interviews with nearly two dozen bank executives industry practitioners and market experts in Hong Kong to gain the service providers’ perspective. And we analyzed current market practices and business approaches. This research also used Net Promoter Scores from seven major retail banks and eight virtual banks in Hong Kong. NPS measures the degree to which a consumer would recommend an organization product or service to others. An NPS score is the percentage of respondents who identify as “promoters” minus the percentage of respondents who identify as “detractors.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8va3BtZy5jb20veHgvZW4vaG9tZS9pbnNpZ2h0cy8yMDIyLzEyL2V0Zi01MDEtZXUtZGlyZWN0LXRheC1pbml0aWF0aXZlcy0yMDIyLXllYXItZW5kLXN0YXRlLW9mLXBsYXkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Euro Tax Flash from KPMG's EU Tax Centre,"EU Minimum Tax Directive at a glance

The European Commission (EC) published the initial Minimum Tax Directive proposal on December 22 2021 after the OECD had published its Model Rules for the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules two days before. Following technical discussions in the Council working groups a number of compromise texts were published in the course of 2022 and provided for several amendments including to make reference to the ongoing work of the OECD rectify areas of discrepancy between the Model Rules and the initial text and provide for a deferral option of up to six years for Member States where a maximum number of twelve UPEs are based in that jurisdiction. Nevertheless the file remained in deadlock throughout 2022 due to reservations raised by Poland and Hungary.

A new compromise version of the draft Directive was released on November 25 2022 which mainly includes linguistic and structural changes compared to the June 2022 version and remains closely aligned with the OECD GloBE Model Rules.

Status

On December 15 2022 the Council of the EU reached unanimous agreement to implement the EU Minimum Tax Directive. The final text of the Directive was published in the Official Journal of the EU exactly one year after the initial proposal was released by the European Commission. Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the Union therefore entered into force on December 23 2022.

The agreed Directive requires Member States to transpose the rules into domestic law by December 31 2023 and to start applying the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) for fiscal years beginning on or after this date. The Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) will be applied for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31 2024.

In addition the agreed text provides the option for Member States to implement a qualified domestic top-up tax (QDMTT) and to defer the application of the IIR and the UTPR up to December 31 2029 where a maximum number of 12 UPEs are based in that EU Member State.

For more details please refer to Euro Tax Flash Issue 500.

What to keep in mind

With the EU Directive now in place it is important to monitor how EU Member States will incorporate the GloBE rules in their domestic legislation. Key design decisions that are left to national legislators include:

whether to introduce an optional qualified domestic minimum top-up tax;

for Member States with no more than 12 UPEs – whether to apply the IIR and UTPR at a later stage in accordance with the deferral option;

which items of the OECD commentary and GloBE Implementation Framework to incorporate into domestic law (e.g. safe harbor provisions)

how to establish a filing process that allows centralized group filing and automatic information exchange with other GloBE jurisdictions under bilateral or multilateral competent authority agreements.

Member States may also consider whether or how to reform local tax incentives (e.g. R&D tax credits) to align with the GloBE definition of a ‘qualified refundable tax credit’. This momentous overhaul of the international tax system could also be a good opportunity for jurisdictions to consider whether current domestic tax regimes can be simplified for example by removing legislation that might be obsolete following the implementation of the GloBE rules.

The Netherlands has conducted a public consultation on a draft bill - Minimum Taxes Act 2024 (closed at the start of December 2022) while Ireland conducted a high-level consultation on the implementation of Pillar Two in Summer 2022. The French and German Ministries of Finance announced their intention to publish a first implementation draft law for discussion in early 2023 and other Member States are likely to follow suit.

Momentum is also building in non-EU jurisdictions (e.g. UK Switzerland Japan Korea Australia New Zealand Canada) we expect Pillar Two implementation to pick up further speed once the OECD’s work on the GloBE Implementation Framework advances further. On December 20 2022 the OECD released the first three components of the package including guidance on transitional safe harbors and penalty relief as well as public consultation papers on the GloBE Information Return and tax certainty. An expected fourth component in form of administrative guidance has not been released but is expected in early 2023.

Their unit was one of many that were burnt to a crisp.

Kids’ clothes toys and Christmas gifts were destroyed. April Abernathy her husband and three small children live in a modest two-bedroom Mesa apartment. It’s a special place because it is their first home in two years the first time in a while they’ll have their Christmas under their own roof.

The family that lived between their car motels and shelters was dealt another crushing blow knocked back down after trying to get on their feet. “It’s hard” said Abernathy.

The Abernathy’s unit at Public Storage on 8th Avenue and Country Club Drive was one of the many destroyed in a massive fire on Dec. 13 that the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is now investigating. While the cause and the origin are still under investigation it’s clear how much damage and heartbreak it caused.

The Abernathy’s put their kids’ clothes toys and some electronics inside the storage unit when they became homeless. They even had Christmas gifts inside. “It’s like everything got worse; it’s like we got pushed back a little bit from it” said Abernathy. “It’s the sentimental items that are gone that we can’t ever get back. I have baby pictures and everything completely gone that I can’t get back.”

The family of five with another child on the way now sits and sleeps on donated furniture. There are donated gifts under the tree. The clothes on the kids’ backs were also given as a good deed. “We are going to take it day by day” said Abernathy.

Abernathy said she’s working with the insurance agency after the flames destroyed her unit but she has yet to receive a dime. She could use some helping hands but most of all she wants prayers. “Just pray we get through this” she said.

But the Navy's plan is still up for the state Department of Health’s approval following its review of four plans for the underground storage tanks and has already received negative criticism from the Honolulu Board of Water Supply.

“DOH is still committed to a closure plan that guarantees the tanks will never again be used for substances that could pollute our aquifer” a spokesperson said in a written statement.

The World War II-era facility has 20 concrete fuel storage tanks that were mined into the rock each holding about 12.5 million gallons of fuel just above the island's aquifer. The closure plan is part of a directive from the DOH's May 6 emergency order following years of accidental fuel spills into the environment and Navy’s water system.

“The detailed analysis shows that closure in place of the Red Hill facility minimizes impacts to the environment public health and safety which continue to be our highest priority” Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy Installations and Environment Meredith Berger said in a press release.

The Navy submitted the Jacobs Government Service Company-produced analysis of four closure plans for feasibility schedule cost and benefits of which the Navy is requesting approval for a permanent “closure in place.”

This means the tanks will be drained and cleaned but not filled. The ventilation of the tanks will be capped but will need some maintenance in the future to prevent condensation or ""organic growth"" according to the report. This plan would require some other maintenance like monitoring and periodical water drainage from the tanks and visual evaluations.

“If closed permanently as described above the tanks are not expected to deteriorate in the next 50-100 years” the report says. “This conclusion is based on observations of the current condition of the tank steel linings and structural assessments of the visible anchors in the tank.”

The Honolulu Board of Water Supply which has been critical of the Navy and demanded a faster defueling has asked the DOH to deny this alternative.

“The BWS strongly opposes any tank closure proposal that does not call for the one time safe defueling and permanent closure of the Red Hill facility” BWS said in a statement. “Closing the tanks by either removing them from the ground or filling them with an inert material as generally required under the DOH’s rules is the only way to ensure that they can never be used or put our irreplaceable sole-source groundwater aquifer in imminent peril of contamination again.”

Once BWS has gone through the plan the department plans to share more detailed comments.

A second alternative builds off the closure in place by preparing the tanks for non-fuel reuse. This would potentially require the installation of a protective coating depending on what is chosen to be stored inside of the tanks. This plan is estimated to cost $223 million and take about four years following defueling.

According to a press release the Navy will request approval for a “beneficial non-fuel reuse of the facility.” The Navy said it would engage with the community for the to-be-determined reuse.

Defueling of Red Hill is still slated for June 2024 and if the closure-in-place plan is approved it is projected to be finished in June 2027.

“If the DOH approves beneficial non-fuel reuse for the facility as well the DON will actively engage the Oahu community to solicit input on options and coordinate with DOH prior to finalizing the design and process for permanent ‘Closure in Place’ for Red Hill” the Navy said in a release.

The Navy says a non-fuel reuse evaluation report will be “completed in a timely manner and will not affect the overall schedule for tank closure. A final determination on the reuse of the facility is not required in order to close the facility.”

“This important step underscores our commitment to safely close the Red Hill facility and we look forward to hearing the Hawaii Department of Health’s feedback” Navy Region Hawaii Commander Rear Adm. Steve Barnett said. “We are hopeful for an expeditious approval of the proposal so that we can continue on our path to close Red Hill.”

A third plan offers closing up the tanks with fill material ""which may not be available on-island"" and would take about five years ""during which time more than 50 large dump trucks per day would travel the local roads thereby causing severe negative impacts to the local environment and surrounding community. Significantly this alternative does not allow beneficial non-fuel reuse of the tanks.""

The fourth alternative studied removing the steel liners and filling the underground tanks which poses a risk to disabling the surrounding area at an estimated $581 million cost over seven years.

Earlier this week the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Navy signed an initial consent agreement about how the Red Hill fuel storage facility should be shut down.

The EPA said it has done a series of inspections and investigations covering not only the fuel storage tanks but the local system for drinking water which supplies about 93000 households."

The change in strategy came after the Chinese tech maker consumed most of its Kirin inventory. Since the company cannot print new chipsets Huawei had to rely on Qualcomm to launch phones which is likely to continue in 2023.

It’s expected that Huawei will continue to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset for all of the devices launching in 2023. This will lead us to flaghip devices that will enter first in the arena.

For example Huawei is preparing two flagship devices in the first quarter. First is the Huawei Mate X3 foldable phone and second is the Huawei P60 series.

As per the past report Huawei could use Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset on the Mate X3 and the chip configurations for the P60 series remain unknown. However it’s possible for the phone maker to arrange a Gen 2 model hand.

Other than these Huawei also has mid-range devices such as Nova 11 or probably Nova 20 series that will also require to use of Qualcomm chipset. Later on the home ground special the Huawei Enjoy series is also in the queue to present a new model.

Furthermore Huawei will close the year with the new Huawei Mate series flaghip which is also predicted to be powered by a Qualcomm chip. Meanwhile there are also some models that could launch in between these schedules in any category.

Usecase:

As compared to last year 2022 is filled with Qualcomm chipsets and Huawei has launched various smartphones including Huawei Mate 50 and Nova 10 series with the latest Snapdragon mobile processors. That’s not it the chipset powered the latest Huawei Pocket S flip-style foldable with cheap pricing.

The absence of Kirin has brought in new cooperation between Qualcomm and Huawei which will continue to expand throughout 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3RlbGVjb20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzY2LW9mLXNtYXJ0cGhvbmVzLWxhdW5jaGVkLWluLTNxMjItc3VwcG9ydC01Zy1tZWRpYXRlay1nYWlucy1lZGdlLW92ZXItcXVhbGNvbW0tdGVjaGFyYy85NjQ1MDU5M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,66% of smartphones launched in 3Q22 support 5G MediaTek gains edge over Qualcomm: Techarc,"Advt

NEW DELHI: 31 smartphones or 66% of the 47 smartphone models launched in Q3 2022 support 5G technology according to a report released by Techarc on Friday.In terms of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) preference for the chipsets MediaTek enjoyed an edge with 23 (49%) of the smartphones launched during the period using its chipsets. Compared to this Qualcomm ’s Snapdragon was used in 15 (32%) of the launches. Apple and UniSOC had a tie with 4 launches each. Google used its own processor for the latest Pixel model as per the report.Qualcomm’s Snapdragon however was preferred for 5G smartphones with 5 OEMs using its chipsets. Mediatek’s Dimensity was used in 4 launches the report added.Apple Realme and Infinix each launched four 5G smartphones in the September quarter followed by iQOO and Oppo (3 each) Vivo Motorola Samsung OnePlus and Redmi (2 each) and Google Asus and Nothing (1 each).“In the overall smartphone launches 5 brands preferred to go with multiple chipset providers as against in 5G where only 2 brands used multiple chipsets to launch smartphones during the quarter” said the firm in its report.Techarc said that overall as well as in 5G maximum launches happened in the mid-segment (Rs 12000-Rs 25000) with 17 of the total models being introduced in the segment whereas in the basic segment (Rs 6000-Rs 12000) only one 5G smartphone was launched. In contrast no smartphone was launched in the entry-segment (less than Rs 6000).According to the latest projection by research firm IDC for the overall smartphone market 5G will account for just over half of smartphones shipped worldwide in 2022 rising to 80% by 2026.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vY3hvdG9kYXkuY29tL2V4cGVydC1vcGluaW9uL2luZGlhcy12bHNpLWluZHVzdHJ5LW9uLXRoZS1yaWdodC10cmFjay1mb3ItZ3Jvd3RoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's VLSI Industry on the right track for Growth,"Hyderabad India December 23 2022: Globally there is a conscious shift from being dependent on Taiwan’s TSMC for manufacturing. The US and India have separately initiated policy decisions to build manufacturing capabilities. Published data estimates India’s share of global electronics manufacturing will rise to about 10% in 4-5 years from the current 3.5%. The worldwide semiconductor industry is currently valued at $500-$600 billion and caters to the global electronics industry currently valued at about $3 trillion.

In December 2021 India announced its roughly $10 billion dollar production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to encourage semiconductor manufacturing in the country. According to the Electronics and IT Ministry semiconductor demand in India would increase to $70-$80 billion by 2026 with the growing demand for digital devices and electronic products.

Semiconductor products consumed in India or elsewhere range over multiple technologies. Giants like Qualcomm and Intel have massive R&D centers in India and are already working on innovative technologies that are also targeted at domestic markets. These fuel demand to produce chips locally.

Qualcomm is a fabless company as are the majority of the semiconductor companies. Most semiconductor companies have moved away from a vertical integrated model that includes manufacturing thus delineating the complex requirements of maintaining a fab. This model has thrived for over 40 years with only a few exceptions.

The hardware component of the VLSI has all aspects of design and development now being done in India. Large majors like Qualcomm churn out over 10 chips in a calendar year with end-to-end ownership. This includes digital and analog design various state of the art verification methods physical design and verification testing and emulation all of which have immense potential and opportunities in India. Combined with the established software leadership India already holds this is a winning concoction for the VLSI industry.

Combined with the recent focus of the Government on making India a global hub for electronics manufacturing and design the scope of the VLSI industry has rapidly expanded in India. In particular it has sped up in the last 15 plus years.

Government of India announced fiscal support for a design-linked initiative (DLI) scheme to drive global and domestic investment related to design software IP rights etc. from MSMEs and start-ups for financial incentives and infrastructure support across various stages of development and deployment of semiconductor design(s) for Integrated Circuits (ICs) Chipsets System on Chips (SoCs) Systems & IP Cores and semiconductor linked design(s) over a period of 5 years. These are all very much in the right direction in establishing India’s footprint in the semiconductor product and supply chain business.

As a host of learning and mature mentorship is also extensively available in India to constantly fill the demand for manpower with relevant skills.

The year 2023 VLSI Design Conference themed around “Semiconductors driving disruptive Innovations in Global Digitalization” several eminent speakers are going to be delivering Keynote on topics that are relevant today. In addition to technical presentations there will be tutorials panel discussions poster sessions and exhibits from leading VLSI companies. And most importantly there are opportunities to network with other attendees and learn about technology job and career opportunities in the field of VLSI.

With the required push from Government and knowledge sharing conferences like VLSI Design Conference 2023 the future of the semiconductor industry looks bright.

Senthilbalaji the DMK Minister in-charge of selling liquor to Tamil Nadu people got personal with Tamil Nadu BJP President K. Annamalai leveling allegations about the latter’s watch.

Senthil Balaji’s spat with state BJP chief K Annamalai raged on after the former targeted the latter for wearing a Bell & Ross special edition Rafale watch.

In a social media post the DMK Minister claimed “Annamalai (referring to him derogatorily) who claims to own just 4 goats as his property is wearing a Rafale watch which costs more than ₹5 lakhs of which there are only 500 wristwatches. If he can show the receipt of that watch in the next one hour many commoners can also buy and enjoy.”

Calling Annamalai a ‘national disease’ the DMK Minister said “A ‘national disease’ sorry a ‘nationalist’ wearing a foreign watch how come he rose to the level of wearing a watch worth ₹5 lakh?” The Minister’s choice of words to refer to the BJP leader is indicative of the gutter-level politics of Dravidian Stockists.

Soon after details of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin’s son-in-law Sabareesan’s watches and luxurious lifestyle emerged with many questioning his source of income given his humble background prior to marrying Stalin’s daughter Senthamarai. Political commentator Savukku Shankar and Youtuber Maridhas were among the first to reveal details about Sabareesan’s luxury possessions. These details have been made public in order to demonstrate to the DMK IT wing cadres that they should not throw stones while living in a glass house.

Sabareesan’s Costly Watches Belts And Shoes

The details of the luxurious possessions which Sabareesan flaunts to prove his social status are taken from pictures available in the public domain.

Richard Mille Watch

The watch in the image appears to be a Richard Mille with a price tag of ₹1.9 crores. Because the watch is not manufactured in India it must be imported incurring an import duty of ₹ 2.66 crores. The watch costs approximately ₹4.65 crores in total.

Dominique Guenat and Richard Mille founded Richard Mille in 2001 and the company is based in Les Breuleux Switzerland. The company is known for its ultra-high-end luxury watches. The brand has been making waves in the luxury timepiece market since it was founded.

This is one of the publically available luxury watches worn by Sabareesan. However political commentator Savukku Shankar who obtained information about Sabareesan’s luxury possessions from a source stated that the DMK Chief Minister’s son-in-law has a large collection of luxury watches worth ₹30 crores.

Hermès Paris Belt

Sabareesan’s Hermes Paris belt costs around ₹4 lakh. It should be noted that authentic Hermes Paris belts are extremely expensive starting at ₹1000000 in India. People sometimes buy gold belt buckles and Sabareesan is said to have one.

Hermès International also known as Hermès of Paris or Hermes is a luxury goods manufacturer based in France. In various valuation and ranking studies published by leading consultancies it has consistently been ranked as the world’s most valuable luxury brand. Hermès is a brand that has become synonymous with luxury.

Salvatore Ferragamo

In one of the photos with DMK’s Liquor Minister Senthilbalaji Sabarisan can be found wearing a Salvatore Ferragamo belt which is approximately costs ₹1.5 lakh.

Louis Vuitton Shoes

In 2013 the valuation of the brand was US$28.4 billion with revenue of US$9.4 billion. The company operates in 50 countries with more than 460 stores worldwide.

Gucci Footwear

In December 2018 Sabarisan along with MK Stalin and Kanimozhi had met the Gandhi Family. In the picture Sabarisan can be found wearing Gucci footwear costs anywhere between ₹80000 to ₹4 lakhs.

Scott Sports’ Sportswear

Sabareesan who used to cycle was spotted wearing Scott Sports’ branded sportswear and cycles which cost several lakhs. According to a conservative estimate of the items used during the cycling Sabareesan was riding a cycle worth ₹5 lakhs and wearing a helmet and t-shirt worth ₹42000 and ₹34000 respectively.

Scott Sports SA (formerly Scott USA) is a Swiss producer of bicycles winter equipment motorsports gear and sportswear. The company’s main office is in Givisiez Switzerland with branches in Europe and in the United States South Africa and India.

Ralph Lauren Shirts

Even the ordinary shirts worn by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s son-in-law cost thousands of rupees. He is seen with MK Stalin wearing a ₹35000 Ralph Lauren shirt.

Burberry Shirt

In one of the pictures Sabarisan can be seen wearing a Burberry shirt which costs around ₹34000.

Udhayanidhi’s Costly Cars And Watches

Not only does MK Stalin’s son-in-law flaunts his opulent possessions; his son Udhayanidhi Stalin who is known for his car and watch collections is no exception. It should be noted that in his mid-20s Udhayanidhi Stalin purchased a Hummer car worth more than ₹1 crore and was summoned by the CBI since he purchased the car from an illegal car smuggler. He was made to surrender the car before CBI.

Udhayanidhi’s Panerai Watch

Following the uproar over Annamalai’s watch BJP cadres began circulating images of Udhayanidhi with actress Keerthy Suresh in which he was wearing a luxury watch. He was spotted wearing a Panerai Submersible PAM watch which costs approximately ₹15 lakhs.

Udhayanidhi Hummer Controversy

Udhayanidhi Stalin surrendered his illegally imported Hummer Sports Utility Vehicle to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in May 2013. The investigating agency wanted to seize the alleged ‘illegally’ imported vehicle. A Hummer car was imported in 2007 by Alex Joseph a car importer based out of Hyderabad who allegedly later sold it to Udhayanidhi. From 2007 to 2011 Joseph is alleged to have imported highly-priced cars from abroad to India evading Custom Duties and he counted the rich and powerful among his customers.

Udhayanidhi’s Car Collections

Udhayanidhi has a wide range of cars ranging in price from several lakhs to a few crores. It’s worth noting that MK Stalin stated in his election affidavit stated that he doesn’t own a car. MK Stalin on the other hand drives his son Udhayanidhi’s car.

Udhayanidhi owns a Range Rover Sports worth ₹1.8 crores a Range Rover Vogue SE worth ₹1.1 crores a Land Rover Freelander HSE worth ₹47 lakhs a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado VXL worth ₹1 crore a Toyota Innova 2.5V worth ₹19 lakhs a Toyota Innova Crysta worth ₹25 lakhs a Volvo XC90 D5 worth ₹1 crore an Audi Q7 worth ₹90 lakhs a Mercedes Benz GLE 250D worth ₹70 lakhs and a Porsche Cayenne worth 1.9 crores

Stalin’s Indulgence

MK Stalin the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu rode a Daijo Pedeleze C2 Elite model bicycle which costs around ₹ 85000. Pedaleze is an Indian E-Bike brand that offers state of art features and technology making it all the more desirable and worth the investment.

Before the 2021 assembly election CM Stalin was riding a Merida Reacto bicycle that cost ₹178000.

Behind the north end zone at Raymond James Stadium a replica pirate ship adorned with Tampa Bay Buccaneers colors and logos.

One person came to the mind of Missouri’s head coach as he stood on the field and looked at the ship. Mississippi State coach Mike Leach who died unexpectedly on Dec. 12 after a heart attack.

""I think multiple people said there’s only going to be one Mike Leach” Drinkwitz said after the game. “Just wanted to say thanks.""

Due to the bowl practice schedule Drinkwitz was unable to attend a memorial for Leach on Tuesday. Instead he opted to wear a shirt adorned with the late coach’s image during Missouri’s loss to Wake Forest in the Gasparilla Bowl.

According to Drinkwitz the white shirt which featured a photo of Leach on the front and the Air Raid offensive pioneer’s signature “Swing your sword” phrase on the back was pulled together at the last moment by Missouri equipment manager Mike Kurowski.

“Asked Mike to see if he could pull a miracle off and get that shirt made” Drinkwitz said. “He did and it was just a tribute to (Leach) how much he’s meant to the game of college football and how much respect I have for him as a football coach and as a person.”

Drinkwitz wasn’t the only coach to honor Leach during a bowl game on Friday. During Houston’s Independence Bowl matchup with Louisiana Cougar head coach Dana Holgorsen and some members of his staff wore black hooded sweatshirts with “State” printed across the front.

The shirt was a signature look for Leach during his time at Mississippi State. Houston defeated Louisiana 23-16 in the game.

In addition to his time at Mississippi State Leach also was a head coach at Texas Tech and Washington State. His Bulldogs will play at Raymond James Stadium in the Reliaquest Bowl against Illinois on Jan. 2.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vY2hpY2Fnb2NydXNhZGVyLmNvbS9sbS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1wYXJ0bmVycy1hbmQtc2FhZXZpLWFjcXVpcmUtY29uY29yZGlhLXBsYWNlLWFwYXJ0bWVudHMtaW4tY2hpY2Fnby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L+M Development Partners and SAA|EVI acquire Concordia Place Apartments in Chicago,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vY2hpY2Fnb2NydXNhZGVyLmNvbS9sbS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1wYXJ0bmVycy1hbmQtc2FhZXZpLWFjcXVpcmUtY29uY29yZGlhLXBsYWNlLWFwYXJ0bWVudHMtaW4tY2hpY2Fnby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224E61810>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

And for the Tigers it was frankly more of the same with a sloppy offense once again holding them back while the defense ran out of steam in the fourth quarter.

There were some positives here and there for the Tigers such as the first-half performance from freshman wide receiver Luther Burden.

Outside of that it was a largely dreary night for the Tigers who ended the season with their ninth game scoring 24 points or less.

However that is where the negatives stop because in reality there was nothing about the Gasparilla Bowl that was going to affect the Tigers' past present or future.

Early Signing Day has now come and gone. Meanwhile the February signing period is now quickly approaching and the transfer market is beginning to heat up.

And there isn't a single recruit or prospective transfer who will look at the Tigers' subpar performance from a mid-tier bowl game as a slight against the program.

Rather they'll likely look at it as an opportunity to contribute early on as the Tigers glaring weaknesses were once again... well glaring.

And that is where Eliah Drinkwitz and Missouri's focus needs to be.

Not on a frustrating loss in a meaningless bowl game but on the future which starts now.

And then he thought better of it choosing to remain retired.

Gronkowski had multiple conversations with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers around Thanksgiving about returning to the NFL to help his former team make the playoffs according to the Tampa Bay Times.

STEELERS’ KENNY PICKETT SELF-REPORTED CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AGAINST RAVENS

""It was more of a conversation than anything else"" Bucs coach Todd Bowles said. ""Usually when you have to think about playing you probably don’t want to play. When it’s just a discussion I didn’t think much of it at the time.""

According to the report Gronk was ""bored"" without football and reached out to the Bucs to inquire about playing again.

Gronkowski retired for the second time following the 2021 season after catching 55 passes for 802 yards and six touchdowns.

Tom Brady convinced Gronkowski to end his first retirement from the New England Patriots and the pair won a Super Bowl in 2020.

Gronkowski caused a stir earlier in the week when he fired off a tweet seeming to insinuate that a return to football was in the cards.

""I'm kinda bored"" Gronkowski wrote Wednesday night.

As it turns out Gronkowski’s tweet was nothing more than an advertisement for his partnership with FanDuel.

Gronkowski’s return to the Tampa Bay sidelines couldn't hurt considering the Bucs have struggled to a 6-8 record. Brady and the offense have failed to put enough points on the board averaging just 17.6 points per game.

MSI’s preparing to release a lot of RTX 4070 Ti models

MSI’s latest EEC listing has revealed seven unannounced graphics cards from the company all of which are Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti models. With Nvidia’s RTX 4070 Ti being expected at CES 2023 it makes sense for MSI to be preparing some of their own models.Â

Looking at this EEC listing MSI appears to be building RTX 4070 Ti graphics cards in SUPRIM Gaming Trio and Ventus 3X flavours with all models offering users 12GB of GDDR6X memory. MSI appears to be creating OC and Non-OC models for each of these graphics cards as well as a new SUPRIM SE model.Â

Below are the MSI RTX 4070 Ti models that were reveals through the company’s newest EEC listing.Â

– MSI RTX 4070 Ti SUPRIM X 12GB

–Â MSI RTX 4070 Ti SUPRIM 12GB

–Â MSI RTX 4070 Ti SUPRIM SE 12GB

–Â MSI RTX 4070 Ti Gaming X Trio 12GB

–Â MSI RTX 4070 Ti Gaming Trio12GB

–Â MSI RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 3X 12GB OC

–Â MSI RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 3X 12GB

Rumour has it that Nvidia plans to reveal their RTX 4070 Ti graphics card at CES 2023 and that the graphics card that specifications that are identical to the company’s “unlaunched” RTX 4080 12GB. That means that Nvidia should reveal their RTX 4070 Ti within the next two weeks and that gamers will not need to wait for long to see Nvidia’s next RTX 40 series graphics card.Â

You can join the discussion on MSI’s seven planned RTX 4070 Ti models on the OC3D Forums.Â Â",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXNuLmNvbS9udmlkaWEvc3BoeW54LWFtcGVyZS1zaG93ZXItc2V0LWdhbWluZy1sYXB0b3DSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia shower set gives RTX 3000 a signature smell with a surprise,"Nvidia RTX graphics cards aren’t blessed with a smell we can all obsess over like the Steam Deck vent but fear not: company eggheads have figured out the exact odour of its Ampere range. Y’know… for science.

Pretty much everyone gets a box of smellies during Christmas so Nvidia decided to whip up its very own deodorant and shower gel set to envision the signature scent of its previous generation GPUs. Since the line-up lasted two years before the RTX 4000 series took the best graphics card crown the smell needs to be more timeless than something seasonal like cinnamon or pumpkin spice.

Instead the aroma is more fitting of its green colour scheme as Ampere whiffs of citrus. The Sphynx Ampere range – which is not at all derivative of Lynx (Axe in the US) – comes alive with limonene and citronellol giving it a distinct lemon punch. I never put much thought into what my hardware should smell like before but it makes me wonder whether AMD Radeon would go down the berry route given that it’s team red.

Sphynx Ampere is definitely something you’d want under the Christmas tree since it’s no ordinary shower set. Nvidia tells us that the all-new kit “not only brings you the most advanced platform for extreme freshness that you’ve ever seen it also upgrades the performance of a traditionally uninspiring gift with its hidden secret.”

Next to the deodorant is a power pack that’s designed to charge the RTX-powered Asus or Acer gaming laptop that lies beneath a hidden compartment. It’s the kind of fake-out any parent would love to see their kid’s reaction to as many a teen would set this aside without clocking the chonky size or weight.

Unfortunately Nvidia isn’t going to market with the Sphynx Ampere set so you won’t be able to “rinse with RTX” any time soon. It’s a damn shame too. I can’t speak for the “cutting-edge technology” it supposedly uses but it smells pretty sweet.",,,,,,,,,

Accumulations are minimal but the high winds and falling temperatures pose a danger to those traveling on area roadways.

The National Weather Service has issued a wind chill warning and winter storm warning for both Mahoning and Trumbull counties that will remain in effect until 10 a.m. Saturday. The weather service in Cleveland at 10 a.m. today issued a blizzard warning for Cuyahoga Lake Geauga and Ashtabula counties until 4 a.m. Saturday.

Although no major crashes or incidents have been reports authorities have urged residents to use caution when traveling and to stay at home if they do not have to leave.

The Trumbull County EMA website reports that crews from the Ohio Department of Transportation the Trumbull County Engineer’s Office and local road departments were out treating the roads as soon as the snow started falling.

About 7 a.m. a social media post noted that a tree had fallen across Warren Avenue in Niles. The Ohio State Highway Patrol reported that a utility pole had fallen across state Route 46 near Leffingwell Road south of Canfield closing that roadway to traffic.

Other reports had poles falling across Glenwood Avenue and Boston Avenue on Youngstown’s South Side with a tree falling across a drive in Mill Creek Park.

The temperature dropped about 40 degrees in about four hours this morning with winds picking up speed. Gusts were expected to reach 50 mph. Wind chills are expected to be well below zero by this afternoon.

The Salvation Army on Franklin Street SE in Warren has opened a “warming center” to the homeless and others until 3 p.m. today. The hours may be extended based on need. For more information call 330-392-1573.

By 1:15 p.m. Ohio Edison’s website noted about 36000 customers were without power statewide including some 19 households in Warren Howland Township Hubbard Youngstown Austintown Canfield and Poland. Another 12 households have been hit with outages in northern Columbiana County.

Residents experiencing a power outage should report it to Ohio Edison by calling 888-544-4877 or logging onto www.firstenergycorp.com and clicking on “Report Power Outages.”

Republic Services of Youngstown announced this morning they it suspended curbside trash pickup operations because of the current weather conditions. The announcement which was texted to all customers stated Republic Services will resume pickup service on Monday.

Across the country tens of millions of Americans endured bone-chilling temperatures blizzard conditions power outages and canceled holiday gatherings today from a winter storm that forecasters said was nearly unprecedented in its scope exposing about 60 percent of the U.S. population to some sort of winter weather advisory or warning.

More than 200 million people were under some form of winter weather advisory or warning this morning the National Weather Service said. The weather service’s map “depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever” forecasters said in a statement this morning.

More than 3400 flights within into or out of the U.S. were canceled today according to the tracking site FlightAware causing more mayhem as travelers try to make it home for the holidays. More than 458000 homes and businesses were without power this morning.

The huge storm stretched from border to border. In Canada WestJet canceled all flights today at Toronto Pearson International Airport beginning at 9 a.m. And in Mexico migrants waited near the U.S. border in unusually cold temperatures as they awaited a U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether and when to lift pandemic-era restrictions that prevent many from seeking asylum.

“This is not like a snow day when you were a kid” President Joe Biden warned Thursday in the Oval Office after a briefing from federal officials. “This is serious stuff.”

Forecasters are expecting a bomb cyclone — when atmospheric pressure drops very quickly in a strong storm — to develop near the Great Lakes. That will stir up blizzard conditions including heavy winds and snow.

Among those with canceled flights was Ashley Sherrod who planned to fly from Nashville Tennessee to Flint Michigan on Thursday afternoon. Sherrod was debating whether to drive or risk booking a Saturday flight that she worries will be canceled.

“My family is calling they want me home for Christmas but they want me to be safe too” said Sherrod whose bag — including the Grinch pajamas she was planning to wear to a family party — was packed and ready by the door. “Christmas is starting to for lack of a better word suck.”

The cold also led to a high demand at homeless shelters including in Detroit where some shelters were at capacity Thursday.

“We are not sending anyone back into this cold” Aisha Morrell-Ferguson a spokeswoman for COTS a family-only shelter told the Detroit News.

And in Portland Oregon officials opened four emergency shelters. In the city’s downtown Steven Venus tried to get on a light-rail train to get out of the cold after huddling on the sidewalk overnight in below-zero temperatures.

“My toes were freezing off” he said a sleeping bag wrapped around his head as he paused near a flimsy tent where another homeless person was taking shelter.

Courtney Dodds a spokeswoman for the Union Gospel Mission said teams from her organization had been going out to try to persuade people to seek shelter.

“It can be really easy for people to doze off and fall asleep and wind up losing their lives because of the cold weather” she said.

In famously snowy Buffalo New York forecasters predicted a “once-in-a-generation storm” because of heavy lake-effect snow wind gusts as high as 65 mph whiteouts and the potential for extensive power outages. Mayor Byron Brown urged people to stay home and the NHL postponed the Buffalo Sabres’ home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning.

The man was sleeping in a dumpster when a Republic Services truck on its rounds picked up the dumpster emptying its contents – including the man – into the back of the truck.

Fortunately the driver checked the cameras on his truck before turning on the compactor. He helped the man get out of the truck and called his supervisor Operations Manager Chuck Cantrell.

Cantrell responded by buying the man clothes and boots and helped him find a shelter.

He said if the driver hadn’t followed his training the man would likely have been killed.

It was a true Christmas miracle.

Jets head coach Robert Saleh has stood by Zach Wilson for the entirety of the young quarterback's tumultuous career in New York through two significant knee injuries flashes of brilliance between the lines and several trips to rock bottom.

Thursday night was no exception.

After Wilson was benched in the third quarter of an ugly loss to the Jaguars featuring a horrific performance from the signal-caller Saleh had his quarterback's back once again. Sure Saleh was critical but the head coach also assured that he still has faith in Wilson.

""We haven't seen the last of him"" Saleh told reporters after the 19-3 loss. ""Right now he's just got to focus on finding ways to get better. We've got to find ways to help him we've got to find ways to protect better we've got to find better ways to run better we've got to find better ways to call the game better. We've got to do a lot. It's not just him.""

Saleh's right this is a collective issue for New York right now. The Jets' offensive line was as flimsy as ever against Jacksonville and the run game was nonexistent once again. Both position groups on offense have been struggling late in the season due to injuries and certain players underperforming.

Jacksonville entered play with the 24th-ranked defense in the NFL one of the worst units in football at stopping the pass. When third-stringer Chris Streveler entered the game and was able to move the football it made Wilson's putrid start look even worse. Wilson threw for just 92 yards completing nine of his 18 pass attempts with one interception. He was sacked three times booed off the field on multiple occasions while leading his team to a grand total of three first downs before Streveler took over.

Saleh went on to explain that the decision to call on Streveler was a move designed to provide a spark to the run game. Once he entered the game and started moving the offense down the field—making plays with his legs and arm—Saleh decided to keep him in and leave Wilson on the sidelines.

""We were trying to change it up to get the run game going"" said Saleh. ""Obviously I know Zach was struggling. Streveler came in he ran a couple plays sparked the offense and got the explosive plays. It just snowballed for us in a good way. We just wanted to give him an opportunity to finish that drive. By the time we got the ball back same thing we're already here let's just keep going with Strev.""



The optics of choosing Streveler over Wilson aren't great. A guy who began the week on the practice squad had more success (and was able to win over the fan base) had more success than the No. 2 overall pick from last year's draft who looked uncomfortable and ineffective. It's the second time this year Wilson has been benched at quarterback—the BYU product recently sat for three games watching Mike White carry this team's offense to new heights before he suffered a scary rib injury against the Bills.

As much as Saleh and the organization have been extremely patient with Wilson it's growing more and more apparent that he isn't the answer. The Jets would be sitting pretty in the postseason picture this month if they had received better quarterback play this season.

Instead they're on the outside looking in after their fourth loss in a row hanging on to a slim shot at making the postseason by a thread with a quarterback that can't produce or live up to his expectations.

""I feel like [Wilson] has gotten better"" Saleh said. ""Obviously we've got to go show it on the football field. It's a collective thing. Starts with coaching. Either way it wasn't close to good enough today.""

Durham’s five-page statement of expenditures spans from April 1 to Sept. 30 of this year. The case of Hillary Clinton-affiliated lawyer Michael Sussmann ended in an embarrassing acquittal within this time frame. Another case against Steele dossier source Igor Danchenko met the same fate shortly after that.

Shortly after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election then-Attorney General Bill Barr tapped Durham to lead a separate probe looking into the origins of the former investigation.

More than three and a half years since his May 2019 appointment Durham has brought few cases and only one has produced a guilty plea on a charge unrelated to the Russia probe’s origins. Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinsemith admitted to altering an email used to justify a FISA warrant for ex-Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page who already had left that position at the time of his surveillance.

Two of Durham’s cases that went to trial this year fell apart in rapid succession. The one against Sussmann accused him of lying to the FBI about the reasons why he passed on a tip regarding a “secret communications channel” between the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank a now-sanctioned Russian bank. Sussmann indicated that he was simply performing his duty as a good citizen and Durham alleged that the lawyer had been secretly acting on behalf of two clients: Clinton and a tech executive subsequently identified as Rodney Joffe.

There was no allegation that Sussmann lied about that “secret communications channel” knowingly or not.

Sussmann’s lawyers claimed that the case was an “unprecedented” “unjust” and “unlawful” prosecution of an “innocent man” and a federal jury ultimately found him not guilty. His defense attorneys noted that Sussmann’s connections to Clinton and the Democratic party were well known and they called it implausible that he would risk committing a crime to mislead the FBI about information readily available to them.

That argument was bolstered by the handwritten notes of the interview with FBI agent Bill Priestap who wrote noted Sussmann’s ties to the Clinton Foundation in his notes. Priestap also added a notation that Sussmann apparently “said” he was “not doing this for any client.”

Sussmann was acquitted in late May 2022 just a month into the fiscal year at issue.

In October days after the fiscal period at issue ended a separate federal jury heard Danchenko’s case which also accused the defendant of lying to federal authorities. The judge dismissed one of the five counts before they even reached the jury. Danchenko’s attorney Stuart Sears reportedly told the jury Durham was an overzealous prosecutor who tried to convict his client “at any cost.”

At the time of Danchenko’s acquittal Durham’s probe was known to have cost taxpayers $5.8 million for the periods between October 2020 and March 2022 the Washington Post reported. The new disclosure form first reported by the New York Times places the tally closer to $8 million.

He wasn't awarded his knighthood in the usual way by the Queen after being nominated by 10 Downing Street. His title is hereditary.

He is in fact a baronet the third in a baronetcy that dates back to 1917 when it was awarded to an ancestor who represented London University in the House of Commons.

Sir Laurie's appointment as ethics chief comes more than eight weeks after Mr Sunak became prime minister and there have been claims that the PM was struggling to find a candidate.

Remember the last two holders of the post veteran mandarin Sir Alex Allan and former Royal courtier Sir Christopher Geidt both quit after disagreements with Boris Johnson.

Sir Alex quit in 2020 after finding former home secretary Priti Patel guilty of bullying and then Mr Johnson declared that she had not breached the ministerial code.

Sir Christopher a former private secretary to the Queen quit in June this year after conceding Mr Johnson may have broken ministerial rules over party-gate.

So Mr Sunak has turned to a former merchant banker who serves on half a dozen quangos and whose long business career involved links with disgraced retail tycoon Sir Philip Green and the late tycoon Robert Maxwell.

Controversially in his new role Sir Laurie won't have the power to launch his own investigations into allegations or ministerial wrong-doing. He'll only launch a probe if he's asked to by the prime minister.

That was believed to be one of the reasons Sir Christopher quit but in his letter of appointment to Sir Laurie Mr Sunak wrote: ""I propose to retain the existing terms of reference as agreed with your predecessor.""

So that means Sir Laurie won't be able to launch his own inquiry into the conduct of Dominic Raab the justice secretary and deputy prime minister who's facing eight bullying allegations or Suella Braverman the home secretary over claims of leaking and ignoring legal advice over asylum although both deny any wrongdoing.

Sir Laurie's quango CV includes the chairmanship of Historic England a former trustee of the conservation charity the Landmark Trust ex-chair of the National Trust membership of the Culture Recovery Fund a trustee of English Heritage Trust and deputy chair of the All Churches Trust.

As Historic England boss Sir Laurie entered the row over the tearing down of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol claiming such statues should not be removed but have ""counter-memorials"" placed alongside them.

Besides his quango roles Sir Laurie remains a major figure in the City as a senior adviser at investment banking group Evercore and chairing two FTSE 250 listed investment trusts.

""Laurie Magnus is very much a member of the City's great and the good"" a senior Square Mile insider reveals. ""He was a director of Samuel Montagu one of the oldest of what we used to call merchant banks more than 30 years ago. He's very much a patrician character.

""He was once adviser to Philip Green back in the days when he used to run a stock market-listed clothing business called Amber Day which subsequently went bust.

""Samuel Montagu were for many years the leading merchant banking adviser to Robert Maxwell and oversaw the ill-starred stock market flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers back in 1990.

""I don't think Sir Laurie was responsible for the direct client relationship with Captain Bob but he would undoubtedly have known him.

""Samuel Montagu had the unenviable task of untangling Mirror Group from the rest of the Maxwell empire prior to the flotation which would have given them ample insight into knowing what a scoundrel he was.""

Scoundrels in politics? Never. But as he moves now from business and quangos into politics the next chapter in Sir Laurie's colourful career may prove far more controversial.",,,
ROK,Rockwell Automation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL3doeS1lbWVyc29uLWVsZWN0cmljLXN0b2NrLWNvdWxkLW91dHBlcmZvcm0tcm9ja3dlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Emerson Electric Stock Could Outperform Rockwell Automation Stock in 2023,"The industrial company's shift toward becoming a pure-play automation company is likely to be rewarded by the market over time.

Sometimes it takes a little time before investors reconsider a company following restructuring. At least that's how it looks at Emerson Electric (EMR -0.04%). Management's restructuring in recent years has created an automation company that deserves a valuation close to if not more than its U.S. peer Rockwell Automation (ROK 1.61%). For that reason I think Emerson will outperform Rockwell Automation next year. Here's the lowdown.

Automation and industrial software

There's no doubt that automation is an attractive market to be in right now which is why Emerson Electric's management has focused the company on it. Demand for automation is driven by its long-term cost-saving properties allowing companies to reshore manufacturing from low-labor-cost countries. That's a key consideration as many companies faced significant supply chain difficulties in recent years as lockdowns shut down plants in various parts of the world. The other often underappreciated driver is the incredible productivity gains to be made from the use of digital technology in automation.

In short the explosion of web-enabled digital technologies and analytical capability creates significant efficiency gains for manufacturers. For example consider a manufacturing plant that's been digitally modeled in a so-called ""digital twin."" Data from the physical plant can be used to render a digital twin of the plant and then simulated to predict servicing requirements better reducing valuable downtime.

From this it's clear that industrial software is a key part of the automation offering. Indeed Rockwell has a strategic partnership with industrial software company PTC ABB has a partnership with Dassault Systemes and Siemens has its own industry-leading software business.

Emerson Electric is now focused on automation and industrial software

Over the last few years Emerson has divested non-core businesses (such as InSinkErator) and recently announced a deal to sell a 55% stake in its climate technologies business to Blackstone.

The desire to do so was evident as far back as 2017 when its management launched an audacious takeover bid for Rockwell. The idea is to create a company capable of competing with automation giants like Siemens and ABB. For reference Siemens' digital industries segment (factory automation process automation motion control and industrial software) generated revenue of 25.3 billion euros in its financial 2022 compared to $11.8 billion for Emerson's automation solutions segment and $7.8 billion overall for Rockwell Automation.

The bid was rebuffed but since then Emerson has built up its automation business while seeking to divest its non-core upstream oil and gas-focused businesses.

As for its software exposure management bought software businesses (such as the $1.6 billion acquisition of Open Systems International in 2020) and then contributed them and $6 billion in cash for a 55% stake in industrial software company Aspen Technology.

Why Emerson stock can outperform Rockwell Automation

Emerson's restructuring toward automation means it should command a valuation similar to that of its rival. In summary Emerson is now an automation company with a 55% stake in an industrial software company and a 45% remaining stake in its climate technologies business.

To illustrate the point about valuation here's a look at what Wall Street analysts are forecasting for earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the two companies and what it means for their enterprise value (market cap plus net debt)-to-EBITDA valuations. As you can see below Emerson Electric's valuations look attractive relative to Rockwell's -- one reason Emerson can outperform.

Company/Metric 2022 2023 Est. 2024 Est. Emerson Electric EBITDA $4.378 million $3.907 million $4.274 million Emerson Electric EV/EBITDA 11.8x 14x 12.7x Rockwell Automation EBITDA $1.573 million $1.805 million $1.970 million Rockwell Automation EV/EBITDA 17.9x 17.8x 16.1x

Looking ahead to 2023

Investors will likely reward Emerson's gradual transition toward becoming a pure-play automation company. While this argument relies on relative valuation and Rockwell's valuation may be a little rich Emerson is an attractive stock in its own right.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMi1tb3N0LWFkdmFuY2VkLWNvdW50cmllcy1yb2JvdGljcy0xNTEwNDU0MzYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics,"In this article we take a look at the 12 most advanced countries in robotics. You can skip our detailed analysis of the robotics industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics.

Robotics refers to the design manufacturing and utilization of robots for tasks (in hardware and software) that have traditionally been performed by humans.

A Robot Takeover

Automation has been one of the most noteworthy trends in the world with 31% businesses having fully automated at-least one business function as of 2020 according to McKinsey.

Additionally businesses that had no plans to automate operations were reduced to 16% in 2020 from 20% in 2018. Further according to the World Economic Forum more than half of the jobs in the workflow will be performed by robots and algorithms by 2025.

Conventional wisdom suggests that robot-takeover of jobs won’t bode well for human workers. However it has been argued that the reverse is true with robots reducing humanity’s physical and mental labor while creating new jobs in the process.

The World Economic Forum forecasts suggest that automation will create 97 million new jobs for humans by 2025.

Driving Factors

Robotics offers various advantages in the workflow including consistent product/service quality in manufacturing reduction in operating costs and lead times and higher production output and efficiency.

Another key driving factor is long-term adaptation to the aging human population. In 2020 the number of people who were 60 years or older outnumbered children that were less than 5 years of age.

Those aged 65 or above comprised 1 in 11 people in the world in 2019. Their population is projected to reach 1.5 billion in 2050 per the UN figures with every 1 in 6 people being 65 years or older.

Automation and robotics will play an important role to compensate for the availability of fewer people of working age in the coming decades.

In fact the future is being played out in Japan where people who are aged 65 years or older make up 29% of the country’s population as of 2021. This has led Japan to early-adopt robotics and automation to remain competitive with 631 robots for every 10000 humans in the workforce in the country.

The necessity of automation has also made Japan pretty much a superpower in robotics. The country is the largest manufacturer and exporter of industrial robots in 2022.

Robotics Industry Outlook

The global robotics market is projected to reach $215 billion in value by 2030 growing at a solid CAGR of 23% according to Market Research Future. The industrial automation market on the other hand is much bigger but largely overlaps with the robotics market.

Story continues

According to Precedence Research the automation industry was valued at $197 billion in 2021 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 8.59% to a market value of $413 billion by 2030.

Major players in the two sibling industries include Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) Boston Dynamics Fanuc Corporation (TOKYO:6954.T) Seiko Epson Corporation (TOKYO:6724.T) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM).

Some of the leading countries in robotics are Japan Singapore and the US. Below we list the 12 most advanced countries in robotics.

Most Advanced Countries in Robotics

Our Methodology

For our list of the most advanced countries in robotics we’ve ranked them based on their technology scene in robotics as well as their level of automation. We’ve used data from the International Federation of Robotics especially for the robot density in the manufacturing workforce.

Here are the 12 most advanced nations in robotics.

12. China

China like other East Asian countries is one of the most advanced countries in robotics. According to data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) the Chinese market added over 240000 new robot units in 2021 an increase of 44% as compared to the year 2020. The country had 187 robots working in the manufacturing sector for every 10000 humans in the same year.

This suggests that a significant number of factories in China have implemented automation technologies including industrial robots in their operations.

Automation in the country is covering for the labor shortage due to an aging population while also creating new jobs. For instance 18 professions were announced by the Chinese Ministry for Human Resources and Social Security. One of these included the ‘Robotics Engineering Technician’ a job for R&D in control algorithms and operating systems for robots.

Siasun Robot&Automation Co.Ltd. (SHENZHEN:300024.SZ) is one of the leading robotics companies in China.

11. The Netherlands

The Netherlands is located in Northwestern Europe. It is known for high levels of automation as well as numerous robotics companies. As of 2021 the country’s robot density in the manufacturing workflow is 224 robots for every 10000 human workers according to the International Federation of Robotics.

The Netherlands is one of the pioneers in the most advanced robotics systems to date and is producing leading research from institutes like Radboud University. The country is also implementing AI and robotics technology to modernize industries like Agriculture with its Wageningen UR being the top institute innovating in robotics for agriculture.

10. Denmark

Denmark is a European country in the Scandinavian region. It is one of the most developed countries in terms of science technology GDP per Capita and other indicators. As of 2021 Denmark has 234 robots in the manufacturing-sector workforce for every 10000 humans.

One of the key players in the Danish robotics industry is the Danish Technological Institute which conducts research and development in a wide range of areas related to robotics and automation including collaborative robots service robots and manufacturing automation.

The institute also works closely with industry partners and has a number of commercial projects in development.

Another important player in the Danish robotics industry is Universal Robots a leading manufacturer of collaborative robots (also known as cobots). Based in Odense Denmark the company has developed a range of cobots that are used in a variety of applications including assembly welding packaging and material handling.

9. Switzerland

Switzerland is ninth on the list of most advanced countries in robotics. There are 240 robots for every 10000 human workers in the manufacturing industry in the country as of 2021. It is also home to some of the most noteworthy robotics companies in the world like ANYbotics.

Some of the key players in the robotics industry in Switzerland include ABB which is a global leader in industrial robotics and automation and Swisslog which specializes in logistics automation solutions.

Switzerland is also home to a number of research institutions and universities that are actively involved in robotics research and development. These include the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich which has a well-recognized robotics program.

8. Sweden

Sweden is another one of the most advanced countries when it comes to robotics. As of 2021 there are 321 robots per 10000 humans in the manufacturing labor-force in the country.

Sweden has a number of research institutions and universities that are involved in automation R&D. These include the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm which has a renowned automation program and the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg which has a strong focus on automation and control systems.

Sweden made headlines for Eve a lab robot that is extensively used in automating research processes in the country.

Apart from its own robotics companies Sweden also benefits from the presence of American companies like Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) Cognex Corporation (NYSE:CGNX) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

7. United States

The United States is one of the most advanced western nations in robotics. Its robots to human workers ratio is lower than Germany’s at 274 robots per 10000 humans but the country makes up for it with advanced robotics technology.

Some of the top tech corporations in the US like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) are highly focused on robotics.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) primarily develops high-end GPUs which have been found to have many applications for robotics and machine learning. Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) on the other hand are two of the premier automation companies in the US with a global presence.

There has been a record adoption of industrial robots in the US in the past decade. In 2019 however the trend started slowing down and the decline continued well into 2020 with 8% fewer installations than the previous year. The slow down can largely be attributed to the pandemic and factory closures due to lockdowns.

6. Hong Kong SAR

Hong Kong has an advanced manufacturing and research infrastructure which the country has used to advance in robotics among many other fields. There are 304 robots in Hong Kong for every 10000 human workers as of 2021. Given its population the number of robots amounts to over 224000.

Insight Robotics and Rehab Robotics are two of the most prominent robotics startups in Hong Kong. The small nation also hosts Hanson Robotics the designer and manufacturer of Sophia the Robot.

Long before the era of ""The Visionary"" it was The Age Of The Fall for Seth Rollins. Then performing under the name Tyler Black Rollins climbed the ranks of the independent wrestling scene before emerging as a focal figure in Ring of Honor. There he joined forces with Jimmy Jacobs later claiming the ROH World Tag Team Championships on two occasions. The duo eventually split and Rollins captured the ROH World Championship in 2010.

After building his professional resume Rollins earned a contract with WWE and has since racked up a myriad of accolades. However Rollins' former tag team partner initially had some doubts about him signing with WWE. ""I didn't see him being as big of a star as he became. Gabe [Sapolsky] did"" Jacobs admitted on ""The Insiders"" podcast.

Jacobs also confirmed it was his idea to bring the future WWE star into ROH after knowing ""he was going to be good"" for the promotion. However ""it wasn't how obvious a star that anybody was going to be at that time because that gap of independents and WWE was still strong in 2007."" Jacobs regarded that iteration of Rollins as ""young and athletic"" with a clear passion and talent for in-ring wrestling but didn't believe Rollins had strong enough promo skills to potentially carry a segment on ""WWE Raw.""

Eventually Jacobs joined WWE as a writer starting just days after Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract at WrestleMania 31 to become the WWE Champion. ""It was very beautiful to have Seth win that title right before I was coming in"" he said. ""Then just coming in with the writers and I was in that room for like a half hour an hour before I just go 'Oh look everybody here is really smart.'""",,,,,,,,,,,,

“For those that don’t know in January a lot of things will be marked down to 49 cents to like less than $2” she says in the video.

The video shows her running through different categories of items such as slippers holiday-themed beauty items and other merchandise that she predicts will be available for serious markdowns after the Christmas holiday.

The video was viewed over 5.1 million times with several Ross employees sharing their thoughts in the comments section.

“I worked at Ross for 5 years and certain items markdown to .49 cents because they’re returned” one commenter wrote. “Wash clothing before wearing!”

“I use to work at Ross and although this is true the employees can’t show you [where] all this stuff is because they don’t know as well it really is a treasure hunt!” another explained. “The best way to score is to find items with a RED ticket. Also go through all of clearance. If you go to Ross often and you see the same couple items you can ask to see if they were missed at markdown but please don’t do that if they’re busy!”

“The lower priced items will be holiday leftovers and clothes that have been returned/clearance ONLY!” a third added. “I’ve been working for ross for 3 years.”

In a follow-up video @orlandoqponqueen addressed some of these concerns saying that she worked for Ross for seven years and “knows the ins and outs” of the way stores are stocked and priced.

“I know this video may not get the same views as the other one but I just want you guys to please respect the workers” she said. “Let them work and don’t hover over them.”

The Daily Dot reached out to @orlandoqponqueen via Instagram direct message and to Ross via press contact form.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9saWZlc3R5bGUvdXMtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzLzYzYTU2OTNmNDYxNjNmMzI2MDhiNDViZC5odG1s0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWFyY2EuY29tL2VuL2xpZmVzdHlsZS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvNjNhNTY5M2Y0NjE2M2YzMjYwOGI0NWJkLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas Day 2022: What stores are open on Christmas Day?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.marca.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/lifestyle/us-news/2022/12/23/63a5693f46163f32608b45bd.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226E50550>, 'Connection to www.marca.com timed out.

Ross II passed peacefully from this life at the age of 79 on Dec. 22 2022 in Jupiter Florida surrounded by his wife and two sons. Sam was born in Parkersburg WV on Sept. 21 1943 to the late Byrl and Elinor Ross. He attended Parkersburg schools before transferring and graduating from the Kiski School in Saltsburg PA. He then attended The Ohio State University where he earned a B.S. degree and then on to the University of Washington where he earned an MBA with an emphasis in Finance.

Sam is survived by his wife Susan Storck Ross son Samuel B. “Tres” Ross III and his wife Melissa and their 4 children Braeden Owen Christian and Ivy Ross all of Vienna and son Spencer Brownell Ross and his husband Phil of New York City. He is also survived by his niece Elizabeth Monroe Schuler and her husband Mike and their children Tristan Trevor and Tasha and his former wife Brownell Cochran. Sam was pre-deceased by his sister Janis and his stepson Robin.

Sam was the visionary behind many companies all based proudly in West Virginia. He started his career by opening his first convenience store in 1972 in Parkersburg. Within 3 months of opening his company SBR became a licensee of the Southland Corporation commonly known as 7-Eleven. It didn’t take long until 7-Eleven became the dominant convenience food store chain in West Virginia and Maine with additional stores in Ohio Indiana and New Hampshire.

In 1987 SBR began diversifying when it acquired Woodcraft Supply Corp. which specialized in woodworking tools and again in 1989 when it purchased Simonton Building Products a vinyl window manufacturer that became tremendously successful under SBR’s leadership. But it didn’t stop there! The SBR family eventually also grew to include Hy-Lite Products Style-Mark Fypon and Dixie Pacific.

After selling SBR in 2006 Sam thought he might retire. He had carved out the Woodcraft company and thought he might enjoy spending his days woodworking and growing Woodcraft but as usual his quest for growth just continued. He became involved in the exploration and production sector of the oil and gas industry through Hall Drilling LLC with Mike Hall. He and his wife also pursued their love of horses by getting involved in the horse racing industry through a company called Breeze Easy another venture with Mike Hall. He even purchased the historic Blennerhassett Hotel in downtown Parkersburg to keep it alive for the benefit of the Parkersburg Community. He continued to operate and improve the hotel with his son Tres until it was sold in 2019.

Sam was truly one of a kind. He was not only an extremely successful businessman but he was willing to share his knowledge his passion and his success with all of his employees. It was not enough for him to win; he insisted that his employees and his customers win as well. In the early years of his business career Sam along with his management team at the time developed a standard of performance that they called “The SBR Way” which stated that the employee was the #1 resource to achieve success in any company. This standard was used to guide each of the SBR companies to achieve phenomenal success while maintaining a fun and caring atmosphere.

Sam was incredibly proud to live and work in West Virginia. He was committed to giving back to the communities that had enabled SBR to be so successful and insisted that a percentage of all net income generated from his companies be returned to the community in which they operated through charitable acts and contributions. In 2006 Sam and his family created the Ross Foundation which was designed to support charitable efforts in Wood Ritchie Doddridge Pleasants and Jackson Counties in WV and is led by his son Tres. One of the most exciting ventures so far is the creation of a children’s museum in Parkersburg named Discovery World on Market which is scheduled to open in the Spring of 2023.

Through the years Sam had received several honors and accolades for the many business achievements and charitable contributions he made to the communities in which he operated. This was difficult for him as Sam was always more focused on succeeding than he was receiving public recognition for those successes. Nevertheless he was tremendously honored by his induction into the West Virginia University Business Hall of Fame in 2006 and when he was selected to be a member of the World President’s Organization.

But beyond those who will remember his business success there was a man who will be deeply missed by his family. His son Tres will always treasure the times they had traveling the world together especially their cycling trips through Colorado and France always with wine in tow. His son Spencer will forever be thankful for all of the passions his father introduced him to especially cherishing their first Broadway show together at the age of 6. And throughout the 35 years they were married his loving wife Susan was honored to support all of his endeavors by his side. And Sam’s love for his dogs Connor Finn and especially the recently departed William (“Puppy”) knew no bounds.

An avid outdoorsman Sam was always happiest with a fishing pole in his hand fly fishing out west. He was a voracious reader always inquisitive and in search of more knowledge. And there were few things he loved more than pasta and a glass of fine wine a trait that his children will definitely continue.

Ask anyone who knew him and they will tell you that there will never be another Sam Ross. His legend will live forever through his example of a well lived life the generosity of his spirit and the mark he made on the hearts and values of thousands of people throughout the world. He will be truly missed.

A “Celebration of Life” ceremony will be held at a later date to be announced.

In lieu of flowers the family kindly asks that any gifts should be made directly to Discovery World on Market or the Humane Society of Parkersburg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtsZnkuY29tL2xvY2FsL2N2cy13YWZmbGUtaG91c2Utd2FsZ3JlZW5zLWFtb25nLWZldy1idXNpbmVzc2VzLW9wZW4tb24tY2hyaXN0bWFzLWRheS_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbGZ5LmNvbS9sb2NhbC9jdnMtd2FmZmxlLWhvdXNlLXdhbGdyZWVucy1hbW9uZy1mZXctYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1vcGVuLW9uLWNocmlzdG1hcy1kYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS Waffle House Walgreens among few businesses open on Christmas Day,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtsZnkuY29tL2xvY2FsL2N2cy13YWZmbGUtaG91c2Utd2FsZ3JlZW5zLWFtb25nLWZldy1idXNpbmVzc2VzLW9wZW4tb24tY2hyaXN0bWFzLWRheS_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbGZ5LmNvbS9sb2NhbC9jdnMtd2FmZmxlLWhvdXNlLXdhbGdyZWVucy1hbW9uZy1mZXctYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1vcGVuLW9uLWNocmlzdG1hcy1kYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226E525C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

In the note to Crown and Anchor Society members Brant specifically mentions that the celebrations will kick off on an exciting note by unveiling new fresh and redesigned program gifts along with onboard amenities to recognize members’ loyalty to Royal Caribbean.

However Brant does not specify what these onboard amenities will be or how the program gifts will be revamped in the coming year.

This could be hinting at the gifts award to Diamond Plus and Pinnacle members which receive personalized gifts and amenities as part of the loyalty program; however this is simply speculation.

According to Brant the festivities with also kick off with Royal Caribbean’s first-ever Coffee Talk which is described as a virtual webinar that will be hosted quarterly by the loyalty team. Brant shares that these virtual webinars will also feature special guest appearances from company leaders throughout next year.

Invitations to join the company’s Coffee Talk virtual webinar will be sent in January so Brant encourages Crown and Anchor members to keep a lookout for these in the coming weeks.

Brant also teases more celebrations planned to commemorate the program’s tenure noting these are just a few of the surprises coming in the new year.

Brant joined Royal Caribbean in May 2022 as the Director of Crown and Anchor Society in a role that gives frequent cruisers a singular point of reference for loyalty communication from the cruise line.

As an advocate for Royal Caribbean’s valued Crown and Anchor members Brant expressed her gratitude and appreciation for the memories created among Royal Caribbean’s valued and loyal members within her first year as director of the program.

Brant also notes how moving it’s been for her to witness the relationships built with one another and even Royal Caribbean’s employees.

Covid-19’s Impact

However some of the changes were seen as welcomed and improved changes such as the addition of daily drink vouchers. Rather than serving a nightly happy hour with beer wine and basic cocktails the daily vouchers (up to $14 each) can be used at anywhere on the ship throughout the day.

He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

No tackle no foul no intervention whatsoever. He just fell over. He would not have his goal. He would not be the hero.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

The finding of 'reasonable' evidence to conclude that the U.S. ally had breached international law in its conduct of the war in Gaza was released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday.

It is the strongest statement that the Biden administration has made yet.

But the caveat that the U.S. was unable immediately to link specific U.S. weapons to individual strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.

The first-of-its-kind assessment which was compelled by President Joe Biden´s fellow Democrats in Congress comes after seven months of airstrikes ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35000 Palestinians mostly women and children.

Those were launched in response to Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 2023 that saw 1300 Israelis murdered.

While U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes the report said given Israel's 'significant reliance' on U.S.-made weapons it was 'reasonable to assess' that they had been used by Israel's security forces in instances 'inconsistent' with its obligations under international humanitarian law 'or with best practices for mitigating civilian harm.'

Israel's military has the experience technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians but 'the results on the ground including high levels of civilian casualties raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases' the report said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen the Maryland Democrat who led the push in Congress told reporters that even even though the administration had reached a general finding 'they´re ducking a determination on the hard cases politically inconvenient cases.'

Biden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s war against Hamas.

He has faced growing rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and the onset of famine caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the movement of food and aid into Gaza.

Tensions have been heightened further in recent weeks by Netanyahu´s pledge to expand the Israeli military´s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah despite Biden's adamant opposition.

Biden is in the closing months of a tough reelection campaign against Donald Trump. He faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need.

Rep. Michael McCaul the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the review was unnecessary 'and only contributes to politically motivated anti-Israel sentiment.'

'Now is the time to stand with our ally Israel and ensure they have the tools they need' he said in a statement.

The Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a shipment of 3500 bombs out of concern over Israel´s threatened offensive on Rafah a southern city crowded with more than a million Palestinians a senior administration official said.

The presidential directive agreed to in February obligated the Defense and State departments to conduct 'an assessment of any credible reports or allegations that such defense articles and as appropriate defense services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law including international humanitarian law.'

Nothing in the presidential directive would have triggered any cutoff of arms if the administration had more definitively ruled that Israel´s conduct had violated international law.

The agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they deemed that Israel has acted to 'arbitrarily to deny restrict or otherwise impede directly or indirectly' delivery of any U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians there.

On this question the report cited 'deep concerns' that Israel played a significant role in preventing adequate aid from reaching starving Palestinians. However it said Israel had recently taken some positive steps although still inadequate and the U.S. government did not currently find Israel restricting aid deliveries in a way that violated U.S. law governing foreign militaries that receive U.S. military aid.

Van Hollen accused the administration of glossing over what he said were clear Israeli blocks on food and aid deliveries during much of the war. 'That´s why we have hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that have nothing to do with Hamas on the verge of starvation' he said.

Lawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support an accusation the Biden administration denies. They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific Israeli airstrikes on schools crowded neighborhoods medical workers aid convoys and other targets and restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza violated the laws of war and human rights.

Their opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel´s military and further heighten tensions with Netanyahu´s hard-right government over its conduct of the war against Hamas.

Any finding against Israel also could endanger Biden´s support in this year's presidential elections from some voters who keenly support Israel.

At the time the White House agreed to the review it was working to head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to Israel.

Israel launched its offensive after an Oct. 7 assault into Israel led by Hamas killed about 1200 people. Two-thirds of the Palestinians killed since then have been women and children according to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.

Human rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January in a case brought by South Africa the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it could to prevent death destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

Israel says it is following all U.S. and international law that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.

Biden in December said 'indiscriminate bombing' was costing Israel international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April the Biden administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to Israel if it didn´t change its handling of the war and humanitarian aid.

Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s and early 1990s were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or toward Palestinians.

A report to the Biden administration by an unofficial self-formed panel including military experts academics and former State Department officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys journalists hospitals schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that the civilian death toll in those strikes - such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians - was disproportionate to the blow against any military target."

The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) executive director Kemraj Parsram yesterday told Stabroek News that his agency is preparing to review the written ruling from the court before addressing the permit. He said that while the environmental agency will act in accordance with the court ruling for clarity they are reviewing the judge’s decision and the orders made by the court.

Justice Nareshwar Harnanan last Friday ruled that the EPA breached its statutory duty by issuing environmental permits to the company.

His ruling followed legal action by residents of the Houston community asking the High Court to declare the EPA’s decision waiving the requirement of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as being among other things unlawful and unreasonable.

As a result he ordered the quashing of an environmental permit issued by the EPA on June 9 2021 in favour of Schlumberger to permit it to construct a radioactive substances and materials storage and calibration facility at Lot 1 Area X Houston on the East Bank of Demerara.

The High Court judge also declared that the decision of the EPA to not conduct an environmental impact assessment into the effects of the construction of the facility was illegal ultra vires unreasonable irrational for breaching the Environmental Protection Act Cap.20:05.

Justice Harnanan also granted an injunction against the company to bar it from continuing the possession use and storage of radioactive chemicals at its Houston facility. The injunction is in place until the company can legally obtain a lawful permit under the EPA Act.

The action was brought against the EPA by residents—Danuta Radzik Vanda Radzik and Raphael Singh.

During arguments the EPA said that permission was given for the construction of the facility and not for the operation of a radioactive substances and materials storage and calibration facility.

The High Court Judge ruled that the operation and construction must not be viewed separately. In the court’s view he said the EPA cannot treat the operations independent of the construction permit when it is a condition precedent to the functionality of the facility.

“The court is of the view that it could not have been the intention of the party to treat the operation as distinct from construction for the purpose of licensing since operations can only commence after construction” he said.

Justice Harnanan ruled that the EPA further breached its mandate as outlined in the EPA Act when it took the decision to waive the EIA requirements. He stated that they failed to provide reasons behind the decision for a waiver.

In this regard he also quashed the EPA’s decision of the January 2020 award of an environmental authorisation.

The Radziks and Singh (the Applicants) via court filings had said that they live near the radioactive facility which is also in proximity to schools and places of worship. They contended that the EPA’s decision was made without any consultation with residents.

Against this background they accused the Agency of having arbitrarily made the decision in breach of its statutory duty and contrary to natural justice. They said too that it was made in the absence of evidence was unfair and asked that the Court so declare.

They said there was no inkling that the facility would be used to store radioactive materials or that the request for such a permit was even under consideration. The Applicants said it was not until April 11th that the EPA issued a public notice via the press that Schlumberger wanted to construct a building to house the radioactive materials and that the construction process would not require an environmental impact assessment.

In the newspaper notice which is an exhibit in the case the EPA announced that in accordance with Section 11 (2) of the Environmental Protection Act Schlumberger-Guyana Inc.’s application for an environmental authorisation had been “screened” for “potential environmental impacts.”

According to the EPA following its assessment it had determined that the project would “not significantly affect the environment or human health” and that Schlumberger would therefore be exempt from requiring an EIA.

The applicants however questioned the basis on which the EPA arrived at its conclusion that an EIA would not be required. Their main contention was that radioactive materials should not be used and/or located in close proximity to schools neighbourhoods a main thoroughfare or the Demerara River and that an impact assessment was therefore inherently necessary.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MtY20vaW5kdXMtdG93ZXJzLWFwcG9pbnRzLXByYWNodXItc2FoLWFzLW1kLWNlby1mb3ItNS15ZWFycy0xMjIxMjIzMDAzNTVfMS5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzLWNtL2luZHVzLXRvd2Vycy1hcHBvaW50cy1wcmFjaHVyLXNhaC1hcy1tZC1jZW8tZm9yLTUteWVhcnMtMTIyMTIyMzAwMzU1XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indus Towers appoints Prachur Sah as MD & CEO for 5 years,"Indus Towers said that its board has appointed Prachur Sah as an additional director as well as managing director and chief executive officer (MD & CEO) of the company with effect from 3 January 2023 for a period of five years.

A front door refresh has an extremely high return on investment. The color of your front door can actually say a lot about your personality and style and it gives a glimpse into the design taste that lies behind it. But picking the hue that will set the scene for your entire home can be daunting. Blue is one of the most popular front door paint colors but you could swim in a sea of options. ""Before choosing a color for your front door take your home's existing palette into consideration—the siding trim shutters etc. You'll want a shade that creates a cohesive look"" says Sue Wadden director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams. For inspiration just turn to the landscape: ""If you have a backdrop of trees consider colors that complement nature."" she says. What color works better with nature than a shade of blue? Ahead we're sharing designer-and editor-loved blue paint colors for your front door. These hues are so beautiful you just might be inspired to head to the hardware store for a bucket of paint.

01 of 18 Greek Isles Hector Manuel Sanchez; Styling: Buffy Hargett Miller This cheery front door was inspired by blue skies. Behr's Greek Isles (P510-1) looks good anywhere especially on a white exterior (or an adorable Dutch door). This versatile shade of blue promises an instant smile from neighbors as well as curious house hunters.

02 of 18 Mediterranean Charm Photo: Allison Gootee; Styling: Suzonne Stirling Shannon and Joseph Hillenmeyer's Kentucky cottage ""brings the outside in"" at Christmastime. ""We wanted the front of the house to look almost forestlike to convey what it was like to come inside"" says Shannon. To pull off this idea they piled on thick garland around the door. ""We think it's easiest to start with a ready-made garland hang it and then enhance it with fresh clippings on-site"" says Joseph. A shapely boxwood wreath (free of any ribbons) hangs like a holiday bull's-eye on the bright blue door that's painted Behr's Mediterranean Charm (P510-2).

03 of 18 Drawing Room Blue Hector Manuel Sanchez; Design; Meg Lonergan; Styling: Barbara Schmidt Houston designer Meg Lonergan transformed a 100-year-old craftsman with colorful touches inside and out. If a blue door in Drawing Room Blue (No. 253) by Farrow & Ball wasn't eye-catching enough from the street she also painted the front porch's floors in a fun pattern. ""My house is my laboratory—I like to experiment and play with things"" she says.

04 of 18 French Blue Hector Manuel Sanchez; Styling: Jenny O'Connor Designer Amy Berry made a young Dallas family's dream home come to life. Traditional French blue was the through line in the color palette with ""bright and happy"" accent hues. Clean white paint modernized the brick exterior and allowed the classic blue shutters and door to stand out. For a similar paint color try Greenhow Blue (CW-655) by Benjamin Moore.

05 of 18 Naval Hector Manuel Sanchez; Styling: Barbara Schmidt Michael Pajcic and Katy Debriere built a new home that's full of old Florida soul which included a 360-degree continuous porch that's 11-feet deep and 9 feet tall. ""Because the porch runs all across the front of the home we didn't want the entry door to overtake the exterior"" says interior designer Stephanie Jarvis. She chose a nautical color Sherwin-Williams' Naval (SW 6244) for the waterfront home's front door.

06 of 18 Blueberry Hill Photo: Helen Norman; Styling: Lizzie Cox Artist Dana Gibson's Richmond Virginia home is a master class in pattern mixing. A cheery blue front door in Benjamin Moore's Blueberry Hill (812) is a telltale sign of the fun inside. ""That's what you do with your front door. It's the first image somebody gets of your home so it's important"" she says.

07 of 18 Oceanfront Hector Manuel Sanchez; Styling: Frances Bailey Haile and Ben McCollum weren't looking for extravagance in a beach house. ""Just something that was down-to-earth and easy to manage"" says Haile. She got a little more than ""down-to-earth"" with the 1939 cottage named ""Why Knot"" which had been ""overcome with years of being forgotten"" and was considered a tear-down. However Haile's ""white paint strategy"" was just the cure-all the coastal home needed. She only used three shades on the entire project: Benjamin Moore's Super White (OC-152) on the exterior and interior Sherwin-William's Embellished Blue (SW 6749) on the porch ceiling and Benjamin Moore's Oceanfront (660) on the screen door.

08 of 18 Bermuda Turquoise Laurey W. Glenn This adorable container garden idea is so easy to make yourself. We chose a mixture of purple red white and yellow flowers that all complement a door painted Bermuda Turquoise (728) by Benjamin Moore. Our editors love that it's less formal than cobalt but not as beachy as most turquoises. They recommend using a high gloss finish which looks especially sharp next to a white or cream exterior.

09 of 18 Blustery Sky Laurey W. Glenn We dubbed our 2019 Idea House in Crane Island Florida the ultimate Southern dream home and for good reason. The home's exterior paint colors were inspired by the gorgeous surrounding landscape. The white hue echoes the paths made of crushed oyster shells and the porch's star detailing was ""borrowed"" from a Fernandina Beach home. The antique front door was given new life with a coat of Sherwin-Williams' Blustery Sky (SW 9140).

10 of 18 Waterscape Kay Volmar bought her Florida dream home online while living 1000 miles away in New York City and it was a gamble that paid off. Little by little Volmar renovated the 1912 cottage herself over the course of five years. ""The house was a mess when I moved in so I thought 'What will give me hope?' and I painted the front door blue. I knew it would be my happy place to walk into and that one day the entire home would look as good as the door"" she says. The smile-inducing shade she chose? Sherwin-Williams Waterscape (SW 6470). ""It sets the stage for the rest of my house"" Volmar says.

11 of 18 Parma Gray Alison Gootee; Styling: Elizabeth Demos Monica Lavin founder of the lifestyle blog Lavin Label knew how to dress her Savannah home up for Christmas. ""We want our guests to feel welcome when they step inside"" she says. That warm welcome starts with a cool blue door painted in Farrow & Ball's Parma Gray (No. 27).

12 of 18 Skylight Photo: Laurey W. Glenn Architect Bethany Puopolo created a new take on the classic Southern farmhouse with influences from her Swedish heritage which included a blue and white color palette on the exterior. She chose Skylight (No. 205) by Farrow & Ball for the home's exterior doors.

13 of 18 Blue Sky Hector Manuel Sanchez If you're ready for a front door reset no color is more refreshing than Blue Sky by Sherwin-Williams (SW 0063). ""Preparation is the key to a job well done"" says Rick Watson director of product information and technical services at Sherwin-Williams. First wash grime from your door using a degreasing cleaner; then rinse and let dry. Next lightly sand your door with a sanding sponge and wipe down to remove dust. ""The front door doesn't need to be taken off its hinges but remove or tape off other hardware on it before painting if you can"" he advises.

14 of 18 Gentleman's Gray with Lacquer Photo: Hector M. Sanchez; Floral Design/Props: Heather Barrie (Gathering) Shiny brass accessories pair beautifully with a ginger-jar blue door. Though Benjamin Moore's Gentleman's Gray (2062-20) is a deep black-blue a high-lacquer finish brings out the blue in this example. ""The beautiful blue door surrounded by crisp white architecture made me long for a zesty contrast"" says designer Heather Barrie. She flanked the door with satsuma mandarin topiaries for a fresh splash of orange. Large sapphire-glazed ceramic pots offer a nice boost and tie back to the door's bold shade. Zinnias lantanas and cosmos in citrusy hues pour out of the pots.

15 of 18 Spring Storm Hector M. Sanchez If you've ever explored Charleston South Carolina you know what it means to fall in love with countless entryways just off the street. This door in Behr's Spring Storm (S450-3) stopped us in our tracks. The coastal hue pops against a white exterior.

16 of 18 Oceanside Laurey W. Glenn If you want to add a little green to your blue front door with a turquoise shade Sherwin-Williams Oceanside (SW 6496) is an editor-favorite shade. Not sure yet? ""Sample your options before making a final decision"" says Sue Wadden director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams.

Bass shut down the directive on Wednesday citing a memo she wrote to city department leaders stating that there would be no replacement order.

Garcetti signed the directive on Dec. 11 his final day in office. The City Charter notes that executive directives take effect 15 days after publication and “shall be binding on all departments commissions appointed officers and employees of the city” unless it is “revised or rescinded by the mayor.”

Zach Seidl of Bass’ office confirmed to City News Service that Bass rescinded the order “because there were concerns about the legality of the order.”

Garcetti’s directive would have set up an 18-month pilot program to allow the world-famous sign to be lit up. It called for a report to the City Council at the end of 18 months on the impact of the pilot and its success.

Some nearby residents have opposed the illumination of the sign because of concerns over traffic and safety and potential impact to wildlife. A representative for Garcetti declined comment.

The Hollywood sign turns 100 next year Garcetti noted in his directive. Garcetti said the nonprofit that oversees the sign the Hollywood Sign Trust has “tested new technology that allows the sign to be seen on special occasions at night.”

Responding to neighbors’ concerns the directive claims that tests “have demonstrated how new technologies can focus lights and help reduce the impact of lights on wildlife and ambient lights on local residents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ncmVlbnNib3JvL25hbWUvbWFydGhhLXdhcmQtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Mzg1MDMyOTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Martha Ward Obituary (1942 - 2022) - Greensboro NC - Greensboro News & Record,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ncmVlbnNib3JvL25hbWUvbWFydGhhLXdhcmQtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Mzg1MDMyOTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225EA4430>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Pairing and accenting tips from design experts,"There's an infinite number of greens in the spectrum – but which colors go with sage green?

Decorating with sage green allows you to create the most restful of green room ideas. This more muted gentle tone is perfect for every space from elegant dining rooms to casual kitchens and modernist sitting rooms. 'Sage green has increased in popularity over recent years not only due to its versatility but also as a reminder of our environment. It helps us feel inspired and brings life to any room' explains Helen Shaw Marketing Director at Benjamin Moore.

Benjamin Moore was just one of the paint brands that chose sage green as its color of the year in 2022 – Sherwin-Williams and PPG also opted for the shade – and it's set to be just as relevant in 2023. 'Sage green is more popular than ever! As we seek to bring nature and calming into our lives it is the perfect choice' agrees Noell Jett of Jett Set Farmhouse.

What colors go with sage green?

What makes sage stand out from other shades particularly when you're decorating with green walls is its gentle gray-green tone. Not only does this have a softness that relates to the natural world but it also works incredibly well alongside other colors making it a surprising all-rounder.

We asked interior designers and color professionals for their take on sage green from the colors to pair it with to how to introduce sage green shades in pattern via wallpaper and furnishings.

'What's so interesting is that there isn't a consensus on where sage green should be used – it really does seem to suit every room and aspect' says Lucy Searle Global Editor in Chief of Homes & Gardens. 'That gives you the freedom to use sage green your own way making this on-trend color truly timeless.'

1. Create a layered sage green scheme with plains and pattern

(Image credit: Future)

The easiest option? Sage green goes well with sage green. The painted sage green wall forms the backdrop of this scheme – the color is Card Room Green by Farrow & Ball – but it's the many different inclusions of the shade that make this green living room so interesting. As well as the paint color the curtain rug stool seat and throw cushions all contain elements of sage green in their design.

'One way to introduce a pattern with sage green is to use it as the main color in a patterned throw pillow or piece of artwork' suggests Noell Jett of Jett Set Farmhouse. 'This will create a focal point in the room and help to draw the eye to the sage green color.

'You could also use the color in a patterned area rug or curtains to add some texture and interest to the space. Another option is to incorporate the color into a larger pattern such as a floral or geometric design to create a cohesive and visually appealing look.'

2. Complement sage green with dark wood tones

(Image credit: Little Greene)

Deep wood tones and dark kitchen cabinets are seeing a spike in popularity as people seek cozy and immersive schemes that provide a sense of connection with nature. And sage green is the perfect complement. 'I would say we’re seeing people leaning away from ultra-modernism and moving back towards styles that connect more with nature' agrees Samantha Struck of StruckSured Interiors.

Here Windmill Late emulsion from Little Greene is used on the wall of this green kitchen but Samantha feels tile would have been another great option. 'Wood tones as in this kitchen are the natural partner to sage green. But I really like sage green tile as a backsplash (or in a shower)' she says. 'Glazes hold the vibrancy of this color in a way that pops and adds life to a room.'

3. Pair sage green with pink

(Image credit: Future)

Sage green tends to be a mid-tone shade but it can read lighter or darker depending on the colors it is paired with. Pinks creams and whites freshen the look while deeper tones bring richness to sage green schemes.

If the lighter option is what you're after mixing light wood and pastel pink will bring a freshness that's perfect for a predominantly green bedroom or sitting room.

'A saturated sage green can look soft and whimsical when paired with pastel pinks and soft blues particularly when finished with linen and rustic accents such as rattan to create the ultimate haven of relaxation' agrees Helen Shaw Marketing Director at Benjamin Moore.

4. Use cream as a neutral with sage green

(Image credit: Future)

Sage green is a calming and neutral shade so it can be paired with a variety of accent colors. 'You could pair the color with other earthy tones such as terracotta or beige to create a warm and inviting space' says Noell Jett of Jett Set Farmhouse. 'You could also try pairing it with warmer neutrals like taupe or cream.'

Sage green and white or cream gives a softer impression than navy or black and white but still brings a sense of definition and grown-up style to a room.

'Ultimately the best neutral colors to pair with sage green will depend on the overall aesthetic you're trying to create in your space. It's always a good idea to try out different combinations and see what looks best to your eye' says Noell.

5. Use sage green wallpaper for a prettier touch

(Image credit: Future)

In nature sage green would be punctuated with colorful flowers and the rhythm of repeated blooms in garden borders. Wallpaper allows you to bring that sense of movement and excitement to your decorating scheme while also introducing additional colors in the pattern that can be picked out as accent hues in accessories.

'Your wallpaper idea might simply be a single wall featuring a wonderful sage green design. Or as above you could repeat the wallpaper between rooms – across a dining room and kitchen say or living room and hallway – to bring a sense of cohesion and flow that carries through your home' says Lucy Searle Global Editor in Chief of Homes & Gardens.

6. Team sage green with terracotta

(Image credit: Future)

Sage green can sometimes seem a safe color option but combining it with unexpected tones – as in this bold floral headboard – can elevate the shade to a more assured level.

'Terracotta and ochre are my favorite colors to pair with sage green. Sometimes with pops of rich burgundy red' says Samantha Struck of StruckSured Interiors. She's seeing an increasing number of brands focussing on sage green as a key color in their palettes.

'Article has a handful of living room pieces in the sage green spectrum. Rove Concepts has a couple of beautiful fabrics called Moonstone and Esme that would make stunning accent pieces as well. And Zia Tile makes a statement sage green tile with their Nile cement tile and Kelp Forest tile' Samantha says.

7. Use sage green to bring light or shade to a room

(Image credit: Crown Paint)

When you're deciding the color for any room you'll need to consider when and where the light strikes the wall surface and the impact that has on the color. The mutability of sage green can be your friend here as it appears to change in shade depending on the aspect of the room.

'Although sage green reflects sunlight beautifully it is a light enough shade to brighten up darker spaces such as north-facing rooms' explains Helen Shaw Marketing Director at Benjamin Moore.

In a dark room that doesn't get much direct light sage green can enhance the moody atmosphere without appearing overwhelmingly dark.

8. Don't be afraid to mix sage with greens

(Image credit: Original BTC)

Taking a tonal approach to decorating with green can defy color rules and make for a more interesting green-on-green scheme.

'Olive greens which have an undertone of yellow go surprisingly well with the gray-green of sage and can be offset with the blue-green of a pine green' explains Lucy Searle Global Editor in Chief of Homes & Gardens. 'Really it's about being playful and instinctive with color setting items against each other and seeing what works.'

If multi-faceted green is too much then introduce a brown or a clean cream to add light and shade to the look. 'We love combining sage green with Farrow & Ball's Dead Salmon and/or Tanner's Brown' says Tanya Smith-Shiflett of Unique Kitchens and Baths. 'For a neutral I think sage green pairs best with warmer tones like cream or taupe.'

What colors go well with sage green?

'Sage green is a calming and neutral color so it can be paired with a variety of accent colors' suggests Noell Jett of Jess Set Farmhouse. 'Pair the color with other earthy tones such as terracotta or beige to create a warm and inviting space. Popular choices for neutrals include white beige and gray.'

How do you accessorize with sage green?

There are many ways to introduce sage green in trims accessories and other small accents according to Noell Jett.

'Use sage green in decorative pillows throws or blankets to add a pop of color to a neutral-colored sofa or bed. Incorporate the color into vases planters or other home decor items to add a touch of greenery to the space. Use sage greem in small accessories such as picture frames clocks or lampshades to add a subtle touch of the color to the room.

'For a green bathroom use the color in towels bath mats or shower curtains to add some color to the space.'"

Fans excited to see the trio back together flooded the comments section with messages of love and support.

One wrote: ""MY FAVORITES. ALWAYS AND FOREVER. Please make a new tv series"" while another commented: ""This is what [the] Internet wants!""

Despite his character dying in the last episode of The Originals back in 2018 fans had been calling for Morgan to reprise the part ever since and in June he did so in the spin-off series Legacies.

Klaus has become a staple in the TVD universe which makes it hard to fathom that the character was only supposed to make an appearance in four episodes of the flagship series.

""From the beginning it was always thought that Klaus would die at the end of season three"" Morgan revealed. ""So I would come in at the end of season two season three would be my big season of being this villain throughout the whole season and then the good guys would defeat me at the end of season three.



""Then a few things happened – one was of course the degree of passion with which the fans responded to the character and the other was that I was just having so much fun playing [him] and I always felt that for the character there wasn't enough room to grow in the setting of The Vampire Diaries.""

The Vampire Diaries is available to watch on Netflix.

JEFF KOWALSKY / AFP

While the United States has been paralyzed in the days leading up to Christmas by freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls disrupting transportation in much of the country and prompting numerous calls for caution from authorities Western Europe is experiencing mild temperatures. Frédéric Nathan forecaster at Météo-France analyzes the dynamics at work in this cold snap.

Is the current cold snap in the United States where we have seen particularly low temperatures exceptional?

It is part of events that occur from time to time. This polar cold that is hitting the southern United States is driven by the position of low-pressure systems in the north. It is important to understand that there is less solar radiation in the north in the polar region than in the tropics and that is why it is colder in the north. Depending on the positioning of these low and high-pressure areas we come under the influence of polar or sub-Saharan air. This scenario is permanent it is nothing new.

How do you explain that the scenario in the United States is not producing the same effects in Europe?

The cold air masses that hit the United States passed through Canada and continental stretches. They were particularly intense and therefore that air has been unable to warm up. This explains the records that have been set in the last few days such as the -41°C observed on December 21 in Casper Wyoming the lowest temperature since 1939 the first year that measurements were taken at this station. But again the United States is not in an extraordinary situation and not many records have been broken so far.

Along the Rocky Mountains the drop of about twenty degrees occurred within just one hour.

What is most impressive is how quickly temperatures plummeted with thermometers plunging 20 to 25 degrees in a matter of hours. Along the Rocky Mountains in the northeast of the country the 20-degree drop occurred within just an hour on December 22! After hitting the Great Lakes region the active center of this low-pressure system and cold air is expected to move towards New York and then up to Quebec Canada accompanied by heavy snowfall most of the time.

In Europe these cold air masses coming from the Arctic zone cross seas such as the North Sea where the temperatures become milder.

Lake Michigan froze over on December 22 2022. SCOTT OLSON / AFP

Nevertheless very low temperatures were observed last week in France.

This dynamic does not prevent episodes of extreme cold as occurred a few days ago in France. The natural circulation of air masses on earth goes from West to East. But in some cases this circulation is also reversed with air masses coming from the East especially from Russia.

Former Dancing on Ice contestant Donna Air has fractured her spine in two place.

The 43-year-old took to Instagram on Thursday (December 23) as she shared snaps wearing a neck brace as she laid down in her hospital bed.

She said she's been ""stopped in her tracks"" by the injury but went on to thank her loved ones for supporting her through the tough times.

""Just when I thought this Christmas would be without restrictions - I have managed to fractured my spine in two places.

""I guess sometimes we are stopped in our tracks and reminded yet again to keep it simple looking forward to seeing so many of you when I am back in my dancing shoes.

""Grateful to my nearest and dearest who have kept me smiling these past two weeks especially @freyaaspinalll AKA 'The elf who saved Christmas.""

It comes after Byker Grove actress Donna revealed that the coronavirus lockdowns caused her to put on weight ""for the first time"" in her life.

She revealed last year that she had gone up two jeans sizes since the pandemic began in 2020 by eating cheese and multiple takeaways a week.

However Donna insisted she had no plans to lose the extra pounds anytime soon as she said she was ""quite happy about it"" and embraced her new ""curves""

SO,Southern Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2JldHRlci1idXktbmV4dGVyYS1lbmVyZ3ktb3Itc291dGhlcm4tY28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: NextEra Energy or Southern Co.?,"If you are looking for a utility stock do you buy the hot renewable power option or the one building a nuclear power plant?

On the surface it would seem like NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) and The Southern Company (SO -0.14%) are very similar since they are both large U.S. utilities. Once you get past that top level however there are a lot of important differences. Is one better than the other or are they just meant for different types of investors? Here's a quick comparison.

1. Dividends

When investors look at the utility sector often the goal is to find a reliable dividend stock. Both NextEra and Southern would fall into that category. However they reside in different camps. The average utility using the Vanguard Utility Index ETF (VPU -0.19%) as a proxy has a 2.8% dividend yield. Southern's yield is 3.9% and NextEra's yield is 2%. If your goal is maximizing your income stream right now Southern wins hands down.

That said Southern has increased its dividend annually for 21 consecutive years with an annualized rate of 3% over the past decade. It gets kudos for the streak's length but dividend growth is pretty modest. NextEra has increased its dividend annually for 28 years and the annualized pace of increase over the past 10 years was an enticing 10% or so. So if you are a dividend growth investor NextEra will likely be your choice.

2. Valuation

NextEra's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently sits at around 43 times. That's rather lofty for a utility even one that provided material dividend growth over time. Southern's P/E ratio is around 22 times which isn't exactly low either but it's far more attractive than 43 if you have any kind of value bias at all. That said the average utility's P/E is around 21.5 times so Southern's ratio isn't out of line with the peer group.

For investors seeking a reasonably priced dividend-paying utility Southern gets the nod here. NextEra is most appropriate for dividend growth investors willing to pay full price or maybe more for large annual dividend hikes.

3. The future of things

Electricity generation is changing with a huge push away from dirty fuels toward cleaner and renewable options. Both NextEra and Southern are well aware of this. But they aren't taking advantage of the shift in the same way.

Southern so far has been happy to be a regulated utility that produces power and sells it to customers. Its big effort right now is to complete a pair of nuclear power plants that have been long delayed and over budget. The goal is to have them both up and running by the end of 2023. Given the history of their construction though it wouldn't be a shock if the completion date were moved into 2024. This will provide the company with years of baseload clean energy.

NextEra is really two businesses in one. It owns Florida Power & Light the largest utility in Florida a pretty simple regulated utility operation. However it is also one of the largest wind and solar power producers on Earth. It is essentially using its regulated arm to help support the growth of its renewable power business. This is largely why NextEra has managed to grow its dividend at such a rapid clip.

It wouldn't be fair to suggest that Southern is falling behind the industry as the world shifts toward clean energy but it certainly isn't trying to be a leader. NextEra is a leader. If that type of ESG positioning matters to you then NextEra is the name to pick. If you prefer a company that just plays it safe then Southern will probably be your favorite here.

Dividend growth vs. maximizing income

When you look into these two utility stocks it is very clear that Southern is a stodgy old income stock and NextEra is an exciting income growth stock. Both are fairly well-run companies at least when you look past Southern's costly and delayed nuclear power project (nuclear power plants are notoriously difficult to build). In the end the selection here really comes down to what you are looking for in your utility investment. That said if you paired them up you'd have a nice combination of yield and dividend growth which might be the best move.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vYmlybWluZ2hhbXdhdGNoLm9yZy9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWFjY3VzZXMtYWxhYmFtYS1wb3dlci1vZi1mdW5uZWxpbmctbW9uZXktdG8tbG9jYWwtbmV3cy1zaXRlcy1mb3ItZmF2b3JhYmxlLWNvdmVyYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investigation Accuses Alabama Power of Funneling Money to Local News Sites for Favorable Coverage,"Alabama Power not only generates electricity it also wields power of the political kind. An investigation conducted by NPR and the nonprofit news collaborative Floodlight highlights that fact.

The story alleges Alabama Power has indirectly and covertly paid news outlets in the state in an effort to receive favorable coverage. To do so the utility funneled the money through Matrix LLC an Alabama-based consulting firm that has recently been the focus of news coverage itself as the company’s founder has had an unamicable split with his former CEO.

That split resulted in a lawsuit. According to news reports it’s also brought about the release of a trove of documents that show the inner workings of the company including its work for Alabama Power and by extension its direction of news coverage at several Alabama-based media outlets.

WBHM’s Richard Banks spoke with Floodlight’s Director of Investigations Miranda Green about the lengths the players in this scheme allegedly went to in order to hide the money and their influence.

Editor’s note: Banks has previously freelanced for a company that performed work for Alabama Power.

The following interview was edited for clarity.

What are the names of those news outlets that you allege have been directed by Alabama Power?

Yellowhammer News Alabama Political Reporter and Alabama Today. And the interesting thing about two of those outlets is that Yellowhammer News and Alabama Political Reporter both launched the same week in 2011. And what we found is that the third outlet Alabama Today was launched by the romantic partner of Jeff Pitts who was the CEO of Matrix and she also received payments from Matrix through ledgers that we have obtained.

You mentioned that there were documents that were leaked to you and your team. How did you come about getting those documents and can you name the source?

We can’t name the source because we don’t technically know who the source is. But the reason why we were able to even tell this story is because what happened in 2020 is that Matrix started imploding. The two founders — the two main guys leading Matrix — Jeff Pitts who was the CEO and Joe Perkins who founded the company got into a nasty brawl with one another and they actually started a lawsuit. Pitts left to start his own rival firm and took some of the clients with him and Perkins sued him. And while that happened a bunch of these internal documents started getting leaked to reporters anonymously. So we have spent the last year both collecting these leaked documents but also spending a lot of time verifying them.

How did you determine that there is a connection between Matrix and Alabama Power?

The documents that we have showed direct payments from networks to various different news organizations: Yellowhammer News Alabama Political Reporter and Alabama Today. And in some of those notes it says via Alabama Power. … In addition to that there’s communications that we’ve seen that insinuate that. But also there’s been public testimony. Joe Perkins is from Alabama … and he has spoken openly about the fact that Alabama Power is one of his oldest clients.

Your reporting allegedly found a complex stream of transactions between a nonprofit run by an Alabama contractor and a series of nonprofits linked to Matrix and Yellowhammer News. Give me a sense of how these transactions happened.

So what we found here in this reporting and why this took us several months to get through it is that it’s not cut and dry. Alabama Power [and] Matrix — they wanted to make it very hard for people to find this stream of money. And they did that by utilizing nonprofits and political nonprofits and shell companies to kind of flow money from where they received them to where they wanted it to go.

What did these documents reveal in terms of what the money actually paid for?

What we were doing as we were reporting is first we found these payments. And we wanted to know are these payments just for advertising or is there something deeper here? But while two of the editors said to us you know these go towards the advertisements we’re talking a lot of money here and none of them [the editors] can point to any of the advertisements that this money specifically paid for.

What we also found here which is so interesting is that these publications while seeming distinct from one another — you know Yellowhammer News is right leaning Alabama Political Reporter is more central left — they were essentially echoing the exact same talking points.

Have you or your team found any evidence that this sort of influence continues today?

We’ve been getting a lot of interesting emails and phone calls from people saying that they know that this is more expansive than we even mentioned and that they believe it’s happening in other papers in Alabama … or to a greater extent than we have highlighted which is something we’d like to look into. We know that Matrix is still operating today. We know that Jeff Pitts who spun off his own company Canopy Partners is still operating today. … But there are utilities and power companies across the country and many consulting firms that can do this on their behalf. And so I am sure that this goes a lot deeper.

What responses have you received from Alabama Power Matrix and the news outlets?

Mostly they have all been “no comment.” The news outlets at large have declined that the money influenced their editorial policies but have not commented on their use of the PR postings without explaining [why they used them verbatim without attribution] and have not shown us their advertisements that the money [supposedly] came from. Alabama Power denied all comment as did its parent company Southern Company.

Why is this sort of behind-the-scenes control of news outlets not in the best interest of the news consumer?

There’s a lot of doubt about who you can trust and what facts are. And what most journalists should strive for is to ease that doubt in readers. They want to offer as much transparency in their reporting as possible. … If you’re reading a publication that doesn’t disclose where I’m getting money from that might have an ulterior motive that this actually is just one side of the story and doesn’t offer an alternative perspective — that’s not fair to the reader. And that’s spreading misinformation and it is putting out information as if it’s facts when it is in fact not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2lzdGVyLXBhdHJpY2lhLWRhbHktZGVhZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sister Patricia Daly 66 Dies; Took On Corporate Giants on Social Justice (Published 2022),"Sister Patricia Daly a Dominican nun who as a leader in the field of socially responsible investing took on corporate behemoths like General Electric Ford and ExxonMobil died on Dec. 9 in Caldwell N.J. She was 66.

The cause was bile duct cancer her cousin Edward Conlon said.

For nearly a quarter century Sister Pat as she was known was the executive director and galvanizing force of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment a group of religious orders that used the ownership of shares by their pension funds as an entree to challenge corporate executives to act more responsibly on a range of issues including environmental protection climate change and social justice.

“I don’t use the God card” she told The Chicago Tribune in 2005. “I’m not saying I’m speaking for Jesus here. But if people see the Dominicans and the Jesuits on a shareholder resolution they’re going to say ‘These are people with some credibility.’”

Before General Electric held its annual meeting in 1998 she proposed a resolution calling on the company to publicize the dangers of eating fish from the Hudson River which G.E.’s factories had polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs. To press its case the coalition paid for a full-page ad in The New York Times with a picture of a G.E. plant and upending the company’s own slogan a pointed message: “On the Hudson G.E.

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) today released the latest yearly editions of its Toxic 100 lists of the top corporate air and water polluters and top greenhouse gas emitters in the United States based on the most recent data available from the Environmental Protection Agency.

New this year is the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by the amount that their distribution of fossil fuels contributes to global climate change. This new list joins the Greenhouse 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their emissions responsible for global climate change according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the Toxic 100 Air and Toxic 100 Water Indexes which rank U.S. industrial polluters using the EPA Toxics Release Inventory. The indexes created as part of PERI’s Corporate Toxics Information Project once again include environmental justice indicators to assess impacts on low-income people and minorities.

“The Toxic 100 and Greenhouse 100 inform consumers shareholders regulators lawmakers and communities which large corporations release toxic and climate-altering pollutants into our environment” says Michael Ash professor of economics at UMass Amherst and co-director of the Corporate Toxics Information Project. “We assess not just how many pounds of pollutants are released but which are the most toxic and who is exposed. People have a right to know about toxic hazards to which they are exposed. Legislators need to understand the effects of pollution on their constituents.”

For the first time PERI has published a Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their 2020 supply of products that result in greenhouse gas emissions when the products are released combusted or oxidized. The top five companies on this year’s inaugural list in order are Marathon Petroleum Phillips 66 Valero Energy Exxon Mobil and Peabody Energy. The first four of these are primarily on the list because of their petroleum refining operations although the top two also conduct natural gas extraction. Fifth-ranked Peabody Energy is on the list due to its coal mining ventures. The top four each produced fossil fuels that resulted in 280 million metric tons or more of CO2-equivalent emissions. Rounding out the top 10 greenhouse suppliers are Enterprise Products Partners Chevron BP Arch Resources and Shell PLC.

The Greenhouse 100 Index ranks companies by 2020 direct emissions of greenhouse gasses from large sources. The top three companies are Vistra Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company the fourth year in a row in which these companies were in the top three spots. They each released more than 75 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Together these three companies released 4% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from all sources including non-energy sources.

The rest of the top 10 in the Greenhouse 100 are Berkshire Hathaway American Electric Power Energy Capital Partners NextEra Energy Xcel Energy the U.S government and Exxon Mobil the top company whose direct emissions are not dominated by electric power plants. Among the top 10 Energy Capital Partners has the highest weighted share of minorities living within 10 miles of its facilities.

In order LyondellBasell BASF Becton Dickinson Salzgitter Huntsman Dow Inc Canopus International Celanese Berkshire Hathaway and NOV Inc. lead the Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index which reports the top companies in 2020 in terms of total potential chronic human health risk from toxic chemical air pollutants. Five of these companies are in the top 10 almost entirely because of chromium or ethylene oxide released from one of their facilities. The Toxic 100 Air Index covers both publicly traded and privately held companies such as Koch Industries (No. 58) that appear on Forbes Fortune or S&P lists. The index includes environmental justice indicators that denote for example while minorities make up just under 40% of the U.S. population they bear 68% of the air-toxics risk from facilities owned by LyondellBasell.

The Toxic 100 Water Polluters Index which ranks the pounds of toxics released into surface water or sent to water-treatment systems in 2020 adjusted for chemical toxicity is led this year by Northrop Grumman LyondellBasell NextEra Industries Dow Inc. and Cargill. The Toxic 100 Water Polluters list also once again includes environmental justice indicators that show for example minorities bear 63% of the toxic hazard created by Dow from water releases and transfers to water treatment facilities.

In addition to the top 100 lists search functions for toxic air toxic water and greenhouse gas polluters provide information on all companies reporting releases or production to the Toxics Release Inventory the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program or the EIA-7A coal mine survey. Data related to Air Toxics at School and the Coal Producers Index is also searchable through the Corporate Toxics Information Project.

“In making this information available we are building on the achievements of the right-to-know movement” Ash notes. “Our goal is to engender public participation in environmental decision-making and to help residents translate the right to know into the right to clean air clean water and a livable planet.”

Not only are we seeing record numbers of travelers around the holidays but we’re also witnessing some of the worst winter storms we’ve seen in a long time. While thousands of flights have been canceled nothing seems to be going quite as bad as Southwest Airlines’ situation in Denver.

Southwest declares “state of operational emergency”

As first reported by aviation watchdog @xJonNYC Southwest Airlines has declared a state of operational emergency at Denver International Airport (DEN). This started late on December 21 and applies until further notice. Long story short the airline doesn’t have nearly enough rampers at the moment which is causing huge issues.

Things seem to be going well at southwest pic.twitter.com/5ChyDpAxv9 — 🇺🇦 JonNYC 🇺🇦 (@xJonNYC) December 24 2022

In a memo to employees the airline reports receiving “an unusually high number of absences.” The airline states it has an obligation to customers and to fellow employees to safely and efficiently run the operation so the airline has declared a state of operational emergency.

What does this entail?

Employees alleging illness will be required to provide a doctor’s note on the first day they return to work indicating when the doctor was seen and confirming that the employee was unable to work on the days of the claimed illness; telemedicine appointments don’t qualify and failure to comply with these requirements will be considered insubordination and will lead to termination

The company is denying any requests for personal absence and ramp employees will be required to work their usual shifts; failure to comply will also result in termination

The company will apply mandatory overtime regardless of an employee’s status; if an employee refuses to work overtime they’ll also be terminated

Just how bad is Southwest’s operational performance?

Southwest is performing horribly operationally at the moment. For example on Friday December 23 2022 the airline canceled 32% of its flights and delayed 52% of its flights. So only 16% of flights operated on-time. Ouch. Things didn’t look much better the day before and still aren’t looking good today (though they don’t look as bad as yesterday).

As also noted by @xJonNYC the situation got so bad that on December 22 that a Tampa to Denver flight returned to Tampa because there wouldn’t be sufficient ground staff to assist with the flight. The airline ended up operating a nearly four hour flight to nowhere. Ouch.

this SW flight had to turn around and go back to Tampa as there were no rampers at DEN available for it to land there:https://t.co/P3WJl7EhCB — 🇺🇦 JonNYC 🇺🇦 (@xJonNYC) December 24 2022

A Denver-bound Southwest flight returned to Tampa

My take on Southwest’s operational challenges

Obviously weather is horrible in many parts of the country so it’s interesting how Southwest seems to specifically be struggling in Denver more than elsewhere. It makes you wonder what’s going on in Denver specifically that’s causing this and not other stations.

While I can appreciate that Southwest needs to run a reliable operation this memo comes across as borderline cruel. That’s especially true for an airline that always talks about how its biggest asset is its employees. Southwest executives have long said that the strategy is to take care of employees and then in turn have them take care of customers.

Specific to this situation:

If someone just has a common cold there’s not really a need to go to a doctor so to force someone to go to a doctor’s office to get a note is ridiculous especially when telemedicine is excluded (trying to discredit telemedicine seems like a bizarre move)

The pandemic should have taught us that we should stay home if we’re not feeling well to help protect others; Southwest is encouraging sick people to come to work here

Threatening to terminate anyone who requires a last minute personal absence is awful; so if you have a family members who is suddenly ill or dying you’ll have to decide between spending time with them and keeping your job

Southwest isn’t showing much “heart” here

Bottom line

While airlines around the country are having operational challenges nothing is quite as bad as Southwest Airlines’ situation in Denver. The airline has declared a state of emergency and is threatening to terminate ramp employees for any of a number of reasons. This includes if they call in sick but don’t get a doctor’s note from an in-person visit or even if they need to take a personal absence.

What do you make of Southwest Airlines’ Denver situation? Are any OMAAT readers caught up in this mess?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtdHVybmluZy1mbGlnaHRzLWF3YXktZnJvbS1kZW52ZXItbm8tcmFtcGVycy1zaG93ZWQtdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Declares Emergency In Denver No One To Work The Ramp,"I’ve had several readers ask why Southwest Airlines is cancelling so many more flights than other carriers this holiday and why their operation in Denver is worse than United’s – so it’s not just weather. I initially assumed that the way Southwest routes its planes – throughout its system rather than isolating them with back-and-forths – tends to cause cancellations across the system when there are localized disruptions.

However it turns out they’re having a bigger problem in Denver. There are a lack of employees working the ramp. As aviation watchdog JonNYC reports Southwest has declared an emergency there and it’s extreme. The airline is threatening to fire employees who call out sick without a doctor’s note and telemedicine appointments with doctors won’t even be accepted. The memo begins by referring to rampers’ “alleged” illnesses.

The state of operational emergency that’s requiring everyone to show up at work including mandatory overtime is not working . Here’s one flight in particular that was turned around on its way to Denver on December 22 because the airline lacked rampers to receive it which JonNYC brings to our attention.

this SW flight had to turn around and go back to Tampa as there were no rampers at DEN available for it to land there:https://t.co/P3WJl7EhCB — 🇺🇦 JonNYC 🇺🇦 (@xJonNYC) December 24 2022

It’s unclear what caused the staff shortage initially but one unconfirmed explanation is mass resignations.

Someone reports: “There's a rumor that 100 plus Southwest Rampers in Denver quit” — 🇺🇦 JonNYC 🇺🇦 (@xJonNYC) December 24 2022

However according to the airline

Due to the conditions we’ve been rotating ramp crews to limit exposing our People for an extended period. As this requires essentially double the Employees to turn an aircraft we’ve reduced our operation at DEN until temperatures rise. We’re optimistic today’s and the future weather forecast looks more promising.

Denver has faced extreme temperatures below zero over the past several days though it’s currently expected to rise above freezing this morning.

I’ve never personally seen planes turned around while enroute due to lack of rampers to receive them. Southwest led the world in cancellations on Friday with 1334 or 32 of its schedule (half of its flights were delayed). Denver had the third-most cancellations of any airport across all airlines with 251 though far behind leader Seattle with 363. Already today Southwest has cancelled more flights than other U.S. airlines.

There’s a clear shortage of rampers and some of it is no doubt due to the cold – people can’t stay outside as long in extreme cold so more staff would be needed than normal to handle the same number of flights. But reports from within the airline are that there simply haven’t been any rampers available and one flight was even turned around operating a four hour flight to nowhere as a result.

Southwest is imposing extreme measures that result in crew showing up even when sick as an in-person doctor’s appointment and note are required to justify any absence. Is it even possible to get a doctor’s appointment on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning? And if a ramper gets sick and follows up with a doctor a couple of days later will it be possible to get an attestation that they were symptomatic on their first date of absence? The uncertainty alone with threat of termination could pressure employees to show up sick in extreme temperatures while infecting each other.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYWVyb3hwbG9yZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1kZWNsYXJlcy1zdGF0ZS1vZi1vcGVyYXRpb25hbC1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktYXQtZGVudmVyLWFpcnBvcnQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Declares State of Operational Emergency at Denver Airport,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='aeroxplorer.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/southwest-airlines-declares-state-of-operational-emergency-at-denver-airport.php (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212272F28F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYWVyb3hwbG9yZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1kZWNsYXJlcy1zdGF0ZS1vZi1vcGVyYXRpb25hbC1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktYXQtZGVudmVyLWFpcnBvcnQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

And even if you don't celebrate the holiday you're still going to need a caffeine fix from your favorite café as the holiday falls on Sunday (and Sunday calls for coffee!).

But if you usually head to a local coffee shop chances are they will be closed as Christmas is a federal holiday. So your next best bet (or perhaps your preferred one) is to check out Starbucks. After all few coffee chains make a festive drink or stronger cup of coffee better than the 'bucks. But right Christmas Day is a federal holiday so you might be wondering what that means for a big chain like Starbucks. We've got the answers!

Is Starbucks open on Christmas Day 2022?

Some Starbucks locations will be open on Christmas! Before heading out to pick up your peppermint mocha though know that only select Starbucks stores will be open for the holiday ― which means that not all locations may be open and some may have limited holiday hours depending on location. A Starbucks spokesperson told Good Housekeeping ""We recommend customers use the Starbucks Store locator and the Starbucks App to determine hours at their local stores.""

What other stores are open on Christmas Day?



If you need something more than just coffee there are plenty of other shops open on Christmas as well as grocery stores including CVS Walgreens and 7-Eleven — so you can totally pick up that one ingredient you totally forgot to buy ahead of the big dinner (don't worry we've all been there). And if you're looking for a relaxing bite during the holiday try these restaurants open on Christmas and fast food restaurants open on Christmas so you can spend quality time with family and not have to do the dishes afterwards!

Lee publishes newspapers and other media content in 77 markets across 26 states including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court alleges that Lee’s news-media websites offer users the option of subscribing to newsletters or to newspapers that provide consumers with access to articles and video content in exchange for their personal information including names and mailing addresses.

The lawsuit claims Lee “does not adequately disclose” to subscribers that their personal identifying information is captured by various tracking methods embedded in the Lee websites which allegedly is then transferred to the social-media company Facebook.

The lawsuit alleges that decades ago Congress recognized the potential harm caused by that sort of information sharing in conjunction with video content. As a result Congress passed the Video Privacy Protection Act in 1988 prohibiting video providers from sharing without consumers’ consent any personally identifiable information that is tied to a customer’s viewing of specific pre-recorded audio-video material.

The law defines a “video tape service provider” as any entity engaged in the “delivery of pre-recorded video cassette tapes or similar audio-visual materials” and was intended to protect the privacy of individuals’ video rental and video-purchasing data. In 2012 Congress amended the law to include video-on-demand cable services as well as internet streaming services.

The plaintiffs claim Lee Enterprises “is a video service provider in that it provides pre-recorded audio-visual materials” to customers and that the relationship between Lee and its subscribers is “precisely the type of relationship contemplated” by the federal law.

The lawsuit seeks a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.

According to the plaintiffs in the case Facebook provides tools for web developers to monitor user interactions on their websites and those interactions can then be shared with Facebook. Anyone with a developer’s console tool which is built directly into commonly available internet browsers can then monitor the transmission of data between Facebook and companies like Lee the lawsuit claims.

Although the person monitoring the exchange of information wouldn’t see the name of the Lee customer they would see that customer’s Facebook ID number — which the lawsuit claims can easily be used to identify the Facebook user. The plaintiffs say that one can simply append an unidentified individual’s Facebook ID number to the end of the URL www.facebook.com in any internet browser and that will open up the Facebook user’s public profile page revealing whatever personal information they choose to have featured there.

In addition individuals can allegedly use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos they have watched on Lee websites.

The plaintiffs say Lee’s newspaper websites have been standardized in response to the economic pressures facing the entire news industry. According to the lawsuit that standardization has led to all of the Lee sites using the same software and offering readers much of the same content which in turn has led to widespread violations of the federal privacy law.

“With fewer local reporters and editors working on local designs at the Greensboro News & Record for example Greensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan noted that ‘there are days when you open up the paper and find no original reporting’” the plaintiffs’ petition states. “Rather than focusing on local news the Lee sites are built using cookie-cutter templates and incorporating news and media from across the country.”

The lawsuit seeks payment of $2500 to each class member participating in the lawsuit plus damages and attorneys’ fees.

Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Calls and emails to Lee’s corporate office and to Lee’s contracted communications firm were not answered Thursday.

In seeking class-action status for the case the plaintiffs allege there are more than 100 potential class members and that the aggregate amount of money in controversy exceeds $5 million. So far the plaintiffs in the case include Brittney Stoudemire of Alabama; Amanda Vose of Massachusetts; Lucinda Jackson of Ohio; Barbara Grazioli of New Jersey; Dana Foley of Illinois; and Douglas Castle of Indiana.

LOUIS — A St. Louis County woman faces murder charges after police say she tracked her stolen Hyundai to a gas station and killed two men during a shootout.

Demesha Coleman 35 was charged Thursday in the deaths of Darius Jackson 19 and Joseph Farrar 49. They were shot dead outside a Speedie Gas near North Broadway Street and Riverview Boulevard just after 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.

Another man was shot in the head but survived.

It was not immediately clear which if any of the three men were suspected of stealing the Hyundai.

Coleman was captured on surveillance footage walking up to a Hyundai Tucson in the gas station parking lot a detective wrote. She was with a man police have not publicly identified but officers said they were both carrying guns.

She’s seen opening the front passenger door of the Tucson with her gun raised while the man opens the driver’s side door with his gun raised police wrote. Coleman opened fire and a shootout followed.

Coleman of the Spanish Lake area of St. Louis County told detectives during a recorded interview that she went to the gas station to take her stolen car back then identified herself on the footage according to court documents.

Farrar was shot in the torso and police found him next to a gas pump. Jackson was on the ground next to the Tucson and had also been shot in the torso police wrote.

The third man was found on the far end of the gas station parking lot and had been shot in the head. He was taken to Barnes-Jewish Hospital.

Coleman is charged with two counts of murder one count of assault and three counts of armed criminal action in the shooting. She had no prior criminal history.

Wednesday’s killings mark the latest incident of victims tracking down their stolen vehicles as the number Kia and Hyundai thefts surged in the St. Louis region.

On Halloween police say a man used GPS to track down a family member’s stolen car in Sunset Hills and shot at the suspects on U.S. Highway 40 (Interstate 64). The man and some of the theft suspects were arrested.

That same day two teenage boys were shot after stealing a woman’s Kia from her home in north St. Louis. The woman tracked down her stolen car to two different locations before the teens were shot and police said it was unclear who did the shooting.

And earlier this month a 43-year-old man was shot and killed outside a gas station while confronting teenagers he believed had stolen his vehicle.

Rates of stolen Kias and Hyundais have exploded this year — a trend also seen nationally because of a viral TikTok video that shows how to break into and drive off in the South Korean-made vehicles using just a screwdriver and a USB charging cable. The method can be used on some models of those cars because manufacturers did not install engine immobilizers an electric anti-theft security device.

The thefts have overwhelmed the city’s police department.

St. Louis city counselor Sheena Hamilton sent a letter Aug. 19 to Kia and Hyundai demanding the companies take responsibility for the thefts and threatened a lawsuit over the defect.

Kia and Hyundai attorneys noted in their response to the city the security device is not federally required.

In September Jones said in a statement that city attorneys would meet with the manufacturers to discuss their ideas and determine the next steps.

City spokesman Nick Dunne on Friday said there was no update to provide on the city’s discussions with the manufacturers.

In the county where rates have also ballooned police agencies are pursuing a joint task force to combat vehicle thefts."

The monthly dynamics of steel production in European countries in November 2022 was downward.

Ukraine according to Ukrmetalurgprom in November 2022 produced 313 thousand tons of steel which is almost 1.6% less compared to October 2022.

According to WorldSteel data French steelmakers in November 2022 cut steel production by 6.2% m/m – to 910 thousand tons. Spain in this period cut steel production by 6.4% m/m – to 855 thousand tons.

Italian steel enterprises according to Federacciai in November 2022 cut steel production by 7.9% compared to the previous month – to 1.85 million tons.

Germany’s steel production in November 2022 according to the report of the German steel association WV Stahl fell by 11.8% m/m – to 2.77 million tons.

Simultaneously Belgium increased steel production by 25% m/m in this period – up to 520 thousand tons.

In general steel production in EU countries in November 2022 fell by 17.9% year-on-year – to 10.5 million tons. In January-November 2022 this indicator decreased by 10.1% y/y – to 127.4 million tons.

Turkiye in turn in November 2022 reduced steel production by 22.4% m/m. Compared to November 2021 the country’s steelmakers reduced steel production by 34.3%.

In 11 months of 2022 according to industry associations and WorldSteel leading steel producers reduced production (in an annual terms):

Germany – by 7.9% to 34.16 million tons;

Turkiye – by 12.3% to 32.4 million tons;

Italy – by 11.2% to 20.35 million tons;

France – by 11.6% to 11.44 million tons;

Spain – by 19.2% to 10.77 million tons;

Belgium – by 0.8% to 6.27 million tons;

Ukraine – by 68.6% to 6.16 million tons.

European steelmakers are massively reducing or stopping production against the background of rising electricity tariffs. At the same time they are forced to compete with steel imports from countries which producers have lower electricity costs and do not pay costs for carbon emissions.

In addition European producers stop blast furnaces or postpone their start-up after major repairs or stoppage of work. In particular ArcelorMittal Poland recently postponed the restart of blast furnace №3 at the Dombrova-Gurnych plant at the beginning of January 2023. The employees of the enterprise are afraid of the final shutdown of the blast furnace.

In Turkiye since September of this year the prices of gas and electricity for industry have increased by 50%. Currently according to the Turkish Association of Steel Manufacturers (TCUD) share of energy resources in the total production costs of Turkish seelmakers increased to 28-30%. At the same time capacity utilization has dropped from 75% to less than 60% as local producers cut shifts or shut down operations.

The low production of Ukrainian steelmakers is connected with logistical problems the unfavorable situation of the world market as well as with the destruction due to hostilities of the two largest enterprises of Ukrainian iron and steel industry – Azovstal and Ilyich Iron and Steel Works of Mariupol.

As GMK Center reported earlier global steel production in November 2022 decreased by 2.6% compared to the same period in 2021 – to 139.1 million tons. This is evidenced by the global rating of 64 steel-producing countries of the World Steel Association. Total steel production in the CIS countries and Ukraine fell by 24.6% y/y in this period –to 6.5 million tons.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The rise of digital infrastructure investing has been swift in recent years with alternative asset managers such as Brookfield Asset Management KKR & Co. and Blackstone Inc. jockeying for assets.

AT&T CEO John Stankey is bullish on fiber as a path to long-term growth since it provides some of the largest capacity and highest potential speed of any broadband connection. That gives fiber-optic lines a longer-term viability than copper wire or wireless connections. But the wiring costs are high and require a huge investment in labor and equipment.

Between the 4G and 5G variants of the device Samsung was expecting to ship 30 million units in 2023 or roughly 10% of the total number of smartphones the company is expected to deliver in 2022. However an undisclosed issue with the phone related to the 50MP camera on the back of the device has led Samsung to cut deliveries of the Galaxy A23 5G.





Instead of shipping 12.6 million units of the Galaxy A23 5G this year Sammy is now planning to put less than 4 million units in transit. That works out to nearly a 70% reduction in shipments of this model. The 4G version of the phone which was introduced earlier this year should see no change to the 17.1 million units Samsung said that it would deliver in 2022. The Galaxy A23 5G was released in the second half of this year.





Samsung has never explained what the issue was with the Galaxy A23 5G. The manufacturer changed some of its suppliers for the phone and Sunny Optical was selected to provide the 50MP primary camera that features optical image stabilization (OIS). Partron supplied the 4G version of the phone with the same parts. To be clear Samsung is not blaming Sunny Optical for what has transpired.









An unrevealed problem caused other components found on the phone like the camera to work poorly. After investigating the problem for a month during which it spoke with its suppliers Samsung told Sunny Optical that while it was in the clear the China-based supplier should have reacted quicker.





Even though Samsung did eventually discover what the problem was it decided to reduce shipments of the phone because of the headache that the 5G model caused. Next year Samsung plans on producing only 5 million units of the phone.





The Galaxy A23 5G features a 6.6-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1080 x 2400. Under the hood is the 6nm Snapdragon 695 a mid-range chipset designed by Qualcomm. The phone is equipped with 4GB of memory 64 GB of storage and a microSD slot for those needing additional storage.





Besides the 50MP primary camera with OIS the array on the back includes a 5MP ultra-wide camera a 2MP Macro camera for extreme close-ups and a 2MP depth sensor. In front you'll find an 8MP camera for selfies and video chats. The 5000mAh battery keeping the lights on charges at 25W. And this phone does sport a 3.5mm earphone jack.







In the U.S. the Galaxy A23 5G is available from AT&T T-Mobile Metro by T-Mobile Cricket and Boost Mobile. StraightTalk has the phone available for $149.99 which is half of the $299.99 manufacturer's suggested retail price.

Subcontractors have sued China Mobile International for allegedly failing to pay for work on a data center in San Jose.

In lawsuits first reported by The Mercury News Rosendin Electric said that it was out $7.5 million for electrical work Southland Industries said it was owed $2.7m for numerous tasks Sunsteel said it was missing $1m and Alcal Glass Systems said it was owed $113000.

China Mobile was denied an application by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide telecoms services in the US back in 2019.

The next year then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order blocking US companies and citizens from owning shares in businesses the military said had links to the Chinese army. This included China Mobile.

Since it was established in 2011 Absci’s ambition has encompassed partnering with large biopharmas to use its artificial intelligence (AI) drug discovery platform to help them design better biologics faster.

But this past year Absci has also concluded that becoming the Google of protein-based drug discovery and biomanufacturing also entails developing its own therapeutics.

“We’ve decided to start to build out our own pipeline as well because we really believe so much in the platform that it makes a whole lot of sense to start developing out some of our own assets as well” McClain said. “So we are both developing our own assets but then additionally continuing to rapidly grow the partnerships with large pharma and biotech.”

Absci carries out drug discovery through its own Integrated Drug Creation™ platform which integrates AI and synthetic biology among other technologies with the aim of helping users identify novel drug targets discover optimal biotherapeutic candidates and generate the cell lines to manufacture them [See below].

The platform is intended to help biopharmas accelerate drug development timelines and decrease attrition in early R&D. In August Absci researchers posted a preprint on bioRxiv reporting that the Integrated Drug Creation platform rapidly and simultaneously optimized the affinity and naturalness of the HER2-binding antibody trastuzumab (the breast cancer treatment marketed by Roche and its Genentech subsidiary as Herceptin®) in silico using generative AI.

“Additional properties could be added alongside data from their respective assays such as conditional pH binding effector function melting temperature self-aggregation viscosity and more” the researchers asserted. “Harmonizing antibody optimization and de novo generation may be the next big step in data-driven therapeutic design.”

McClain said the preprint showed Absci’s Integrated Drug Creation platform could be used for multi-parametric modeling of antibodies: “You can model for the affinity of the antibody simultaneously with developability attributes as well as what we call naturalness which we have shown is inversely correlated to mutagenicity. You can do that in one shot and you don’t have to go through an iterative process.”

Increasing the success rate

“This is what’s going to really dramatically shorten the time it takes to get drugs into the clinic and ultimately help with increasing the success rate because you’re no longer having to give up one attribute for another. You can get all the attributes that you want all at the same time and progress those into the clinic” McClain added. “This was a really big breakthrough for how drug development is done and also a big breakthrough in just showing how generative AI can be used in drug discovery and how it can be used to really change the paradigm of how we do drug development.”

Absci reasons that its partnership efforts will be strengthened by having its own pipeline by demonstrating to large biopharma partners that Absci can also develop its own assets.

“It also shows that we can take drugs to proof of concept” McClain said. “The more drugs that we that are developed with our platform that show proof of concept it’s only going to drive more and more partnerships and so I think it builds a lot of credibility within our partnerships. I see it as actually a huge huge benefit of developing our own pipeline just that credibility factor.”

Absci’s pipeline consists of 17 programs most of them focused on cell line development. Ten of those programs began in 2022 exceeding the company’s investor guidance which called for eight such programs launching this past year.

Absci won’t say what therapeutic areas or modalities it is pursuing saying the company will disclose that information in 2023. However McClain did say that Absci’s pipeline will include both wholly-owned candidates and candidates developed through partneships with larger biopharmas.

“We’ll take it to proof of concept in the clinic and then out-license it or sell the asset at that point in time” he said.

The company’s dual focus on manufacturing and drug development is reflected in its nearly year-old partnership with Merck & Co. launched in January 2022 and consisting of up to two collaborations.

One entails applying the Integrated Drug Creation platform to develop production cell lines for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) candidates with Merck retaining the option to nominate up to three targets and enter into a drug discovery collaboration agreement. Upon Merck exercising that option Absci would be eligible to receive up to $610 million in upfront fees and milestone payments for all three targets as well as research funding and tiered royalties on sales.

“With the target elections for the drug discovery those discussions are ongoing and you’re definitely going to be hearing more about that in the future” McClain vowed.

In the other Absci-Merck collaboration Absci is deploying its Bionic Protein™ non-standard amino acid (nsAA) technology for targeted incorporation of non-standard amino acids in return for unspecified upfront and certain other milestone payments.

Technical milestone

During the third quarter Absci disclosed achieving a technical milestone in the Merck nsAA collaboration that according to McClain accounted for a majority of the $2 million that Absci reported in technology development revenue during Q3. Absci isn’t specifying exactly how much or detailing the milestone.

“That program has actually been progressing faster than we anticipated” McClain said. “We couldn’t be more excited about where we sit with that program. It’s progressing extremely well and ahead of schedule.”

Merck is one of a handful of partners disclosed by Absci. Others include:

Alpha Cancer Technologies  to which Absci licensed its license its E. coli SoluPro ® protein expression technology for the production of Recombinant Human Alpha-fetoprotein (hAFP) in 2020.

 to which Absci licensed its license its E. coli SoluPro protein expression technology for the production of Recombinant Human Alpha-fetoprotein (hAFP) in 2020. EQRx with which Absci is jointly engineering and developing “several” clinical candidates across therapeutic areas that include oncology and immunology. The discovery partnership combines EQRx’s clinical development expertise and commercial capabilities with Absci’s Drug Creation™ technology with the goal of advancing next-generation protein-based therapeutics at lower cost.

with which Absci is jointly engineering and developing “several” clinical candidates across therapeutic areas that include oncology and immunology. The discovery partnership combines EQRx’s clinical development expertise and commercial capabilities with Absci’s Drug Creation™ technology with the goal of advancing next-generation protein-based therapeutics at lower cost. PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals with which Absci is partnering to create a customized cell line to enable high-yield commercial production of an unspecified PhaseBio clinical candidate. The collaboration has remained active though PhaseBio filed in October reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and has named Chiesi Farmaceutici as lead bidder with a minimum “floor” bid of up to $100 million at a future auction of assets that include lead candidate bentracimab (PB2452).

In July Absci announced a partnership with an undisclosed “stealth-mode company” that has developed novel proprietary warhead linker chemistries that it will target to specified sites on subject antibodies using Absci’s Bionic Protein technology. Under the collaboration whose value is also undisclosed Absci has agreed to generate up to seven novel Bionic Antibodies™ incorporating nsAAs as the companies partner on discovery and development of ADCs initially for oncology indications.

Absci expects its list of biopharma partners to grow in the 2023: “We are into really great discussions with other marquee pharma partners just like Merck.”

Is 2023 too soon to talk about one of Absci’s pipeline candidates getting into the clinic?

“I can’t disclose that. But I would say yeah it’s probably a little early” McClain said.

To oversee development of its own pipeline Absci has hired Andreas Busch PhD to lead its R&D and technical operations as well as its internal and partnered drug development programs as Chief Innovation Officer.

A veteran biopharma executive Busch previously held positions at Cyclerion Therapeutics as chief scientific officer and chief innovation officer and head of the innovation center. Earlier he served as executive vice president head of research & development and chief scientific officer at Shire before its acquisition by Takeda. Before Shire he held several senior leadership positions at Bayer most recently executive vice president and head of Global Drug Discovery for Bayer Pharma and earlier was Global Head of Cardiovascular Research at Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis (now Sanofi).

What attracted Absci to Busch was his record of shepherding more than 10 drugs through clinical development to approval. “Andreas brings world-class R&D expertise to our executive leadership team and continues our momentum toward Absci’s next phase of growth” McClain said.

Restructuring operations

That next phase began in August 2022 with a restructuring of operations that resulted in Absci eliminating jobs and honing its operations to focus on key technical initiatives including AI drug and target discovery.

Absci won’t say how many jobs or what percentage of its workforce it eliminated or how much in charges against earnings it has taken to account for the reorganization.

“We were getting much more efficient on the cell line development side of the organization especially with the integration of AI and we saw that we didn’t need some of the R&D programs that were going on with the cell line development and we had enough capacity for the growth that we had” McClain explained. “We doubled down on our generative AI drug creation platform and really went all in on that and then building that out as well as progressing our own assets into the clinic.”

Absci says the reorganization extended its cash and cash equivalents beyond earlier guidance of the end of 2024 enough to fund its operations into late 2025. The company used $19 million in cash for Q3 operating activities accounting for part of its 48% quarter-to-quarter drop in cash and cash equivalents which stood at $107.324 million as of September 30—down from $206.021 million as of June 30 and $252.569 million as of December 31 2021.

However during Q3 Absci gained $73.988 million in short-term investments giving the company $181.312 million in assets toward funding operations. And for all of 2022 Absci has trimmed its expected total net decrease in cash and cash equivalents short-term investments and restricted cash to approximately $105 million vs. an earlier estimate of $110 million. The figure includes one-time time-based disbursements totaling $10.5 million from restricted cash associated with Absci’s acquisitions of AI platform developer Denovium and antibody and target discovery technology developer Totient paid in the first half of 2022.

Publicly-traded Absci finished the third quarter with a net loss of $27.259 million up from a net loss of $23.654 in the year-ago quarter on total revenue that rose 54% to $2.369 million from $1.539 million in Q3 2021. For the first three quarters of 2022 Absci’s net loss jumped 75% year-over-year to $85.657 million from $48.982 million.

Absci went public in July 2021 through an initial public offering that generated approximately $210 million in net proceeds at the tail end of an historic bull market for biotechs. Three months later Absci opened a new 85000-square-foot headquarters in Vancouver WA where the company has been based since 2016. McClain founded Absci in 2011 from a tiny basement lab where he began pursuing a vision of revolutionizing the development of protein-based drugs by using DNA to program E. coli bacteria.

Pursuing AI talent

On the East Coast Absci has bolstered its AI capabilities—and moved toward its goal of de novo drug and cell line design entirely in silico—by opening the Absci AI Research Lab in New York City. The New York AI team is roughly 15–20 scientists of which half are based at the lab located on the 43rd floor of Carnegie Hall Tower which boasts panoramic views of Central Park; the rest work remotely.

“What really encouraged us to open up an office here in New York is the AI talent that’s here” McClain said. “Meta is here. Google is here a lot. [AI startup] Hugging Face is here. There’s just an abundance of AI talent that is here in the city. Being able to recruit talent here has definitely made it a lot easier having an office space to house the collaboration of the team.”

Meta’s vice president of connectivity Dan Rabinovitsj joined Absci’s board in November: “We are seeing tech companies get more and more interested in drug development or discovery biotech/life sciences. And I think that in the future I think that you could see some really interesting partnerships emerge with large tech companies as well. So having someone like Dan who is a senior executive at one of the large tech companies in particular Meta or Facebook we saw as a huge huge advantage.”

Other strengths Rabinovitsj brings to Absci McClain said include his experience rapidly scaling the work of tech organizations as an executive and his ability to navigate large tech organizations for recruiting efforts. Absci and other AI-based startups have benefited from talent leaving Meta which in November announced plans to lay off 13% of its staff or more than 11000 people.

AI specifically support for the Integrated Drug Creation platform is one area of projected job growth for Absci in 2023 along with key hires to Busch’s drug discovery team. The company isn’t specifying how much its workforce will grow beyond its current size of about 200 employees (Absci reported 212 employees all but one full-time as of December 31 2021 according to its Form 10-K annual report for 2021 filed in March.

“At the end of the day the team is everything and we just have one of the best teams. And it’s just an amazing team that has really built an amazing platform that is really going to be able to help us see the vision through which is developing biologics at a click of button” McClain said.

He and Absci have high hopes for the team in 2023.

“You’re going to see continued innovation on the AI drug creation side. You’re going to see development and publications come out on where we set on our de novo AI platform. And then additionally you’re going to see continued growth on the partnership side more marquee deals like the ones with Merck and I think some progress on our own pipeline as well” McClain added. “We’re in for a really exciting 2023. I couldn’t be more thrilled with the direction we’re going as a company the progress we’ve made.”

“To make generative AI drug creation actually work and see our vision through you have to have that perfect integration of wet lab and wet lab technology along with the AI and the AI scientists and being able to collaborate in a very well-oiled fashion and we really have that.”

If you want to see more stocks in this selection go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.

A monopoly is defined as a market arrangement in which a single seller dominates the market and offers a unique product. In its purest form a monopoly has a 100% share of the market. Numerous industries are dominated by prominent players with significant market shares. These firms enjoy economies of scale and create barriers to entry for any new potential player to come up and break their domination. Companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have entered a sector and absorbed a sizeable amount of the market share are considered near-monopolies. These businesses frequently diversify their product lines in order to increase market share and revenue. Although the businesses allow some room for competition they yield significant market power over the industry.

Monopolies enjoy strong pricing power and famous investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett considers it a factor when he shortlists a stock for his portfolio that is followed and tracked by millions of investors globally. Back in 2011 when the Oracle of Omaha was asked to testify in front of the US Congress and provide the reason for investing in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) he highlighted that pricing power is one of the most integral criteria for evaluating a business. He added that if a business can increase prices without losing its market share to an industry peer it has a strong business model. Moody's along with two other credit rating agencies owns 95% of the credit rating market. The New York-based entity is still the eighth biggest investment in the portfolio of Omaha Nebraska-diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B) with a value of nearly $6 billion as of Q3 2022.

Interestingly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest holding in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway with a value of over $123.6 billion as of Q3 2022. The tech giant holds a monopoly or near monopoly position in numerous industries. Meanwhile American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is the fifth biggest investment in the portfolio of Warren Buffett. The New York-based company provides credit and debit cards along with Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Together these three entities hold a 99% share in the credit and debit card industry. All these monopolies or near-monopolies generate healthy profits and receive a positive response from experts. Another example is Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which occupies the fourth biggest position in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway. Together with PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) these three companies hold a market share of 57% in the soda industry.

A popular misconception has emerged about Elon Musk and Tesla: The megabillionaire’s love affair with Twitter is the main reason Tesla shares have lost so much value this year. But Tesla’s steep stock selloff this week proved that the problems at Musk’s car company go well beyond Twitter.

Even as Musk signals he may give up his CEO title at Twitter investors became concerned that the outlook for Tesla’s sales and profit is taking a turn for the worse. A sign of the weakening demand: Tesla has announced a rare sale. The company offered two rebates for buyers who take delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year initially offering a $3750 discount earlier this month. Tesla then doubled that rebate to $7500 Thursday.

“Tesla clearly is starting to see demand cracks in China and in the US at a time that EV competition is increasing across the board” said Dan Ives tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull who cut his price target for the stock Friday from $250 to $175. “The price cuts that Tesla enacted was the straw that broke the camel’s back on the stock.”

Another reason Tesla’s stock is sinking: The US economy could tip into recession next year hurting car sales. Musk said on an Twitter Spaces call Thursday he foresees the economy will be in a “serious recession” in 2023.

“I think there is going to be some macro drama that’s higher than people currently think” he said according to Reuters adding that homes and cars will get “disproportionately impacted” by economic conditions.

Tesla’s questionable valuation

Part of the problem with Tesla’s stock price is that critics question whether it was ever worth the trillion-dollar valuation it had at the start of the year. At its peak Tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined despite having a fraction of the sales of any of them. Today it is worth $399 billion.

“It got ahead of itself in the near-term” said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures another Tesla fan. “I still believe this can be a much bigger company. I think it will see those kinds of numbers again. But it could take a long long time to get there.”

Tesla’s growth prospects - a target of 50% sales growth annually helped drive that valuation. It conceded in October that it will miss that sales target for this year.

The stock’s climb to dizzying heights – rising 743% in 2020 alone – was driven by Musk’s reputation as a genius who would disrupt the massive global auto industry.

“Tesla was viewed as a disruptive technology company not as an automaker and a large part of that premium is related to Musk” said Ives.

Overpromising and underdelivering

Critics of Tesla said much of its sky-high valuation was based on promises that Musk made about future products many of which came years after they were originally promised.

A prime example is the Cybertruck the Tesla pickup truck first unveiled three years ago with promises that production would start in 2021. Now it is slated to start production next year with a ramp-up in production in 2024 putting it years behind other electric pickup offerings from Ford and upstart EV maker Rivian both of which have electric pickups available for purchase today. It could also trail planned electric pickup offerings from General Motors.

“Elon Musk has a pathological problem with the truth” said Gordon Johnson one of the largest critics of Tesla among analysts. “When people say he’s a genius and innovator it’s based on all his promises he never lives up to.”

Johnson said Tesla shares will have a much steeper fall ahead once it starts being priced like other automakers rather than on its promises. He said that for Tesla to hit its growth targets it needs to be building new plants almost every year but that new factories in Germany and Texas that opened in spring are still not operating at full capacity. And he said that its plant in China has had to scale back production due to weak sales in the market in the face of the Covid restrictions.

“Demand in the US has collapsed” he said. “Two months ago your wait time was two or three months. Now you can get one immediately. They’re going to build more cars than they sell for a third straight quarter. It’s the definition of excess capacity.”

Tesla is still by far the largest EV maker worldwide although that title is being challenged in some key markets by Volkswagen in Europe and by BYD in China. And more competition is coming from established automakers such as Ford and GM.

The Twitter factor

That’s not to say Twitter has played no role in Tesla’s stock price demise this year: Tesla shares have lost 66% of their value since Musk’s interest in Twitter was first disclosed in April with a 45% decline since he closed on the deal in late October.

Investors have been disappointed that Musk appears to be paying for so much of his $44 billion purchase of Twitter by selling Tesla stock. Musk Tesla’s largest shareholder has sold $23 billion worth of Tesla shares since his interest in Twitter became public in April.

On Thursday’s Twitter Spaces call Musk promised he was done selling shares of Tesla stock until at least 2024 if not beyond. But he hasn’t lived up to a previous promise in April that he was done selling Tesla shares selling $14.4 billion of that stock since that time.

“It’s been a Pinocchio situation for Musk saying he is done selling stock. Investors want to see him walk the walk and not just talk the talk” said Ives.

Another Twitter factor: Musk named himself CEO of Twitter the third major company he leads along with Tesla and SpaceX. So many people assumed that Musk’s loss of focus on Tesla has spooked its former fans on Wall Street.

But this week began with Musk running a poll - on Twitter of course - asking if he should give up the CEO title at his social media plaything. He promised he would comply with the result and 57.5% of those who voted said they want him gone.

That departure may take a while - Musk tweeted he will resign “as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” And the same tweet he cautioned that even if he gives up the CEO title at Twitter he’s not walking away totally saying that he plans to “just run the software & servers teams” after finding a new “fool” to be CEO.

The poll results late Sunday were enough to lift Tesla shares in early trading Monday but the shares ended the day slightly lower and have lost significantly more ground every day since. Tesla shares fell 9% Thursday and it ended the week down 18% after another 2% drop on Friday.

And then there’s the question of how much damage the debacle at Twitter has done to the Tesla brand. Musk has fired thousands of employees banned journalists while allowing Donald Trump and other previously banned accounts back online called for the prosecution of Dr. Anthony Fauci embraced conspiracy theories and made anti-trans statements in his short tenure as CEO.

It may have endeared him to some but angered other potential buyers including liberals who might be willing to pay a premium for a more environmentally friendly vehicle.

“I think it was measurable damage” said Munster who believes the publicity over his time at Twitter cost Tesla 5% of its sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvdGVzbGEtc3RvY2stcGx1bW1ldGVkLWVsb24tbXVzay10d2l0dGVyL3N0b3J5P2lkPTk1NzU2NzMz0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3MvdGVzbGEtc3RvY2stcGx1bW1ldGVkLWVsb24tbXVzay10d2l0dGVyL3N0b3J5P2lkPTk1NzU2NzMz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla stock has plummeted since Elon Musk took over Twitter. Here's why.,"Shares of Tesla have fallen 45% in two months since the Twitter acquisition.

Tesla stock has plummeted since Elon Musk took over Twitter. Here's why.

Tesla stock has plummeted since CEO Elon Musk took over Twitter falling more than 45% in about over two months.

In all the company's stock has dropped more than 65% since January when Musk began investing in Twitter. By comparison the tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen about half as far over that period.

Musk said on Tuesday that he will resign as head of Twitter when the company identifies a successor. The news temporarily buoyed Tesla stock before it again turned downward.

The electric vehicle company faces falling demand amid recession fears heightened competition and pandemic-induced production challenges.

Moreover some analysts and major investors have sharply criticized Musk over a perceived lack of focus on Tesla saying the company needs leadership as it contends with an adverse business environment.

""Musk is viewed as 'asleep at the wheel' from a leadership perspective for Tesla at the time investors need a CEO to navigate this Category 5 storm"" Dan Ives a longtime Tesla bull and managing director of equity research at Wedbush said in a research note on Thursday.

""Instead Musk is laser focused on Twitter which has been an ongoing nightmare that never ends for investors with hopes a new CEO is picked in the coming weeks as a first step forward"" Ives added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Aside from investor concerns over Musk the company's stock losses owe in part to insurgent rivals and diminished demand.

Tesla remains the top-selling electric vehicle company in the U.S. but its lead has slipped in recent months as competitors offer a host of affordable alternatives a S &P Global Mobility report showed last month.

The company held 65% market share of new registered vehicles in the U.S. through the third quarter of this year a drop from 71% last year and 79% in 2020 the report found.

Responding to weakened demand Tesla announced on Wednesday that it would offer $7500 discounts on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered in the U.S. this month. Shares in Tesla fell by nearly 9% the following day.

Still significant investor attention has focused on Musk and his apparent focus on Twitter.

The world's richest person has sold nearly $40 billion worth of Tesla stock since late last year including a $3.6 billion sale as recently as last week as he has financed the acquisition of Twitter.

The sales have reduced the stake Musk holds in Tesla raising questions about his continued level of involvement with the company.

Some major Tesla investors have called for Musk to place his primary focus on Tesla which boasts a market capitalization of $392 billion far larger than the value of Twitter for which Musk spent $44 billion.

""I think it is in the best interest for Tesla shareholders for Elon to be back at Tesla working full time"" Ross Gerber CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management tweeted on Sunday.

For his part Musk has defended his actions at Twitter as part of an aggressive effort to rescue the company from financial peril which he described in a Twitter Spaces interview on Tuesday as an ""emergency fire drill.""

""That's the reason for my actions"" he added. ""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever.""

In a Twitter Spaces interview on Thursday Musk vowed to stop selling Tesla stock until at least 2024 though he has previously violated commitments to halt sales of the stock. He added meanwhile that he hadn't missed ""a single important Tesla meeting"" since acquiring Twitter.

Musk also said on Thursday that he expects the economy to fall into a ""serious recession"" next year further slashing demand for expensive items.

To be sure this year has pummeled automakers across the sector. Shares of Ford have plummeted 45% in 2022; while General Motors has fallen 43% and Toyota has dropped 26%.

Interest rate hikes at the Federal Reserve have spiked borrowing costs making car purchases more difficult for consumers already strained by sky-high inflation. Meanwhile pandemic-induced production bottlenecks and chip shortages have persisted increasing costs and causing delivery delays.

In recent months falling consumer sentiment has placed added pressure on the industry.

Despite these headwinds Tesla can stanch its financial bleeding and turn around its business said Ives of Wedbush Securities.

He attributed roughly 70% of Tesla's stock decline in recent months to Musk's focus on Twitter and urged Musk to return his attention to the company and stop selling Tesla stock.

""Taking a step back the long term Tesla transformational story remains intact"" Ives said adding that he expects global electric vehicle demand to significantly accelerate over the coming years.

Tesla he said is the ""clear leader poised to benefit front and center.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvb3Bpbmlvbi9tdXNrLWlzLWh1cnRpbmctdGVzbGEtYnJhbmQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Elon Musk’s Twitter Antics Are Hurting Tesla’s Brand,"Not long ago Tesla’s electric vehicles were far and away the best on the market. If you wanted a stylish long-range easy-to-charge and feature-packed E.V. Elon Musk would be your most likely supplier — even if you hated his guts.

But not anymore. In the past year I test drove many fantastic new E.V.s that hit the market in 2021 and 2022 — cheap ones expensive ones big ones small ones strange ones boring ones. Ford’s F-150 Lightning the electric version of the longtime best-selling vehicle in America and its Mustang were terrific inside and out nicely designed roomy and fun to drive. The Kia EV-6’s striking futuristic exterior had strangers stopping me to ask what cool ride I was driving. There are also great models by Chevy Mercedes and Rivian. Although I liked the Teslas I drove (the uber-expensive Model S Plaid which can go from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in about two seconds was terrific fun) the truth is that many of the best electric wheels on the market today are not made by Musk.

The new competition makes Musk’s recent role as the town crier for the red-pilled online right especially puzzling and for his car company perilous. His chaotic and polarizing tenure as Twitter’s chief executive — during which he’s embraced far-right tropes about gender and journalism and public health and generally behaved like a rich bully on a power trip — already seems to be battering Tesla’s brand. The Wall Street Journal reported last month on a survey by Morning Consult showing that perceptions of Tesla have been falling steadily since May shortly after Musk began his bid for Twitter; between October and November the period when Musk took ownership of Twitter sentiment among Democrats toward Tesla plummeted while favorability among Republicans rose slightly.

Over the past years Hisense has been researching the best possible laser source for Laser TV and successfully developed a mature laser display technology using TI DLP technology. Thanks to this technology Hisense Laser TVs can now offer ultra-high-definition display and premium audio quality to all customers with less power. Collaborating with chipset manufacturer Texas Instruments Hisense has developed sophisticated laser displays allowing museums art galleries and even restaurants to provide fully immersive experiences.

Hisense and TI Are Committed to Advancing Display Technology

For over 10 years Hisense and TI have been collaborating to refine the display technology in TVs aiming to provide customers with premium Laser TVs and an immersive viewing experience. One of the most salient products of this collaboration is the first Hisense 4K Laser TV which is equipped with the TI DLP .66"" chipset and has gained widespread popularity among customers upon its release. Another 4K Laser TV the Flagship L9 powered by the TI DLP .47"" chipset also dominated the market with its screen as big as 120 inches. This year Hisense has again chosen to employ the new TI DLP .94"" chipset for its first 8K Laser TV. The TI DLP .94"" chipset will enable more than 33 million pixels offering four times more pixels than a 4K TV and will bring a new level of big-screen cinema and TV experience to living rooms.

The strong collaboration between TI and Hisense has been a success for many years. In the future Hisense and TI will continue to work together to develop more advanced products and contribute further advancements to the whole laser display industry.

I'm a dividend investor so an out-of-favor stock like Intel (INTC -0.80%) with its historically high yield is something I'm going to take a look at. The company has some attractive features.

But a deeper dive suggests the risks outweigh the benefits especially when I compare the chip giant to my investments in International Business Machines (IBM 0.53%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 0.93%). Here are two big reasons why I'm taking a pass on Intel.

1. A high yield on its own isn't enough

The big thing that attracted me to Intel was the stock's current 5.4% dividend yield. That's not only large on an absolute level but it's also near the highest levels in the company's history suggesting the stock is relatively cheap today. That combination is easily enough to get me to take a closer look at Intel right now. One warning sign for me here however is that the dividend hasn't been increased annually for even 10 consecutive years.

By comparison IBM has increased its dividend annually for over 25 years. IBM's yield meanwhile is an attractive 4.7%. And while the yield isn't near all-time highs it is still fairly generous historically speaking.

And there's the fact that IBM has an over 100-year history that includes several major business transformations -- one of which has just recently been completed with the company's purchase of RedHat. In fact a long period of declining sales appears to have turned around. While IBM is hardly perfect it has proven that it can adjust with the times.

One of the reasons why Intel is in the Wall Street doghouse today is that it hasn't actually proven it can do that. When smartphones became more important it missed the opportunity and its efforts in autonomous driving haven't been inspiring (it just spun off a piece of Mobileye which I don't think it would have done if this push into the autonomous driving sector was a huge success). Meanwhile it has recently fallen behind CPU competitors because it has faced delays with new technology. Change takes time and it is likely that the company will muddle through but I'd rather stick with IBM which has a similar yield and a better business history.

2. Not enough diversity

On the other side of the coin looking specifically at chip stocks Intel has one main product that gets used in two main end markets. Basically from my simplistic point of view as a non-tech investor it makes the brains of a computer (the CPU). As mobile devices have become increasingly important demand for desktop computers has largely waned. Intel appears to have gotten lucky with the server market (basically just a variation on a computer) taking off to supply the data centers that support mobile demand. In some ways it's a one-trick pony.

Texas Instruments meanwhile makes far simpler microchips that get used in thousands of products. To put a number on that this chipmaker has around 80000 products that it sells to more than 100000 customers. The chips it makes are very similar to each other but that's kind of the point. These are simple commodity chips that are somewhat fungible making them easier to sell into the market. I believe strongly in diversification for my portfolio and I tend to favor companies that have diversification in their businesses too.

Meanwhile Texas Instruments has increased its dividend annually for 19 consecutive years. And its 2.9% dividend yield is toward the high end of its historical range suggesting it is relatively cheap. Like Intel Texas Instruments is focusing on capital investments right now but the stakes aren't nearly as high. Intel needs to upgrade its tech or risk falling further behind its peers; Texas Instruments is really just trying to prepare ahead of time for the increased demand it sees down the road. That's a much stronger position to be in.

Tech confuses me but...

I'll happily admit that I'm not a technology genius but I don't think you need to be to see the bigger picture trends at these three companies. And when you add up the pros and cons Intel just doesn't seem as attractive as similarly high-yield IBM or Texas Instruments in the chip sphere. I reserve the right to change my mind but right now I'm passing on Intel because it doesn't stack up to the other tech names I own.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL3N0bS10eG4tYmV0dGVyLXZhbHVlLXN0b2NrLTE2NDAwNDE4OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,STM or TXN: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,"Investors interested in Semiconductor - General stocks are likely familiar with STMicroelectronics (STM) and Texas Instruments (TXN). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.

Currently STMicroelectronics has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that STM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TXN has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.

Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics including the tried-and-true P/E ratio the P/S ratio earnings yield and cash flow per share as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.

STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.01 while TXN has a forward P/E of 17.81. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 1.80. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.91.

Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 2.98. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison TXN has a P/B of 10.30.

These metrics and several others help STM earn a Value grade of A while TXN has been given a Value grade of C.

STM sticks out from TXN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models so value investors will likely feel that STM is the better option right now.

Textron’s Cessna SkyCourier and Cessna Grand Caravan Ex will soon start flying over Mexico. They’re not just an addition to an existing fleet but the fleet itself. That’s because Aerus is new to the game and ready to start operating a small (at least for now) fleet comprised of two SkyCouriers and four Grand Caravans.The SkyCourier was introduced back in 2020 when it took to the sky for the first time. Earlier this year none other than FedEx Express got its first SkyCourier delivered only the first unit out of a total of 50 aircraft.A twin utility turboprop this fresh Cessna model is fitted with a pair of Pratt & Whitney PT6A-65SC turboprop engines enough to hit over 200 knots (230 mph/370 kph) at most or cover up to 1035 miles (1666 km) on a single flight. The version that was selected by Aerus boasts a 19-passenger configuration but the aircraft can also be used as a cargo airplane with a 6000 lbs (2720 kg) payload.The Grand Caravan EX turboprop is no stranger to passenger or cargo flights. Thanks to its 675-hp PT6A-114A turbine engine it can handle heavy-duty cargo operations boasting a 3305-lb (1499 kg) payload. Regarding the passenger configuration it offers enough space for 14 people. Either way what makes it stand out is its ruggedness. The Grand Caravan can even make its way on short rough runways and handle challenging conditions.Both aircraft claim to also come with the added perk of lowered operating costs compared to similar models. Based in Monterrey Mexico the new aviation operator intends to use this fleet to provide coverage in areas that have been underserved so far.But the Grand Caravan has the potential for something even bigger in its future. Earlier this year the Los Angeles-based Ampaire brought to life the hybrid-electric version of this popular airliner called the Eco Caravan.

Using the combined power of Ampaire’s electrical system and of the compression ignition engine developed by RED Aircraft GmbH rated at 550(405) the Eco Caravan is ready for greener regional flights. The prototype has already nailed a long nonstop flight (1075 miles/1730 km). According to Ampaire this was the longest flight of a hybrid-electric aircraft.While the standard SkyCourier and Grand Caravan EX will soon be flying over Mexico the greener Eco Caravan continues its flight test campaign aiming to kick off commercial operations by 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2VyaWN0ZWdsZXIvMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9jZXNzbmFzLXNreWNvdXJpZXItbGFuZGVkLWl0cy1maXJzdC1haXJsaW5lLWN1c3RvbWVyLWp1c3Qtc2V2ZW4tbW9udGhzLWFmdGVyLWZlZGV4LXRvb2stZGVsaXZlcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cessna's SkyCourier Landed Its First Airline Customer Just Seven Months After FedEx Took Delivery,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2022/12/24/cessnas-skycourier-landed-its-first-airline-customer-just-seven-months-after-fedex-took-delivery/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2VyaWN0ZWdsZXIvMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9jZXNzbmFzLXNreWNvdXJpZXItbGFuZGVkLWl0cy1maXJzdC1haXJsaW5lLWN1c3RvbWVyLWp1c3Qtc2V2ZW4tbW9udGhzLWFmdGVyLWZlZGV4LXRvb2stZGVsaXZlcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1nZW5lcmFsLWF2aWF0aW9uLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business and General Aviation Highlights of 2022,"Credit: Bombardier

Called the plasma proteome the proteins being studied are released by cells that often play an important role in the body’s immune response to viruses. The research team studied how they adapt and change to a COVID-19 infection.

As part of the study blood samples were taken from 30 subjects in three patient groups at London Health Sciences Center (LHSC). One group had patients with COVID-19 another group had patients with severe infection but were negative for COVID-19 and the third was a healthy control group. Blood samples were drawn on the day of critical care admission and again on days three seven and ten in hospital.

“We collected plasma from these patients and measured well over a thousand proteins with great accuracy using new technology that combines immunology and genomics” says Dr. Douglas Fraser Lawson scientist critical care physician at Children’s Hospital at LHSC and professor at Western University’s Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. “With the use of this advanced technology we were able to better analyze the protein patterns and better understand what is happening with COVID-19 especially in critically ill patients.”

The research team found that COVID-19 patients demonstrated changes in immunosuppression pathways which typically keeps the immune system balanced. In critically ill patients the changes were heightened. Analyses of the plasma proteome helped researchers determine which cells in the body are active during the disease state and which signaling pathways were activated.

“This study has allowed us to understand the progression of the disease processes in very sick patients providing us clues on the body’s immune system and other systems that were reacting to the severe disease” says Victor Han PhD Lawson Scientist director of CHRI and professor at Schulich Medicine & Dentistry. “We hope that this knowledge will allow us to identify the patients who will become severely ill and develop new therapies to counteract the changes occurring within their bodies.”

Dr. Fraser who is also a scientist at CHRI adds that the team can now examine potential new drug therapies with the hopes of improving outcomes for these patients.

The next steps for the research team will be to use this technology to examine plasma biomarkers in long COVID patients to determine why some develop prolonged disease after a COVID-19 infection.

This interview has been condensed and edited.

Name: Susan Abbatiello Current: Principal consultant scientist at Waters Corp. Career path: Ph.D. analytical chemistry University of Florida Postdoctoral research: Method development mass spectrometry and proteomics University of Pittsburgh First job outside of academia: Research associate at Genetics Institute (now Pfizer) Favorite molecule or protein: ""I will say my favorite protein is the first one that I worked on right out of undergrad. I worked at this company called Genetics Institute. The protein therapeutic that I worked on is called bone morphogenetic protein 2 BMP-2. And its function is to induce bone growth.""

Before going to graduate school you worked at Genetics Institute (now Pfizer). Can you tell me about that?

Coming out of undergraduate I felt very burned out and I didn't feel like I could continue going to school. So I looked for positions that were laboratory-based because I like to be in the lab and I was offered a position at a company in Andover Massachusetts that made recombinant human proteins which was a newer type of technology at the time. They gave me an entry-level position in a group that did method development. I worked there for five years. Three-and-a-half years in I thought to myself: ""I could probably go back to school and get a little deeper education in analytical chemistry."" It seemed like if I got a degree in analytical chemistry — specifically in mass spectrometry — I would be able to have a lot of options coming out of graduate school. So I went back.

Waters Corp. is a technology company specializing in scientific instruments. Can you tell me what you do day to day?

I'm in the global research team and my project is called charge detection mass spectrometry. We abbreviate it CDMS. That technology has not quite yet become mainstream meaning there really aren't a lot of commercial options for people to buy an instrument. The precise aspects of it were developed by Martin Jarrold at the University of Indiana and his company called Megadalton. Waters bought the intellectual property rights to the technology with the goal of commercializing CDMS. What's interesting about it to me — it's a mass spectrometer — is it’s different than any of the types of mass spectrometers I've worked on in my whole career of 20 years. In this day and age when we're all dealing with COVID there are new vaccines being developed that use very large structures that contain a payload whether it's proteins DNA or RNA to help make our bodies stronger and more immune to viruses. The charge detection MS system is able to measure large proteins whereas conventional mass spectrometers that are time-of-flight or the Orbitrap weren't primarily designed for that. To detect proteins this large it uses a slightly different mechanism. If we put them on a regular mass spectrometer you will not be able to detect them because of the mass-to-charge range of the MS detector.

What has been one of your favorite projects?

Back around 2005 Thermo Fisher Scientific had purchased a technology — FAIMS which stands for high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry. I was interested in this technology because while I was in grad school some of my colleagues were working on prototypes of this technology. The instrument was really hard to use. It was the first commercial iteration. I started at Thermo in the hopes that I would be able to work on that project. So a colleague and I began messing around with some hardware modifications. We saw that not only could it limit the junk getting into your system but you could improve the signal-to-noise ratio of what you wanted to detect so your instrument stays cleaner for longer and you get better signal. It’s like a win-win-win. It took several years. I was in a product manager role and I was able to work with some of the software engineers for controlling the hardware and then processing the data. I wanted to make sure that anyone that would use it could use it intuitively. When that product launched I was very happy; it was like a technology baby. I thought that was enough of me doing for-profit work for a while and so I left Thermo at that time but I feel really proud of that accomplishment because it was really hard and I feel like I made an impact.

How can students who are interested in a similar industry role prepare?

Start as early as high school or undergrad. Try summer internships so they can work closely with people in the lab to get a feel for what it's all about. Undergraduate internships and co-ops are something that Waters Corp. heavily leans on especially in research and engineering. Instrument companies and some pharmaceutical companies will hire a grad student co-op skilled in a certain area if that student could help the company.

There are some skills that I wish I had worked on earlier in my career. One is learning how to code. Whether it's R or Python or just being able to write macros to more efficiently do things. Raising the bar on some of the skills that are preferred or required at certain jobs is helpful especially in instrumentation.

What advice would you give for others who are interested in industry careers?

Like what you do even if it's not interesting. Finding a place where you can do what you do and be appreciated is another key and important aspect I would say in a successful career. I've worked at a lot of different places and some I didn't feel appreciated and I decided it just wasn't the right fit for me. I've just kind of moved around until I found a position where it seems to fit the best. I think it's important to not be afraid of that. We're not in the generation anymore where people are working 20 and 30 years at the same job. I think it's a lot less of a red flag to try different experiences and find what works best. After one experience in industry I never thought I would go back to a for-profit. I found something that fit better.

Also network. Find people that are in these different areas and have frank conversations with them. You have to be happy with what you do in order to live a happy life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQzNTg3LTAyMi0wMDMyNy000gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nucleophagy delays aging and preserves germline immortality,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQzNTg3LTAyMi0wMDMyNy000gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226950AF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The consumer discretionary sector is down about 37% for the year. Companies in this sector tend to suffer during times of economic downturn since consumers prioritize paying for necessities such as rent or food over discretionary purchases when their budgets are tight.

But ""while most consumer discretionary stocks have been horrendous this year we've had some pools of strength too and many of them can work in 2023"" according to Cramer.

Here are his picks:

Genuine Parts  O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone

Cramer highlighted these three auto parts stocks as potential buys stating that AutoZone is his favorite. With used car prices coming down and new car prices likely to follow consumers are more likely to fix up their old car next year than purchase a new one he reasoned.

Ulta Beauty

While the company reported a solid earnings beat and boosted its outlook earlier this month investors shouldn't be greedy with the stock especially if it sees a big gain Cramer advised.

TJX Companies

The parent company of T.J. Maxx Marshalls and HomeGoods will benefit from the excess inventory the holidays will leave behind he said. He added that because TJX operates discount retailers its stock is a winner during times of recession when consumers tend to trade down.

Yum! Brands

Cramer called the parent company of KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut a great value proposition for consumers.

Starbucks

He said he expects Starbucks to make a powerful comeback in China once the company's economy fully reopens.

It shouldn’t be surprising that Miami’s nightlife and hospitality circuit is eager to check out the neighborhood’s latest rooftop pool. But even with activations on multiple floors below this is clearly the place to be. Invisible anchors keep the company’s logo afloat in the water as influencer after influencer parades by to get the shot: a slim pale blue rectangle illuminated by the towering glittering nightscape behind it. You can’t knock the hustle — it is a great shot. Waiting for the go-ahead on this 20th-floor watery gem is part of why the hotel which technically began accepting guests in July didn’t celebrate their official launch until November.

Now that all the dominoes have fallen into place the Netherlands-based hospitality company’s bet on one of Miami’s hottest neighborhoods seems to be well worth the wait. After three years of construction the 252-room 20-story hotel fits perfectly into the casual-cool vibe of Brickell with an art-covered facade featuring local artist Jen Stark’s colorful abstractions. That isn’t the only place where art is centered in CitizenM as celebrating local art and community is a core tenet of the rapidly growing hotel company’s ethos. Here Emilie Sobel and party citizen Tiffany T Fantasia — aka one of Miami’s most beloved drag queens — each redecorated rooms in their own image for the Brickell opening party.

As for the rooms CitizenM embraces what founder Rattan Chadha calls “affordable luxury for the people” which translates first and foremost into one of the most compact hotel rooms I’ve ever stayed in. But within what Americans might call a very European sensibility of space these tight rooms are so well-designed that after a few hours the tiny size makes sense. That’s due in part to the technology that permeates the suites from start to finish with a brand new iPad to control it all (or via an app on your own phone if you’d like to download and go from there). Unlike some hospitality companies where technology feels like a second thought CitizenM is all about the cutting edge.

First of all there are controls for a whole host of different light settings including preset moods and science-backed soundtracks projected around the room to simulate focus dreaming or ascending. You can make the room as light or dark as you want and with a huge XL king bed cozied up to a massive TV this is definitely a room for those looking to put sleep and relaxation first. While the bed is big enough for two the rest of the 150-square-foot room isn’t. This is the kind of hotel that’s ideal for a solo traveler or someone on business who moves in and out of cities quickly.

All the rooms are the same size creating a sense of uniformity and equality in a sector that’s often focused on flexing around special treatment. Still I think splitting this room with a partner or friend would put a strain on the relationship so maybe take advantage of the affordability and book two rooms next door if traveling with a loved one. Then again the rest of the hotel is designed for what Miami does best: partying the night away. With the lobby restaurant and bar (CanteenM) and signature “living room space” on the second floor — plus another set of meeting rooms and open-format work areas on the floor right above — there are plenty of common areas to mix and mingle once outside of your room. The most important of those will undoubtedly be that rooftop pool and bar.

Check-in is another area where technology is at the forefront with 24/7 contactless ATM-like front desks where guests can input all of their own details and pick up their keys any time of day or night. Check-in can also be done on the app. The on-site bar menu offers hotel room staples like nachos and dumplings and a fancy water bar allows guests to help themselves to still or sparkling and accouterments like lemon lime and orange. But the menu is extremely limited and quality is hit or miss — this isn’t a fine-dining hub or even a real restaurant per se — so take advantage of the excellent location and go out for your meals if you’re looking for something substantial.

The draw of a property like the CitizenM is to stay in a luxury-minded hotel without paying the high-end price tag. Especially if you’re a solo traveler there’s probably no better place as a home base for getting into the mix of downtown Miami. This late-night Florida city is clearly a priority for the brand as they plan to open another location at the World Center in January and then in South Beach in 2024. For now my money’s on the Brickell rooftop as a potential gateway to the rest of the city.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvaG90ZWxzLW1ha2UtZ2FpbnMtaW4tMjAyMi1leHBhbmRpbmctbG95YWx0eS1tZW1iZXJzaGlwcy_SAVlodHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2hvdGVscy1tYWtlLWdhaW5zLWluLTIwMjItZXhwYW5kaW5nLWxveWFsdHktbWVtYmVyc2hpcHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotels Make Gains in 2022 Expanding Loyalty Memberships,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjMvaG90ZWxzLW1ha2UtZ2FpbnMtaW4tMjAyMi1leHBhbmRpbmctbG95YWx0eS1tZW1iZXJzaGlwcy_SAVlodHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2hvdGVscy1tYWtlLWdhaW5zLWluLTIwMjItZXhwYW5kaW5nLWxveWFsdHktbWVtYmVyc2hpcHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226535150>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Ole Miss Preview,"Joey McGuire will lead the Red Raiders against Lane Kiffin and the Rebels Wednesday

NRG Stadium in Houston Texas is the home of the 2023 Texas Bowl between the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Ole Miss Rebels. The Big 12 and the SEC will meet head-to-head on Dec. 28 with kickoff slated for 8 p.m. (CST).

Previously having won the bowl in 2012 and lost 2015 it will be the Red Raiders’ third time in the Texas Bowl. In his first season as head coach of the Red Raiders Joey McGuire has had a successful season. With two wins over ranked opponents this season (University of Houston and Texas Longhorns) Texas Tech finished 4th in the Big 12 with a record of 5-4.

Texas Tech head coach Joey McGuire Houston Chronicle

McGuire led his team to a winning season finishing 7-5 overall. But while his first season as head coach in Lubbock was a success it didn’t come easily.

The Red Raiders had a problematic season when it came to having a single quarterback at the helm. Due to injury the Red Raiders not only had three quarterbacks that routinely rotated into the starting role but three quarterbacks that threw for 1000 yards each.

Between Donovan Smith Behren Morton and Tyler Shough the Red Raiders accumulated 3684 passing yards for 25 touchdowns and 17 interceptions.

Nonetheless the Red Raiders finished their season strong with Shough taking the snaps. Winning the last three games of the season Shough accumulated 1062 passing yards with six touchdowns and three interceptions. Posting a 59.4 completion percentage Shough had the best passer rating among his teammates at 134.1.

Shough led the Red Raiders out of the trenches with big victories over the Kansas Jayhawks the Iowa State Cyclones and the Oklahoma Sooners.

Most notable was the 51-48 overtime victory over Oklahoma. On the Red Raiders’ Senior Day Shough put together a phenomenal performance passing for 436 yards and two touchdowns. Wide-receiver Jerand Bradley who had himself a career day caught eight passes for 173 yards and a touchdown.

While the Red Raiders capped off a successful regular season they will have to face off against a tough opponent in Ole Miss on Wednesday.

In his third season as head coach at Ole Miss Lane Kiffin led the Rebels to a 8-4 season record finishing 3rd in the SEC West. Trailing only No. 5 Alabama and No. 16 LSU Ole Miss finished with a 4-4 conference record.

Unlike the Red Raiders Ole Miss lost its last three games of the season to Alabama Arkansas and Mississippi State. While entering the Texas Bowl on a three-game losing streak Ole Miss has all the offensive artillery to cause problems against the Red Raiders.

Leading the Rebels this season was quarterback Jaxson Dart. The sophomore transfer from USC threw for 2613 yards and 18 touchdowns. Despite throwing eight interceptions Dart completed 63% of his passes and remained a consistent quarterback for the Rebels in 2022.

Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart (2) Ole Miss Athletics

Perhaps the biggest impact and surprise of the season is freshman running back Quinshon Judkins. A true freshman Judkins went from playing at Pike Road High School in Alabama to being the primary running back for Ole Miss.

It was expected that Judkins would take on a secondary role behind Zach Evans who transferred from TCU but the freshman took control and had a stellar season. With 251 rushing attempts Judkins posted 1476 yards for 16 touchdowns. With eight games with over a hundred rushing yards and six multi-touchdown games Judkins averaged a monstrous 5.9 yards per carry.

VIBE Magazine was on the scene to absorb as much of the game as possible. In addition the VIBE team participated in a few Play Now matches on NBA 2K23 for the PlayStation 5 to dive deeper into an early build of the new basketball game. Yes we are bringing back this experience for those that may be considering Xmas gifts like this one.

NBA 2K23 offered four teams as your guide through the new and improved experience. Players could select between the Chicago Bulls Boston Celtics Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns as their team of choice. Upon selection the player was plunged into an authentic NBA game — kitted with roaring crowds bright lights and tightly crafted camera angles. Furthermore 2K23 boasted a graphical fidelity that has grown increasingly advanced over the years bringing players closer to graphics that mirror real life.

For their first bout with the game VIBE chose the Suns and decided to face the Golden State Warriors naturally. During the exhibition players instantly noticed how smooth the camera transitions flowed from the teams hitting the court to tip-off to scoring their first bucket. With the ball now in VIBE’s hand they began fiddling with the mechanics to see what changed offensively and defensively.

The controls were less robotic than previous installments in the NBA 2K franchise with the shot meter smoothed out making it easier to hit “excellent” three and two-pointers; layups were refined and alley-oops were some of the most exciting moves to pull off during play. Defensively the game felt slightly clunky specifically when attempting to block your opponent’s shot or swat the ball from their hands. However Ronnie “2K” Singh Digital Marketing Director at 2K and Alfie Brody 2K Games VP Head of Global Marketing reassured players the game was an early build and would iron these few issues out as they strive to make the best NBA 2K yet — using past iterations of the game as competition.

“Games will have issues here and there but our team is one of the best so we’ll get that fixed and primed for release” said Ronnie during our conversation. “I really am excited about our gameplay; the game feels different [and] it feels great. It’s the whole system we created. It’s a smoother experience.”

“And then the other thing I’d say is we really want to compete with ourselves” expressed Brody following Singh’s statement. “That’s our big thing. We want to put out the best product we can. Now we can’t do everything every year but I can comfortably say that we move the needle with every release always making improvements upon our previous game.”

VIBE Magazine noticed that most of the game’s improvements were direct responses to complaints or requests made by NBA 2K‘s community over the past three iterations. Some of the most significant changes made to the game from 2K20 to 2K23 were camera modifications enhanced dribbling and a more responsive offensive AI that gives the player a challenge on the court.

“It’s our third year on next-gen so we’ve done a lot of what our consumers want and have asked for in past years. We’re trying to make the jump and evolve towards the best game that we can put out there on the market” said Singh. “And that ultimately begins with answering our fanbases concerns wants and needs. Doing what’s best for their experience and doing what’s best for the game.”

And it wasn’t only VIBE magazine that noticed these changes either. NBA stars in attendance such as Detroit Pistons’ Cade Cunningham and Miami Heat’s Tyler Herro at the House of Greatness also had much to say about 2K23’s new feel.

“I think one of the biggest improvements I felt from the game was the way they cleaned up the animations” Cunningham told VIBE Magazine. “[2K Games] improved their dribbling animations and celebrations. Even the shooting and the player interactions on the court feel more dynamic. Graphics were great too; every player looked like themselves more than other joints.”

“I didn’t like the shot meter” Herro articulated followed by a sly chuckle. “The shot meter was never my favorite thing; I didn’t like it. But I did enjoy playing [NBA 2K23]; the game was cool. 2K continues to evolve and I can’t wait to play more of it.”

In the days leading up to the event 2K announced Michael Jordan was selected as one of their coveted cover athletes gracing the Championship and Michael Jordan Edition of NBA 2K23. In addition Diana Taurasi and Sue Bird will grace the cover of the WNBA Edition and rising star Devin Booker will be the Standard Edition cover athlete.

Celebrating 2023 with their focus on “the year of greatness” 2K Games decided that these four athletes fit 2K23’s mission statement the most. An idea that Singh Brody and the 2K Games team were conscious of when deciding on this year’s cover stars and they hope the community is ready for what comes with these explosive players on the covers.

“There’s different criteria for a cover athlete. One certainly is an affinity for the game. Obviously if you work with somebody you want them to like the game. It doesn’t matter how long they played or anything like that” Brody passionately disclosed to VIBE Magazine about the cover athlete selection process. “But they just got to like being a part of it. And then we focus on authenticity so somebody who can play [NBA 2K]. You guys know our community. They’re very vocal. They’re very passionate.”

“It’s NBA 2K23 and we knew what we needed to do. We wanted this game to say something. So if you put Jordan on the cover you’re making a statement” Ronnie 2K expressed. “2K23 is the year of greatness; we’re expecting very big things. This year is gonna be fun for all fans of 2K.”

Fans of NBA 2K23 can now get the game at Gamestop the PlayStation/Microsoft store or the official 2K Games website.",,,,,,

Earlier this week General Mills which acquired Blue Buffalo in 2018 and Tyson Foods’ pet treat business in 2021 said its pet segment sales for its second fiscal quarter of 2023 were essentially unchanged from a year earlier totaling $593 million. Analysts had expected this number to come in closer to $672 million the WSJ said.

In an earnings call General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening said pet sales were hampered by “an unexpected headwind… in the form of inventory reductions at some key retailers” as well as capacity and customer service challenges that had carried over from the first fiscal quarter. “As a result while our all-channel retail sales grew at a high-single-digit rate in the quarter our net sales were essentially flat” he said.

Overall though pet food sales are seeing positive growth. Earlier this month online pet retailer Chewy revealed that 83% of its net sales in the third quarter came from non-discretionary categories like food and healthcare. According to the market research firm Packaged Facts’ latest study on pet food pet owners in the U.S. spent nearly $40 billion on dog and cat food in 2021 up 15% over 2020 (which was already 14% higher from 2019).

When it comes to pet food General Mills’ struggles are “definitely more company-specific” Brad Jashinsky a director analyst at Gartner told Modern Retail. “Pet food’s been very very stable” he said. “It grew so much before the pandemic and then so many people got pets during the pandemic that it continued to grow.”

Similarly Seth Basham who covers Petco and Chewy as managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities says pet food demand is “pretty strong.” “It’s the non-consumable side of the industry particularly discretionary hard goods that are seeing the weakness within their sales” he told Modern Retail. “Pet food specifically is driving the growth for them.”

Overall pet food sales have risen due to inflation with prices up 15.7% year over year in November. That’s more than double the overall economy which saw consumer prices jump 7.1% over the prior year. On a Dec. 9 earnings call Chewy CEO Sumit Singh said that “at Chewy we grew units and price” for the third quarter and that “we expect to do that in Q3 in 2023 as well.”

Blue Buffalo is a super-premium brand that offers foods with prescription formulas high protein and targeted nutrition. For General Mills “there’s definitely challenges in terms of supply but also supply at the right price” Jashinsky said. “Not only do you have to try to find the ingredients but you also have to find them at a reasonable price to be able to keep the margins where they’re at.”

In January 29% of pet owners said they faced “significant challenges” with price inflation in pet food according to Packaged Facts. Still even with inflation pet owners are unlikely to cut back on spending data shows. “A lot of pet owners are willing to splurge on their pets and I’m sure General Mills and Blue Buffalo are probably frustrated at not being able to keep their products on shelves because it is such a reliable product line” Jashinsky said.

Another thing hampering General Mills is competition David Lummis pet market analyst at Packaged Facts told Modern Retail. Blue Buffalo started out in speciality retail but once it moved over to the mass market “to my mind they automatically lose some of their cachet in terms of being super premium” he said. “There’s continually more and more super-premium brands entering the market. And so the competition just continues up and up and up.”

A large portion of Blue Buffalo’s business is dry food. But fresh and frozen pet food products in particular are gaining popularity with the frozen category expected to hit $23 billion by 2032 according to the market research firm Future Market Insights. Freshpet a refrigerated pet food brand that partners with retailers like Safeway and Walmart said sales rose 34.4% year over year in the second quarter. Earlier this year PetSmart formed an exclusive partnership with Nom Nom while Petco launched a WholeHearted Fresh Recipes line co-created with JustFoodForDogs. DTC brands such as PawFoods are also popping up to appeal to pets with special diets like gluten free.

The fresh pet food category is “still a very small part of the market but it’s really booming” Lummis said. To better position itself “it does look to me like General Mills may need to do something a little bit different with Blue Buffalo whether it’s incorporating one of the other big trends in the market that’s in tandem with fresh… like freeze-dried morsels… But much of the attention in super-premium is on that fresh wave.”

To prepare for the next quarter General Mills says it is upping its manufacturing capacity for dry dog food and treats taking advantage of its new distribution center and expanding capacity at its existing warehouses. Overall its CEO said on the call “as we move into the second half of fiscal 2023 we expect to get back to double-digit net sales growth on pet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZm9vZC5jb20vbmV3cy9za2ltcGZsYXRpb24tYW5kLXBsYW50LWJhc2VkLWZvb2Qtc2V0LXRvLWJlLWtleS10cmVuZHMtaW4tMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food trends 2023: “skimpflation” to influence buying behaviour,"Image credit: 1000 Words // Shutterstock.com

Skimpflation or choosing lower-priced products over quality is set to remain a key trend influencing food purchasing habits in 2023 analysts forecast.

Consumers are also moving towards thoughtful indulgence and away from impulse shopping according to research presented at a GlobalData webinar entitled ‘Top Consumer Trends To Watch In 2023’.

So-called “skimpflation” is leading consumers to choose low prices over high quality when it comes to judging a product’s value for money.

“Ultimately the desire for quality has reduced and this pattern will likely translate into 2023 as consumers are associating value for money more with lower prices” said Alice Popple a GlobalData analyst focusing on consumer foodservice and packaging practices.

“So this means that consumers will skimp down on quality to cut costs as fewer people associate high quality with good value in 2022.

“This could actually cause some tension between brands retailers and consumers. And likely the consumer patterns that we will see in 2023 may not be a true reflection of consumer preferences. So it’s important to note that this might be a temporary pattern.”

Katie Page GlobalData content director for consumer foodservice and packaging practices warned that this trend did not mean a “race to the bottom” for manufacturers.

She said: “This is absolutely not all about a race to the bottom or biggest discount. Actually what we really should be thinking of is if you can give consumers a really good reason to buy your products around convenience format or more efficient ways of cooking for example that really justifies the price premium then I think consumers will still make room for those kind of products in their budget.”

Percentages of consumers who are staying vs switching brands in light of rising cost of living by category (GlobalData)

Categories most vulnerable to trading down are chocolate confectionery and desserts and pet products data suggests.

The beverage category on the other hand was seen as one of the most resilient. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks were among the categories consumers were least likely to trade down to a cheaper retailer for.

In November Clive Black head of research at UK-based Shore Capital Markets and a veteran observer of the grocery industry told Just Food he predicted a reduction in overall demand for food as consumers “of most income backgrounds” start shopping with more precision.

“The switch from proprietary brands to private label is happening” he said. “I think we’re looking at around 5-9% switch out from proprietary brands into private label in mass markets in the UK through 2022.” He added that the top tiers of retailers’ private labels are growing in popularity as consumers swap to perceived high-quality own brands.

Analysts also predict consumers will move away from impulse food purchases. “Thoughtful indulgence is all about consumers who are transitioning away from impulse and towards choosing their treats more carefully because they’ve got stricter budgets” said Popple.

“So the pressure of increasing prices and decreasing disposable incomes puts consumers in a situation where they’re forced to make more informed decisions when they’re parting with their money especially with non-essential goods.

“So this does mean that consumers are less likely to indulge frequently or as frequently as they previously were especially with their usual brands. What we’re seeing is consumers switching to cheaper alternatives. Our data shows that this is especially the case in household care dairy products and pet-care products.”

In a recent Just Food feature on indulgent snack habits Shelley Balanko senior vice president at US-based food and beverage strategists The Hartman Group also predicted consumers would stick to shopping lists more amid the cost-of-living crunch and that impulse purchases would be greatly reduced in the US.

Plant-based trend set to continue

Flexible diets are also set to remain a key food trend in 2023 paving the way for growth in the plant-based market. Demand for plant-based products is part of a wider “megatrend” of health and wellness which will continue to dominate food and beverage next year the GlobalData analysts said.

Alternative meat and yoghurt products will to do particularly well according to Popple.

She said: “We can see that the market for plant based is relatively high especially for meat and yoghurt products. There’s definitely opportunity for growth in all of the alternative categories but specifically in those two.”

Despite the relatively small portion of the market held by vegetarians and vegans analysts say a growing number of “flexitarians” – who choose not to eat meat some of the time – means retail and foodservice customers should look to build a range of plant-based products.

Page said: “In terms of market size plant-based is still quite small. But having said that there’s around 16% of consumers who identify as flexitarians a further 2% of consumers on average who identify as vegetarian and a further 1-2% who identify as vegan. So we’re getting up to 20% of the population who would buy into the category of plant-based meat alternatives.

“It’s no longer the case that retailers or foodservice operators can afford not to have a certain amount of range that caters to the needs of consumers who want plant based.”

However Page added plant-based products need to be priced competitively. “The biggest challenge for plant-based meat alternatives is price. Products tend to be fairly expensive compared to meat counterparts. I think consumers will be looking to save money on these products and that’s where repertoire shopping might come in.”

Popple said health and wellness “will continue to outrank all other megatrends as the most important purchase driver through 2023”.

She added: “It’s a pandemic-derived behaviour that has definitely become ingrained in consumer behaviour and will shape purchase decisions in 2023.”

Union Bank has sold five bank branches most of them in San Diego County for $19.25 million according to a real estate brokerage.

The sites which total 39331 square feet include San Diego branches in Ocean Beach and near Rolando Village and two others locally in Imperial Beach and Lemon Grove. The final site is in Brawley in Imperial County.

Michael Peterson Reg Kobzi and Joel Wilson of CBRE represented the bank in the transactions. The firm did not identify the buyers.

“As banks continue to evaluate real estate on their balance sheets it is important to analyze each asset individually” Peterson said. “Each of these five bank branches had a different business plan and took strategic underwriting to attract a buyer who could deliver the highest and best use for the site.”

Peterson added that his firm expects “to see more opportunities like this in the market as banks and users evaluate next steps with their real estate be it sale-leaseback or disposition.”

The pay increases varied by bank and geography with the nation's largest banks paying the highest hourly wages to recruit and retain employees on the lower end of the pay scale. Still the turnover rate for frontline bank employees soared this year according to one survey.

Whether the favorable conditions for workers will persist into 2023 is an open question as many banks are preparing for a possible recession next year. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said earlier this month that the Charlotte North Carolina-based company is pulling back on some but not all of its hiring.

""We seek talent all the time"" Moynihan told Bloomberg Television on Dec. 6. ""We're just more careful about it in times like this.""

After more than ten years of lax monetary policy that guided as much money into markets as possible increased liquidity and stimulated inflation a shift is underway. Now money is actively being withdrawn from markets to fight inflation. Advocates of this shift ignore that other instruments of economic policy — notably comprehensive price caps taxes on corporate profits and redistributive measures — are far better suited to fighting inflation than the current focus on monetary policy. In light of this it is hardly surprising that outside of the business press the impact of monetary policy decisions in the Global North on the states of the Global South are rarely even mentioned let alone debated. When currencies of the Global North and especially the US dollar become stronger (the stated goal of the current policy shift) states in the Global South come under pressure as their currencies become comparatively less valuable. As a result many of these states lose the ability to service large outstanding international debts and thus find themselves forced to take on new debts under ever-worsening conditions. All the while they are pressured by international institutions to implement austerity measures — if they aren’t already ruled by neoliberal governments happy to cut public goods and services on their own.

Strong Currency at the Expense of the Poor While history never repeats itself perfectly a look to the past paints the current monetary policy shift in a troubling light. When central banks in the Global North tightened the monetary reins in the 1970s in response to low growth and high inflation Latin America (along with other parts of the Global South) was hit by an unprecedented sovereign debt crisis that plunged the continent into a nearly decade-long economic crisis. And as is so often the case wage workers indigenous people and the poor were hit the hardest. In many ways the political-economic conjuncture of 1979 is similar to our present. Although COVID-19 did not exist and most imperial wars of aggression were still waged by the US the situation in the Global North was just as much a product of low growth and high inflation as it is today. These factors stemmed among other things from the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Though the Bretton Woods Agreement foresaw the establishment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank two institutions that exacerbate global inequality it also created a system of fixed exchange rates. Based on the gold standard this system played a major role in stabilizing the global economy following World War II. When Richard Nixon abandoned Bretton Woods in 1971 partly to combat recession in the Global North and financial speculation exchange rates became increasingly unstable as mountains of yield-hungry capital were unleashed on the Global South. At first this produced a fairly comfortable situation for many Latin American states. Although exchange rate fluctuations caused some problems interest rates on loans were generally favorable because of the glut of capital from the Global North — seemingly decent parameters for states whose governments were working to industrialize. After 1975 in particular many corporations banks and governments took out loans offered by Global North banks on conditions that appeared solid. But during this period of relative stability in Latin America the economic climate in the United States grew more complicated. In response to the oil crisis growing pressure on the US dollar from currency speculators and the resulting slowdown in economic growth US economic technocrats were forced to loosen monetary policy to prevent low growth rates as the stability of capitalist economies depends on high growth. At the time so the thinking went lowering key interest rates would give firms easier access credit which would in turn make the economy more productive increase exports and ultimately raise the value of the US dollar relative to other currencies. However the intended effect was not achieved: economic growth remained lacking and inflation kept rising anyway. In 1979 Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve. As soon as he took office Volcker instituted a drastic and unprecedented key interest rate hike. The consequences were predictable: the US economy collapsed and millions of people were forced into unemployment. As we now know this could have been avoided. Yet the consequences were even graver in Latin America. As the relative value of the US dollar shot up in response to the rapid key interest rate hike the costs of tending to debts exploded for countries such as Brazil. Not only were their currencies suddenly worth less in comparison but the interest rates on their debts skyrocketed as most of their loans had been borrowed with flexible interest rates linked directly to monetary policy in the Global North. In theory states that could no longer afford to service their debts had a variety of options. Indeed in financial crises before 1981 it was common for them simply to not repay loans when they couldn’t. This was exactly the course of action taken by the Mexican government in 1981. Yet as many now believed the financial markets spelled risk for their investment returns borrowing conditions for Latin American states deteriorated considerably. After all this crisis was different: the amount of loans extended to Latin America was so great that a series of defaults could have meant the collapse of the US banking system. For this reason the US banking sector and government put massive pressure on Latin American governments to repay their national debts — including by taking on new debts if necessary either from major US banks on conditions that were economically miserable or from the IMF on conditions that were politically miserable to boot. Though the emergency credit offered by the IMF for repaying debts seemed generous it was in fact contingent on so-called structural adjustment programs. Structural adjustment programs force states to open their financial markets to foreign capital slash social spending and sell off public assets to private firms and individuals. In the late 1970s and the 1980s many Latin American states spent multiple years trapped in situations where they had to implement them. The consequences for their populations were so severe that this period is now known as the “lost decade.” At the same time Volcker’s policy also drove masses of working-class people in the US into unemployment and personal debt — the effects of which can still be felt today.

Old Strategy New Resistance Much about the current situation recalls the year 1979. Due to the shutdowns in response to the COVID pandemic states around the world took on a considerable amount of debt to keep their economies up and running — just as many had already done following the 2007–8 financial crisis. In the ten largest Latin American economies (excluding Venezuela) the ratio of national debt to economic output has increased on average by 22.7 percent since 2007. In the last two years the costs of national debts in Latin America have gone through the roof: Argentina is now paying 21.5 percent more interest on government bonds than Germany whereas the rates faced by Ecuador and Venezuela respectively are as much as 46.8 and 89.4 percent higher. On average the ten largest Latin American economies pay 25.5 percent greater interest than Germany — money that has to be obtained through new debts or spending cuts or extracted from national economies through taxes. At 8.3 percent in the United States and 10 percent in the eurozone inflation is at similarly high levels to 1979. Moreover just as was the case at the time of the Volcker Shock economic growth in the United States and EU is low and federal banks in both are again tightening monetary policy. Today among other things this means raising key interest rates. In the last two years the Federal Reserve and the ECB have increased their respective key interest rates by 3 and 2 percent. Yet we don’t live in the same world as forty years ago. Progressive forces in the Global South have sought and found ways to defend themselves against exploitation by the Global North. For example many states have deliberately reduced their foreign currency debts. In Brazil 3.3 percent of the total debt is now in foreign currency compared to 22.5 percent in Mexico and 49.6 percent in Chile — significantly smaller figures than in 1979. Many states have developed mechanisms for responding to fluctuating exchange rates. In Latin America countries such as Colombia and Chile have compiled large reserves of foreign currencies which they can sell to stabilize their own currencies in periods of economic turbulence. Central banks in Brazil Mexico Peru Chile and Colombia have kept their financial markets liquid with asset purchase programs. Financial sector regulations have become tougher throughout the continent with oversight power allocated to central banks. Brazil and Mexico now also have direct access to US dollar liquidity from the Federal Reserve which allows them to absorb exchange rate fluctuations. Yet since the 2007 financial crisis the financial markets of the euro and the US dollar have only been propped up by massive interventions from central banks. By buying government bonds and other assets central banks have maintained the stability of both prices and the shadow banking system. Since 2007 central bankers and economists have been developing new instruments for dealing with the effects of the financial crisis the European debt crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Little by little these instruments have now become normalized. Most prominent among them are bond purchasing programs where central banks buy up bonds mostly from governments but also from private firms in order to stabilize financing costs and stimulate inflation. This has happened to such an extent that the ECB’s assets are now worth as much as a third of the EU’s annual economic output. The situation in the United States is similar. The point of these programs has been to give unregulated financial actors or so-called shadow banks access to short-term liquidity. Today scholars are warning that more than fifty states in the Global South are on the verge of defaulting on their debts. Meanwhile inflation is rising not only in the Global North but also in Latin America. In response central banks in the region are raising key interest rates which is supposed to stabilize currency values by reducing borrowing and thus inflation. Although interest rate hikes often don’t achieve this stated goal they do entail a number of side effects — such as causing economies to shrink. In capitalism this means increased unemployment reduced state revenue and cuts to public spending. In spite of current economic insecurity and instability the Federal Reserve and ECB are proceeding in an extremely risky manner by simultaneously reintroducing stabilization programs and raising key interest rates. Back in 2013 a simple announcement that the Federal Reserve would reduce asset purchase programs was enough to send the costs of Latin American debt through the roof. What we are currently witnessing is a policy that not only repeats the mistakes of 1979 but combines them with those of 2013. What the exact consequences of this policy will be and whether the tool kit of central bankers and economic policymakers in the Global South will be sufficient to deal with the expected shock is anyone’s best guess.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpa2luZ3MuY29tL25ld3MvZ3VpZGUtdG8tZ2FtZS1kYXktdnMtZ2lhbnRzLWF0LXVzLWJhbmstc3RhZGl1bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guide to Game Day: Vikings vs. Giants at U.S. Bank Stadium,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpa2luZ3MuY29tL25ld3MvZ3VpZGUtdG8tZ2FtZS1kYXktdnMtZ2lhbnRzLWF0LXVzLWJhbmstc3RhZGl1bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224CBDA50>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Courtesy of Bunny Rivera

Uber driver Bunny Rivera started working for the rideshare company after she became a mom.

Rivera said the job was flexible and she enjoyed the experience so she stuck with it.

She recalled some of her most unexpected holiday experiences which include really big tips.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Bunny Rivera a 35-year-old Uber driver from Washington DC about her experiences working during the holiday season. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I began delivering food for Uber Eats during the fall of 2019. Prior to that I was a flight attendant. When I got pregnant I continued flying right up until the 32-week mark when my doctor insisted I stop.

When my son Kaiden was two months old I left his father. Flying as a single mom was out of the question for me so I began searching for another way to earn a living. I also had to find a job where I could take my newborn son with me since I couldn't afford a babysitter. Uber Eats provided me with the flexibility I needed to do just that.

I only expected to do work for Uber Eats until I got back on my feet but I wound up enjoying the experience and the flexibility couldn't be beat. Most of the time I worked between 20 and 40 hours a week doing a combination of Uber Eats when Kaiden was with me and Uber rideshare when he was with his dad.

These days I run an Etsy shop and I'm swamped with orders for the holidays which doesn't leave much time for driving. But I have lots of unexpected experiences working with Uber during the holidays.

Where I drive in DC isn't always the safest and on more than one occasion I've been assaulted

One time a passenger grabbed my chest and I kicked him out of the car. Another time I arrived at my pickup only to find there were too many people in the party including little kids without car seats. When I told the group I couldn't take them one of the guys got mad reached through the car window and grabbed me by the shirt. When I tried rolling up the window a second man reached in trying to push the window back down. Luckily I was able to drive off.

Ever since I was first assaulted I posted a sign in the backseat of my car with a photo of me and Kaiden. If a passenger is looking to start any trouble my hope is that seeing I'm the mother of a small child will make them reconsider. In addition to the photo I list my Instagram handle and Cash App information for gratuities.

Despite what one might think my tips go down during the holidays

In my experience tipping has gone down since COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic I'd estimate half my rides tipped even if just a dollar but these days less than a quarter of my passengers tip. I chalk it up to people trying to save money. However those that do tip do fairly well.

During my first year driving for Uber I drove a couple home from a holiday party and they ended up tipping me $100. They even treated me to McDonald's since they requested we make a stop at the drive-thru.

Working full-time for Uber had become a good way to earn money on my own terms so I was at a complete loss when Kaiden at the age of 15 months got sick and I had to stop working for nearly a month and a half to stay home with him.

I'll never forget the day I picked Kaiden up from his dad's house and saw his lips turning blue. We rushed to the emergency room where a series of X-rays revealed he'd swallowed a coin.

That evening was one of the roughest of our lives. Over the next weeks Kaiden suffered from lung infections and pneumonia causing him to lose a dangerous amount of weight. Because he was so weak he couldn't return to daycare and so I couldn't return to work.







Christmas as we knew it was looking like it would be canceled in our household until I turned on the Uber app

On a trip to Walmart Kaiden spotted a ""Baby Shark"" ride-on toy that cost $150 and fell in love. One evening when Kaiden's dad took him for the night I decided to Uber as long as I could to earn enough to buy that Baby Shark assuming it would take five or six hours.

The night started out slow until I picked up two drunk college guys who were headed from one bar to another.

When they saw my sign the guys started asking me about my plans for Christmas. I told them we weren't doing much of anything and that I was out working to afford the Baby Shark toy for Kaiden. I didn't think much of it when they asked me how much it cost but then they announced they were going to tip me $150 so I could buy the toy.

Unfortunately the Uber app has a $100 limit on tips. My passengers didn't have Cash App and I didn't have Venmo so they insisted I call a girlfriend of mine who used Venmo so they could send her the money. It was after midnight but luckily she answered I explained the situation to her and the guys sent her the money.

Then they waited in my car for her to forward the money to my Cash App. As soon as that money hit my phone I just broke down and started crying.

To this day I keep in touch with one of the guys on Instagram and we message once in a while. What he and his friend did that night meant everything to me. One day when Kaiden is older I'll tell him Santa exists in many forms and that he's not just a guy with a white beard and a red hat.

I haven't driven for Uber since October but after the holidays I plan to drive 20 hours a week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDgyOTE4My9ob3ctdWJlci1yYWlzZWQtMS01LW1pbGxpb24tdG8taGVscC11a3JhaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Uber raised $1.5 million to help Ukraine,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90829183/how-uber-raised-1-5-million-to-help-ukraine on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDgyOTE4My9ob3ctdWJlci1yYWlzZWQtMS01LW1pbGxpb24tdG8taGVscC11a3JhaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnViZXIuY29tL3VzL2VuL2UvZGVsaXZlci9ncm9jZXJ5L2ZvcnQtd29ydGgtdHgtdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flexible grocery delivery jobs in Fort Worth,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 406 Client Error: Not Acceptable for url: https://www.uber.com/us/en/e/deliver/grocery/fort-worth-tx-us/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnViZXIuY29tL3VzL2VuL2UvZGVsaXZlci9ncm9jZXJ5L2ZvcnQtd29ydGgtdHgtdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbGlua25reS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy91YmVyLWZyZWlnaHQtbGFuZHMtb2ZmaWNlLXNwYWNlLWRlYWwtYXQtbmV3cG9ydC1vbi10aGUtbGV2ZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Freight lands office space deal at Newport on the Levee,"Uber Freight a logistics platform subsidiary of the ride-sharing giant has signed a lease for 20000 square feet worth of office space at Newport on the Levee reported the Cincinnati Business Courier.

Compared to its last extensive merchandising overhaul in 2018 Ulta Beauty’s latest update increasingly emphasizes its service offerings. It includes new brow and makeup services offered in partnership with Benefit and MAC Cosmetics via new beauty bars located in the center of the store. Every new store and every remodeled store will feature the new layout design. Ulta Beauty has long offered salon hair services through a back-bar program featuring brands like Briogeo. During the retailer’s third-quarter 2022 earnings call in December Dave Kimball CEO of Ulta Beauty remarked on the importance of salon services.

“Our services business accelerated and delivered another quarter of double-digit comparable growth primarily due to higher stylist retention increased stylist productivity and increased capacity in our salons as we lap capacity constraints due to the pandemic” he said. “Our targeted CRM efforts to drive awareness trial and frequency are working increasing salon appointments from existing and new [customers]. Our in-store back-bar events also continued to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands.”

Ulta Beauty’s new merchandising strategy comes nearly two years after the retail industry felt the brunt of Covid-19 in 2020. Since brick-and-mortar stores have reopened retailers have watched temporary effects including the exclusive focus on e-commerce give way to more long-term industry trends like omnichannel wellness and a customer focus on values. According to Monica Arnaudo chief merchandising officer at Ulta Beauty the fact that the consumer’s journey is no longer linear informed the new strategy. The Ulta Beauty team considered consumers’ embrace of buy-online pick-up in-store and curbside pick-up.

Also newly positioned within the center of stores are elevated gondolas housing Estée Lauder Clinique and Lancôme brands which Arnaudo called the perfect transition brands between prestige and masstige. They also encompass both makeup and skin-care products which are categories on opposite sides of the store.

“Beauty services can mean an additional visit which may result in product purchases beyond the beauty service itself” said Manola Soler senior director at Alvarez & Marsal Consumer Retail Group a professional services firm. “Services have been part of [Ulta’s] long-term strategy and they remain at a relatively low penetration of total revenue at around 3-4% in recent years. Well-executed services present an opportunity to grow their share of consumers’ beauty wallets and could have a halo effect on their overall spend with the retailer.”

Other noticeable changes at Ulta locations include a repositioning of skin care to the front of the store driven by the category’s overall growth in the past three years. All of skin care has been brought together flowing from mass to masstige to prestige brands. In the pre-existing layout prestige skin care was positioned toward the back of the store on one side with mass skin care placed in front of the store on the opposite side. On another side of the store is now makeup also flowing from mass to masstige and prestige. Fragrance has been moved to the back of stores and there is now dedicated space in the front of the store for brand and product launches across categories. In addition checkout has been moved closer to the salon. As Glossy reported in 2018 Ulta Beauty’s strategy of offering mass and prestige products is core to its strategy.

“This is a big evolution for us. It was important for us to consider the feedback we were receiving” said Arnaudo. “We [wanted to] create an experience that was easy for [customers] to navigate so they could spend their time playing and discovering and being inspired versus spending time trying to find things.” who said this?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZWtub3dzLmNvbS9saXZpbmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjY4ODgwMS9waWNrdXAtZ2lmdHMtdWx0YS_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaGVrbm93cy5jb20vbGl2aW5nL2FydGljbGVzLzI2ODg4MDEvcGlja3VwLWdpZnRzLXVsdGEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shopping Super Last-Minute?

Why Trust Us?

Jennifer Garner recently revealed her favorite foundation-meets-concealer.

The 50-year-old star told Prevention she loves .

Garner shared some of her other favorite skincare recs.

Jennifer Garner tends to have the best advice. Whether she’s touting her cute casual sneakers for every day walking around the lengthening mascara she uses to create defined lashes or even the eye cream she says plumps and decreases lines we can’t get enough of her recommendations. That’s why when she recently sat down with Prevention we asked about her must-have beauty products. What topped the list?

The pick strays from her usual Neutrogena recommendations (don’t worry she still uses the brand for all of her skincare needs). In fact the Neutrogena ambassador has long loved the and s from the brand. And she was so ready to sing the brand’s praises (which makes sense—it’s been 20 years since her iconic Neutrogena face splash commercial).

The foundation-meets-concealer wins Garner’s love for covering a bit of redness. “My friend Monica Blunder has a great little [concealer]” Garner told Prevention. “I put a little around my nose.”



The beauty rec has plenty of love from shoppers to back it up. And it’ll save space in your makeup bag. Blunder Cover is designed to level up the look of skin thanks to its all-in-one concealer/foundation make that aims to even out skin tone. The formula is sheer upon first application but can be built upon as a concealer for places that need a bit more coverage according to the brand.

The skin-loving product contains botanicals like arnica edelweiss and gentle hydrating oils to give your complexion a refreshed appearance.

Though it’s a bit pricy fans say it’s worth it—Garner isn’t the only one who loves the concealer. Just check out the reviews section. “I’ve been following Monika Blunder since before she came out with this. I bought it the minute it was released and have used it DAILY since. Literally. It’s the perfect consistency for whatever you need...either concealing or to be used like a foundation. It does not break me out either (I have SUPER sensitive skin). Please don’t ever change the formula as there is NOTHING like this on the market” wrote one happy Nordstrom customer.

“I have dry skin and am in my 40s. This stuff is beautiful and lasts through the heat. I have tried many foundations and this is one of my favorites” wrote another.

If the price tag is a bit steep for you not to worry. Garner has plenty of drugstore beauty must-haves that will level up your routine. Check out some of her favorites in skincare below to get glowing like the star."
UNP,Union Pacific Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2JldHRlci1idXktdW5pb24tcGFjaWZpYy1vci1jc3gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Union Pacific or CSX?,"Both railways have shown resilience amid a shaky economic climate. But one makes a better buy in today's market.

With freight demand robust this year American railroad companies are taking advantage of greater volumes combined with higher rates. Although steady demand for freight transportation is expected to continue the railway industry also faces near-term supply chain disruptions labor shortages and soaring fuel prices.

Railroad companies that can endure the current economy with minimal damage stand to benefit greatly over time especially considering rail is the most economically and environmentally friendly way to transport goods and materials across the U.S.

Let's take a closer look at two major American railway players and determine which of these railroad stocks makes a better buy in today's market.

1. Union Pacific

Union Pacific (UNP 0.32%) operates 32000 miles of track across 23 states in the western two-thirds of the U.S. As a historic American railway Union Pacific has transported the country's coal agricultural products shipping containers and other freight since 1862. As a member of the prestigious Fortune 500 the Omaha-based company remains a pillar of the rail industry.

After posting third-quarter records for operating revenue operating income net income and earnings per share Union Pacific certainly seems to be on the right track. However a shift in consumer spending from goods to experiences recently triggered a 16% drop in parcel shipments for the rail carrier.

And although volumes were actually up in Q3 staffing shortages left a substantial amount of business on the table for Union Pacific. Despite crew setbacks CEO Lance Fritz is confident that hiring initiatives and enhanced training programs will dig the company out of its staffing hole. According to Fritz although 2022 hasn't exactly been ideal Union Pacific's volumes have nevertheless ""outpaced"" peers throughout the year.

Union Pacific now looks to carry its current momentum in coal autos and construction materials shipments into 2023. To improve profitability Fritz and his team pursue streamlined operations better fleet management faster train speeds and -- above all -- increased volumes.

2. CSX

Also a member of the Fortune 500 CSX (CSX -0.35%) serves every major city in the eastern U.S. In addition to energy-related industrial construction agricultural and consumer freight CSX also runs a small number of passenger trains.

Like Union Pacific CSX has struggled with crew shortages in recent quarters. The Jacksonville Florida-based railway's on-time departures fell 13% in the third quarter and on-time arrivals dropped 16% year over year. However things are improving at CSX with over 6800 crew members hired out of a 7000-hire goal. Vice President of Operations Jamie Boychuk affirmed that train speeds and capacities will continue to pick up once hiring and training are complete.

CSX's new CEO former Ford Motor Company executive Joe Hinrichs seeks to enhance existing railway operations by focusing on service and reliability. Hinrichs' simplified holistic approach centers on improving CSX's core competencies to scale operations. Once the railroad operator earns a track record of reliable predictable service CSX should attract new business organically while retaining and growing its existing accounts.

Undeterred by staffing concerns CSX grew volumes by 2% in Q3 while the railway earned 18% more revenue and 15% more profit than in 2021. As underscored by Boychuk during the Q3 earnings call CSX could stand to see substantial growth -- both in volume and profitability -- once fully operational.

Which railway stock is a better buy right now?

To determine which of these railway stocks makes a better buy in today's market let's compare their price-to-earnings ratios and dividend yields.

Metric Union Pacific CSX Market cap $129.2 billion $66.5 billion Price-to-earnings ratio 18.74 16.83 Dividend yield 2.47% 1.26%

Although it has a higher price-to-earnings ratio Union Pacific does have a greater dividend yield a benefit for income investors. In my opinion the higher yield makes Union Pacific today's winner. However both of these iconic operators stand to benefit from a railway industry poised for long-term growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Thousands of travelers were stranded at airports or stuck on hold trying to rebook flights this week as a massive storm snarled travel in the U.S. and Canada ahead of the holidays.

With the snow rain ice wind and frigid temperatures disrupting air travel plans nationwide United Southwest American Delta and JetBlue are the five major airlines offering flyers a little extra cushion this holiday weekend.

But how does each airline’s system work?

Kurt Ebenhoch a consumer travel advocate and former airline executive said travelers should read the fine print carefully. If you book a return flight outside the window that the airline sets you may have to pay for the difference in fares for example.

United

United Airlines will waive change fees and fare differences for passengers traveling through the East Coast Texas Central and Northwest and the Midwest.

Passengers have until Dec. 28 2022 to rebook.

Policy: https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/notices.html#waiver1

Southwest

Southwest Airlines is offering winter weather waiver codes for all travelers until Dec. 26 2022.

Flights must be rebooked within 14 days of the original travel dates.

Policy: https://www.southwest.com/html/historical-waiver/

American

American Airlines passengers traveling through the Northeast region are eligible for change fee waivers.

Passengers must have purchased their tickets by Dec. 19 2022 and all changes must be made by Saturday night.

Delta

Delta Airlines issued travel advisories for the Atlantic Northeast Northwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the country.

Atlantic and Northeast travelers have until Dec. 27 2022 to rebook or make changes.

Northwest Travelers have until Dec. 26 2022 and Pacific Northwest travelers have until Christmas Day.

JetBlue

JetBlue has a winter weather fee waiver for Northeast and Midwest travelers.

Passengers also have until Christmas Day to rebook flights.

Airlines say one of the best things travelers can do is download their app for information. This way you will stay up to date about any possible delays cancellations or any additional travel options.

As of Friday afternoon more than 4800 flights into or out of U.S. airports had been canceled according to the flight tracking service FlightAware.

RELATED: Winter storm woes causing headaches for holiday travelers

Staying calm -- and knowing your rights -- can go a long way if your flight is canceled experts say. Here’s some of their advice for dealing with a flight cancellation:

MY FLIGHT WAS CANCELED. WHAT NEXT?

If you still want to get to your destination most airlines will rebook you for free on the next available flight as long as it has seats according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

If you want to cancel the trip you are entitled to a full refund even if you bought non-refundable tickets. You’re also entitled to a refund of any bag fees seat upgrades or other extras.

Ebenhoch stressed that travelers are eligible for a refund not just vouchers for future travel. If you do take a voucher make sure you inquire about blackout dates and other restrictions on its use.

CAN I ASK TO BE BOOKED ON ANOTHER AIRLINE’S FLIGHT?

Yes. Airlines aren’t required to put you on another airline’s flight but they can and sometimes do according to the DOT. Jeff Klee CEO of CheapAir.com recommends researching alternate flights while you’re waiting to talk to an agent. Agents are typically under a lot of pressure when a flight is canceled so giving them some options helps.

Ebenhoch also suggests looking for alternative airports that are close to your original destination.

IS THE AIRLINE REQUIRED TO GIVE ME A HOTEL ROOM OR OTHER COMPENSATION?

No. Each airline has its own policies about providing for customers whose flights are canceled according to the DOT. But many airlines do offer accommodations so you should check with their staff.

I’M FACING A LONG WAIT TO REBOOK. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

If someone in your traveling party is at a higher level in a frequent flier program use the number reserved for that level to call the airline Ebenhoch said. You can also try calling an international help desk for the airline since those agents have the ability to make changes.

HOW CAN I AVOID THIS IN THE FUTURE?

Ebenhoch said nonstop flights and morning flights are generally the most reliable if you can book them. If you’re worried about making it to the airport in time for a morning flight he said consider staying at a hotel connected to the airport the night before. And consider flying outside of busy dates; this year the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration is expecting big crowds on Dec. 30 for example.

Klee recommends comparing airlines’ policies on the DOT’s service dashboard: https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard. He also suggests reserving multiple flights and then canceling the ones you don’t use as long as the airline will refund your money or convert it into a credit for a future flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8yNS1tb3N0LXZpc2l0ZWQtY291bnRyaWVzLXdvcmxkLTE2NTQ0NTgzNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 Most Visited Countries in the World,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8yNS1tb3N0LXZpc2l0ZWQtY291bnRyaWVzLXdvcmxkLTE2NTQ0NTgzNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212268F86D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

STORY: ‘’It's an incredibly complex and challenging conundrum for ship owners.’’The shipping industry is under increasing pressure to decarbonize.Especially now that the International Maritime Organization the IMO is being pushed to implement a charge on the sector's greenhouse gas emissions - potentially as soon as September 2024 with the goal of reaching net zero by 2050.But getting there is complicated say shipping executives.They cite unclear regulatory guidelines particularly around which cleaner fuels to switch to. Kenny MacLean is Chief operating officer of Peninsula which supplies fuel to the shipping industry.‘’We obviously empathize with the complexity and the variety of regulatory regimes are placing upon what are essentially our customers and also us to an extent as well because we operate ships. I think the big issue about the new fuels regulatory guidelines is that they there are a lot of them and that they all to an extent overlap. But most importantly I think as they come from different either national regional or international bodies.Shipping accounts for roughly 90% of world trade and is responsible for nearly 3% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. Currently most large ships run on very low-sulfur fuel oil a tar-like substance that is relatively inexpensive and energy dense so a fairly small amount is needed to propel a vessel for great distances.Other greener alternatives include ammonia methanol or biofuel.But industry research has shown that they each have their unfavorable characteristics - ranging from dangerous and toxic to expensive or in limited supply.""Shipping is split into two key categories liner and tramp. So liners you know things like cruises ferries container lines. They pretty much know where they're going to be when they're going to be there. If you're in the tramp business it's a spot business so your ship could literally be deployed anywhere in the world. So if you have more certainty over where your ship's going to be deployed you equally have more certainty over the fuel propulsion system that you can choose because you know what is available today or what is likely to be available in the future. If you're in the tramp trade however you're going to need as much flexibility as possible. So that's why we're looking at hybrid propulsion systems. It could be traditional fuels coupled with something like LNG.’’LNG which stands for liquefied natural gas powered this 8000-passenger Royal Caribbean cruise ship on its maiden voyage in early 2024.The company says the cleaner burning fuel makes the vessel 24% more efficient when it comes to carbon emissions than required by the IMO.But environmental groups say the accompanying methane leakage from the ship's engines is an unacceptable risk to the climate.Bryan Comer Director of the Marine Program at the International Council of Clean Transportation‘’LNG isn't a short-term or long-term solution because the moment that you start using LNG as a marine fuel including in cruise ships you actually start to emit more greenhouse gas emissions than if you had done nothing and continued to run on the fuels that we're using today. ‘’It's actually a step in the wrong direction.""Last year European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen named the world's first methanol-fueled container vessel at a ceremony in Copenhagen.""This event is a big deal not only for Europe but for the whole world. By successfully decarbonising shipping we're not only promoting our fight against climate change we're also creating new supply chains new industries and thousands of new good jobs.""Experts say the challenge for ship owners is not just to do with choosing the right cleaner fuel it’s about its availability too.Roger Holm is Marine president at Wärtsilä - a Finnish company which provides equipment to the maritime industry.‘’Here you have the chicken and egg problem with these fuels that companies are not ready to invest [in] when they don't know exactly the financial impact.

The parties still seek accord covering Medicare Advantage plans.

EVERETT — Thousands of people who receive health care coverage through Regence got good news Friday: They can continue receiving in-network care at The Everett Clinic and The Polyclinic.

Those patients had been living with uncertainty for weeks as Regence BlueShield and Optum the parent company of the two clinics negotiated a new contract to replace one expiring this week. Regence announced the agreement late Thursday.

“We’re pleased to share that we have reached agreement with Optum to keep The Everett Clinic and The Polyclinic in network for our Commercial members. There should be no disruption in care for our Commercial members because of these negotiations” reads a statement on the Regence website.

Regence will send letters to affected members and notify employers and brokers.

The dispute affected everyone with a Regence plan including state and other public employees and retirees with the Uniform Medical Plan. Absent a deal The Everett Clinic and The Polyclinic would have been out-of-network meaning patients would face much higher bills.

The Uniform Medical Plan contract alone affects about 5500 members who receive care at The Everett Clinic and 10800 members who receive care at The Polyclinic according to the state Health Care Authority.

It isn’t all good news.

The agreement announced Thursday does not cover Medicare Advantage plan members. The parties are still negotiating terms of a new Medicare Advantage contract to replace the one that ended Dec. 5.

In November Regence sent letters to members saying Optum demanded a double-digit increase in negotiated rates. Optum officials have not spoken in detail about the impasses.

Regence members with Medicare Supplement Insurance also known as Medigap may receive services from any provider that accepts Medicare. Medigap members are not affected by Optum’s decision and ongoing negotiations according to a Regence press release.

Regence BlueShield is a nonprofit independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Regence reported over $95.8 million in profits in 2021 largely from investment gains according to financial statements reported to the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner. It ended 2021 with a $1.55 billion surplus. Regence actually reported an underwriting loss: It spent more in claims and operating the business than it took in with premiums.

The Everett Clinic is part of Optum which in turn is part of UnitedHealth Group a massive health care company that earned $17.3 billion in profits in 2021. It has over $42 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Sept. 30.",,,,,,,,,

Widely admired retired Massachusetts legislator from Worthington Steve Kulik died at his home on December 18. Kulik served as state representative of the First Franklin District from 1993 until his retirement in 2019 representing as many as 27 small communities stretching from the Hampshire Hilltowns to the Quabbin Reservoir.

His successor Natalie Blais described him as “a fierce advocate for not only his own district but all of Western Massachusetts.”

Kulik attended the UMass University Without Walls program and met his wife Suzanne Thaxter Kulik while marching from Cambridge to Boston to protest the Vietnam War as part of the October Moratorium in 1969. The couple settled in Worthington where after attending the Annual Town Meeting Kulik described being “totally blown away that people could actually participate in town government openly.”

After a stint on the select board Kulik was named president of the Massachusetts Municipal Association (MMA) and ran successfully for the First Franklin District seat a job that would require him to regularly drive 25000 miles per year. In the House he rose to become Vice Chair of the Ways and Means Committee and started the Legislative Rural Caucus.

Kulik’s legislative work included advocating for rural broadband access co-creating the Massachusetts Food Policy Council and supporting landmark state bills for universal health care and legalization of same-sex marriage.

In 2016 Kulik was a sponsor of House Bill 2584 An Act relative to payments in lieu of taxation by organizations exempt from the property tax. The bill would give municipalities the right to assess payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) on 25% of the value of property owned by nonprofits. It would address the challenge faced by several communities in Western Massachusetts where entities such as private schools and hospitals that own valuable real estate require municipal infrastructure and services but are exempt from paying property taxes.

The proposed legislation attracted attention in Amherst where town meeting member Vince O’Connor sponsored Article 44 on the 2016 annual town meeting warrant seeking passage of a resolution in support of the Kulik bill. In a rare display of town meeting unity the resolution passed by a vote of 146-7.

Kulik’s bill died in committee but efforts to enact PILOT legislation in Massachusetts continue. Local State Senator Jo Comerford and 11 others have introduced Senate Bill 1874 similar to Stephen Kulik’s bill but limited to tax-exempt organizations owning property valued at more than $15 million.

Vince O’Connor speaks in support of Kulik Bill at June 6 2016 Amherst Town Meeting

CITY OF SAN FERNANDO Pampanga – The Department of Health Central Luzon Center for Health Development (DOH CLCHD) on Thursday turned over medical transport vehicles to 19 municipalities in the region to enhance the delivery of local health services.

The move is part of the mandate of the agency's Health Facility Enhancement Program to support local Universal Health Care implementations through the provision of medical transport and equipment to local government units (LGUs).

Of the 19 LGU health facility recipients one is in Bataan province four in Bulacan nine in Nueva Ecija two in Pampanga and three in Tarlac.

DOH CLCHD Director Corazon Flores said on Friday the medical transport vehicles will be used by the LGUs for the continuous delivery of quality healthcare services to their localities.

""Together we shall ensure that each vehicle will be made available to anyone who will be in need of immediate ambulance services in their respective municipalities. We aim to keep patients stable while they get transferred to a health facility for more specialized care"" Flores said in a statement.

Each of the medical transport vehicles is equipped with an ambulance stretcher automatic external defibrillator (AED) nebulizer portable suction machines manual resuscitators oxygen cylinder and other medical equipment and accessories that are needed to ensure quality patient transport.

She asked the recipients to take care of the vehicles for their enhanced delivery of emergency health services in their area.

Meanwhile Flores assured that the DOH will continue to improve primary health care and provide easy access to health services in the communities.

In the guidelines issued by it NIH has directed the provincial health authorities to stop diagnostic laboratories from conducting Vidal and typhoid tests immediately saying blood culture test is the surest way to confirm typhoid fever.

In the letter written by the Sindh Healthcare Commission the NIH stated that action will be taken against laboratories and hospitals conducting uncertified tests.

The NIH says that outbreaks of typhoid fever are being reported from different parts of the country especially in flood-affected areas and some laboratories and hospitals in the flood-affected areas are still conducting these tests. The NIH states that the only validated test to confirm typhoid fever is a blood culture and that should be done.

Following the guidelines of the NIH the Sindh Healthcare Commission has also stopped laboratories and hospitals across the province from conducting Vidal and typhoid tests.

Apart from this Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority and other institutions have also banned Vidal and typhoid tests.

Infectious disease experts say Vidal and typhoid lead to misdiagnosis of typhoid fever often misdiagnosing people with viral fever and malaria and giving them antibiotics that are the wrong treatment.

Meanwhile the Ministry of National Health Services and Regulations in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) Pakistan commemorated the Universal Health Coverage Day 2022 with the aim to raise awareness on the need for strong equitable and resilient health systems and universal health coverage (UHC).

Minister of State Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani and WHO representative Dr Palitha Mahipala were the chief guests for the ceremony. The event was attended by representatives from Federal and Provincial Health Departments UN agencies Health Development partners and other stakeholders.

Abdul Qadir Patel Federal Health Minister said: “The Government of Pakistan is fully committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensuring Health and well-being of its people. Achieving Universal Health Coverage is a foundational driver of inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Maintaining progress towards UHC is challenging and is first and foremost a political choice. Effective Primary Health Care (PHC)-oriented systems are the bedrock of equitable and resilient health systems that deliver high-quality health care to everyone. Investing for UHC and PHC is the sure way to guarantee socioeconomic wellbeing of our communities.

Patel added that strong political commitment from National and Provincial/Federating area governments and partner organizations is an essential ingredient for overcoming barriers. He appreciated the provincial/federating area Health departments district health offices and Health Development Partners for their extensive support and contribution towards UHC. He also appreciated WHO to organize this ceremony for UHC day commemoration.

On the occasion WHO Representative Dr Palitha Mahipala highlighted that this year’s UHC Day theme Build the world we want: A healthy future for all emphasizes that to build strong health systems we need equity trust healthy environments investments and accountability.

He stressed that investment in health systems is the need of the hour and urged all stakeholders to join hands and make commitment to prioritize investments for building resilient health systems that can withstand at the time of crisis such as pandemic and natural disasters to ensure “Healthy Future for All”.

WHO and Health Ministry jointly launched three reports on UHC Day (Pakistan UHC Monitoring Report 2022 Pakistan PHC profile Status of Health Financing in Pakistan). Launch of these reports is an important step to monitor the current UHC PHC and health financing situation at national level.

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) today released the latest yearly editions of its Toxic 100 lists of the top corporate air and water polluters and top greenhouse gas emitters in the United States based on the most recent data available from the Environmental Protection Agency.

New this year is the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by the amount that their distribution of fossil fuels contributes to global climate change. This new list joins the Greenhouse 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their emissions responsible for global climate change according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the Toxic 100 Air and Toxic 100 Water Indexes which rank U.S. industrial polluters using the EPA Toxics Release Inventory. The indexes created as part of PERI’s Corporate Toxics Information Project once again include environmental justice indicators to assess impacts on low-income people and minorities.

“The Toxic 100 and Greenhouse 100 inform consumers shareholders regulators lawmakers and communities which large corporations release toxic and climate-altering pollutants into our environment” says Michael Ash professor of economics at UMass Amherst and co-director of the Corporate Toxics Information Project. “We assess not just how many pounds of pollutants are released but which are the most toxic and who is exposed. People have a right to know about toxic hazards to which they are exposed. Legislators need to understand the effects of pollution on their constituents.”

For the first time PERI has published a Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index which ranks U.S. companies by their 2020 supply of products that result in greenhouse gas emissions when the products are released combusted or oxidized. The top five companies on this year’s inaugural list in order are Marathon Petroleum Phillips 66 Valero Energy Exxon Mobil and Peabody Energy. The first four of these are primarily on the list because of their petroleum refining operations although the top two also conduct natural gas extraction. Fifth-ranked Peabody Energy is on the list due to its coal mining ventures. The top four each produced fossil fuels that resulted in 280 million metric tons or more of CO2-equivalent emissions. Rounding out the top 10 greenhouse suppliers are Enterprise Products Partners Chevron BP Arch Resources and Shell PLC.

The Greenhouse 100 Index ranks companies by 2020 direct emissions of greenhouse gasses from large sources. The top three companies are Vistra Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company the fourth year in a row in which these companies were in the top three spots. They each released more than 75 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Together these three companies released 4% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from all sources including non-energy sources.

The rest of the top 10 in the Greenhouse 100 are Berkshire Hathaway American Electric Power Energy Capital Partners NextEra Energy Xcel Energy the U.S government and Exxon Mobil the top company whose direct emissions are not dominated by electric power plants. Among the top 10 Energy Capital Partners has the highest weighted share of minorities living within 10 miles of its facilities.

In order LyondellBasell BASF Becton Dickinson Salzgitter Huntsman Dow Inc Canopus International Celanese Berkshire Hathaway and NOV Inc. lead the Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index which reports the top companies in 2020 in terms of total potential chronic human health risk from toxic chemical air pollutants. Five of these companies are in the top 10 almost entirely because of chromium or ethylene oxide released from one of their facilities. The Toxic 100 Air Index covers both publicly traded and privately held companies such as Koch Industries (No. 58) that appear on Forbes Fortune or S&P lists. The index includes environmental justice indicators that denote for example while minorities make up just under 40% of the U.S. population they bear 68% of the air-toxics risk from facilities owned by LyondellBasell.

The Toxic 100 Water Polluters Index which ranks the pounds of toxics released into surface water or sent to water-treatment systems in 2020 adjusted for chemical toxicity is led this year by Northrop Grumman LyondellBasell NextEra Industries Dow Inc. and Cargill. The Toxic 100 Water Polluters list also once again includes environmental justice indicators that show for example minorities bear 63% of the toxic hazard created by Dow from water releases and transfers to water treatment facilities.

In addition to the top 100 lists search functions for toxic air toxic water and greenhouse gas polluters provide information on all companies reporting releases or production to the Toxics Release Inventory the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program or the EIA-7A coal mine survey. Data related to Air Toxics at School and the Coal Producers Index is also searchable through the Corporate Toxics Information Project.

“In making this information available we are building on the achievements of the right-to-know movement” Ash notes. “Our goal is to engender public participation in environmental decision-making and to help residents translate the right to know into the right to clean air clean water and a livable planet.”

Apple iPhone 14 Plus 5G 128GB Storage Multiple Colors New Line Required $720 off (80%) $180 $899 99 Buy at Verizon





Both deals removed the obligatory trade-in from the equation and although they obviously still came with a bunch of special requirements and exclusions it clearly became incredibly hard to turn down the classically notched Apple A15 Bionic powerhouse.





Not to be outdone by the competition Verizon appears to have discreetly improved its early holiday offer from last month to not only match but (narrowly) beat AT&T's iPhone 14 Plus Christmas promo.





New and existing Big Red subscribers willing to open a new line of wireless service are now looking at spending a measly $5 $7.77 and $13.33 a month for iPhone 14 Plus units with 128 256 and 512GB internal storage space respectively.





That's with your choice of an outright or device payment purchase mind you but either way the $720 savings will be applied to your account as bill credits over a period of three years. All in all the iPhone 14 Plus will thus set you back $180 $280 or $480 in 128 256 and 512 gig configurations respectively with no trade-in or port-in required.





In contrast AT&T customers need to cough up $10 and $15 a month for 256 and 512GB variants respectively so although certainly small Verizon's advantage over its arch-rival is definitely worth mentioning and taking into consideration.





Meanwhile the entry-level iPhone 14 Plus model is just as affordable on both carriers but in order to further sweeten that deal as well Verizon can also offer you a $200 gift card when switching your number from a different operator which effectively makes the non-Pro handset cheaper than free.





That's definitely not bad for such a reasonably powerful mobile device with reasonably capable dual rear-facing cameras a decidedly gorgeous 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED screen solid battery life and the exact same stellar software support as the much costlier iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max





You probably already know that the least successful member of the iPhone 14 family is the Plus-branded 6.7-inch replacement of the similarly unpopular 5.4-inch iPhone 13 mini from last year but that's actually not a bad thing for cash-strapped Apple fans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvc291dGgvMjAyMi8xMi8yMy9zdHJhdXNzLXNlbGxzLWxhbmQtZm9ybWVybHktcGxhbm5lZC1tZWF0cGFja2luZy1wbGFudC1mcmFua2xpbi82OTc1MjUzMDAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Strauss Brands sells land formerly slated for a new meatpacking plant in Franklin,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.jsonline.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/communities/south/2022/12/23/strauss-sells-land-formerly-planned-meatpacking-plant-franklin/69752530007/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226EAC790>, 'Connection to www.jsonline.com timed out.

Here's Why,"There's been a lot of hype around 5G over the past six years and to an extent it still exists today. Driverless cars remote surgery the metaverse -- all buzzwords that have yet to materialize in any real way.

One area where it has noticeably helped change our lives? It finally provides some long-overdue competition to cable companies for home broadband. I've been exploring whether 5G and technologies like it (known as ""fixed wireless"") could replace traditional home broadband over the past year testing out midband solutions from Verizon and T-Mobile as well as millimeter-wave options like Honest Networks.

I ditched my Spectrum subscription and even switched my apartment to Honest which provides gigabit upload and download speeds to our building for $50 per month. It was great for months and I would have been happy to continue using it.

Locating local internet providers

At least until Spectrum came knocking.

Competition breeds deals

Spectrum's deal of three months free was awfully compelling. Screenshot by Eli Blumenthal/CNET

Since ditching Spectrum I got a flyer in the mail offering three months of free TV and internet if I switched back. There were no contracts or commitment strings attached either. The company seems to be hoping that once people sign up they won't leave again so quickly.

Locating local internet providers

As an avid sports fan the appeal of traditional cable was certainly enticing for the rest of the NFL and college football regular seasons MLB postseason and the beginning of the NBA and NHL campaigns. Getting and managing regional sports networks in New York is a hassle and the only streaming service that offers all of them (DirecTV Stream) is pricey at $90 per month for the Choice package.

While my internet speeds wouldn't be as fast as the gigabit promised by Honest Spectrum's Internet Ultra offers download speeds ""up to 500Mbps"" which is more than enough for all of my and my roommates' work video chats streaming and gaming.

Plus even after the three months are up the internet charge would be $40 per month a $10 monthly savings compared to T-Mobile and Honest.

I can't say this deal is a direct result of 5G internet options joining the fray and adding competition. I also don't know if Spectrum is offering this everywhere or just in some markets like New York City but it does seem to be a newer option.

""We have nationally consistent regular pricing and customer-friendly policies like no modem fees data caps or contracts"" a Spectrum spokesman said in a statement. ""We often offer promotions to new or upgrading customers to give them the chance to sample a service or package at a discount for a specific period of time before the regular price takes effect.""

These deals also aren't always just for new subscribers. The old trick of calling up your provider and threatening to switch to T-Mobile or Verizon which I noticed when helping a friend with their Optimum bill in New Jersey helped lower their bill by $40 per month before they adjusted anything on their service.

The cable companies seem to be concerned and perhaps rightfully so. Verizon's earnings saw consumers flee its traditional wireless phone business amid higher prices but the carrier did add 234000 consumer ""fixed wireless"" users.

T-Mobile added 578000 home internet users in its most recent quarter and now has over 2.1 million subscribers.

Comcast the largest cable operator in the US seems to be particularly worried and earlier this month began rolling out TV ads against T-Mobile's Home Internet encouraging users to head to its website where it ""compares"" the two broadband options. A number of cable companies -- including Comcast Optimum and Spectrum -- have also been offering bundles of home internet with their own mobile services.

""I think you'll see (cable companies) getting more aggressive with promotions and work on driving up speeds to try and counter the momentum the telcos are getting"" Technalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell says.

""Given how fast (home internet) subscribers for both T-Mobile and Verizon have been growing consumers clearly get it and seem eager to move away from cable companies"" he says.

Faster speeds are coming too

Beyond the price and deals the rise of 5G home broadband has also coincided with a renewed push by cable companies on speed. Comcast's lead point against T-Mobile is that it has more gigabit offerings available and that its broadband could be up to 36 times faster than T-Mobile's 5G home internet.

""Fixed wireless over 5G is making it crucial that cable companies upgrade their infrastructure to be able to claim consistently high speeds particularly on uploads where wireless can struggle today"" said Avi Greengart an analyst for research firm Techsponential.

A wide variety of other providers including Optimum Spectrum Verizon and AT&T have added new multigigabit speed tiers and expanded their buildouts for fiber service all while the three major wireless providers continue to build out and improve 5G service. This push for faster options should allow for not only the prospect of better speeds for those looking for a boost but also better selections for their needs.

""People who are continuing to work at home or who just want the fastest option will look at fiber"" says O'Donnell. ""Mainstream users now have multiple choices and folks who have had limited options (rural etc.) now can finally get something reasonable."""

Coleman: The most imminent and important upcoming trial result expected in my field in 2023 is mirvetuximab soravtansine from ImmunoGen. This received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 14 November based on results of a single-arm trial that enrolled 106 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose tumors had high expression of folate receptor-α and who had been treated with up to three prior regimens at least one of which included bevacizumab (Avastin).

Under accelerated approval the sponsor can market their drug under the indication agreed to by the FDA — in this case patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. For the drug to move from accelerated approval to regular approval a confirmatory trial needs to be conducted to confirm the overall safety and efficacy of the agent of interest. In this case initial results for the confirmatory phase 3 MIRASOL trial are expected in early 2023.

This drug is an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC); these agents are already being used for the treatment of several solid and liquid tumors but this is the first for ovarian cancer. It will be aligned with a companion diagnostic test that mirrors the expression in tumors needed for clinical trial eligibility. We expect about one-third of patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer to have high expression of folate receptor-α. The ADC field is expanding rapidly with trastuzumab deruxtecan approved in April 2022 for use against breast cancer but it has been a long time since a new cytotoxic agent has been approved for ovarian cancer. Among treatments for gynecological cancers this is only the second ADC approved so far after Tisotumab vedotin (in September 2021) for patients with recurrent previously treated cervical cancer. Now we have one in ovarian cancer. Several other ADCs are in development and successful approval will provide a solid framework for clinical trials evaluating novel combinations in several disease settings.

In a statement Fontainebleau Development and Koch Real Estate Investments said they secured the construction loan through J.P. Morgan SMBC Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies Goldman Sachs Guggenheim and real estate investment trust VICI Properties. J.P. Morgan acted as the administrative agent.

“Securing $2.2 billion in financing in today’s market speaks to the widespread confidence in this project and the team that’s come together to bring it to Las Vegas” Koch Real Estate President Jacob Francis said in a statement.

The long-stalled Fontainebleau project restarted in November 2021 when the original Florida-based developer reacquired the 25-acre site nine months earlier. Fontainebleau Development walked away from the planned $2 billion development in 2009 when the project was 75 percent complete and the company’s financing dried up.

During that time span the project went through a bankruptcy foreclosure sale and had two different owners before Fontainebleau Development Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Soffer reacquired the 67-story blue-tinted-glass hotel-casino.

Work has continued on the project during the past year.

In addition to 3700 hotel rooms Fontainebleau Las Vegas will have a casino 550000 square feet of convention and meeting space and a collection of dining retail and lifestyle attractions.

In a statement Fontainebleau Development said the financing keeps construction on schedule and the project would open in the fourth quarter of 2023.

“This is a milestone for Fontainebleau Las Vegas and stands as a testament to the tremendous dedication of our team and our partners at Koch Real Estate Investments” Fontainebleau Development President Brett Mufson said. “We are eager to bring our iconic Fontainebleau brand to the Las Vegas Strip.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhc3ZlZ2FzYWR2aXNvci5jb20vcXVlc3Rpb24vcnVmZmluLW1pcmFnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Didn't Phil Ruffin Purchase the Mirage instead of Hard Rock?,"After seeing renderings of what Hard Rock has in store for the Mirage it appears that the Hideous Guitar Hotel will completely block out any views the Treasure Island has of the Strip. I can't believe Phil Ruffin is pleased with this. And on another topic why didn't he purchase The Mirage? It would have seemed to be a good fit.

A:

There was only one way to answer this question and while we had our doubts we still gave it a shot. We called Treasure Island and asked to be connected with Mr. Ruffin.

Although he's a billionaire 87 years old owns a slew of businesses and has two young children (12 and 9) with 41-year-old Miss Ukraine 2004 Oleksandra Nikolayenko Ruffin has a reputation as a hard-working hands-on no-nonsense kind of executive who gets to his office at TI at 5 a.m.; he is after all the son of a grocer. So we weren't especially surprised though we were quite gratified that he was apparently sitting at his desk when our call was patched through and he picked up.

So we got to ask him your questions.

“I don’t think [the guitar hotel] will have any kind of impact on us” Mr. Ruffin told us. “It’s not a very high building and we’re well-known and have very big signs. That’s not going to be a problem for us.

“The reason we didn’t bid on the Mirage” he continued “is that you don’t get the ground and the building. All you get is the operational side. When we buy something we want the ground and building and that’s been sold to Vici [Properties]. What Hard Rock has is an operating agreement and we don’t like operating agreements. That’s why we didn’t bid. The [Seminoles] have a lot of money. They make a lot of money out of Florida so they can afford to do whatever the hell they want to do. They’ll be a good neighbor for us. It should be OK.”

We didn’t press Ruffin on why he didn’t buy The Mirage prior to the Vici purchase but we suspect it has to do with the asking price. Although he picked up Treasure Island in 2009 for $775 million and Circus Circus/Slots A Fun in 2019 for $825 million both from MGM Resorts he never took the Mirage bait. Always value conscious Ruffin acquired Treasure Island for a bargain seven times cash flow and Circus Circus for 10 times but MGM wanted 14 times for The Mirage pushing the asking price well past the billion-dollar mark. (Hard Rock paid $1.1 billion and as Ruffin said didn’t even obtain the real estate.)

Along with Circus Circus came a huge parcel of undeveloped land on the Strip 102 acres to be exact a serious coup. (Ruffin paid $662.5 million in cash; the other $162.5 million was a note due 2024.) He's still biding his time in terms of developing the empty acreage (a baseball stadium is still possible) and we’re sure we won’t know anything more about it until he’s good and ready to spill the beans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMTIyMzAwNTAyMi9lbi9Gb250YWluZWJsZWF1LUxhcy1WZWdhcy1TZWN1cmVzLTIuMi1CaWxsaW9uLWluLUZpbmFuY2luZy10by1Db21wbGV0ZS1Db25zdHJ1Y3Rpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fontainebleau Las Vegas Secures $2.2 Billion in Financing to Complete Construction,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMTIyMzAwNTAyMi9lbi9Gb250YWluZWJsZWF1LUxhcy1WZWdhcy1TZWN1cmVzLTIuMi1CaWxsaW9uLWluLUZpbmFuY2luZy10by1Db21wbGV0ZS1Db25zdHJ1Y3Rpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002122691C190>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

For more companies head on over to 5 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas.

The United States of America is the world's largest economy and among the most popular nations in the world. It is home to one of the best education systems in the world and also has pioneering companies that lead - and in some cases have created - their own industries. Consequently the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.

In order to work in the U.S. one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas as the H1-B workers often work in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population.

The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS) Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

A monopoly is defined as a market arrangement in which a single seller dominates the market and offers a unique product. In its purest form a monopoly has a 100% share of the market. Numerous industries are dominated by prominent players with significant market shares. These firms enjoy economies of scale and create barriers to entry for any new potential player to come up and break their domination. Companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have entered a sector and absorbed a sizeable amount of the market share are considered near-monopolies. These businesses frequently diversify their product lines in order to increase market share and revenue. Although the businesses allow some room for competition they yield significant market power over the industry.

Monopolies enjoy strong pricing power and famous investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett considers it a factor when he shortlists a stock for his portfolio that is followed and tracked by millions of investors globally. Back in 2011 when the Oracle of Omaha was asked to testify in front of the US Congress and provide the reason for investing in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) he highlighted that pricing power is one of the most integral criteria for evaluating a business. He added that if a business can increase prices without losing its market share to an industry peer it has a strong business model. Moody's along with two other credit rating agencies owns 95% of the credit rating market. The New York-based entity is still the eighth biggest investment in the portfolio of Omaha Nebraska-diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B) with a value of nearly $6 billion as of Q3 2022.

Interestingly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest holding in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway with a value of over $123.6 billion as of Q3 2022. The tech giant holds a monopoly or near monopoly position in numerous industries. Meanwhile American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is the fifth biggest investment in the portfolio of Warren Buffett. The New York-based company provides credit and debit cards along with Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Together these three entities hold a 99% share in the credit and debit card industry. All these monopolies or near-monopolies generate healthy profits and receive a positive response from experts. Another example is Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which occupies the fourth biggest position in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway. Together with PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) these three companies hold a market share of 57% in the soda industry.

After a slow start by both teams the Berkley bench led by junior Michael Onuoha sparked the Bears staking them to a 25-17 halftime lead. Onuoha came on late in the first period and got two quick rebounds and a put back to get things started for Berkley who led just 5-4 at the time.

By the time Onuoha left near the end of the second period Berkley was up by nine points and Onuoha was leading everyone in both points (eight) and rebounds (six).

Berkley’s bench posted 14 points in the first half compared to just 11 for the Bears’ starters. Seaholm’s starters were struggling even more with just eight first half points.

“Plug and play that’s kind of how we are” Bears head coach Joe Sermo said. “Michael (Onuoha) really got his first varsity minutes tonight and like we tell our guys once you get the opportunity don’t relinquish it. Don’t give it up and give us a reason not to take you out and he certainly did that. He impacted the game on both ends of the floor.”

But Berkley’s starters got the press going to full effect in the second half blowing the game open stretching the Bears’ lead to 16 points 41-25 midway through the third period.

“That was our game plan was to put pressure on them” Sermo said. “We’re quick. Our guards are really fast they’re aggressive. This was a perfect recipe playing against this team to put the pressure on them. And we did real well with making it uncomfortable for them even if we didn’t turn them over.”

The Maples made their open jumpers sinking eight three-pointers but the Berkley press made it hard for Seaholm to set up their offense and get those open looks. Still Seaholm kept fighting and every time it looked like Berkley had the game well in hand the Maples would get loose and sink a couple of shots to tighten things back up.

At one point Seaholm went on a 12-5 run late in the third quarter and into the early fourth quarter to cut Berkley’s lead to 46-37 with 7:05 still to play.

But they just couldn’t get over the hump and Berkley ran off seven of the next nine points mostly from the free throw line to put the game out of reach.

“I was happy with our fight overall. We’ve got a lot of fight on this team and if we cut down a lot of those turnovers and get shots it’s a different ball game” Maples assistant coach Shawn Smith said.

Jacob Sheriff (15 points) Tamir Runinkevich (14 points) and Henry Robertson (12 points) all reached double digits for Berkley. After scoring just seven points combined in the first half they combined for 34 of Berkley’s 43 second half points.

Seaholm was led by sharp shooters Ben Diskin (13 points) Corey Gray (11 points) and Ricky Sparby (10 points).

With the win Berkley improves to 3-2 overall and starts division play 1-0.

The Bears will face Dearborn next weekend at the Motor City Roundball Classic next weekend.

Seaholm slips to 1-4 overall and 0-1 in OAA Blue. The Maples are off until after the new year when they will resume play with a match up against crosstown rival Birmingham Groves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXVudG9uZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtcm91bmR1cC1pY2UtaG9ja2V5LXRhdW50b24taGlnaC1zd2ltbWluZy10YXVudG9uLzY5NzU0ODQyMDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scores: Taunton hockey suffers first loss to visiting Somerset Berkley,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.tauntongazette.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/sports/high-school/2022/12/24/high-school-roundup-ice-hockey-taunton-high-swimming-taunton/69754842007/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223AC0340>, 'Connection to www.tauntongazette.com timed out.

The canine is in line to get a bullet and stab protective vest to wear on the job.

Berkley police said the vest is a charitable donation from a nonprofit group Vested Interest in K9s Inc.

Officer Brian Anderson who lives and works with Bear put in the application to get his partner some added protection.

The vest is expected to be delivered within about two months. Vests from the charitable group are worth from $1774 to $2283 and weigh about 5 pounds.

Bear is almost two years old. Berkley Public Safety Lt. Jason Kobernick said Vested Interest waits until K-9 dogs are at least that age before donating a vest to them so they are full-size and don’t outgrow it.

Working K-9 dogs face dangers on the job just like officers Kobernick said.

“There are quite a few (incidents) where the dogs are injured” he said. “That’s because they are usually the first one’s to enter a building. Also (suspects) can be desperate to get away and the dogs often take the brunt of that.”

Bear is trained in tracking suspects sniffing out drugs and protecting his handler Officer Anderson.

“Bear has been an incredible addition to the department” Kobernick said “both for morale service” and community relations.

Matt Koehn Public Safety Director said in a statement that the department is grateful for the donation from Vested Interest.

“Anything we can do to help protect Bear while he is protecting Officer Anderson and the public is much appreciated” Koehn said. “We are very thankful to all who made donations.”

Vested Interest founded in 2009 to donate protective vests and other assistance to dogs in law enforcement nationwide.

The canine body armor is made in the U.S. custom fitted and certified by the National Institute of Justice.

Thus far the charitable organization has given out more than 4845 vests valued at $6.9 million to K-9 dogs in all 50 states.

Vested Interest’s program is open to active U.S. law enforcement dogs that are at least 20 months old. Funding comes from private and corporate donations.

Berkley Public Safety established its K-9 unit last year with community donations of more than $30000 from residents businesses and $25000 donation from the Mary P. Dolciani Foundation. A Berkley resident sits on the board of directors of the foundation."

Once enacted INFORM is slated to empower every state attorney general to enforce the law’s provisions.Walgreens is proud to work with states that have already established statewide Organized Retail Crime (ORC) task forces to coordinate efforts between attorneys general local law enforcement and retail asset protection professionals to build cases and prosecute criminals. Walgreens is encouraging every state to make tackling ORC a priority by funding dedicated task forces to prosecute criminal rings operating in their communities.Walgreens ( www.walgreens.com ) is included in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and U.S. Healthcare segments of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

AP

Walmart faced numerous challenges throughout the past year due to inflation and supply chain issues.

Analysts expect the retailer to work through excess inventory in 2023 but obstacles may arise.

Heading into the new year analysts are keeping a close eye on two of Walmart's ambitions: healthcare and banking.

Vast amounts of unwanted inventory choked store aisles. Ambitious e-commerce efforts came up short. A healthcare push faced a major hiccup.

Walmart certainly saw some tribulations in 2022 in the face of rampant inflation and supply chain issues. And in 2023 customers should brace themselves as the retailer tries to capitalize on e-commerce healthcare and banking plans among other things – all while facing another potentially unpredictable year analysts say.

""They're certainly not putting all of their eggs in one basket"" said Mari Shor a research analyst with Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Here are four major Walmart challenges to watch in 2023.

1. Trying to 'enter the new year clean' without much excess inventory

Walmart excess inventory blocking a private breastfeeding room at a store in Indiana. Anonymous

Excess inventory has been Walmart's boogie man in 2022.

Supply chain and inflation issues led the retailer to have way more supplies on hand than consumers were buying – leading to unwalkable backrooms packed with full pallets.

Walmart has said since May that it would make a concerted effort to get through excess inventory and to its credit it has kept its word. In its first-quarter earnings call in May the company reported a 32% year-over-year increase in inventory; in the latest earnings call in November that increase was only 13%.

""I feel good about their ability to enter the new year clean"" Shor said.

The caveat: On the other hand Walmart's worst-case scenario for 2023 is if any of the unpredictable problems from 2022 arise again such as supply chain disruptions or changes in consumer behavior caused by a potential recession according to Michael Rofman a partner with Mazars: ""They could be in a period where they have again too much inventory.""

2. Continuing e-commerce savings growth while mitigating costs

Walmart struck gold with its online sales at the start of the pandemic as it experienced as much as 97% year-over-year growth during the second quarter of 2020.

But despite major efforts – ranging from pushing membership platform Walmart+ to offering early online Black Friday sales – the retailer hasn't recaptured that same magic this year.

Walmart saw an 8% decline in average daily visits to its website this year through November compared to last year according to data from Similarweb a web analytics company.







The best-case scenario for Walmart with its e-commerce plans in 2023 is to have ""continued measured growth"" in home delivery and curbside pickup sales according to Zain Akbari an equity analyst for Morningstar.

The caveat: But according to Shor the worst case scenario for Walmart in 2023 would be if the retailer struggles to roll out cost-saving initiatives like its planned automated fulfillment centers and e-commerce growth continues to dip.

3. Expanding clinic presence is a 'must' to create major healthcare gains

Healthcare remains one of the most lucrative fields that Walmart has hardly touched to date. The retail giant currently only has 32 clinics across five states.

In 2022 Walmart saw competitors like Amazon make major healthcare splashes. 2023 is going to be an uphill battle for Walmart as Dr. Cheryl Pegus Walmart's executive vice president for health and wellness left the company in November for a health venture at JPMorgan.

Walmart ""must expand its clinic presence and solve the operational challenges many of its clinics have faced"" said Sari Kaganoff general manager of consulting at Rock Health Advisory.

Part of expansion has been announced for 2023 as Walmart plans to launch 16 more clinics in Florida by the end of the year.

The caveat: On the other hand Walmart healthcare's worst case for 2023 would be a scandal either coming from a data hack or through mistreating a patient according to Natalie Schibell a research director with Forrester: ""An egregious case of medical malpractice or a major data breach would paralyze"" Walmart's goals.

4. Rolling out new customer banking services

Of all Walmart's big initiatives for 2023 its foray into banking may just be the most secretive.

After the Walmart-backed fintech Hazel acquired neobank One and adopted its name at the start of this year the company has worked quietly to recruit top talent from Goldman Sachs and Apple to build out financial services.

Though current and former customers of One have experienced issues with the bank Walmart has pushed forward in trying to sign up employees for a bank account. And One's work is just beginning: the group reportedly plans to offer buy now pay later services for Walmart customers as soon as next year.

The caveat: According to Akbari One ""has a lot of upside"" in 2023 and Walmart should focus on helping build out the infrastructure for it: ""They tend to just focus on making sure that they have things as close to right as possible and then go forward rather than trying to be overly experimental with how they approach things.""

Carmen Kelly was approached by shopper Elizabeth Rizzo at the store in Arizona who noticed that she was using a cane and leaning against a shopping cart for support. Concerned for her well-being Rizzo discovered that Kelly was not allowed to sit down at work and was struggling to pay her medical bills.

Keen to help out Rizzo posted a video of her conversation with Kelly to TikTok and set up a Go Fund Me page in the hopes of raising up to $10000 so she could retire.

“I’m going to make sure this goes viral and get you some help Carmen. I’m going to try my best” Rizzo said. Little did she know at the time Kelly only had $50 left in her bank account.

The efforts of a kind stranger went further than either of them could have ever imagined. Not only did the TikTok video receive millions of views — 15.4 million at the time of writing — but the funds donated amounted to more than 10 times the original goal. So far over $131000 has been raised.

Life-changing kindness

Kelly’s story touched the hearts of people all over the world; “She’s an inspiration and a strong survivor. I’m glad I could help” wrote one donator. “She seems like such a sweet lady with a wonderful spirit!” another responded on TikTok.

In another video where Rizzo revealed the news Kelly was overjoyed: “I could never ever repay you and thank you” she said. “You’re changing my whole life and I just feel like God sent you to me.”

As for what the future looks like Kelly said she wants to continue her job at Walmart for the time being since she loves it so much although she might cut back on her hours and she would like to buy a house so she can live closer to her family."

The temperature in Central Florida today is dropping faster than a train cresting the lift hill on Iron Gwazi. Overnight lows might dip below freezing as the arctic storm that's been blasting America wraps its frosty trip across the country with a visit to Walt Disney World.

There's no precipitation in the forecast however so it looks like ""snoap"" will be the only thing falling from the sky this chilly Christmas in the Orlando area. But those of us with long memories might recall that it has snowed (okay flurried) at Disney World before.

And I was there.

So in solidarity with those guests and cast members bracing themselves for the cold this weekend I offer this chapter from my Stories From a Theme Park Insider book - The Day That It Snowed at Walt Disney World.

* * *

Even in December the weather in Central Florida remains pleasant on most days. But once a decade or so a nasty cold front penetrates the state freezing orange trees tourists and even residents.

The morning of December 23 1989 brought one of those fronts. With the forecast calling for temperatures to fall into the 30s I hauled my Chicago winter coat from the back of the hall closet. Good that I did too. Watching other opening-shift cast members shiver in their jean jackets and sweatshirts while I stayed toasty warm I was glad that I had dressed as someone should for near-freezing temperatures – despite the fact that I now lived in Florida where the weather wasn't supposed to do this.

That day I was opening at Tom Sawyer Island driving rafts across the river. We didn't expect much of a crowd. It was Saturday two days before Christmas. Most people coming down for the holidays would be traveling that day making it a busy day at the airport but not at Walt Disney World. (Certainly no local would be fool enough to come out in this weather either.)

A freeze doesn't come to Central Florida the way it arrives up north with weeks-long gradual cooling into the 30s and 20s leaves turning and warmth slowly escaping the ground. Instead Arctic air blows sharply into Florida shrouding the still-warm waters and soil.

What happens when you drop a blanket of Yankee winter air on top of warm Florida water?

You get fog. Lots and lots of dense fog.

Actually the morning's fog wasn't too bad when I arrived. I drove over the crew who worked the snack stand on the island without hassle. No I couldn't see all the way across Frontierland to the Country Bear Jamboree from the middle of the river like I could on a clear day but I could see from the dock on one bank to the other which was all I really needed.

So we opened the island to a small cluster of shivering guests stuffed into the winter coats they hadn't expected to be wearing in Florida. Everyone wore their shoulders around their ears that morning.

Then the temperature kept dropping down through the 30s on its way to what would be the day's low: in the mid-20s. The fog thickened. As I docked the raft on the mainland side after my second or third crossing I heard the riverboat's whistle. I turned to signal the riverboat clear... and couldn't see it. Nor could I see across the river to the island dock.

Lake Buena Vista we've got a problem.

My lead called a supervisor to let him know we were going down and we learned that we weren't the only ones making the same call. Big Thunder Mountain couldn't open at all since the ride's trains kept speeding over the frozen track. The fog enveloping Tom Sawyer Island had also covered the Seven Seas Lagoon taking down the ferryboats and forcing all guests to access the Magic Kingdom via monorail. The Jungle Cruise was down too. As was People Mover Dumbo and just about every other outdoor ride in the park.

But we still had about a dozen guests on the island. The riverboat would have to dock while I ferried over a security guard to help the rest of the Tom Sawyer Island crew clear the island. Frankly the guests seemed happy to go. Half of them already had gathered on the dock for the return trip. The rest we found huddled in one of the caves trying to stay warm.

No one stepped up to relieve me of raft-driving duties. (Gee I wonder why?) So I sailed blind through the muck on that final trip back to the mainland. Cocky raft drivers say that they can make the trip blind. I got to prove it.

When we arrived two of my friends from other attractions were waiting for me. With half the rides in the park closed leads were releasing any cast members who wanted to leave early. Rather than spend the day shivering at the entrance to the Tom Sawyer Island queue just to let people know that they couldn't visit an island they could no longer see I took an early release too.

We decided we'd go play in the park – but somewhere indoors. We chose The Land pavilion at Epcot which we would later discover had become the most popular destination in all of Walt Disney World that day with crowds thicker than the fog.

On my way over to the tunnels to change clothes and clock out I felt something fly into my eye. A bug? I blinked instinctually and my brought my hand to my eye to wipe away whatever it was. Then I felt the offending speck melt to water instead. No way! Standing in the middle of Frontierland I looked to the sky and saw... snowflakes.

It was snowing... at Walt Disney World.

Both his grandfather and great-grandfather were engineers on the steam trains at the Pittsburgh steel mills. John never imagined he would carry on their and Walt’s legacy at the Magic Kingdom Park overseeing the Walt Disney World Railroad’s historic return today.

Starting at Magic Kingdom in 1995 John’s first role was as a Conductor on the Walt Disney World Railroad. “It was this moment of serendipity” John explains. “My grandma was so tickled that I was working on the railroad just like my grandfathers. They love to tell the story that when I was born my grandfather was on the train and blew his whistle nonstop when he found out he was having a grandson.”

A young 17-year-old at the time John was incredulous that he was being trusted with such an iconic piece of the park. “You can’t get more Disney than the steam train” he says. He felt a deep connection with Walt but also his grandfathers who had both since passed away.

Now 28 years later John has spent almost the entirety of his Disney career on Main Street U.S.A. His full-circle journey has brought him to this very moment where he now oversees the operation of the Walt Disney World Railroad! The enormity of bringing these historical 100-year-old trains back to the Magic Kingdom isn’t lost on him. It’s an opportunity to introduce guests to the same feelings of whimsy and childlike wonder that made him fall in love with the park all those years ago.

“The first time cast members brought the Walter Elias train into Main Street Station guests and cast gathered below to cheer and welcome the trains home” John muses. “You can see the excitement on kid’s faces as they see the train coming around the corner for the first time and hear its whistle. It’s magical and an honor to introduce the next generation to the beauty of steam trains carrying on my family and Walt’s legacy.”

Just in time to join the Walt Disney World 50th Anniversary Celebration we invite you all aboard this historical opening day attraction to escape into the fantastical nostalgia of yesteryear.

It’s been four long years since the Walt Disney World Railroad rolled through the Magic Kingdom. But now just in time for the new year the trains are hitting the track once again.

On December 22 Disney announced that the railroad would be reopening “soon” – and less than 24 hours later it turns out “soon” is today! You can now hop on a train and take a Grand Circle Tour around the Magic Kingdom the next time you’re at the park (including over the holidays this weekend).

The Walt Disney World Railroad closed back in December 2018 due to the construction of TRON Lightcycle / Run. With plans for the new Tomorrowland addition to impact the railroad’s original tracks the attraction closed. And during its downtime two of the Walt Disney World Railroad train stations were given fresh paint the Walter E. Disney train engine saw refurbishment and new tracks were installed to make way for TRON Lightcycle / Run.

What’s New for the Walt Disney World Railroad

Now when you climb aboard one of the train cars to ride the refreshed railroad you’ll get to experience some new additions. While closed the railroad’s tracks and soundtrack were given some updates.

This classic attraction which has been part of the Magic Kingdom’s history since opening day on October 1 1971 now has a “completely refreshed track looping the park and an all-new voiceover guiding guests as they travel from one magical land to the next” Disney states.

One of the most notable changes is a new tunnel constructed near TRON Lightcycle / Run which takes Guests under the canopy of the coaster.

Additionally Guests will get the chance to “meet” a new conductor character who narrates the updated audio track and acts as a sort of unofficial mayor of the railroad.

Catch a Ride on the Railroad Today

If you’re headed to the Magic Kingdom you can hop on the Walt Disney World Railroad during your visit. It’s open as of Friday December 23 2022. The attraction hours are currently 10 AM to 6 PM daily.

Warner Bros Discovery doubles down after signing multi-year PTO broadcast deal

The Professional Triathletes Organisation (PTO) has completed a Series B financing round led by Divergent Investments with other backers including majority investor Sir Michael Moritz and Warner Bros Discovery.

The financing round is believed to have raised US$30 million. PTO chief executive Sam Renouf said that the tour which gained a global TV and streaming audience of 23.1 million would be able to expand further thanks to the funding. Next year will see the addition of two new PTO races with the European and Asian Opens set to debut.

“We feel we’ve proven that we can turn triathlon into a televised sport” Renouf told SportsPro. “The fact that a broadcaster wanted to join the investment round themselves is a really nice validation that this has great potential as a broadcast sport as well as a mass participation sport which is what triathlon is more commonly known for.”

The investment from Warner Bros Discovery is significant as the media giant recently agreed a multi-year broadcast rights deal for expansive coverage of the PTO Tour in Europe and the Indian subcontinent. Renouf explained that also adding Warner Bros Discovery as an investor shows faith in the PTO to continue its growth path.

“Now that [Warner Bros Discovery] become co-owners in the business they go on that journey with us as we commercialise” he added. “If you look at the most successful and best known rights holders out there they’re not two or three years old they’re ten 20 30 40 years old. That’s the same kind of journey that we intend to go on with the PTO.”

Andrew Georgiou president and managing director of Warner Bros Discovery Sports Europe said: “Working closely with rights holders is a fundamental part of Warner Bros Discovery’s strength in sport and the foundation of how we use our scale expertise and platforms to help grow sports and their events.

“This is the heart of why we are investing in the PTO and deepening our relationship providing the opportunity to sit alongside them and have a real impact in driving and developing its properties and the sport of triathlon more widely.”

Renouf noted that the organisation’s focus on scaling up and commercialising further would help pay its athletes fairly with US$2 million set to go towards those on the PTO’s world rankings.

“With our model we’re creating a season long narrative of professional events where the athletes are both compensated accordingly for their talents and showcased and promoted” said Renouf.

“Taking the stories that we knew already exists in triathlon and being able to showcase them to a global audience is really the essence of what we’re doing.”

The PTO is an athlete-founded organisation launched in 2014 which runs the PTO Tour alongside majority owner Moritz. The competition sees men and women compete for equal prize money with its flagship event in The Collins Cup offering a prize of US$1.5 million.

PTO chairman Chris Kermode noted that there was potential for the PTO Tour to expand on its promotion of health and wellness which has been supported by Eckuity’s recent investment.

He said to SportsPro: “It’s about all live events to inspire people to be either become participants or viewers or fans and you need to put these events on in global cities in great locations.

“That’s our intention for the next few years to really create this season-long narrative storytelling throughout the year putting the best athletes in the world on a stage that can be seen by as many people as possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL25ld3MvcHRvLXJhaXNlcy0zMG0taW4tc2VyaWVzLWItZnVuZGluZy13aXRoLXdhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1hbW9uZy1pbnZlc3RvcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PTO raises $30m in Series B funding with Warner Bros.

WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9ndWF0ZW1hbGEtbGFuZGZpbGwtZmVlZHMtdHJhc2gtaXNsYW5kcy1odW5kcmVkcy1vZi1taWxlcy1hd2F5LWluLWhvbmR1cmFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guatemala landfill feeds 'trash islands' hundreds of miles away in Honduras,"An estimated 20000 metric tons of trash from the Guatemala City landfill flows down the Motagua River into the Caribbean each year where it washes ashore on Honduran beaches and forces residents to form cleanup efforts.

While cleanup efforts are a good temporary solution the root cause of the problem is poor waste management infrastructure at the landfill something that has proven extremely difficult to address due to complex social issues and the cost of relocating waste disposal sites to other parts of the country.

The trash also comes from illegal dumping along the river.

As a stopgap some stakeholders are focused on catching the trash in the rivers before it can reach the ocean.

GUATEMALA CITY — After heavy rains hotel workers and other residents in Honduras walk up and down beaches picking up everything from plastic bottles to toys to medical waste. They’ve become experts at garbage cleanup. It piles up in the sand if they don’t move quickly and then tourists might complain or even stop coming which could be disastrous for the many residents who rely on work in local hotels and shops.

Some towns on Honduras’s Caribbean coast have banned single-use plastics and implemented more rigorous recycling plans. But the trash keeps coming. A lot of it it turns out doesn’t come from the locals but rather from landfills and illegal dumping sites hundreds of miles away in inland Honduras and neighboring Guatemala.

“It goes into the food chain and even disrupts coral” says Jenny Myton the conservation program director at the Coral Reef Alliance. “This affects everything — animal life and health but also the economy and tourism.”

Guatemala’s 485-kilometrer (300-mile) Motagua River is one of the biggest conduits of this torrent of waste. An estimated 20000 metric tons of trash from the Guatemala City landfill and illegal dumping sites flows into the river on its way to the Caribbean each year. Ocean currents push it northeast where it washes up on the beaches of Tela and other Honduran towns. The rest of it can stay floating out at sea for as long as six months before sinking to the bottom.

The problem has elicited cleanup efforts recycling programs and garbage divergence plans by everyone from local communities to international NGOs. But many of them also admit that these are only temporary solutions. The root cause of the problem — garbage collection and storage at landfills across the region — will be much harder to make right.

“A new waste management plan must be set up for Guatemala and Honduras including both citizens and industries” a 2020 study on waste management in the region said. “Recycling and integrated waste management systems should be implemented everywhere within a country (including smaller towns and villages in the mainland).”

Fixing the landfill

The Guatemala City landfill is located in the Zone 3 neighborhood in the city’s north and takes in everything from food waste to plastic to medical equipment — and not just from the city proper. Thirteen surrounding municipalities also rely on the landfill as their principal disposal site which then feeds into the local watershed and ultimately pollutes the Caribbean hundreds of miles away.

Landfills may just look like simple holes in the ground where waste piles up. But they’re actually complex operations with sophisticated technology intended to prevent waste from creating public health issues and environmental harm. Modern landfills usually include multiple “cells” for controlled dumping a drainage and rainwater collection system and a network of pipes and vents to prevent the buildup of methane gas which is emitted as organic waste breaks down over time.

But the landfill in Guatemala City is decades behind technologically. Garbage piles up dozens of meters high so unstable that it can shift like an ocean current swallowing up garbage pickers unexpectedly. The lack of methane vents can lead to gas buildup fires and toxic smoke.

And the lack of a formal water drainage system has led to a naturally flowing river of contaminated liquids moving out of the dump.

“I’ve rarely seen such a blatant and concrete example of unintended consequences” said Trae Holland executive director of Safe Passage an NGO working in the area. “From a sanitation and waste management standpoint the medieval approach in Guatemala City is transcending its physical location to become an international problem.”

Guatemala City municipal authorities didn’t respond to Mongabay’s request for comment about what it’s doing to actively address waste management at the landfill. Some organizations tell Mongabay they’ve worked closely with officials to improve the situation saying they want this problem gone as much as anyone else does. Others say there’s little evidence that the government is taking any environmental action whatsoever.

In recent years the government pushed back the landfill so it wasn’t encroaching on residential buildings. It decorated the entrance gate with flowers. But the prevailing waste management strategies appear to have gone unchanged.

“It’s this Arcadian paradise” Holland says. “The front looks like the entrance to a university now that the garbage has been pushed away from the front. This is obviously not solving any problems right? It’s just a PR move.”

But problems at the dump aren’t just technological. They’re also wrapped up in the political and social struggles of the country. It’s expensive and controversial for example to create a new landfill somewhere else. Zoning can be complicated not only because the area must be strategically located to mitigate environmental hazards but also because nearby residents and businesses would fight back against the plans.

Unregulated dumping has given rise to an entire informal economy for the impoverished residents of Zone 3 with families entering the landfill each day to pick out plastics and other items that can be sold to middlemen recyclers. Children used to pick trash out of the river a practice that’s now banned. Gangs oversee a lot of what’s bought and sold there complicating efforts by groups looking to help struggling families.

During the pandemic the landfill shut down several times putting so much stress on trash pickers that several households reported suicides by family members Holland says. Gangs couldn’t collect extortion fees which led to kidnappings of children and retaliatory violence.

As difficult as the last several years have been Holland says the pandemic may have gotten city officials’ attention for the better and may in the long run lead to improved waste management.

“The municipality I can tell you right now woke up to some of the issues in that community and in that zone that they were ignoring before” he says. “And I feel very strongly in fact that that’s going to be a net positive.”

Temporary solutions

With systematic changes to the Guatemala City landfill slow to come some stakeholders have shifted their focus downriver where the trash is freer from the same complex social and political issues.

The Ocean Cleanup an international organization engineering creative ways to remove plastic from the oceans came to Guatemala in 2018 in hopes of developing a method for intercepting the trash on the Motagua River.

“If something is done about the source that would be ideal but I think we have to recognize that the brunt of this is more complicated than that” CEO Boyan Slat tells Mongabay. He adds “We asked ourselves what is the fastest most cost-effective way to stop this plastic from going into the ocean?”

Slat a Dutch entrepreneur founded The Ocean Cleanup when he was just 18 after having gone viral for a TEDx talk about what innovative technologies can bring to conservation efforts. His organization has raised millions of dollars since then but has also been criticized for its flawed technology and lack of results.

In Guatemala its pilot project involved installing “Interceptor 006” a fence 50 meters (164 feet) wide and 8 m (26 ft) high that’s designed to catch plastic in its mesh while letting the water through.

In a video released by The Ocean Cleanup the trash fence starts out looking like it’s going to succeed. The trash stops at the fence and starts to build up with the water passing through free of plastic. But after a while the sheer magnitude of trash gets to be too much and the infrastructure starts to bend. Then holes form and the plastic pushes through.

“We thought we truly cracked the nut” Slat says “that we collected what’s roughly a million kilos [2.2 million pounds] of plastic … and then seeing a big chunk of that disappear again almost literally slipping through our fingers. In the matter of two hours we went from the highest high to a substantial low.”

The Ocean Cleanup is working on a new type of interceptor that hasn’t operated anywhere else and which will look “evolutionary rather than revolutionary” when compared to the previous one Slat says. However he doesn’t divulge any details about its design.

He also says the organization is working with local partners to develop recycling and incineration programs as well as methods of waste fraction (the sorting of waste into biodegradables glass batteries and other categories).

The Guatemala 2.0 solution as Slat calls it should be ready by the end of the first quarter of 2023. And while it won’t solve the waste management issues at the landfill or stop illegal dumping at different points along the Motagua River it should help slow the amount of trash entering the Caribbean.

However disposal is not an easy task because selecting the type of disposal facility depends on multiple factors such as the type and quantity of radioactive waste; the existing and future environmental geological seismic and climate conditions; and available funds. For countries with limited amounts of radioactive waste disposal could theoretically involve safe secure and permanent placement inside boreholes deep underground.

The IAEA is providing technological and engineering support for the first of a kind construction and implementation of borehole disposal facilities for radioactive waste as part of a pilot project underway in Malaysia and Ghana funded by Canada.

“The borehole system allows for a permanent disposition rather than storage solution” said Heather Looney Head of the Nuclear Security of Materials and Facilities Section at the IAEA’s Division of Nuclear Security. “One of the most important benefits expected from this project is the overall enhancement of nuclear security and radiation safety at the national and regional level as well as globally. The IAEA systematically assists countries to identify and implement optimal solutions for the safe and secure use storage and now permanent disposal of their radioactive sources.”

Sealed radioactive sources are important for many nuclear applications in industry medicine agriculture and research. Their uses include treating cancer extending food shelf life sterilizing medical supplies irradiating seeds to enhance food production supporting oil and gas prospecting measuring soil density for construction and in common smoke detectors. A cradle-to-grave management approach to radioactive sources recognizes that a radioactive source continues to require safety and security arrangements after the end of its use and ensures such continuous safety and security.

“The borehole disposal is a fit-for-purpose and cost-effective solution in general because it is specifically designed for disposal of disused sealed radioactive sources (DSRSs) and is economically affordable in comparison with the other disposal pathways such as geological disposal” said Nora Zakaria Head of the IAEA Waste Technology Section.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjMxMjIwMjIvY2hlbWljYWwtcmVjeWNsaW5nLXBsYXN0aWMtc29sdXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is ‘Chemical Recycling’ a Solution to the Global Scourge of Plastic Waste or an Environmentally Dirty Ruse to Keep ...,"Diplomats negotiating guidelines for an international convention on hazardous wastes this month in Switzerland debated a new section on the “chemical recycling” of plastic debris fouling the global environment.

The 1989 Basel Convention which seeks to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes was updated in 2019 when 187 ratifying nations agreed to place new restrictions on the management and international movement of plastic wastes—and to update the treaty’s technical guidelines.

Since then the plastics industry has tried to quell mounting anger over vast mountains of plastics filling landfills and polluting the oceans by advancing chemical recycling as a means of turning discarded plastic products into new plastic feedstocks and fossil fuels like diesel.

Scientists and environmentalists who have studied the largely unproven technology say it is essentially another form of incineration that requires vast stores of energy has questionable climate benefits and puts communities and the environment at risk from toxic pollution. Some of them even view the inclusion of the chemical recycling language in the implementing guidelines as a threat although it remains to be seen what that language will ultimately say.

“The text is nowhere near settled” said Sirine Rached the global plastics policy coordinator for the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA) which with the Basel Action Network has called chemical recycling of plastics “a fantasy beast that has yet to establish its efficacy and economic viability while already exhibiting serious environmental threats.”

We’re hiring! Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobs

Rached said the group’s “priority is for the guidance to focus on environmentally-sound management and to refer to technologies only on the basis of sound peer-reviewed references and not on industry marketing claims and this involves not speculating on how technologies may or may not evolve in future.”

“The solution is making less plastic” Judith Enck founder and president of the environmental group Beyond Plastics and a former EPA regional administrator told a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works at a hearing on Dec. 15.

U.S. lawmakers are weighing their own ideas for addressing the plastics crisis. “We need to cut plastic production by 50 percent in the next 10 years and we can do it” she told them adding that chemical recycling produces “more fossil fuel and the last thing we need is more fossil fuel.”

Such a dramatic cut in plastic would devastate the economy said Matt Seaholm chief executive officer of the Plastics Industry Association which represents companies that produce use and recycle plastic. “Our industry wants to recycle more” and deploying more mechanical recycling and chemical recycling will help he told lawmakers. “We love plastic” he said. “We hate the waste. We need to collect sort and ultimately reprocess more material.”

Wide agreement exists that the 11 million metric tons of plastic pollution that enters the oceans every year “is devastating” Erin Simon head of plastic waste and business for the World Wildlife Fund a conservation group that operates in 100 countries said in an interview. “It’s wreaking havoc on our species our ecosystems and in the communities that depend on them.

“You really do need this coordinated global structure” that treaties can provide she added. “Because it’s clear that it’s not going to happen just with voluntary initiatives alone.”

Writing Guidelines for Chemical Recycling

The world is making twice as much plastic waste as it did two decades ago with most of the discarded materials buried in landfills burned by incinerators or dumped into the environment according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development a group that represents developed nations. Production is expected to triple by 2060. Globally only 9 percent of plastic waste is successfully recycled according to OECD.

Nearly all of the plastic that gets recycled goes through a mechanical process involving sorting grinding cleaning melting and remolding often into other products. But mechanical recycling has its limits; it does not work for most kinds of plastic and what gets recycled such as certain kinds of bottles and jugs can only be recycled a few times.

Chemical recycling consists of new and old technologies hailed by the industry but seen as an unproven marketing ruse by environmentalists that governments must now study and regulate if they are to successfully confront a menacing problem that spans the Earth and has even invaded our bodies with microplastic particles.

A Basel Convention committee met in the second week of December in Switzerland to debate whether the Basel treaty’s technical guidelines should be updated to include chemical recycling which is also sometimes referred to as “advanced recycling” and if so under what terms.

The debate occurred within the framework of the Basel Convention and any language on chemical recycling that makes it into its technical guidelines will be seen as acceptable tools for managing plastic waste. The guidelines are likely to carry over into the negotiations over the next two years on an international treaty governing plastic pollution and ongoing plastics manufacturing.

Those treaty talks have barely begun with a first negotiation session among delegates a few weeks ago in Uruguay.

The technical guidelines for the Basel Convention are supposed to represent the best available technology for protecting humans from various hazardous wastes said Lee Bell an Australia-based policy advisor for the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN). He is also the co-author of a 2021 IPEN study that detailed how chemical recycling generates dangerous dioxin emissions produces contaminated fuels and consumes large amounts of energy.

“Many parties and observers are of the view that there is no proof that chemical recycling is what you would call best available technology … or best environmental practice” he said.

The concern he said is that chemical recycling’s inclusion in the technical guidance “becomes a sort of formal endorsement by the (Basel) convention and therefore by the U.N.” It then would be possible for advocates of chemical recycling to point to the Basel technical guidance and say “‘let’s just adopt those wholesale as part of the new plastics treaty’” Bell said. “And I think this is exactly what’s going on.” Stewart Harris senior director of global plastics policy for the American Chemistry Council said it’s too soon to say what role chemical recycling might play in a global plastics agreement. But he said the Basel Convention technical guidance is important. “The Basel Convention guidance on the environmentally sound management of plastic waste is a key resource for all countries looking to support the transition to a more circular economy for plastics” Harris said. “Properly classifying chemical recycling will help governments assess how these technologies fit into national waste management plans.” In a joint release with the International Council of Chemical Associations following the first round of plastics treaty talks held Nov. 28 to Dec. 2 in Uruguay the two industry groups favored an agreement that “moves nations closer to a future where plastics remain in the economy and not in the environment.” Industry opposes caps on soaring plastic production which Enck and other environmentalists say is the only way to ultimately solve the environmental crisis that is plastic waste and pollution.

In the United States the fight over chemical recycling has occurred in statehouses local communities in Congress and inside the Environmental Protection Agency. The American Chemistry Council a leading industry advocate for chemical recycling this year celebrated adoption of legislation by 20 states over the past five years aimed at easing regulatory pathways for chemical recycling.

“The appropriate regulation of this is really critical if you want to scale advanced recycling and you want to use more recycled material in your products” Joshua Baca vice president of plastics for the chemistry council told Inside Climate News.

But plastics were never designed to be recycled and environmental advocates have been fighting back trying to block new chemical recycling facilities that have been proposed in various states across the country.

In Pennsylvania a Houston start-up called Encina has proposed a $1.1 billion chemical recycling plant for plastic waste in Point Township that has left local officials and professors at Pittsburgh universities perplexed about whether the company’s plans were at all feasible. Nearby residents meanwhile worried about impacts to air water and quality of life.

In northeast Indiana Inside Climate News found Brightmark Energy struggling to get its chemical recycling facility using a technology called pyrolysis up and running. The company could not precisely say what percentage of plastic waste it would actually turn into fuel or plastic feedstocks.

And while Fulcrum BioEnergy does not market its waste-to-jet fuel plant proposed for Gary Indiana as chemical recycling it would employ a similar technical process gasification. Inside Climate News found that the company’s plans to use municipal solid waste are complicated by an anticipated 30 percent plastic in its feedstock which reduces carbon benefits and can gum up the production process. In Gary an environmental justice community residents have filed a Civil Rights Act complaint with the EPA against the state regulators who approved the Fulcrum air permit.

“Technologies that worsen the climate crisis perpetuate a reliance on single-use plastics and adversely impact vulnerable communities cannot be viewed as viable solutions moving forward” a group of 35 members of Congress wrote in July urging the EPA to fully regulate chemical recycling emissions and to stop working to promote the technology as a solution to the plastics crisis.

A Global Solution

Plastic waste is a global problem and the countries of the world are working on a global solution.

In March against the backdrop of what U.N. officials described as a “triple planetary crisis of climate change nature loss and pollution” the United Nations Environmental Assembly voted to start two years of negotiations for a treaty to end global plastic waste.

At the Uruguay meeting the discussion focused on a process for the negotiations and other preliminary matters. Early fault lines emerged. Some countries favored more of a bottom-up approach in which each of them would set their own goals while others suggested a harder-line approach with global mandates.

The United States a major plastics producer and consumer is advocating for a treaty that features national action plans much like the 2015 Paris climate agreement. (The U.S. did not ratify the Basel Convention on hazardous wastes).

“Plastic pollution does not have a one-size-fits-all solution” a State Department official said in a written statement. “Many participants emphasized the importance of national action plans under a future agreement and the importance of allowing for country-driven approaches that reflect different national contexts.”

The U.S. approach amounts to “low ambition” said Neil Tangri also from the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. “Every country is already doing what they want to do. The whole point of an international treaty is to get countries to go beyond what they want to do.”

Scientists have also been weighing in on the proposed plastic waste treaty and chemical recycling.

“We know that we’re using more than 10000 chemicals in everyday plastic products” said Martin Wagner a Norwegian University of Science and Technology associate professor of biology who was among 13 scientists to jointly publish a letter in the journal Science in November urging plastics treaty negotiators to recognize the myriad of toxic chemicals that comprise plastic materials. “We know that 2400 of those chemicals are actually classified as toxic and hazardous.

“Still they’re allowed to be used in everyday plastic products” said Wagner who studies what plastics and endocrine-disrupting chemicals do to human and ecosystem health. “So we have clearly a shortcoming there with regards to regulating hazardous chemicals and plastics.”

Wagner was also among nine scientists to write another letter in Science in April advocating for a global cap on plastic production.

Capping plastic production will increase the price of making new plastics and would then make recycling more economical while helping to end plastic pollution he said.

Chemical recycling likely needs to be in the mix of potential solutions but it raises a lot of questions Wagner said.

“It’s unclear how (chemical recycling) would scale to deal with the mega- and gigatons of plastic waste that we are producing” he said. “And then there is the problem of chemical safety. And technically I really don’t understand how they would get rid of all those chemicals.

“That’s why I’m cautious about promoting this chemical recycling as a silver bullet solution. It has a role to play but I am not sure how big of one.”

Continuing the Negotiations But with Skepticism

At the Basel Convention meeting in mid-December in Switzerland environmental groups watched closely as a committee worked on language for the proposed new section on chemical recycling. Those conversations were kept confidential.

Environmental groups such as the International Pollutants Elimination Network the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives and the Basel Action Network have tried without success to keep the committee from including chemical recycling in the technical guidelines.

Another Basel working group will pick up the talks in February before delegates from countries that are parties to the Basel treaty meet in May where the technical guidelines could be resolved.

For now however records from the technical committee meeting show language inserted to interject a measure of skepticism about solutions from chemical recycling. For example one change notes that “further scientific evidence for the ecological and economic benefits is still necessary for final evaluation.”

Even the United States which is not a party to the Basel Convention but participates in an advisory role urged cautionary language around chemical recycling in the Basel technical guidelines.

“Given the uncertainty about the environmental impacts of chemical recycling and the role the technology can play in addressing plastic waste we support the guidelines highlighting that further evidence is needed to assess the life cycle impacts of chemical recycling processes and demonstrate commercial viability” a U.S. official suggested.

Plastic recyclers in Europe offer a mixed assessment of chemical recycling.

“Chemical recycling could have the potential to build upon mechanical recycling processes if it can treat the waste which currently cannot be mechanically recycled into high-quality plastics” said Emilia Tarlowska a spokeswoman for Plastics Recyclers Europe a group representing European recyclers that closely follows the U.N. deliberations.

But she also said that “chemical recycling is in its infancy” and barely out of the “laboratory.”

“It is perhaps too early to tell if these technologies have the potential to significantly contribute to the challenges presented by plastics waste” she said.

For its part the U.N. Environment Program in a document prepared in advance of the plastics treaty talks in Uruguay identified chemical and mechanical recycling as two main ways for “closing the loop of plastics in the economy” or getting away from a linear “take-make-waste” model.

“Chemical recycling includes a wide array of technologies that for the most part are not yet proven at scale” the text said. “Chemical recycling tends to be energy intensive and should only be used when the overall environmental profile is comparable to or better than other proven management options.”

The Linn County landfill in Marion will close in 2044 although it's projected to reach its capacity sooner.

A new landfill in Linn County is not an option because of zoning restrictions.

The solid waste agency has narrowed down its remaining options which include anaerobic digestion and a process that turns waste into energy.

The new technologies are expensive so the agency may partner with other municipalities like Des Monies to make waste management more cost-saving efficient.

MARION — Most of the materials that pile up in Linn County garbage cans end up in a landfill in Marion where trash has accumulated since the 1970s. However that site will close by June 30 2044 — or earlier thanks to debris from natural disasters.

Negotiations with Marion to extend the landfill’s capacity through 2074 fell short. The Cedar Rapids Linn County Solid Waste Agency is now charged with finding new options after the site closes.

“We're going to close on June 30 2044” said agency communications director Joe Horaney. “On July 1 2044 there's still going to be 700 tons of garbage generated (daily) in Linn County that needs to go somewhere.”

With the help of consultant HDR the Solid Waste Agency catalyzed its search in 2020 by evaluating eight waste management scenarios in its Forward 2044 study. Since siting a new landfill in Linn County is no longer an option four scenarios remain.

The ideal solution would be a combination of technologies that target different types of waste divert them from landfills and re-purpose them. In interviews with The Gazette representatives delved into the tech and explained how robotics bacteria heat and more could be used to reduce waste in Linn County.

That innovation will come at a cost: The agency’s board members this week approved a higher fee for bringing garbage to the landfill which will likely continue to rise to account for future expenses.

That’s why representatives said the agency is leaning toward regional collaborations that take advantage of existing infrastructure to make waste reduction cheaper. Several potential partnerships already are in the works.

“We're looking to bring Iowa to a regional level where we would have enough ways to make it economically viable” said agency Executive Director Karmin McShane.

“The lowest common denominator would be taking material to a facility and considering it waste” she said. “We would like to take that material to a facility and consider it a resource.”

Using mechanics to sort waste

When you look at your garbage you may see rotting useless or tattered materials. In the eyes of the Solid Waste Agency however that garbage equals potential. Different types of waste if handled correctly are desirable for certain markets and can be reused. It’s just a matter of separating those items from the rest of the rubbish.

Many curbside pickup services already collect trash recyclables and yard waste separately. In its Forward 2044 plans the Solid Waste Agency is evaluating mechanical technologies to further separate waste streams and divert more trash from landfills.

Mechanical sorting or mixed waste processing separates desirable materials like metals plastic and cardboard from trash.

Optical sorters for instance use light absorbance and reflection to identify materials as they pass by on a conveyor belt. Once identified a small blast of air underneath desirable items ejects them from the rest of the waste stream and they can be properly sorted. Robotics and artificial intelligence can also play roles in mechanically separating waste.

Some recycling facilities in Iowa already take advantage of mechanical technologies. Forward 2044 wants to take sorting a step further by applying them to more waste streams.

“There is not currently a facility that is bringing in trash and separating it” said Kate Bartlet an HDR solid waste planner and policy director for Forward 2044. “It's the same technologies that are used in recycling facilities now. It's just (changing) what that input stream is.”

Targeting organic waste

Food waste has been the most prevalent component in Iowa’s landfills since at least 1998 Iowa Department of Natural Resources analyses show. Rotting organic waste releases methane — a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.

“The biggest thing that we're seeing statewide is the push and the desire to get organics out of the waste stream” communications director Horaney said.

To do so the Solid Waste Agency is exploring biological treatments that use natural processes to break down organic waste — like food waste and yard waste — and reduce its volume.

One way to do that is through composting which the Solid Waste Authority already conducts at a site in Cedar Rapids by Mount Trashmore. There materials are placed in long rows outside where they naturally break down within eight to 12 weeks. Less methane is released because of the oxygen-rich conditions as opposed to compacted materials in a landfill.

The location currently produces 11000 tons of finished compost product every year. The resulting compost — made from organics that would’ve ended up sitting in a landfill — can be used in gardens lawns and mulching. Other composting processes are being considered in Forward 2044 McShane said.

Cedar Rapids compost yays and nays The Solid Waste Agency’s composting site accepts: • Fruits and vegetables • Baked goods (no sweets accepted: doughnuts cinnamon rolls pies cookies etc.) It does not accept: • Meat products • Dairy products • Plastic utensils bags of any kind • Paper products (napkins paper towels paper plates) • Any kind of trash

Anaerobic digestion is another biological treatment being evaluated. In giant sealed containers called reactors bacteria colonies are used to break down waste in the absence of oxygen. The process produces gases — like methane and carbon dioxide — that can be used to generate energy along with residual materials that can be re-purposed.

The process is commonly used at wastewater treatment facilities like the Cedar Rapids wastewater plant. The Solid Waste Agency is partnering with the plant to complete a feasibility study by feeding organic waste to the plant’s digesters to create energy. The results — which should be available in the next two months — will determine if building a digester is viable in Linn County.

“We’re hopeful it will be” McShane said.

Turning waste to energy

After organics and recyclables are separated from the waste stream that doesn’t mean the rest of the trash has to head to a landfill. Forward 2044 is exploring waste-to-energy processes.

A mass burn facility for instance feeds waste into a boiler system where the materials combust and turn to ash. The process produces steam that can be used to generate energy.

Other facilities take the waste shred it and take out any non-combustible materials. The resulting product — called a refuse-derived fuel — can then be burned for energy. The Solid Waste Agency is evaluating if this fuel could be produced in Linn County and then sent elsewhere for use.

“We haven't determined if that is viable but it is an example of something that is scalable” McShane said.

Joining forces is advantageous

To make alternative technologies more cost-efficient large amounts of waste are needed — larger than what is currently produced in Cedar Rapids. That’s why the Solid Waste Agency wants to band together with municipalities across the Midwest to take advantage of existing infrastructure and waste streams.

“The key piece is there's not just one solution” said HDR project manager Morgan Mays. “It's really the combination of these scenarios that best suits the region and the area and the waste stream that we have here.”

The Solid Waste Agency has been broaching potential partnerships with municipalities for at least nine months McShane said.

In Des Moines for instance a new state-of-the-art recycling facility was completed in 2021. The Solid Waste Agency may attempt a pilot to transport waste to the facility and potentially bring Des Moines waste back to Linn County’s composting site.

Iowa City is primed for anaerobic digestion McShane said due to local interest and existing efforts to minimize organic waste. There could be an opportunity for a partnership with the Solid Waste Authority to create an organics campus where people can be educated about composting anaerobic digestion and food waste.

While a new landfill in Linn County is out of the picture the Solid Waste Agency is considering siting new transfer stations in the county where waste can be prepared for transport to other facilities. Partner landfills in other areas also will be utilized creating a web of waste management collaboration in the region.

“Rather than saying ‘We can't do it we don't have enough waste’ we want to see if we can do it and bring folks together regionally” McShane said. “I think doing it now versus doing it in 2036 is key to being successful.”

This interview has been condensed and edited.

Name: Susan Abbatiello Current: Principal consultant scientist at Waters Corp. Career path: Ph.D. analytical chemistry University of Florida Postdoctoral research: Method development mass spectrometry and proteomics University of Pittsburgh First job outside of academia: Research associate at Genetics Institute (now Pfizer) Favorite molecule or protein: ""I will say my favorite protein is the first one that I worked on right out of undergrad. I worked at this company called Genetics Institute. The protein therapeutic that I worked on is called bone morphogenetic protein 2 BMP-2. And its function is to induce bone growth.""

Before going to graduate school you worked at Genetics Institute (now Pfizer). Can you tell me about that?

Coming out of undergraduate I felt very burned out and I didn't feel like I could continue going to school. So I looked for positions that were laboratory-based because I like to be in the lab and I was offered a position at a company in Andover Massachusetts that made recombinant human proteins which was a newer type of technology at the time. They gave me an entry-level position in a group that did method development. I worked there for five years. Three-and-a-half years in I thought to myself: ""I could probably go back to school and get a little deeper education in analytical chemistry."" It seemed like if I got a degree in analytical chemistry — specifically in mass spectrometry — I would be able to have a lot of options coming out of graduate school. So I went back.

Waters Corp. is a technology company specializing in scientific instruments. Can you tell me what you do day to day?

I'm in the global research team and my project is called charge detection mass spectrometry. We abbreviate it CDMS. That technology has not quite yet become mainstream meaning there really aren't a lot of commercial options for people to buy an instrument. The precise aspects of it were developed by Martin Jarrold at the University of Indiana and his company called Megadalton. Waters bought the intellectual property rights to the technology with the goal of commercializing CDMS. What's interesting about it to me — it's a mass spectrometer — is it’s different than any of the types of mass spectrometers I've worked on in my whole career of 20 years. In this day and age when we're all dealing with COVID there are new vaccines being developed that use very large structures that contain a payload whether it's proteins DNA or RNA to help make our bodies stronger and more immune to viruses. The charge detection MS system is able to measure large proteins whereas conventional mass spectrometers that are time-of-flight or the Orbitrap weren't primarily designed for that. To detect proteins this large it uses a slightly different mechanism. If we put them on a regular mass spectrometer you will not be able to detect them because of the mass-to-charge range of the MS detector.

What has been one of your favorite projects?

Back around 2005 Thermo Fisher Scientific had purchased a technology — FAIMS which stands for high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry. I was interested in this technology because while I was in grad school some of my colleagues were working on prototypes of this technology. The instrument was really hard to use. It was the first commercial iteration. I started at Thermo in the hopes that I would be able to work on that project. So a colleague and I began messing around with some hardware modifications. We saw that not only could it limit the junk getting into your system but you could improve the signal-to-noise ratio of what you wanted to detect so your instrument stays cleaner for longer and you get better signal. It’s like a win-win-win. It took several years. I was in a product manager role and I was able to work with some of the software engineers for controlling the hardware and then processing the data. I wanted to make sure that anyone that would use it could use it intuitively. When that product launched I was very happy; it was like a technology baby. I thought that was enough of me doing for-profit work for a while and so I left Thermo at that time but I feel really proud of that accomplishment because it was really hard and I feel like I made an impact.

How can students who are interested in a similar industry role prepare?

Start as early as high school or undergrad. Try summer internships so they can work closely with people in the lab to get a feel for what it's all about. Undergraduate internships and co-ops are something that Waters Corp. heavily leans on especially in research and engineering. Instrument companies and some pharmaceutical companies will hire a grad student co-op skilled in a certain area if that student could help the company.

There are some skills that I wish I had worked on earlier in my career. One is learning how to code. Whether it's R or Python or just being able to write macros to more efficiently do things. Raising the bar on some of the skills that are preferred or required at certain jobs is helpful especially in instrumentation.

What advice would you give for others who are interested in industry careers?

Like what you do even if it's not interesting. Finding a place where you can do what you do and be appreciated is another key and important aspect I would say in a successful career. I've worked at a lot of different places and some I didn't feel appreciated and I decided it just wasn't the right fit for me. I've just kind of moved around until I found a position where it seems to fit the best. I think it's important to not be afraid of that. We're not in the generation anymore where people are working 20 and 30 years at the same job. I think it's a lot less of a red flag to try different experiences and find what works best. After one experience in industry I never thought I would go back to a for-profit. I found something that fit better.

Also network. Find people that are in these different areas and have frank conversations with them. You have to be happy with what you do in order to live a happy life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbC5nci9lbi9hZHZlcnRvcmlhbC9yb2FkLXRyaXAtdG8tbGFrZS1wbGFzdGlyYS1hLW1hZ2ljYWwtbWFubWFkZS1lY29zeXN0ZW0v0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJhdmVsLmdyL2VuL2hvdy10by10cmF2ZWwtZW4vYWR2ZXJ0b3JpYWwvcm9hZC10cmlwLXRvLWxha2UtcGxhc3RpcmEtYS1tYWdpY2FsLW1hbm1hZGUtZWNvc3lzdGVtL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Road trip to Lake Plastira a Magical Manmade Ecosystem,"Next we drove towards then across Tavropos Dam which is really wonderful experience in itself. Then off to Moucha where we were awestruck by the view of the lake which looked to me a little like a Nordic fjord with a little tree covered island in the middle island Niaga it’s called.

We spent practically an entire day driving the 60-kilometre circle around the lake because we stopped so often to admire and photograph all the different views. If you don’t have enough time to do the same make sure you don’t miss the spot where Kryoneri and Neochori connect and try to make a stopover at Kalyvia Pezoula (another lovely village we could have used as our base). For about nine kilometres of your drive you’ll have the shores of the lake on one side and the lush trees on the other.

Hiking and Stunning Views

The drive was good and our visit to the lake shores even better but our key reason for leaving Athens to come here was to deeply commune with nature. We love hiking and were told that this was an awesome area to trek around as it’s not too challenging but really beautiful. Most of the area’s hiking trails stretch between the village of Belokomiti and the dam and criss-cross through forested dirt tracks.

Some sections however extend onto marked trails. We followed the M3 trail which leads to the Observatory from Zygogiarneika; at an height of 1350 metres above sea level. Luckily it was a clear day so we got the opportunity to take in the stunning view of the lake and the mountains of Karditsa and Evritania. It was probably the best moment of a very full weekend in a place that “emerged” from man’s need to tame and use the power nature.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5uZXQucGgvMjAyMi8xMi8yNC9jaHJpc3RtYXMtc3Bpcml0LWNvbWVzLWFsaXZlLWluLXNlbWlyYXJhLWlzbGFuZNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5uZXQucGgvYW1wL3N0b3J5LzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvY2hyaXN0bWFzLXNwaXJpdC1jb21lcy1hbGl2ZS1pbi1zZW1pcmFyYS1pc2xhbmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas spirit comes alive in Semirara Island,"The fiberglass boats are built through a bayanihan system with the beneficiaries taking part in the fabrication and technical assistance provided by experts from the Municipal Agricultural Office of Caluya Antique. | PHOTOGRAPHs COURTESY OF SMPC

Its Semirara Marine Hatchery Laboratory maintains a giant clams nursery that propagates and reseeds endangered clams which are considered keystone species crucial to marine water biodiversity along the coastal waters of Semirara Island. SMPC also deployed man-made reef balls in the coastal waters to create artificial reefs that can help combat the adverse effects of overfishing and destructive fishing methods. Two of the company's power subsidiaries Sem-Calaca Power Corporation and Southwest Luzon Power Generation Corporation deployed such artificial coral reefs in April 2022 along the Marine Protected Area of Barangay Carenahan in Balayan Batangas and equipped the shoreline with a watchtower that local sea patrol community volunteers can use to monitor activities in the protected environment.

MARINA DEL REY Calif. -- A Marina Del Rey couple is breathing a sigh of relief heading into Christmas with a refund from Wells Fargo after they had their life savings wiped out of their bank accounts last week.

Even though their money has been returned they want to raise awareness on hidden fraudulent accounts that are used to steal money.

James and Diana shared a screenshot of their Wells Fargo account showing eight back-to-back transfer transactions on Tuesday Dec. 13 totaling $68000.

VIDEO: How scammers used Zelle to clean out one man's bank account

It took just a few minutes of clever manipulation for scammers to clean out Marcas Miles' bank account using Zelle.

The couple who wished to be identified only by their first names said they were notified the next morning that their savings account had reached zero dollars.

""I log onto our account and I see that our entire savings account was drained and most of our checking account was drained"" said James.

He said a fraudulent account had been created years ago using his wife's personal information and it had gone unnoticed.

James also said someone then used it to take their money without it being flagged by Wells Fargo.

""Now if you were to lose $40 or $50 you'd hear something"" James said. ""But when you lose your entire savings and you have these very suspicious amounts going one after another and not to hear from them; that was very bizarre.""

The couple now wants to know how this happened.

ZELLE SCAM: Bank impostor taunts San Jose woman after stealing $3500 using her name

How are scammers able to take over your Zelle account -- all while sounding like a real bank employee? Here's how one woman found out the hard way.

""I don't have confidence in the bank that our current checking and savings accounts would be safe from further fraud"" Diana said.

Federal Bureau of Investigations Special Agent In-charge Brian Gilhooly said ""criminals are at their highest level at the point trying to take your money.""

Gilhooly said stolen identity information can make it easier for thieves to gain access to your account.

He urges everyone to change his or her login information often.

""Having that updated and strong password and changing that frequently would prevent or change and restrict access if someone does create a fictitious account or has access to your account by changing the password they will no longer have access to that account"" Gilhooly said.

Officials are warning about a scam that's taking advantage of unsuspecting victims who make electronic withdrawals from their bank accounts.

Meanwhile Wells Fargo issued the following statement regarding the couple's incident.

""After conducting our review we're pleased to resolve this matter for our customer. We are sorry for the inconvenience and worry our customer encountered as we know situations like these can weigh heavily on those impacted. We have a very extensive fraud program dedicated to protecting our customers and a thorough investigation process to research all reports of account fraud and identity theft. When we confirm fraud on an account we take action to block the fraudulent activity and reimburse the fraud victim.""

The FBI warns people over the age of 60 are the most vulnerable to these type of scams.

Gilhooly encourages people to also set up alerts from your banks so that they're notified when there is unusual activity.

The FBI asks anyone who believes they may be the victim of an internet crime to visit the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaGFybG90dGUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWV4ZWMtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1sZW5kaW5nLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charlotte-based Wells Fargo exec gives outlook on tightening commercial lending market - Charlotte Business Journal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bizjournals.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /charlotte/news/2022/12/23/wells-fargo-exec-commercial-lending-predictions.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225F201F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaGFybG90dGUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWV4ZWMtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1sZW5kaW5nLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlcy9vd2VkLW1vbmV5LWJ5LXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWhlcmVzLWhvdy1tdWNoLXRvLWV4cGVjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Owed Money by Wells Fargo?

The firm founded by Andres Perez and Mateo Semerene plans to use these resources to boost its integrated credit platform in Latin America.

The round was led by Far Out VC with participation from Caffeinated Capital Techstars Unpopular Ventures Kamay Ventures BuenTrip Ventures Lorimer Ventures and CompuSoluciones Ventures.

Before this the company had raised pre-seed capital of $450000.

Innovative products in a rapidly growing market

“AltScore is a company with an outstanding Founder Market Fit which has created a transparent culture of quality and constant improvement that delivers innovative products in a rapidly growing market” said Jonathan Fentzke Co-Founder & General Partner at Far Out VC.

The capital will allow AltScore to develop further its technology solution that is focused on supporting businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises through an end-to-end LaaS toolbox as they state.

Co-founders of AltScore

Also the company said in a statement that it would expand its operations and move its headquarters to Mexico.

AltScore uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to enable its clients to provide loans to any person or company including those outside the banking system.

The company will use the funds to evolve into an end-to-end lending tool according to a statement signed by Perez and Semerene; the seed round obtained by the Ecuadorian fintech includes funds from the United States and Latin America.

Expanding access to credit in LatAm

According to the company founded in Ecuador in January 2021 1.7 billion adults globally and more than 270 million in Latin America are outside the traditional system. Also according to AltScore access to credit is limited.

This year the fintech achieved over 10x growth in revenue YoY and a 34% CMGR over the last 12 months. Moving forward AltScore will focus its development in the Mexican market looking to establish itself as a leader in the LaaS space.

“Altscore not only has a massive opportunity in the exploding Fintech revolution in LATAM but the founders have deep domain expertise and a superhuman ability to execute. They are unstoppable” said Andrés Barreto from Techstars.

Now the growth focus of the fintech which operates in a dozen countries in North Central and South America and has around 30 clients will be the Mexican market. It has 15 full-time employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYW5nb3JkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjQvb3Bpbmlvbi9vcGluaW9uLWNvbnRyaWJ1dG9yL3J1c3NpYS1pcy11c2luZy13ZXN0ZXJuLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktaW4tdGhlLXdhci1hZ2FpbnN0LXVrcmFpbmUtaGVyZXMtaG93LXRvLXN0b3AtaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia is using Western technology in the war against Ukraine. Here's how to stop it.,"The BDN Opinion section operates independently and does not set news policies or contribute to reporting or editing articles elsewhere in the newspaper or on bangordailynews.com

Anastassia Fedyk is an assistant professor at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. Yuriy Gorodnichenko is a professor of economics at UC Berkeley. James Hodson is chief executive of AI for Good Foundation. They are co-founders of Economists for Ukraine. They wrote this for the Los Angeles Times.

For the last several months Western observers have watched Russia systematically destroy Ukrainians’ access to electricity heating and technology by targeting civilian power and communications infrastructure. It is a total war against the Ukrainian people.

Much of this targeted destruction is made possible by Western technology running on Western-designed devices core operating systems and networking software. A damning report from the Yermak-McFaul International Working Group on Russian Sanctions reveals that a large part of the technology systems enabling Russia to continue its attacks against civilians comes from Ukraine’s allies.

Companies such as Microsoft Google Cloudflare Oracle IBM AutoCAD and others have made public statements announcing that they are “exiting the Russian market” — but simply stopping new sales of equipment without shutting off existing phones and operating systems is wholly insufficient.

Many vendors continue to allow their products to be used to help manage servers monitor networks secure data build artificial intelligence and other capabilities that have clear potential to be co-opted for military purposes. These technologies are critical to Putin’s ability to damage Ukraine’s digital and physical infrastructure.

Western technology firms operate inside Russia by the rules of the Russian government. The relatively compliant Google which has a long history of coordination with the Russian government’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor is practically the only major American information platform still allowed to operate within Russia. It has tried to operate its information platforms in a delicate balance to comply with the Russian government’s implicit rules. But now Android devices are being used on the battlefield to communicate and coordinate attacks.

The time for delicate balance is well past. After 10 months of war Russians are not rebelling against the Putin regime’s murderous actions even though the costs are growing ever higher for them. Many are rejoicing in the damage done in Ukraine. There is little hope of making Russians want to stop their aggression. What remains is to hinder their ability to continue.

As Ukrainians face a brutal winter with limited heat and power even as they work to set up “points of invincibility” to provide refuge for the most vulnerable the least the West can do is to stop enabling Russian aggression with Western-produced technology.

What’s needed is more comprehensive information technology sanctions that cover military-enabling technology cyber-enabling technology and information-war-enabling technology.

Block IT services and access to stop further use by the military.

It’s imperative that the West limit Russia’s access to cloud computing resources and cloud-based data such as commercial satellite imagery and GIS systems and terminate all licenses and access to IT service providers such as Microsoft Google (Cloud and Android) SAP Oracle IBM Cisco and dozens of others. It is not possible to identify all potential military-enabling uses of such technologies so they should be blocked comprehensively. The same goes for manufacturing equipment and industrial technology provided by Western companies that are remotely accessible or reliant on international connectivity and communication.

Prevent Russia from using network and web-related technologies to communicate securely.

We should prevent access to software and related apparatus for secure digital communications network monitoring proxy networks VPN and other similar services that allow the use of digital resources remotely. This would include blocking access to services such as Cloudflare and access to patches/updates for security vulnerabilities in key network software and operating systems.

Make social platforms more accountable by requiring that data on content consumption by region language and source be publicly available.

Require social media digital advertising networks and content-sharing platforms to perform stringent checks before allowing paid-content sharing and prior to allowing content to reach an audience of more than 10000 accounts. Any platform distributing news-like content should report on key consumption metrics so that the reach of pro-Russian versus independent news sources in each region and language can be readily ascertained.

Impose stricter controls on technology transfers to Russian companies and nationals working in Western nations.

Examples of Russian firms supplying equipment to Western governments and infrastructure persist. Stronger monitoring of these firms is crucial to better protect national security and the West’s industry and technology base. Russian nationals working in related technology areas should be subject to “deemed export” regulations as applied to non-U.S. nationals working on any technology subject to export controls.

Russia will continue to exploit all available channels to carry out its aggression. The first step is to block Western technology from operating in Russia until attacks on civilians and infrastructure stop and Russians are held accountable for the committed crimes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9jb3JzYWlyLW1wNjAwLWdzLXNzZC1yZXZpZXcvMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corsair MP600 GS SSD Review: Middling but Capable,"Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

Comparison Products

The 2TB Corsair MP600 GS faces the WD Black SN770 the Crucial P3 Plus the Solidigm P41 Plus and the Corsair MP600 Pro XT all at 2TB. 1TB competitors include the Samsung 980 the HP FX900 and the Patriot P400. All but the MP600 Pro XT and 980 are within the same class of drive as the MP600 GS with the former being high-end and the latter PCIe 3.0. The P41 Plus and P3 Plus also stand out as the only QLC-based drives in the list.

Trace Testing - 3DMark Storage Benchmark

Built for gamers 3DMark’s Storage Benchmark focuses on real-world gaming performance. Each round in this benchmark stresses storage based on gaming activities including loading games saving progress installing game files and recording gameplay video streams.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The MP600 GS delivers mediocre marks in 3DMark. On the whole there are only two in-class drives that beat it: the Black SN770 and the P41 Plus. The Black SN770 remains an amazing drive. The P41 Plus only barely edges out the MP600 GS but it’s a QLC option that’s cheaper than both the MP600 GS and the SN770. The 980 is merely average here but this is a good showing for a PCIe 3.0 SS

Trace Testing – PCMark 10 Storage Benchmark

PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and everyday tasks to measure the performance of storage devices.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The MP600 GS does poorly in PCMark although it’s not really far off from most of the drives tested. Once again the Black SN770 and P41 Plus stand out. At least some of this is from firmware optimization. Even if the results do not demonstrate a direct performance relationship they do reflect an intention of designing a drive geared toward a better real world experience.

Transfer Rates – DiskBench

We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom 50GB dataset. We copy 31227 files of various types such as pictures PDFs and videos to a new folder and then follow-up with a reading test of a newly-written 6.5GB zip file.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The MP600GS is above average in DiskBench but it’s essentially on the same page as competing drives like the FX900 and P400. The Black SN770 has traditionally done well on this test too. The MP600 Pro XT easily pulls away.

Synthetic Testing - ATTO / CrystalDiskMark

ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products. Both of these tools give us insight into how each device handles different file sizes.

Image 1 of 12 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Read results from ATTO are stellar on the MP600 GS as we would expect from Phison controllers. This also applies to the P3 Plus and the MP600 Pro XT. ATTO writes are more subdued limited to some extent by the controller interface with the MP600 XT Pro pulling easily ahead again. We have actually seen anomalies in ATTO testing with some Phison drives that have been confirmed by other review sites. Things are more clear with CDM.

CDM sequential performance for the MP600 GS is as expected - right with the rest of the pack except the MP600 Pro XT. The exception is with QD1 read where the SN770 pulls away and the MP600 GS falls a bit behind. As the MP600 GS is holding right with the P3 Plus and P41 Plus here it’s likely a facet of the Phison E21T controller. The InnoGrit IG5220 controller used on the FX900 and P400 is faster.

The drive’s 4K performance is mediocre particularly at a low queue depth. This is one area in which the IG5220 is simply superior scoring well with reads which remains an important benchmark. One standout here is the P41 Plus which manages to have slightly better latency despite using QLC. Part of this is due to SLC caching and part possibly due to optimizations for reads with Solidigm’s 144-layer QLC but it also suggests that Solidigm tunes its drives carefully for client use.

Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery

Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache which is a fast area of (usually) pseudo-SLC programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the ""native"" TLC or QLC flash. We use Iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The 2TB MP600 GS writes at about 4.8 GBps for over 14 seconds in pSLC mode with a cache of nearly 70GB. After that it writes at 1.78 GBps in TLC mode which is about half the maximum speed of drives with this flash that use the Phison E18 controller like the MP600 Pro XT. This is logical because the MP600 GS’s E21T controller has half the channels and therefore half the interleaving. This cache layout is different from the one on the FX900 and P400. On those drives the cache is larger with an eventual decline to a slower folding mode after writing to TLC.

Only some E18-driven drives like the MP600 Pro XT opt for a smaller cache in return for better sustained performance. This design choice makes the MP600 GS unique as it’s capable of very fast sustained performance. This will be better for certain prosumer tasks but also will maintain performance with a fuller drive or after a lot of writes scenarios you might face when using it as a caching drive. The cache is still large enough to manage random writes and because it is smaller in absolute terms it will maintain its size more consistently across the drive as it is filled.

The drive is capable of recovering some cache relatively quickly which can help absorb random writes but otherwise it does not seem in a hurry to move data over. This is a reasonable design decision because random writes tend to incur higher write amplification and are ideally cached in pSLC. Meanwhile typical usage that is if the drive is used in a normal gaming computer will likely offer plenty of idle time to restore the full cache. This potentially makes the MP600 GS more attractive than the alternatives in this price bracket for specific cases.

Power Consumption and Temperature

We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade as even the best ultrabooks can have mediocre storage.

Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly ultimately saving energy.

One great thing to come out of the age of new PCIe 4.0 DRAM-less controllers as well as 176-layer flash is the preponderance of efficient drives. The MP600 GS is no exception beating everything here except the FX900. The SN770 and P3 Plus come pretty close though.

Not shown are the Team MP44L and Silicon Power UD90  drives with similar hardware as the MP600 GS. These have displayed better efficiency in our prior testing which is likely a consequence of differences in pSLC caching. It’s possible then that a longer or more variable test would have the MP600 GS win out.

The 2TB MP600GS idled at around 40C. Under load it reached a maximum of 80C after approximately 600GB of writes. Write performance was not perfectly consistent past this point demonstrating some dips. This drive could benefit from a heatsink if you are purchasing it for anything heavy duty and in fact we would recommend that for some applications and hotter environments.

Conclusion

The Corsair MP600 GS is your run-of-the-mill mid-range PCIe 4.0 SSD. Its performance is not amazing but certainly good enough as is its power efficiency. In some areas it does stand out specifically with sustained writes. This can make it useful for some tasks and also more consistent in edge cases. It’s nice to see it available at up to 2TB too but it has stiff competition from excellent drives like the WD Black SN770. The Corsair name will only get it so far as it doesn’t offer anything special like an option for a heatsink although the 5-year warranty is decent.

Our recommendation would be to wait for a price drop as this drive is at least competent within its class. There’s nothing wrong with similar offerings from Silicon Power or Team Group but Corsair perhaps has a bit more cachet in some circles. This may or may not be deserved although we would point out that the drive's cache design does suggest Corsair was aiming at a more reliable experience. This could make the MP600 GS more broadly appealing but the differences in daily use would be negligible.

I've noticed a common theme within recent PlayStation exclusives: the addition of the dual protagonist perspective. For example you play as both Ratchet & Rivet in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and as Ellie and Abby in The Last Of Us Part 2. However I think that Santa Monica Studios absolutely nailed the dual protagonist narrative in God Of War Ragnarok.

Embarking on my journey with Kratos and Atreus filled me with glee. Their father and son relationship was my favourite aspect of the franchise reboot alongside that addictive Leviathan Axe recall thumping into Kratos' raised right hand.

Here the dual protagonists open the narrative scope and allow players to follow the perspective of both Kratos and Atreus and explore their relationship to the wider Norse realms and companion characters like Freya.

It makes a big difference. The player already understands the mindset of Kratos and his thoughts on Atreus. However as the game unfolds the player slowly starts to unravel clues to Atreus' growing maturity and emotional strength.

The Atreus segments give us enough time to spend with characters that Kratos would view as enemies. Atreus' relationship with Odin Thor and Thrud present the player with valid emotional connections with antagonistic presences by flipping the table on our perceptions. It was fantastic to team up with Thor and command him to throw Mjolnir to attack enemies on my behalf. I was surprised to get a more intimate view of the Thor Sif and Thrud household and it also mirrored the fracturing relationship between Kratos and Atreus. The phrase ""For our children we must be better"" is at the core of Ragnarok framed perfectly in the powerful ending of the climactic battle with Thor. Kratos uses kindness and compassion to prevent unnecessary bloodshed. Kratos finally trusts Atreus by giving him the ultimate choice on how to deal with Odin. ""This is your choice son I trust you"" he says and Atreus makes the difficult but correct choice of empathy - to follow the path of justice over rage and violence. ""We survived today because of your choices. Who to trust. Who to call friend. Son. You are ready"" Kratos says. Atreus replies ""Remember our promise."" Kratos responds ""Loki will go."" With an emotional tremble Kratos then touches his heart whilst saying that ""Atreus... remains."" The epilogue is emotionally effective because we finally get to face the colossal boss - the emotional breakthrough. Kratos finally believes that Atreus has the power to have autonomy in his life and to be trusted. Kratos learns that without Atreus' company Kratos can easily slide back into the killing monster witnessed by the death of Heimdall. Atreus ultimately makes Kratos a better God. Throughout it all the dual protagonist perspective allows us to follow Kratos and Atreus on their separate journeys which ultimately brings them closer together to value their unique father-son relationship.

Still here? I couldn't let 2022 go without talking a little about another PlayStation exclusive one that ate up a lot of my year. I want to focus on the accessibility aspects of this second PlayStation game which is Horizon Forbidden West. (I played it on PS4 because the PS5 did not work for my accessibility setup.)

The plethora of accessibility settings present in Forbidden West gives players control over their gameplay and the chance to align it with their abilities to ensure that enjoyment isn't affected by unnecessary barriers. It's a great start for Guerrilla able to design Forbidden West from the beginning with accessibility in mind. The studio's attempt is extremely well executed and it means more gamers can enjoy the amazing characters and wonderous world of Forbidden West.

Horizon Forbidden West.

Guerrilla understands that disabled gamers don't just want an easy mode but they do want control over important aspects of gameplay such as how much damage Aloy receives or how much damage enemies take. The main aspect of combat is to accurately tear off enemy parts for crafting purposes. However the precision necessary to do this can be difficult to achieve as enemies are extremely mobile.

Because of this Forbidden West has added the option to loot those specific parts once you get the kill. This option was great for me as it provided a safety net when fatigue caused me to forget to tear parts off in battle. The auto-heal option removed the need to press up on the d-pad especially useful when I made the ridiculous decision to fight a Tremortusk and two Scrappers with low tier weaponry. If you assume that I survived the massacre you'd be absolutely right... if right actually meant wrong. I'm an advocate for the implementation of toggles and Guerrilla has happily obliged here too. There are toggles for aiming opening the weapon wheel crafting Shieldwing activation and Pullcaster. The crafting toggle is clever: you can easily craft arrows or ammo whilst in the weapon wheel by tapping X instead of holding it. During combat it made a huge difference by reducing fatigue and unnecessary constant muscle usage. This is supplemented with the option to increase the weapon wheel time slowdown. It doesn't completely stop time but slows it enough for me to choose the right weapon ammo type or alternate fire.

Guerrilla has added sprint when pushing the left stick fully forward and this option enabled me to slide (by pressing crouch) for the first time. But the clever bit is that if you are crouching and push the stick fully forward you don't ruin stealth by accidentally sprinting. This option should appear in all games because sliding is useful but more importantly super awesome.

Horizon Forbidden West.

I wouldn't say that Horizon Forbidden West has the best control remapping system seen in PlayStation exclusives - Insomniac's Spider-Man Miles Morales is still the star - but it's not far off. It's flexible enough to alter the button layout and change layouts for different contexts such as when aiming separate joint actions or layer actions on one button. For example the new ability to glide using the Shieldwing can be assigned to most face buttons because it only activates after jumping. The remapping surprisingly allows you to layer the Interact action onto other buttons; I layered it to the dodge action thus freeing up the triangle button to be used as the ""use trap"" button. The great aspect of the ""use trap"" button is that if you hold it it accesses your backpack where you can craft traps or swap between them without using the d-pad.

The choice to assign actions when aiming is great. You have to consider controls for your Pullcaster for activating the essential Concentration mode which slows time for increased accuracy and for the first time your weapons have multiple unlockable alternate fires. The additional option to automatically activate Concentration mode when aiming makes gameplay intuitive fluid and more immersive.

The only accessibility issue with Horizon Forbidden West is that the process to swap between three alternate fires in the weapon wheel requires the use of the d-pad. There should be an option to either use the left stick or triggers to swap. Alt fires are essential tools in Aloy's arsenal and swapping between them is usually a choice between life or death. Beyond this Forbidden West continues the progress we're starting to see in accessibility. See you in 2023!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGNhcmVpdG5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW56L3JvdW5kdXAtYWx0ZXJhcy1zdW5yaXNlLWVtci1mdWxseS1yb2xsZWQtb3V0LWdpcHBzbGFuZC1hbmQtbW9yZS1icmllZnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roundup: Altera's Sunrise EMR fully rolled out in Gippsland and more briefs,"Altera Digital Health completes Sunrise EMR rollout in Gippsland

Archives NZ discloses breach of historical health records

New Zealand's national archive Archives NZ has disclosed instances of unauthorised access to historical health records which happened three months ago.

On 19 September the agency was informed by a former Archives NZ staff member that some digitised health records dating as far back as the 1950s have been made open access by mistake. These records which were restricted to the public became unintentionally viewable to public users of the Rosetta digital images system.

The records include Sunnyside Hospital's admissions book from 1952-56; a 1968 diary and an admission book from 1966-1973 for admitted criminal offenders.

Following this the agency immediately restricted access to the records and formally notified both the Privacy Commission and Te Whatu Ora of a potential privacy breach.

""We sincerely apologise for this incident which was a result of human error. We want to reassure you that immediate corrective steps have been taken. We understand if you may feel anxious or worried about this breach of information"" the chief archivist said in a statement.

So far it was only known that two members of the public had accessed the said records in August. According to Archives NZ ""it has not been possible to determine whether images were downloaded or shared during the access events.""

Nonetheless the agency has a ""high degree of confidence that the scope is limited and that this is a one-off case due to human error rather than systemic issues.""

Monkeypox vax platforms go live in NSW

eHealth NSW has helped set up two digital platforms to support NSW Health's vaccination campaign against monkeypox.

It launched the Monkeypox Vaccination Administration Management for public health staff. Now live at 27 NSW mpox vaccination clinics the system provides end-to-end administrative tools including automated workflows and clinic capacity management.

The other platform is an online booking portal for citizens seeking mpox immunisation. Nearly 4000 people who used the portal received their shots within the first month of launching.

Mills that churn out cardboard are slashing production worldwide a worrying sign that global trade is slowing down.North American companies that make the raw material for corrugated boxes shut down nearly 1 million tons of capacity in the third quarter and a similar scenario is expected for the fourth quarter Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ryan Fox said. Prices are falling for the first time since 2020.“Severe weakness in global box demand is an indication of how weak many parts of the global economy are” said KeyBanc analyst Adam Josephson . “The recent history shows a significant amount of economic stimulus would be necessary to provide meaningful box demand and we do not see that coming.”Investors are watching closely for any harbingers of what is to come as fears mount that many of the world’s biggest economies will tip into recession next year. Paper boxes are present at nearly every step of a good’s journey through the supply chain  which makes paper a key indicator of how economies are faring. The signals are not encouraging.Global demand for packaging paper is showing weakness for the first time since 2020 when economies reignited following the first hit of the Covid-19 pandemic. US prices fell in November for the first time in two years and the US the world’s biggest exporter reported 21% lower volumes sent overseas in October versus the previous year.WestRock and Packaging Corp. have announced mill closures or idled machines. Klabin  Brazil’s biggest packaging-paper exporter is considering cutting its exports by as many as 200000 metric tons next year Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Teixeira said. That’s almost half the amount exported in the twelve months ended September.Much of the fall off in demand is attributed to the shrinking effect inflation has on consumer wallets. Companies that produce everything from consumer staples to apparel are bracing for a pullback. Procter & Gamble Co. has raised prices for products from Pampers diapers to Tide laundry detergent several times to offset higher expenses fueling the company’s first quarterly decline in unit sales since 2016 earlier this year.US retailers discounted heavily on Black Friday in hopes of clearing out excess inventory but shoppers responded with only modest traffic and sales fell in November by the most in almost a year. Moreover the meteoric growth of e-commerce — an avid user of cardboard boxes — has receded.Sluggish demand is also hitting pulp the raw material for paper. Top global exporter Suzano recently announced a price cut for its eucalyptus pulp in China the first decline since late 2021. European demand is decreasing and a long-awaited recovery in China hasn’t materialised yet said Gabriel Fernandez Azzato a director at consultancy firm TTOBMA.",,,,,,,,,,,,

U.S. small businesses see sales boost after Made in America features with David Muir

For the 11th year running ABC News' ""World News Tonight"" is spotlighting small businesses across the country making and selling American-made products in its annual Made in America Christmas series.

From personalized books to Christmas tree growing kits David Muir reports on the U.S. small businesses creating products and jobs. For the 3rd year in a row Oprah Winfrey got in on the fun by sharing some of her Favorite Things made in the United States.

The companies featured all said they saw a boost in business after being seen -- and that viewers' orders made a big difference on their sales.

The company Buck Mason who sells tee shirts made of cotton from farms across the country sold over 3400 shirts after Muir visited their store in New York.

The Mystic Connecticut-based company Mystic Knotwork saw over $40000 in sales within an hour of being featured in the series. ""We had phone calls coming in off the hook. It was crazy"" employee Bailey McGowen said.

Alex Schuman's company Nomadic Kitchen in Burlington Vermont makes holiday themed and flavored marshmallows. Because of the increase in orders Schuman said she added more hours and days for staff and even hired a new employee to accommodate the high demand.

In Gardena California Gloria L. Williams' beauty company Body Nanny -- which was on the list of one of Oprah's Favorite Things -- received hundreds of new orders for their sugar scrub set.

""You made us so busy"" Williams told Muir in a video message. ""We had to hire extra people and we had to add extra shifts!""

Another item on Oprah's list was Stone Hollow Farmstead's movie night trio popcorn box. Mother-daughter duo Deborah and Alexander Stone created 500 new boxes for ""World News Tonight"" viewers at their harm in Harpersville Alabama.

The Philadelphia-based company Vinylux repurposes old vinyl records into bowls coasters journals clocks and more. Once they shared their story with Muir sales increased by 1600% and sold out. Owner Jeff Davis and his team immediately got to work restocking their supply. “It’s been a very busy week here which has been great” Davis said.

The nonprofit Augusta Training Shop sells wooden snowflakes handmade by adults with special needs. Executive director Audrey Murell said the organization will now be able to hire more employees after being spotlighted.

The custom chips it designs make its products snappier to use or help them eke out an hour or more of extra battery life. Last year though Apple’s chip department hit a serious setback.

Apple planned a generational leap for the graphics processor in the latest version of its high-end smartphones the iPhone 14 Pro. But engineers were too ambitious with adding new features and early prototypes drew more power than what the company had expected based on software simulations. That could have hurt battery life and made the device too hot according to two people with direct knowledge of the incident. Because Apple discovered the mistake late in development it had to base the graphics processor in its iPhone 14 Pro line—which powers the phone’s user interface games and everything else visible on its screen—largely on the design of the chip that went into last year’s iPhone model according to four people familiar with the matter.

Those people described the snafu which hasn’t been previously reported as unprecedented in the group’s history. The iPhone 14 Pro models which went on sale in September showed only small gains in graphics performance compared to the leaps prior generations of iPhones had made over their predecessors according to testing by independent chip-benchmarking firms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdwYi5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2F1ZGl0LWZpbmRzLXN0YXRlcy12aWRlby1nYW1lLXRheC1jcmVkaXQtd29ydGh3aGlsZS1pbnZlc3RtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Audit finds state's video game tax credit a worthwhile investment,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdwYi5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzIzL2F1ZGl0LWZpbmRzLXN0YXRlcy12aWRlby1nYW1lLXRheC1jcmVkaXQtd29ydGh3aGlsZS1pbnZlc3RtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002122363BA00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

As spotted by the Nintendo -focussed publication Vooks legal documents were lodged in December 2022 with multiple breaches of legislation cited over the launch and advertisement of the PokeWorld NFT game.

Kotiota Studios have allegedly been advertising the game for several months claiming it’s a ‘metauniverse P2E [play to earn] game … filled with fascinating Pokemons that players can collect as pets.’ (Note: The official plural of Pokemon is just ‘Pokemon’.)

Imagery shown off included digital 3D models of Pokemon like Pikachu as well as 2D art clearly ripped from official Pokemon sources. Kotiota claimed to have worked on other Pokemon titles in the past including Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Pokemon Home and Pokemon Sleep. The Pokemon Company International has denied these claims and made clear Kotiota is not and has never been a contractor for the company.

Read: Pokemon Scarlet and Violet review – A shiny Terastallized gem

The filing has been lodged in an attempt to stop Pokemon Pty Ltd and Kotiota Studios from representing themselves as being licensed to develop official Pokemon games and cease the operation of the PokeWorld website including all sales of NFTs.

As pointed out by Vooks the official court document confirms The Pokemon Company International has made ‘a deliberate decision not to launch any Pokemon NFTs’ – likely to protect the renowned brand which has long been seen as Nintendo ‘s flagship property for children and people of all ages.

While the PokeWorld website may have flown under the radar it appears The Pokemon Company International was ultimately alerted to its presence as Pokemon Pty Ltd had begun reaching out to media with its plans to launch the NFT game in January 2023. Given the obvious lack of official Nintendo support this raised major red flags.

As of writing the PokeWorld website remains online – however the company’s Twitter page has been suspended. Given the ongoing court proceedings it’s likely the website isn’t long for this world. We’ll have to stay tuned to see how The Pokemon Company International proceeds."

In addition to listing his 50 Central South duplex for $90 million last week Wynn has listed two Sun Valley Idaho homes for $27 million as well as a Palm Beach property for $78.5 million. That’s in addition to a Beverly Hills California estate that is looking for $100 million after initially seeking $125 million in March 2020 according to WSJ.

Sue Engelmann and John Sofro of Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Sun Valley Properties have the Sun Valley listing. The larger of the two homes is 12400 square feet with seven bedrooms and sits on 2.4 acres. He bought the home which has a catering kitchen and two guest wings in 2009 for $7.5 million. The property has a heated pool and hot tub.

Wynn also bought the adjacent 3200-square-foot four-bedroom house which sits on 2 acres. He uses that home for hosting guests.

The nine-bedroom 17000-square-foot mansion in Palm Beach Florida went on the market in November the outlet reported. He bought the property a year ago for $49 million and after a renovation put it back on the market in November for $78.5 million.

Lawrence Moens of Lawrence A. Moens Associates is the listing agent.

Wynn has had success flipping properties in the area. In April he sold a waterfront Palm Beach home for $32 million within a year of buying it for $24 million.

A company tied to Wynn paid $49 million for a lakefront mansion at 1350 North Lake Way in March 2021. That same month he flipped the waterfront property at 235 Via Vizcaya for $23.7 million two months after buying it for $18.4 million.

And in 2019 he paid $43 million for the oceanfront mansion at 1960 South Ocean Boulevard. A year earlier he sold the lot at 1350 South Ocean Boulevard for more than $20 million.

He hasn’t had as much success — yet — in selling his 3-acre property in Beverly Hills which he bought in 2015 for $48 million. The 11-bedroom mansion was originally listed for $135 million in March 2020 before he slashed the asking price a couple of times to its current $100 million price tag.

The 80-year-old Wynn who is worth $3.3 billion according to Forbes is the founder and former chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts. He stepped down from the company about four years ago after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct were revealed by WSJ.

Florida-based Hard Rock International owned by the Seminole Tribe said it plans to reshape the property at the center of the glittery Las Vegas Boulevard casino corridor by replacing its volcano attraction with a huge guitar-shaped hotel tower.

Company Chairman Jim Allen said in a statement that the property's 3500 employees were absorbed Monday into Hard Rock's 45000-member workforce. The company has cafes hotels casinos and concert properties around the world.

“We are excited to create an integrated resort on the Strip that will make this legendary entertainment community proud” Allen said. The statement specified there were no immediate plans to close The Mirage or lay off employees.

Hard Rock and MGM Resorts announced plans for the operational takeover a year ago. The deal became official following Nevada Gaming Commission approval at a special meeting Friday.

“We're thrilled to welcome Hard Rock to the neighborhood and wish them all the very best” Bill Hornbuckle CEO and president of casino giant MGM Resorts International said in a statement.

The more than 3000-room hotel on 80 acres becomes the first on the Las Vegas Strip to be run by a Native American tribe.

East of the Strip the Connecticut-based Mohegan Tribe operates a casino that opened in 2021 at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas after that property – named Hard Rock Hotel & Casino – was purchased in 2018 renovated and rebranded by Virgin.

West of the Strip an affiliate of the California-based San Manuel Band of Mission Indians owns and operates The Palms.

Seminole-owned Hard Rock International had no previous involvement with the former Hard Rock Hotel & Casino that operated from 1995 to 2020. It bought licensing and naming rights in May 2020. The Mirage redevelopment plan is projected to run through 2023. Costs have not been disclosed.

Daily operations “are set to continue under The Mirage brand for the foreseeable future and all room reservations and group bookings will be honored with no action required by guests or group organizers” the company said.

“The process. ultimately will dramatically reimagine every aspect of the resort and change the Las Vegas skyline with the addition of a guitar-shaped hotel tower” the company promised.

Hard Rock International also entered into a long-term lease agreement with VICI Properties Inc. a real estate investment trust that acquired MGM Resorts properties this year in a $17.2 billion deal with MGM Growth Properties a publicly traded landowner of holdings in eight states. New York-based VICI owns properties and leases them back to hospitality and entertainment operators.

The sale marks the end of an era for a Polynesian-themed property built by former casino mogul Steve Wynn and credited with helping transform Las Vegas from a gambling hub into an ultra-luxury resort destination with broader appeal.

It opened in November 1989 with a sidewalk-side volcano spewing fire years before gondoliers began plying canals at the Venetian and fountains started dancing at the Bellagio. For years The Mirage hosted Siegfried & Roy taming white tigers. It remains home to a Cirque du Soleil show set to a Beatles soundtrack.

The change-of-hands is one of several involving well-known properties on Las Vegas Boulevard. Rhode Island-based Bally's Corp. completed its acquisition in September of the Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. Bally's Corp. does not own Bally's Las Vegas on the Strip.

Caesars Entertainment Inc. which owns Bally's Las Vegas is rebranding the 2800-room property as the Horseshoe Las Vegas.

Lee LeFear’s reaction to his $872 bill 245 miles away in Denver was much the same.

“I thought I was keeping up” LeFear said. “There was no way I could pay that. It’s a hell of a thing to get two weeks before Christmas.”

LeFear 66 is on Social Security disability and health problems have sidelined the Rickses both 57 from working. The utility bills were beyond their means to pay sending them to social service agencies for help.

The two households are part of an unprecedented wave of people scrambling for assistance with utility bills which have soared with rising natural gas prices and a series of electricity and gas rate increases by Xcel Energy the state’s main utility provider with more than 1.5 million customers.

The big bills come as inflation is pushing up the cost of living and as sources of aid such as funds for rental food and job loss assistance under initiatives such as the federal American Rescue Plan dry up.

And as bad December bills have been aid agencies fear January bills boosted even more by the arctic cold blanketing the Front Range could be even worse.

“You are talking about people living on the margins living dollar to dollar” said Kristen Baluyot the Salvation Army Metro Denver director of social services. “Any change in expense can dramatically change their housing stability and their need for assistance.”

Ryan Breedlove has such a story. The single parent of three girls Breedlove 37 is a gig worker doing merchandising warehousing and cleaning. A couple of months ago her car needed a new water pump and other repairs totaling $1400 — a tab she couldn’t afford.

“That has made it difficult to get to jobs and I’ve had to pay extra to get my daughter to and from school” Breedlove said. Rent on her Arvada townhouse also rose by about $100 a month.

can be reached directly at 303-825-8750 or or infor@energyoutreach.org To find a local payment assistance agency near you use the Energy Outreach Colorado locator:

https://co.my.xcelenergy.com/s/billing-payment/energy-assistance

Then came the December Xcel Energy bill of $1200 reflecting two months usage. Breedlove took her bill to Community Table an Arvada-based nonprofit aid organization participating in a statewide utility assistance program.

Community Table was able to cover the bill. “I don’t know what I would do without them” Breedlove said.

Her tale is just one of many this December and the numbers tell the tale.

The two main sources of utility bill relief are the state’s Low-Income Energy Assistance Program or LEAP and nonprofit Energy Outreach Colorado or EOC.

Each offers a one-time payment to help with utility bills.

The federally funded LEAP program began accepting applications Oct. 1 and in the first 12 weeks had 69000 requests for help with heating bills. To be eligible a household can earn up to 60% of the state median income — $34560 for an individual and $66468 for a family of four.

So far the program has approved 43000 applications. In the 2021-22 heating season LEAP helped a total of 83000 households. About 35% of the grants go to households in the Denver metro area.

“This marks the most we have seen in recent years and with increasing energy costs our dollars have less impact” said Theresa Kullen LEAP manager. The program is expecting to spend about $65 million for the heating season.

EOC through a mix of government corporate and foundation funding helped 21700 households with gas and electric bills in 2021. Since October the organization has fielded 113000 calls for help.

“What people are telling us is that their utility bills have doubled in many cases” said Denise Stepto EOC’s chief communications officer. “They are completely shocked and in many cases unable to afford it.”

EOC distributes its aid through local partner social service agencies and groups such as Community Table and the Salvation Army. “We are spending a lot of EOC money” Baluyot said.“We are seeing a significant jump crazy significant.”

By mid-December the Salvation Army had distributed $599000 in utility aid almost as much as it did all of last year.

It’s not consumption making bills bigger

The fact is that even if a family’s energy consumption isn’t going up what Xcel Energy is charging them for gas and electricity has risen.

In the last year the Colorado PUC has approved six Xcel Energy electric and gas rate increases.

A main driver in the soaring bills has been the rise in the price of natural gas — a cost that gets passed directly on to consumers.

This year the spot price for natural gas doubled to as much as $8.81 for a million British thermal units before dropping to $5.45 a million BTUs in November which still left it 25% higher than the start of the year.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission has approved three rate increases this year to cover rising gas prices the last one in September just before the heating season began.

In June the PUC also approved a temporary gas rate increase to cover $500 million in fuel costs during 2021’s Winter Storm Uri which briefly spurred prices to as high as $190 a million BTUs.

On top of that in October the PUC granted Xcel Energy a $64.2 million increase in the base natural gas rates and last April the utility commission also approved a $182 million hike in electricity rates.

“This is not sustainable for many people” Stepto said.

The result is that even a couple like LeFear and his wife who are careful about their electricity use cannot avoid higher bills.

“I can’t figure it out. We haven’t touched the thermostat I have all new appliances new furnace new water heater everything is efficient” LeFear said.

The cost of moving to renewable energy adds up

Much of the rate increases are being spurred by the goal of shifting the company to 80% renewable generation by 2030 in Colorado and assuring the reliability of the electric grid and natural gas pipeline system.

“We understand customers are concerned with the rising cost of energy” Michelle Aguayo a company spokeswoman said in an email. “We want them to know we work hard to be good stewards of their money and are prudent in making investments that continue to provide a safe and reliable grid while leading the clean energy transition.”

All the investments in projects such as wind farms solar installations battery storage and a new regional grid will have “long-lasting benefits for all our customers” Aguayo said.

Xcel Energy also has bill payment aid plans financed by a charge on customer bills including gas and electricity affordability programs where customers who qualify for LEAP can receive a bill credit or partial forgiveness of past-due balances.

Between last December and Nov. 30 of this year Xcel Energy customers donated $700000 for energy assistance and through monthly energy assistance charges on bills the utility has provided $16 million to EOC.

Still the jump in bills has been overwhelming for the Rickses and many others. Paul Ricks has been mostly unable to work as handyman because of heart problems and a fall earlier this year also kept Cheryl out of work. She has a scar across her forehead and a bad back to show for it.

The couple managed to outfit their 1978 mobile home in Clifton with new appliances last year in the hopes of being more energy-efficient and cutting their bills. “Maybe it’s our poor windows?” Cheryl said.

Cheryl Ricks took her bill to Grand Valley Catholic Outreach another EOC partner. People have been lining up at the door in the morning with their utility bills Sister Karen Bland the center’s director said.

When Ricks was told that her entire bill could be covered it left her in tears. “These are tears of joy” she said. “I didn’t expect to get help with the whole thing.” She left with a smile and a box of donated food.

The kinds of people coming through Grand Valley’s doors this season are different from many of those the center has helped in the past according to Scott Montgomery the organization’s financial director.

“Instead of seeing people mired in generational poverty the agency is now seeing people who are accustomed to paying their bills regularly” Montgomery said. “They were staying on top of bills by carefully managing fixed incomes but sudden doubling and tripling of utility bills and big hikes in rent pushed them into needing help. The numbers of disabled and senior citizens we are starting to see is disturbing to us.”

LeFear 66 is one of those numbers. The Air Force veteran and retired window glass installer has lived in his townhouse in Denver’s Washington Virginia Vale neighborhood for 14 years and has always paid his Xcel Energy bill.

Last March — with a zero balance — LeFear said he moved to budget billing where Xcel Energy calculates a fixed monthly charge based on a household’s historic usage seasonal variations and the prevailing rates.

“The bill was $279 a month and I never missed a payment” LeFear said adding that he made sure to keep the thermostat low during the colder months and higher during the summer.

A review of LeFear’s bills however showed with each month the fixed charge didn’t quite cover the usage first by a little bit and then growing until in December his bill tallied $872.

Stunned LeFear called the Senior Assistance Center a Denver nonprofit that is also an EOC partner. “I got six calls in one day” said Karen Black the center’s executive director. “This is really upsetting to people living on a pension or Social Security. They can get behind really quickly.”

Black said that Xcel Energy works with the center and its clients to deal with the bills and keep the lights and heat on even after they receive shut-off notices. “Xcel people are very kind and respectful” she said.

There are limits however. “If the customer is struggling for a long time and has multiple disconnect notices and not working on a payment plan they lose patience” said Alex Romberg the Denver Inner City Parish liaison to EOC.

The senior center will cover LeFear’s December bill and “help him get caught up” Black said. If there are no surprises LeFear said he hopes he will be able to stay on top of his bills going forward.

“The problem is the bill just keeps going up and up but my money does not keep going up” he said.

Lee LeFear went on Xcel Energy’s budget billing plan to smooth out the highs and lows of his utility costs. But the $279 per month that was set gradually stopped covering the cost to heat and light his townhome. His bill was almost $900 in December so he asked for help. (Kathryn Scott Special to The Colorado Sun)

Xcel is looking for another electric rate increase

Xcel Energy has already filed a request for another $312.2 million electric rate increase and is seeking to recover $123 million from customers for coal-delivery shortfalls and high natural gas prices.

While EOC LEAP and the local social service agencies are helping seniors and families manage their December bills with the one-time payments they are worrying about what will happen in January.

“What we expect is that the January bill is going to be worse” EOC’s Stepto said. “If you can’t pay December and then comes January you can get a cascading effect where you can’t afford anything. … It is kind of scary.”

Inflation remains another concern. “The increased costs of everything at this point is what is driving folks” LEAP’s Kullen said. “While they may have been able to get by in the past now so many folks are in positions that they are having to ask for help from many avenues.”

Last year Grand Valley Catholic Outreach for example helped 700 people with a range of services this year it is up to 1700.

Bland said some of the people coming in for help seem to have been “scared into immobility” by the vastly higher gas and electricity bills they received this month. “They just don’t know what to do.”

Brands Inc YUM restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken is the face of Christmas in Japan. The ordinarily quiet restaurants become abuzz with activity as the holiday approaches.

Talking Turkey ... Or KFC: The tradition of eating fried chicken for Christmas by the bucket loads stems from one man — Takeshi Okawara who was the manager of the first KFC that opened in the country in November 1970 in Nagoya reported TimeOut a local publication.

Okawara apparently overheard an ex-pat reminisce about eating turkey for Christmas and hit upon the idea of dishing out fried chicken instead according to the report.

In 1974 KFC reportedly came up with the slogan “Kentucky Wa Kurisumasu” or Kentucky is Christmas which fortified the link between the festival and chicken.

Book Ahead Or Line Up: As a Tokyo-ite I can attest firsthand that people start booking their Christmas meals at KFC as early as November. Even so on the day the meals are supposed to be picked up you can expect to queue up outside a KFC. Many times employees set up special stalls outside the restaurant so customers can pick up their KFC goodness.

Last year The Japan Times said KFC is now encouraging people to order online to avoid the “perennial” Christmas queues.

A company spokesperson said that the move was an “infection countermeasure” in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

What's In Store? You might be forgiven for imagining that a KFC Christmas would be all sloppy fast food fare. This year the restaurant chain is dishing up a “Premium Roast Chicken” for JPY 6200 or $45. There are various combos on sale including what the company calls “Party Barrel” which features 8 pieces of original recipe chicken a cheese-based dessert and four cheese Doria — a gratin-like rice dish popular in Japan.

The Party Barrel is on sale for JPY 4480 or USD 33. Several cheaper options are available including one which contains barbecue chicken and is priced at JPY 1980 or $14.50.

Beyond The Colonel: The popularity of eating fried chicken is now well-established in Japan. So popular is the dish that it is promoted during the winter holiday season in convenience stores and by other restaurant chains for those who can’t or couldn’t be bothered to queue up at Colonel Harland Sanders’ doorsteps.

You could even give a loved one the gift of crispy deep-fried chicken this season thanks to LINE — a super app that is popular in the country.

The consumer discretionary sector is down about 37% for the year. Companies in this sector tend to suffer during times of economic downturn since consumers prioritize paying for necessities such as rent or food over discretionary purchases when their budgets are tight.

But ""while most consumer discretionary stocks have been horrendous this year we've had some pools of strength too and many of them can work in 2023"" according to Cramer.

Here are his picks:

Genuine Parts  O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone

Cramer highlighted these three auto parts stocks as potential buys stating that AutoZone is his favorite. With used car prices coming down and new car prices likely to follow consumers are more likely to fix up their old car next year than purchase a new one he reasoned.

Ulta Beauty

While the company reported a solid earnings beat and boosted its outlook earlier this month investors shouldn't be greedy with the stock especially if it sees a big gain Cramer advised.

TJX Companies

The parent company of T.J. Maxx Marshalls and HomeGoods will benefit from the excess inventory the holidays will leave behind he said. He added that because TJX operates discount retailers its stock is a winner during times of recession when consumers tend to trade down.

Yum! Brands

Cramer called the parent company of KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut a great value proposition for consumers.

Starbucks

He said he expects Starbucks to make a powerful comeback in China once the company's economy fully reopens.

Earlier this month Spanish restaurant operator AmRest agreed to sell its KFC restaurant business in Russia to Almira a Russian restaurant and entertainment company.

The deal consideration was at least €100m ($104.48m).

AmRest initiated the process in March this year after KFC and Pizza Hut brands owner Yum! Brands decided to exit the Russian market following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

AmRest has been operating in the Russian market since 2007. At present it operates 215 restaurants. Meanwhile in October this year KFC introduced all-digital KFC Smart Restaurants across India starting with the cities of Hyderabad Gurgaon Chennai as well as Bengaluru."
ZBRA,Zebra Technologies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h6aW5lLmV1L2Jsb2dzL2luZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLzk3OTQ5L2Ftci10aGUtYXV0b25vbW91cy1yb2JvdC1pbi10aGUtd2FyZWhvdXNlLWFsb25nc2lkZS10aGUtZW1wbG95ZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMR: the autonomous robot in the warehouse alongside the employee,"In warehouses optimizations for more efficient and faster work are often welcome. This can be done by refining existing work processes or replacing used tools but also by deploying modern robots if this is not already being done. Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are trying to set a standard in this area by being better than the somewhat better-known Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). We visited Zebra Technologies to get some more insight into the warehouse worker’s handy little helper.

Not everyone will immediately see the match between Zebra Technologies and robots. After all the company is known to many from scanners and mobile computers. However the goal of all Zebra technology is to support front-line workers including in the warehouse. To offer more in these environments than the software and equipment Zebra Technologies already had it acquired Fetch Robotics in the summer of 2021. It thus added several AMRs to its product offering to further automate warehouses. This by letting robots take over tasks that employees don’t really want to do. That way it gets the best out of employees is the idea.

From AGVs to AMRs

Autonomous Mobile Robots are different from Automated Guided Vehicles. In many cases the latter category of machines is already present in warehouses. AGVs like AMRs can be used to move goods. What an AGV does differently is that it follows a configured route for which it uses wiring for example. This is the “guided” part of the machine. It allows the machine to follow only the configured route. If there are no obstacles this obviously works fine.

AMRs however are smarter than AGVs. These robots have a map of the warehouse in which they operate. When instructed to deliver goods at a certain point they determine the best route for themselves. Obstacle do not cause the robot to come to a complete stop to wait for the obstacle to be moved. They navigate around a moving or stationary object to still get to the end point. If necessary they may take an entire detour between other racks to do so. The AMR will use allowable zones and no-go zones though when properly set up in advance.

Basically this brings us to the fundamental difference between AGVs and AMR. Still what is striking about the robots we see is how the employees in the Zebra warehouse handle the machines. They find it all pretty straightforward. When they want to use the AMR to move goods they can easily give the instructions. Zebra Technologies will no doubt insist on using its own technology a lot and correctly in its own warehouse but it does show that AMRs are robots that a large group of workers can handle.

Making work more pleasant

According to Marcel Kars VP of Robotics Automation at Zebra Technologies AMRs in a warehouse can ultimately provide many benefits. He cites an example that an employee in a less automated warehouse walks 15 kilometers a day sometimes for much of the time with heavy items. That can be physically demanding as well as taking up a lot of time. If you can automate much of that away with robots Zebra Technologies sees a happier employee emerging. The employee can focus more on primary tasks. Or the higher-value tasks as Zebra Technologies describes them. Think of repairing and replacing broken packaging and products. People are simply still needed for such tasks. Right now as far as we can see there are no fully covering robots for such high-value tasks.

So what Zebra Technologies is trying to do with the acquired Fetch Robotics machines is take over work that robots can perform. According to Kars that also removes some errors as the robots perform repetitive work flawlessly. The theory is that workers are prone to errors in repetitive tasks. Eliminating those errors combined with saving time and allowing workers to perform more attractive tasks make the investment a no-brainer in Kars’ view.

Setting up the environment incrementally

Kars points out that warehouses can feel free to roll out robots incrementally getting a little more efficient each time. For example they can start with a small robot with a roller conveyor for conveying tasks. Such a robot can be used for loading and unloading and help with rush orders. Ultimately that can get companies excited and possibly encourage them to purchase other robots. For example Zebra Technologies also has AMRs that can be used to move racks or very heavy pallets. The image below gives an idea of the different Fetch Robotics AMRs.

The above robots show the diverse use cases of AMRs. According to Zebra Technologies you’re really going to see more efficiency down the line by making them part of your existing investments in ‘intelligent automation’. This is where the company sees an advantage by pairing with the somewhat more traditional Zebra tools. For example handheld scanners and tablets provide visibility of inventory in the warehouse to simplify management. Linking AMRs to that information and linking the information from AMRs to traditional Zebra tools can create some additional visibility and achieve automation.

More efficient through AMRs

It should be clear that AMRs aim to be a handy aid to the warehouse worker. With current market conditions like a labor shortage and faltering supply chain that extra help is a good investment as far as Zebra Technologies is concerned. But even when such problems disappear AMRs can provide a desired efficiency boost. Fearing that they will completely automate warehouse work is not necessary because high-value tasks will still require people. It is a combination of people and technology that Zebra Technologies says the world is really looking to for added efficiency.

The 20-year-old who hails from Manchester MI had conquered not only her and her horse’s first 3*-L competition but also a severe form of cancer.

This time last year Jordan was undergoing chemotherapy and unable to ride.

The story begins in the spring of 2021 when Jordan was training in Aiken preparing for the upcoming season. It was then that she noticed a swollen lymph node in her neck and soon found another one next to her throat that seemed to be growing. Jordan’s farrier Dawn Rammage also a nurse who works on an infusion floor for cancer patients recommended that she get it checked out.

A biopsy revealed cancer cells but the doctors could not determine the source of the cancer. Jordan subsequently underwent multiple CT scans PET scans and an MRI which showed nodules on her lungs and behind her nose. It was Nasopharyngeal cancer which is not at all common in her age bracket. The cancer tends to affect elderly men who smoke heavily but somehow Jordan had gotten it.

“It would have spread to my lungs next and that was pretty terrifying because they said it was not really curable if it spread to my lungs” Jordan explained.

The doctors instructed her to start treatment as soon as she could. But there was one thing she wanted to do before starting treatment: she wanted to run a 3* with her longtime partner Redemption Song. That she did finishing just outside of the top ten at the Hagyard Midsouth 3*-S in October of 2021.

Then it was time to tackle the cancer. “Before I started my treatments I reached out to Jess Halliday and she gave me really good advice” Jordan said. The much-loved late Jess Halliday known for her advocacy apparel line Buck Off Cancer passed away from colon cancer in October 2021. “I didn’t know Jess but I had heard her podcast on Major League Eventing.” Ever-generous Jess spoke with Jordan about the challenges of cancer treatments and how hard it is to spend time on the sidelines.

“I can’t let this define me.” Jordan told herself this and that she would get through the cancer treatments. She and her family kept positive attitudes throughout the process. She did three rounds of chemotherapy had one month off and then seven more weeks of chemo and radiation. These weeks were intense: the treatments happened five days per week for seven weeks straight. This started before Christmas of 2021 and continued through the spring of 2022.

“I would just think about the hospital and get sick” Jordan explained. She developed association sickness particularly because of the manner in which the treatments were done. Because the cancer was behind her nose she had to lie on a table and wear a mask that was bolted to the table through which the radiation was administered. “It really made me have a good mental game to stay strong through that.”

She said that she felt okay physically but the treatments made her exhausted. “By the end of the treatments I could hardly do anything I was so weak.” She spent the majority of her time resting.

There was another challenge to undergoing such intense cancer treatments: Jordan could not ride. Her friend Kristen Rozycki agreed to take Redemption Song (known in the barn as “Breezy”) on for a while down in Aiken to keep her going. “I had never been away from this horse for longer than a week” she explains.

Indeed Jordan’s whole life had been consumed with horses. “I grew up helping out with beginner lessons and my mother’s horse camps” she explains. She and her mother Amy Riske buy young horses and train them up the levels which is how she ended up with Breezy. They also have a small breeding program with several thoroughbred mares and a warmblood stallion. She has also been awarded her traditional A rating from Huron Valley Pony Club in the Great Lakes Region. Thus a disease that pulled her away from the horse world was difficult.

Jordan finished treatments on March 11 2022. “My birthday was March 14 so that was an amazing birthday present.” Soon after that she went down to Aiken to pick up Breezy from Kristen. She recalls having a jumping lesson and feeling like she could get right back into action. Her doctor approved but he was surprised that she had so much energy so soon after the treatments.

Jordan and Breezy competed at River Glen in the Intermediate/Prelim six weeks after her final cancer treatment. She then groomed for her coach Robin at the Lexington 4*-S at the end of April.

In May Jordan went in for another PET scan from which there were still some found to be spots of cancer evident but in August she had a clean PET scan. She was cancer-free and is now in remission. She’ll continue to have scans done regularly given the increased risk of recurrence.

Still Jordan is not slowing down. If anything she seems to be putting down the accelerator. Having recently finished her Associate’s degree in Business Administration at Washtenaw Community College she is hoping to transfer next spring to Eastern Michigan University. Alongside her studies she works for 4* rider Robin Walker who spends the winters in Ocala. She is also hoping to move up to the Advanced level next year with Redemption Song.

“She absolutely loves her job she will jump the moon for me” Jordan smiles as she describes her now-3* horse whom she purchased for $1800 in Indiana when she herself was only 14 years old. “She was the first horse that I bought myself” she explains adding that they have had a few bumps along the way including a broken splint bone and an old injury to the SI ligament. It seems that both of them are fighters.

At Tryon Jordan and Breezy came out on top of the young rider 3* division and her combined team of Areas V and VIII also won the team competition.

If you had told her a year ago that she would have produced such a great result in Tryon Jordan would have smiled humbly but I think that she would have believed you. She’s the kind that has the self-belief to make it happen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9mZmFseWV4cHJlc3MuaWUvbmV3cy90dWxsYW1vcmUtdHJpYnVuZS85OTU2MTAvbmV3LWpvYnMtdG8tYmUtY3JlYXRlZC1hcy1vZmZhbHktZmlybS1wbGFucy1tYWpvci1leHBhbnNpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New jobs to be created as Offaly firm plans major expansion,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.offalyexpress.ie', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/tullamore-tribune/995610/new-jobs-to-be-created-as-offaly-firm-plans-major-expansion.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002122592ACE0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9mZmFseWV4cHJlc3MuaWUvbmV3cy90dWxsYW1vcmUtdHJpYnVuZS85OTU2MTAvbmV3LWpvYnMtdG8tYmUtY3JlYXRlZC1hcy1vZmZhbHktZmlybS1wbGFucy1tYWpvci1leHBhbnNpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,
