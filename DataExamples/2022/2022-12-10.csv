Ramesh Ramadurai MD 3M India spoke to businessline about the company’s growth opportunities in the automotive and infrastructure segments as 3M India continues to report strong performance especially in the last two quarters.

All the segments are on a growth trajectory with the safety and industrial business group and the transportation and electronics business group making 71 per cent of its sales healthcare -17 per cent and consumer -12 per cent he added. In FY22 it posted revenues of ₹3335.84 crore and its PAT was ₹271.97 crore. Edited Excerpts:

Total demand for EVs in the country India could grow at a CAGR of 39 per cent in 10 years

Q What are the present business conditions and future prospects for 3M India?

The last two quarters have been quite good for 3M’s business. Of the 16 quarters in the last four years plus two quarters of this year the last two quarters have been the best in terms of revenue. In Q1 and Q2 FY23 we generated ₹943.59 crore and ₹976.69 crore respectively. We recorded growth of 16 per cent along with improving PBT (profit before tax).

Transportation and electronics have grown well due to the growth in the automotive business. Last year automotive production was around 3.5–3.6 million units; this year production is going well and is estimated to pass the 4 million mark. Moreover the mix of SUVs has increased substantially. Such model mix changes have led to greater penetration opportunities. Also some of our newer products have also gained traction.

Additionally we have launched new technology in the acoustics portfolio for automotive OEMs such as products for reducing noise inside the cabin. These products will have a good play in the electric vehicle segment as well. In our EV portfolio we produce thermal management systems that go in the batteries and we expect thermal runaway to be our major concern in this space. Another opportunity for us lies in the interior of the cars—the dashboard or cockpit.

Q What are the opportunities in the next couple of years in the Indian market?

3M as a differentiated solution provider is focused on scaling opportunities – most of our products have a level of differentiation or premiumization and would be focused in the same area. With a greater emphasis on the PLI scheme infrastructure is another opportunity for us. A lot of 3M’s product portfolio is around safety including road safety safety at airports railway stations and more.

Q What is 3M’s manufacturing footprint in the country?

We are well-placed in terms of having the capacity to grow. Our manufactured products are a combination of both mostly in-house and a relatively small part through contract manufacturing.

3M has three factories in India - Bangalore- focused on the automotive sector Ahmedabad – for developing corrosion protection products targeted mostly towards the oil and gas industry and Pune factory is more like a multi-product development factory – with a focus on healthcare specialized products including respirator production sanitisers new investment is being done for ceramic materials for 3M’ catalytic converters too.

Q How is 3M’s R&D centre in India contributing to the science and innovation ecosystem?

We have a team of 100 engineers in our R&D Center working on a combination of application development application engineering and product development with a primary focus on the Indian market. We have prioritized some areas to direct our local teams for product development such as traffic safety different kinds of road furniture and locally developed products for electrical markets because we work with power utilities distribution centres and so on. Similarly a lot of the automotive aftermarket division is locally developed. We also leverage some of the global technology and capabilities for product development the products also undergo local variations because the application conditions differ in segments such as healthcare and personal safety including regulated products.

Some amount of research work for global projects is done in India. Moreover 3M also tracks invention submissions internally which contributes to the decision of whether to patent a product or not – these are internal metrics that help us to keep up the technical team’s energy and momentum of product development. The patents issued invention submissions papers written and published and the participation of engineers in external forums collaboratively create a culture of continuous energy and innovation.

Q What is the size of your export business?

It is a relatively small segment. We export some of our car care products mostly to West Asia and Southeast Asia. We also have our pipe coating products for the oil and gas industry which are exported depending on the project.

Q Apart from the state entity does 3M have any other operating companies in India?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtdHJpZXMtbmV3LXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy10by1yZW1vdmUtZm9yZXZlci1jaGVtaWNhbHMtZnJvbS13YXRlci82MDAyMzQ3NTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota tries new technologies to remove 'forever chemicals' from water,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtdHJpZXMtbmV3LXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy10by1yZW1vdmUtZm9yZXZlci1jaGVtaWNhbHMtZnJvbS13YXRlci82MDAyMzQ3NTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E194610>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

On last week’s episode (December 7) of the show The Long Beach rapper had a guest starring role as Maurice one of Gregory’s (Tyler James Williams) homeboys who had an instant connection with Janine played by show creator and star Quinta Brunson.

Although Gregory has been trying to make moves on Janine and their chemistry is undeniable the two remain just friends. The appearance of Vince has sent fans into a frenzy with anticipation of him making more cameos after the show returns from its winter hiatus.

Over the summer Staples responded to one of Brunson’s tweets about why he would be a perfect fit to make a cameo on a show that he’s such a big fan of.

“You was supposed to cast me in Abbot” he tweeted.

Brunson wrote back “Would like to see it.”

You was supposed to cast me in Abbot — vince (@vincestaples) July 24 2022

Currently in its second season Abbott Elementary which chronicles the ups and downs of a public school in Philadelphia has quickly become a fan-favorite and has earned critical acclaim. For the first season of the show it was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards winning three including Outstanding Writing For a Comedy Series.

Over the last few years Staples has been steadily building his resume as an up-and-coming actor. Recently it was announced that he would join Jack Harlow as co-stars in the reboot of the 90s classic White Men Can’t Jump.

Also Staples landed a lead role in the upcoming Showtime series The Wood according to Variety. The series is based on the 1999 coming-of-age film of the same name.

Staples is slated to play Jamal portraying “an aspiring photographer from Ladera Heights who has been cut off by his upper-class family when he decided to follow his own path instead of going to historic Morehouse College.”

On the music side of things Staples had a lot to say about the industry in an appearance on Juan Ep Is Life with Cipha Sounds and Peter Rosenberg. During the convo Staples accused record labels of capitalizing on catalogs of deceased rappers and finding “money in the violence.”

Abbott’s reversal on fentanyl testing strips is good public policy,"In the unforgiving world of politics changing your mind about something is often treated as a sin. Reversals are described pejoratively as flip-flops. Depending on whom you ask they’re signs of fickleness gestures of political opportunism or traitorous concessions to the opposition.

We don’t know what spurred Gov. Greg Abbott to change his stance on decriminalizing fentanyl testing strips but we’re less engrossed in his motives than we are in the good that will come from his decision. The governor’s support for legalizing fentanyl testing strips which he recently announced would make it easier to pass a bill to that effect in 2023.

Fentanyl testing strips work like pregnancy tests. A paper strip is dipped in water that contains drug residue to detect whether fentanyl is mixed into the drug.

These strips cost about $1 each and can save lives. But they’re illegal in Texas where they are considered drug paraphernalia and their possession can lead to a $500 fine.

Every drug overdose is a tragedy. Compounding those tragedies is the fact that many of the people dying from a fentanyl overdose don’t even know they’ve taken it.

Illicit drug makers are lacing fentanyl a potent synthetic opioid into street drugs and counterfeit medication sold across the U.S. The compound is much cheaper to make than other drugs and more powerful — 50 times stronger than heroin for example. Drug makers can use fentanyl to “cut” or dilute those other drugs preserving the potency and boosting their profits.

It doesn’t take much fentanyl to kill. About 2 milligrams — picture two grains of rice — would be lethal to most people.

Fentanyl overdoses have become a national crisis with families losing children and caregivers to the hidden opioid. The numbers in Texas alone pack a punch. According to state statistics there were more than 1600 unintentional fentanyl-related deaths in 2021 double the number from the previous year and a jump from about 200 such deaths four years ago.

Last year state Rep. Jasmine Crockett D-Dallas filed a bill to decriminalize all drug paraphernalia including fentanyl testing strips. Legalizing every apparatus designed to support illegal drug use is not a good idea. But we’re optimistic that a narrower bill authored by state Rep. James Talarico D-Round Rock that focuses on legalizing fentanyl testing strips will be considered by the full Legislature next year.

We’re also encouraged by Abbott’s outspokenness in favor of making naloxone — a drug to reverse an opioid overdose — more widely available.

It’s the job of state and federal officials to go after criminal organizations and disrupt the illegal drug trade. But they also must be proactive about saving lives already snared by addiction.

Lunsumio or mosunetuzumab triggered a response in 77.8% of patients with follicular lymphoma who had previously tried at least two prior therapies and 60% of patients saw no sign of cancer. The median duration of response and duration of complete response weren’t reached at the data cutoff.

The data came from a longer median 27-month follow-up of a phase 1/2 trial. Roche previously used an earlier evaluation of the study to win a global-first approval for Lunsumio in Europe and for an FDA application that bears a target decision date for Dec. 29.

The FDA wanted more follow-up data than their counterparts did at the European Medicines Agency hence the later ruling Ginna Laport M.D. global head of lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia clinical development at Roche’s Genentech said in an interview with Fierce Pharma. The FDA wanted additional patient survival data and to make sure no late side effects emerge over the long term she explained.

The FDA application includes data after a median follow-up of 18.3 months which showed an 80% tumor response rate and 60% complete response rate. By investigators' estimates 79.5% of complete responders continued to have their tumor in check for at least two years and 51.4% of patients would be alive without disease progression after two years.

The tale of two CD20 bispecifics

The company is also working on a subcutaneous version of mosunetuzumab for convenience and safety reasons Laport noted. The under-the-skin formulation triggered a similar 82% response rate and a 62% complete response rate in a group of patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma according to data shared at ASH 2022.

The subcutaneous version appears to come with better safety; investigators recorded 27% of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) cases across patients with follicular lymphoma and aggressive lymphomas and they were all below grade 3. As for infused Lunsumio the updated analysis of the phase 1/2 trial showed a 44.4% CRS rate and grade 3 or above cases were reported.

Lunsumio represents the first CD20xCD3 T-cell engager approved anywhere. It works by latching onto the CD20 marker on malignant B cells and the CD3 protein on T cells to bring the killer immune cells closer to neutralize the cancerous cell.

Roche has another CD20 bispecific glofitamab which has arrived at the FDA and the EMA for evaluation in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In a group of patients with heavily pretreated LBCL 74% of patients who had seen no sign of tumor at the end of treatment remained in complete remission after a median follow-up of 18.1 months according to data shared at ASH 2022. One of 44 patients who had at least 12 months of post-treatment follow-up experienced disease progression.

Glofitamab’s off-treatment progression rate looks “particularly encouraging” and was “rarely observed” in this treatment-experienced patient population the trial investigators noted in an abstract. But they also cautioned that longer follow-up is needed to confirm the durability of glofitamab’s ability to maintain cancer eradication.

Roche isn’t prioritizing either one of the two CD20 bispecifics but is directing them at different diseases Laport said. The company is developing Lunsumio for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma because it offers “more outpatient flexibility” including a relatively lower CRS rate Laport said. Glofitamab the more potent and less tolerable agent of the two is being developed in aggressive lymphomas.

Upcoming competitions

The Roche products while in the lead so far in terms of regulatory progress could face some competition from other CD20 T-cell engagers especially ones from Regeneron and a partnership between AbbVie and Genmab.

At ASH 2022 Regeneron reported for the first time data from a higher 160mg weekly dosing of its CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody odronextamab from the pivotal ELM-2 study. In 130 patients who had failed at least two prior lines of therapy odronextamab shrank tumors in 49.2% of patients and cleared out signs of cancer in 30.8% after a median follow-up of 21.3 months. After investigators adopted a regimen gradually stepping up treatment dosage no grade 3 or above CRS events occurred. But five treatment-related deaths occurred because of other conditions including COVID pneumonia and Pseudomonas sepsis.

For glofitamab the Roche drug had previously shown an overall response rate of 51.6% and a complete response rate of 39.4% after following a pivotal phase 2 study for a median 12.6 months. CRS occurred in 63% of patients including combined 3.9% of grade 3 and 4 events.

RELATED: Chasing Roche AbbVie posts data on CD20 blood cancer bispecific ahead of race to regulators

Meanwhile AbbVie and Genmab are testing subcutaneous epcoritamab across different lymphoma types. At ASH 2022 the pair unveiled initial early-phase results for a combination pairing epcoritamab with Rituxan and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Revlimid or R2 in newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma. Among 29 efficacy-evaluable patients the combo posted a 90% response rate.

Fixed-duration treatment is a key selling point that Roche thinks could differentiate its bispecifics from the others Laport said. While other candidates are given until progression a fixed-duration therapy gives patients longer treatment intervals and could potentially reduce the probability of long-term side effects and improve the overall patient experience she said.

In DLBCL Roche is waiting for an FDA decision for CD97b-targeted antibody-drug conjugate Polivy in combination with the R-CHP regimen in newly diagnosed patients. Roche plans to launch a phase 3 trial “in the near future” to combine glofitamab with the Polivy-R-CHP cocktail in frontline DLBCL Laport said.

In the latest coup law firm Crowell & Moring just signed for 71000 square feet at Two Manhattan West where it will move next year from a slightly smaller space at 590 Madison Ave.

The deal reaffirms the phenomenon of companies ankling to newly constructed buildings from older ones — including from those that opened as recently as the 1980s such as still desirable 590 Madison Ave.

Corporate relocations cost a bundle even when landlords give concessions and they disrupt operations. The fact that so many tenants are willing to do it shows how powerful the trend is.



Two Manhattan West’s 1.9 million square feet are already 76% spoken for. Cravath Swaine & Moore signed on as anchor tenant a few years ago when the site was a hole in the ground and was later joined by Clifford Chance and KPMG.

The tower will open in the spring when coincidentally the new High Line Moynihan Connector is to be completed that will link the elevated park to Manhattan West’s public plaza.

The move west is “not simply about moving to a bigger space but to a better space” said Crowell’s New York managing partner Glen McGorty. “We can operate more efficiently. Rather than fill our corner offices with partners we have designed cutting-edge multi-purpose space where lawyers and staff can connect” to better serve clients.

Two Manhattan West is the final jewel in the crown of Brookfield’s eight-acre complex just east of Related’s Hudson Yards. It also includes One Manhattan West (nearly 100% leased to EY the NHL and Accenture) the Pendry Hotel and apartment tower The Eugene.

Brookfield can boast of scoring three of the year’s five largest Manhattan leases and five of the largest 10 deals to date.

A dobe is increasingly becoming known however as one of the great digital grifters of the modern age.

From its shonky subscription models to making people pay for certain colours in PhotoShop (which is also Pantone’s doing in a “jointly” made decision ) the company is like so many others in these tumultuous times more concerned with growing its bottom line no matter the cost than it is in taking a moment to consider the needs of its users or the consequences of its actions.

I’m bringing this up today because a week after forcing people to check they weren’t reading an Onion story when learning about the colours thing the company has announced that it is embracing AI art. This i s not only an enormous grift but also a serious threat to the livelihoods of artists around the world big and small.

I’ve made my feelings about AI very clear on this website already—I wrote this feature back in August interviewing a range of video game and entertainment industry artists—and think it sucks not just because it’s a threat to artists but to art. While people’s jobs are of course important we’re not just talking about cotton gins here and how this is in many ways a labour v capital breakdown; we’re talking about a process that is encroaching on a fundamentally human pastime and creative pursuit.

Machines don’t make art. They’re machines! They’re just making an approximated casserole out of human art that has been fed into it in the vast amount of cases without credit or compensation. As Dan Sheehan says in his fantastic piece Art In The Age Of Optimization it’s merely “a technology that clearly exists to remove the human element from the process of artistic expression. ”

Anyway! Last week Adobe dropped an announcement saying that AI-generated art was going to be made available as part of the company’s vast library of stock images going so far as to say the field is “amplifying human creativity. ” The company boldly says repeatedly stuff like they have “deeply considered these questions and implemented a new submission policy that we believe will ensure our content uses AI technology responsibly by creators and customers alike ” and that “generative AI is a major leap forward for creators leveraging machine learning’s incredible power to ideate faster by developing imagery using words sketches and gestures. ”

Creators? Fuck off! These people aren’t creating anything! They’re punching words into a computer that has been fed actual art! And even if Adobe can as they’re claiming only release images that have been “properly built used and disclosed ” it still sucks! Gah! Attempting to make good on one of AI art’s issues—art theft—doesn’t absolve it from its others like the fact nothing to do with these images or their creation has anything to do with art!

Reaction among artists has of course been as wildly negative as any other AI art announcement over the past six months with some criticising the company while others resort to more traditional cries encouraging people to seek out alternatives to Adobe’s products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYWRvYmUtYXVkaXRpb24taG93LXRvLWZpeC1xdWlldC1hdWRpby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Fix Quiet Audio in Adobe Audition: 4 Ways,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.makeuseof.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /adobe-audition-how-to-fix-quiet-audio/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00F343A30>, 'Connection to www.makeuseof.com timed out.

It can literally turn ideas into reality but is it good enough to create motion graphics in Adobe’s After Effects?

In case you’re unfamiliar OpenAI recently released a chat bot. It’s based on their “large language” AI modeling and has deservedly gotten a lot of hype. It’s able to convincingly write college essays instruction manuals and produce code.

Now even though it’s not built to create imagery it can still turn your normal language into JavaScript code that After Effects understands. This could be an incredible tool for motion graphic artists who struggle with expressions. The best part is that ChatGPT also explains what each part of the code means and how to customize it — far better than scrolling through Creative Cow forums.

Testing the Basics

The “Wiggle” expression in After Effects is extremely common. This was the first test I did and it didn’t work. That’s because ChatGPT confidently gave me the incorrect answer and the code was broken. Ok so you might not trust this with your client’s most important project right now.

However hitting the “try again” button and rewriting my question got things moving. This is a common issue with AI modeling and it’s what has led to the first ever hire of a “prompt engineer” at Scale AI this week.

After a few minutes of trial and error we had our wiggle function. Now we can move forward to make more interesting things.

The dots are being animated with a ""wiggle"" function and controlled by random frequency and amplitude. The JavaScript expression was provided by ChatGPT.

Testing the Complex

These are the prompts I used and the results that I was able to create in After Effects. Sometimes I’ve used the customizable parameters to make the animation more pleasing.

Can you create an Adobe After Effects expression that blurs a shape layer when it’s position is in the right half of the composition using the Gaussian Blur effect

Can you create an Adobe After Effects expression that places a blinking cursor at the end of a text field

Can you write out an Adobe After Effects expression to make a shape layer wiggle when a null object is within 50 pixels of the shape's anchor point

Can you create an Adobe After Effects expression that rotates a shape layer around it’s anchor point with a radius of 100 pixels

More to Explore

I tried getting a JSX script out of ChatGPT which unfortunately didn’t work. This would be the obvious evolution of this idea. The After Effects expression engine is powerful but it’s also limited by the parameters you’re trying to change. You can’t create new objects nor affect multiple objects at once like a script would be able to do.

ChatGPT launched on wednesday. today it crossed 1 million users! — Sam Altman (@sama) December 5 2022

Whether I figure out the scripting issues or not though this is still a powerful tool. I’m absolutely stunned at its logical approach to my organic language.

Chip giant Intel (INTC -0.80%) made a critical error as it prepared its Arc graphics cards for launch earlier this year. The company tried to use the software drivers from its integrated graphics products as the foundation for the drivers for the new cards a move that made sense in theory. Why start from scratch if you don't have to?

Intel learned the answer to that question the hard way: Those integrated graphics drivers were incapable of delivering adequate performance for a discrete graphics card. The company was forced to drop its target of shipping 4 million units this year as the resultant software issues delayed the launches of its Arc 750 and Arc 770 graphics cards.

For the launch Intel focused on making sure the Arc cards performed well on modern games using the latest graphics application programming interfaces (APIs). It was largely successful: Reviewers at Tom's Hardware found the Arc 770 handily outperformed NVIDIA's RTX 3060 on average. The problem was that the performance in individual games was erratic.

Graphics drivers are complicated pieces of software and individual games often need specific optimizations. That's an area where Intel had a lot of catching up to do when its Arc graphics cards launched in October. The cards performed well across many modern titles but had problems with older titles.

Making progress

Providing acceptable performance with older video games is important particularly for a mid-range graphics card like the Arc 770. Games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are still wildly popular often topping the list of most-played games on Steam. These games run on older versions of DirectX a popular API and are a weak spot for Intel's graphics cards.

But Intel is plugging away at its graphics drivers and making some real progress. The latest release from Intel delivers huge performance gains for older titles using DirectX 9. As reported by Tom's Hardware the new driver increases average frame rates by as much as 80% in games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive League of Legends and StarCraft 2. It also makes gameplay smoother overall by minimizing jarring frame-rate drops.

Poor performance in older games was likely a sticking point for many gamers who were considering jumping over to Intel. It still has more work to do but the chipmaker is making good progress at eliminating the main disadvantage of its Arc graphics cards.

A multibillion-dollar opportunity

There's no good reason why Intel can't establish itself as a major player in the graphics card market. Its debut Arc cards are good products that were held back a bit by immature software and that is a situation that will be remedied over time. Intel has proved capable of putting out solid hardware at least for the mid-range segment of the gaming market.

Jon Peddie Research estimates that the graphics card market will be worth $39 billion a year by 2026 and it expects Intel's entry into that market to ultimately boost overall unit shipments of these cards next year. The graphics card market right now is in turmoil driven by bloated inventories and sluggish demand. But Jon Peddie Research expects this to be a growth market in the long run.

Intel has one advantage over rivals Nvidia and AMD: It can pick and choose which chips it manufactures itself and which chips it outsources to third-party foundries. The first batch of Intel's Arc graphics chips was manufactured by TSMC using its N6 (6 nm) process node ensuring they provide enough performance and efficiency to go toe-to-toe with the competition. If Intel can regain its lead in manufacturing in the coming years it could ultimately shift production in-house and realize meaningful cost and performance advantages.

While Intel's entry into the graphics card market was a bit messy the company should not be underestimated. Intel is fixing the software problems that are holding it back and both Nvidia and AMD should prepare themselves for a more competitive graphics card market in the years ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oZXJlcy1yZWFzb24td2h5LWJyaXRuZXktZ3JpbmVyLTIyMzQ0NTgwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's The Reason Why Britney Griner Cut Her Locs And When She Actually Made The Change,"After returning home from Russia Brittney Griner has a new look due to conditions behind bars in Russia.

Her hair started freezing due to the cold temperatures which caused pain. Instead of feeling tortured all winter she cut her hair off almost two weeks ago.

“It’s very cold in there and every time she washed her hair she got cold and would get a chill” Blagovolina said. “She should have waited until New Year’s Day.”

Fans have witnessed Griner’s hair transformation over the years since it takes time to grow locs. Cutting her hair off was likely a tough decision.

The 32-year-old left Russia elated on Thursday to finally head home after being detained for several months.

According to TMZ she told one person on the plane that she was “happy” and in good spirits.

U.S. official John Kirby said Friday that after Griner landed in San Antonio she seem to be in a healthy state.

""Tonight's [LaBelle] show at the Riverside Theater has been postponed following a bomb threat investigated by the Milwaukee Police Department"" the organizer tweeted early Sunday morning. ""We are thankful for the efforts of the Milwaukee Police Department and our customers and staff for their safe and orderly exit.""

The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) as well as a rep for LaBelle did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

Journal Sentinel reporter Drake Bentley shared a message from MPD on Twitter shortly after the concert Saturday night which explained that ""all patrons"" had been safely evacuated from the venue. ""Police are clearing the facility at this time"" the message continued. ""The investigation is fluid and ongoing.""

According to Milwaukee Police Capt. Warren E. Allen Jr. per the Journal Sentinel the Riverside Theater ""was searched by K9 units"" and ""no explosive devices were discovered.""

""There is no threat to the public at this time"" he added to the publication.

Adrienne Crossley a journalist who attended the show with family tweeted her first-hand account of events after the venue got evacuated.

""Now that I'm safely at home... A bomb threat at a Patti LaBelle concert really"" Crossley wrote. ""I was having a lovely night with my parents getting to cross seeing Ms. Patti off my bucket list and then it all went left. This is just sad.""

Additionally concertgoer Catherine Brunson told the Journal Sentinel that the event ended barely two songs into LaBelle's set just before 9:30 p.m local time when she said the venue was at its capacity of 2500 people.

""Somebody got on a microphone and said we have to evacuate the building because there was a bomb threat"" Brunson said. ""We came out and police had the block taped off. ...

Advocates for people with prior convictions say the growth of background check companies will lead to more people being barred from sharing economy.

If a user gets an email saying they're banned from Airbnb because of something that appeared on their criminal background check they have a right to see the report.

Bethany Hallam has made no secret about her past struggles with drug addiction. She ran for her seat on the Allegheny County Council in Pennsylvania on a platform of improving the county's jail and public transportation system because she'd spent time in that jail and lost her driver's license for a time.

So she was confused in September when she attempted to book a short-term stay in Florida through Airbnb – something she'd successfully done many times in the last six years – only to have her reservation canceled and her account banned because of a past criminal conviction discovered on a background check.

NUMBER OF AIRBNB HOSTS SURGING:45% say extra income helps them stay in their homes

""My background has not changed since they claimed the policy went into effect"" she said. ""And I have booked with Airbnb dozens and dozens of times and never had a single problem.""

Hallam learned she wasn't alone. After posting about the incident on social media and being interviewed by a local news station she got messages from others who'd been banned by Airbnb and discovered the company it uses to run background checks Inflection has been sued numerous times for allegedly providing false information on consumer background reports.

How is Airbnb running background checks?

Airbnb began using Inflection to conduct background checks on hosts and guests in 2016 to ensure safety when someone is renting a home. Since then users have shared stories about being banned for minor offenses like having a dog off leash being mistaken for people with the same first and last name and having a felony on their report that was actually classified as a misdemeanor or pleaded down to one.

Airbnb's policy states that ""removal depends on the severity of the criminal history"" and ""lesser crimes like disorderly conduct or marijuana possession are not removable offenses."" Hallam's seven-year-old conviction was for drug possession.

The company also says it has ""a rigorous evidence-based approach to assess whether someone can be reinstated after removal."" But people who have sued say they attempted to fix the issue through the appeals process with no luck according to attorney Daniel Cohen of the firm Consumer Attorneys who's represented consumers against Inflection.

GUEST REVIEWS:Can a bad review from a vacation share host come back to bite you on your next trip?

""As part of our efforts to protect our community Airbnb runs standard criminal background checks for Hosts and guests in the U.S."" an Airbnb spokesperson told USA TODAY. ""We know that no background check system is perfect and so we continue to work with criminal justice experts academics advocates and our vendors to evolve our policy and appeals process to make it as effective and thoughtful as possible.""

Are background checks fair in this case?

Advocates for people with prior convictions and those formerly incarcerated say the proliferation of background check companies – using vast amounts of data available online to quickly run someone's history for everything from house and car rentals to babysitting and handyman services – means the detrimental impacts of even a minor conviction can follow people around forever and impact their ability to work and live where they want.

""A lot of times the legal record that is attached to their name that's something that happened in their past. And I get it you know there are certain legal records where people get squeamish… but these blanket bans don't make any sense"" said Jay Jordan CEO of the Alliance for Safety and Justice and founder of TimeDone.

""So pre-9/11 less than 40% to 50% of landlords were doing background checks. Post-9/11 the background screening industry exploded"" Jordan said. ""Now 4 out of 5 landlords do background checks. Nine out of 10 employers do background checks and these are blanket bans. Anything pops up there's no discretion.""

Companies that run background checks have to follow the Fair Credit Reporting Act which requires they ensure maximal maximum possible accuracy on any check of a person's reputation including credit checks and criminal background checks.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act also says consumers have the right to see what's in their report and be notified when information inside it is being used against them. That's why Airbnb must send out an email saying they banned you because of a criminal background check.

The law also says background check companies have a duty to investigate disputed information and cannot report negative information that is older than seven years old.

NEIGHBORS FIGHTING NEIGHBORS?:A 30-day minimum law for Airbnbs has Oahu homeowners split

""We are using data and it's just data about a person that is decades old that does not paint the picture of who people are today"" Jordan said.

His organization recently worked to pass California Senate Bill 731 which expands the state's automatic sealing of criminal records so more people can get a clean slate and access employment and housing opportunities.

""I don't fault the companies for saying this information is out there"" Jordan said. ""The fundamental problem is that when government doesn't give us guidelines on what rehabilitation means then you have the Airbnbs and the Care.com and the Nanny Lane and the Turos and the Ubers and the Lyfts and the property management companies basically saying well we're going to make our own determination because if we get sued then you know that's on us.""

He pointed to a 2006 study published in the Criminology & Public Policy journal that shows if a person is crime-free for more than five years after their sentence the risk of them committing another crime is the same as someone who's never committed one.

""So if we go by that standard that relieves some of the pressure from the sharing economy industries like Airbnb"" Jordan said.

Are these reports accurate?

Inflection says it follows the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The company has settled numerous lawsuits in recent years alleging it failed to ensure accuracy under that law including several brought on behalf of clients by the firm Consumer Attorneys.

Founding partner Daniel Cohen said these cases are typically settled without any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the background check company.

He said the most common scenarios he sees are people being mixed up with someone with the same first and last name crimes that were expunged showing up on the background check and crimes that were pleaded down to misdemeanors or otherwise changed to lesser offenses being reported as felonies on the background check.

""I personally would want Airbnb doing a background check on somebody before I let somebody stay in my home"" Cohen said. ""The problem is that the middleman that Airbnb is using the background check company Inflection and various other background check companies that they use are coming up with false reports.""

FALSE ARREST SETTLEMENT:Hertz agrees to pay $168 million to settle false arrest claims by hundreds of customers

He recently had clients who were trying to go to Napa Valley for their anniversary and the day before their trip Airbnb canceled their reservation and held the $3500 deposit.

""The client finally gets his background check report and he's being mixed up with somebody else entirely"" Cohen said. ""This person has a common name. But at the end of the day he only has one Social Security number (and) one date of birth.""

Cohen said expunged records showing up or the misclassifications of crimes can happen if the company running the background checks isn't able to get updated court records on a regular basis. Companies like Inflection typically buy records in bulk from vendors who may only be able to get updated records from some courthouses once a year or so Cohen said.

""We understand people's lives are affected by the results we deliver so we're committed to the highest standards of accuracy and fairness"" said David Patterson spokesperson for Checkr the parent company of Inflection. ""As a consumer reporting agency regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act we only report criminal records that have been filed in a court of law. We take any disputed inaccuracies seriously and promptly investigate and remediate these when appropriate.""

Are more companies going to start soliciting background checks?

With the sharing economy continuing to grow experts say the negative impacts of increased background checks will also rise.

""There's going to be consumer reports for everything and people are going to want instantaneous results"" Cohen said. ""It's really unfortunate what's happening now and I think it's only going to get worse.""

The Alliance for Safety and Justice estimated in 2020 that 78 million Americans have some sort of past crime on their record.

Jordan said this means background check laws and policies will continue to exclude more people from jobs housing and services unless more is done to address the problem.

Is Airbnb changing its policy?

Author and activist Marlon Peterson attempted to work with Airbnb to update its policies years ago after his own ban from the platform in 2018 prompted him to write a guest column for USA TODAY.

In it he explained how he booked accommodation in Washington D.C. through Airbnb because he was helping organize two busloads of youth from New York City for the March for Our Lives.

""I got an email telling me I was denied the place that I rented so I had to get a hotel room instead. And they had said that it was based on evidence found online or something like that"" Peterson said.

He knew it was easy to find out online that he'd spent 10 years in prison for his role in an armed robbery in which two people were killed – he's since written a book about his journey and frequently talks about it as part of his advocacy work.

""Now after years of healing and loving work I am confronted yet again with the cruel reality that society makes people like me keep paying for mistakes far beyond our prison term"" he wrote in 2018.

After his column ran the host of the ""DEcarcerated"" podcast said he was invited to meetings with Airbnb's Trust and Safety team along with members of organizations like the ACLU and prison reentry advocates. But he felt like those meetings were not productive he said.

""Nothing really changed except that they allowed me (back) onto the platform. I want to be clear like after when I was denied I never asked to be back on the platform I was just mad that this was happening and this is an issue"" Peterson said.

Does everyone with a criminal background face a ban from Airbnb?

Both Peterson and Hallam said they're confused by the inconsistency of who gets banned and who doesn't.

Peterson has a friend who has been renting out his house for years on Airbnb and has a prior conviction but has never had an issue with the background check.

Hallam was a host at one point in 2018. The same conviction that got her banned this year would have shown up on a background check then.

Airbnb's website says that if they have a valid first name last name and date of birth they will run a background check on all guests ""10 days before the check-in date of their reservation (or later in the case of bookings within 10 days of check-in)"" and all hosts ""when the Host logs in after creating a listing or when a stay or experience is booked – whichever comes first.""

The company said it reinstated both Hallam and Peterson's accounts which both individuals confirmed. Neither has used the site since their bans and both said they are more concerned about the people this is happening to who don't have ways to amplify their stories.

Hallam said she asked the company: ""Can you assure me that you're going to do the same review you did for me to everyone else who I've now found out has had similar experiences with Airbnb?"" She said she did not get an answer.

How to appeal an Airbnb ban

If a user gets an email saying they're banned from Airbnb because of something that appeared on their criminal background check they have a right to see the report that was generated by Inflection to ensure it's accurate.

The company will typically send a link to make that request or they can simply respond to the email asking for it.

If something is incorrect on the criminal background report they'll need to take that up with Inflection. Parent company Checkr has a web page on how to file a dispute.

Once the background report information is confirmed to be accurate they can file an appeal with Airbnb to get the account reinstated. They can also file an appeal if the information is correct but they feel it doesn't warrant a ban under Airbnb's policy. More information on the appeals process can be found in Airbnb's help center.

If a customer feels a background check company is not responding adequately to their dispute they can contact a lawyer to help with Fair Credit Reporting Act violations at no cost.

""The cool thing about this law is that you can hire a lawyer to fix this for you with zero out-of-pocket costs"" Cohen said. ""The Fair Credit Reporting Act says that any time that a lawyer spends on the case the lawyer gets to bill to the background check company.""

Kristie Wolfe is the creator behind some of the world's most outlandish Airbnbs from an underground hobbit hole in Washington to a hotel made from a six-ton concrete potato.

Her four listings cost between $200 and $400 a night and are fully booked multiple months to a year in advance. In an interview with Insider Wolfe described her journey from making $13 an hour as a factory worker to becoming one of the most popular hosts on the Airbnb app.

Despite the 14-hour shifts and low wages Wolfe speaks fondly of her time working at the potato factory in Boise Idaho. In fact she said the position was ranked second on her ""dream jobs"" list behind librarian.

""There was a lot of problem-solving involved"" she said. ""I just love efficiency and figuring out new ways to make something work and I got to do all of those things at that job.""

Wolfe's passion for efficiency also dominated in her life outside of work where she lived in a tiny home she described as a ""shack on wheels.""

Costing a total of $3000 she built the mobile structure on a tree farm with her mother as an ""experiment in minimalism"" she told Insider. After realizing the lifestyle came naturally to her Wolfe took it a step further and went entirely off the grid.

Without a mortgage or utilities to pay Wolfe said she was able to cut the costs in her life to ""nearly nothing"" while saving money for her next big project: a solar-powered tree house in Hawaii.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

When one enters the second floor of the Albemarle Music Store for the first time it can be a visual overload as around every turn there is so much that attracts the eye. There are around 18 to 20 model trains of all sizes and colors representing Amtrak Union Pacific and even North Pole Central among others along with tons of airplanes and lanterns hanging from the ceiling.

It is a wonderland for not just train enthusiasts but for people of all ages especially young children watching as the trains move along the 14 tracks for the first time.

“I just enjoy it because there are so many of them” said volunteer engineer Jimmie Cox who has always had a passion for model trains. “Every time I come up here I see something different — I see a different train. It’s hard to take it all in at one time.”

Cox is one of several volunteers who have operated the trains over the years especially during the Christmas season when hundreds of people come out to see the trains.

“The kids love them” he said. “Their eyes just brighten up — and the adults too.”

The vast collection of trains and other memorabilia including a landscape of downtown Albemarle with numerous recognizable model buildings such as the music store and the old Albemarle Hotel has been an integral part of the fabric of downtown Albemarle for more than 30 years. And it was all started by Albemarle native Jimmy Brown who passed away in 2010.

‘It is a labor of love’

James “Milt” Brown opened Albemarle Music Store nearly 100 years ago in 1925. It moved to its current location at 235 W. Main St. three years later. The business was eventually passed down to Brown’s son Jimmy an acclaimed saxophone player who played in venues across the Southeast.

It was not until the holiday season in 1990 when Jimmy Brown first thought about model trains as his young daughter Jennifer asked for one to move around the family’s Christmas tree. Brown purchased several HO scale trains which zoomed across the floor.

But he did not stop there. What started as a gift for his daughter turned into a passion as Brown accumulated more and more model trains many of them Lionel products.

“He just fell in love with them” said his wife Carole Brown.

Brown eventually housed his collection on the second floor of the music store. He built tables to house the tracks and little by little the room exploded with all sorts of model trains airplanes and lanterns. He purchased many of his trains from a distributor in Monroe while others were donated by people in the community.

“We closed on noon on Wednesdays and we went and got trains” Brown said noting that her husband eventually became a Lionel dealer.

Word quickly spread about the collection as local schools visited on field trips and starry-eyed children arrived with their parents. People also flocked to the store to purchase trains. At least 250 people visited the train collection during An Albemarle Downtown Christmas Dec. 2 Brown said which pales in comparison to more than a decade ago when as many as 2200 revelers lined up to see the trains.

With the help of volunteers such as Cox Tommy Aldridge Buddy Efird J.W. Lowder Lorrie Hatley and Bobby Ritchie Brown ran the trains for the public year-round every Friday and Saturday.

“It is a labor of love” Brown said. “A lot of people enjoy it and they come and help.”

For Cox who can spend several hours at a time operating the many trains it brings him back to when he was a kid.

“It takes you back to your childhood” he said.

Since her husband’s death Brown has continued maintaining the collection with help from the volunteers and has no plans to stop.

“I do it in memory of Jimmy” she said. “He loved seeing the kids get so excited. I do it because of him.”

To schedule an appointment to see the train collection people can call the store at 704-982-3815. The store is open 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday and 9:30 a.m. to noon Wednesday and Saturday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuY2JzMTluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS80NzkxMTQ5NC9pbmNpZGVudC1hdC10aGUtc2hvcHMtYXQtc3RvbmVmaWVsZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Incident at the Shops at Stonefield -,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPConnectionPool(host='www.cbs19news.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/47911494/incident-at-the-shops-at-stonefield (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x000002B00EC7C790>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuY2JzMTluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS80NzkxMTQ5NC9pbmNpZGVudC1hdC10aGUtc2hvcHMtYXQtc3RvbmVmaWVsZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

That same year at Tampa-based Heritage Insurance Holdings one of numerous small Florida-based homeowners insurance companies its CEO made $27.3 million — despite overseeing 0.3% of the number of policies and accounts of State Farm.

Florida-based insurance companies have been going out of business the last few years or raising rates by double-digits. Industry groups and Gov. Ron DeSantis have blamed excessive litigation and Republican legislators are poised this week to limit the incentives to sue insurers.

But state lawmakers have largely ignored an issue that has been directly blamed for numerous past company failures — and allowed some executives to make eye-popping sums of money over the last decade when companies were wildly profitable thanks to years without a storm.

Between 2014 and 2018 the CEO for Fort Lauderdale-based Universal Insurance Holdings made between $14 million and $25 million each year corporate filings show. The company has reduced its policies in Florida over the last year.

At St. Petersburg-based United Insurance Holdings whose insurance arm fell under state supervision last week the company awarded millions of dollars in stock dividends most of which went to company officers and directors even while its profits shrank according to corporate filings.

The payouts are legal under Florida law — and necessary some say. While insurance companies in Florida are closely regulated with caps on payouts and profits their parent and sister companies are largely unregulated.

That makes the small domestic companies that dominate Florida’s market more lucrative to investors.

State regulators have long been aware of the dangers of outsized arrangements between insurers and their sister and parent companies.

Large payouts to executives were at the heart of the biggest insurer collapse in the state’s history: the 2008 failure of the Tampa-based Poe Insurance Group which left Floridians on the hook paying roughly $850 million in outstanding claims from the 2004 and 2005 storms. The state sued to recoup $143.5 million in dividends the company paid to owners and their family members between 2004 and 2005.

Since then excessive payouts have been a consistent theme among the graveyard of companies that have failed. Financial autopsies on companies that went insolvent between 2011 and 2018 have repeatedly blamed high salaries and fees to affiliated companies. In one case the autopsy said one insurer’s officers were “stripping (their) company of cash.”

How much such payouts could be to blame for the current wave of failures — six companies in the last year — is unknown.

In 2020 when Florida’s insurance industry began deteriorating after 12 years without a named hurricane hitting the state the Office of Insurance Regulation launched a review of dozens of domestic insurers and their affiliates.

The office has not released the results since the review is ongoing and the responses are confidential under state law an office spokesperson said.

State lawmakers are considering this week expanding regulators’ ability to examine affiliate companies but only after hurricanes. Legislators’ special session begins Monday.

Doug Quinn executive director of the watchdog American Policyholder Association said his group has done its own research on executive compensation. Florida’s history of failures indicates the state’s current policies aren’t working he said.

“If I pick a state and I say ‘We’re going to allow you to come in and start a business and bilk people out of premiums’ Yes you’ll attract a lot of people to start insurance companies” he said.

Lessons from Poe

Between 2004 and 2005 Florida was struck by eight hurricanes the worst stretch in modern history.

Florida’s insurance market was devastated.

Since 1992′s Hurricane Andrew the state has relied on dozens of small Florida-based insurance companies to insure most homes. At the time the largest was the Poe Insurance Group created by former Tampa Mayor Bill Poe which oversaw three different insurers and about 320000 homeowners’ policies.

The 2004 and 2005 storms were devastating to the bottom lines of these firms which saw $2.5 billion in losses. By 2006 all three companies were insolvent and the state levied a 2% assessment on every Floridian’s insurance policy to pay out the companies’ $850 million in outstanding claims.

When state regulators took over the companies they discovered that each one had entered into an agreement with a sister company in January 2004.

The sister company called Poe Insurance Managers provided policy issuance and underwriting services for the three insurance companies in exchange for fees of anywhere between 22.5% to 26.5% of the insurers’ gross written premiums.

The profits of Poe Insurance Managers were then distributed to shareholders through dividends — and they were considerable. Between 2004 and 2005 it paid $143.5 million to company shareholders even though the company was in dire financial condition. Poe himself collected $25 million.

Once the money moves from the insurance company to the affiliate it’s no longer available to pay claims. In 2008 the state sued to recoup the money claiming it was “an intentional and financially reckless scheme to drain and divert the assets of the insolvent insurers for the sole purpose of eliminating their own potential financial exposure and increasing their personal wealth.”

Poe denied the claims and said the family put in over $70 million to try to save the companies.

Although Poe’s collapse was the largest insurance company failure in Florida history state lawmakers did not enhance their scrutiny of companies affiliated with insurers.

These affiliates can still charge the insurance company up to $25 per policy as well as a percentage fee for providing services to the insurer. That fee commonly between 20% and 30% and approved by regulators is often tied to policyholder rates. When rates go up so does the fee.

Large insurers usually have their own in-house employees write policies and provide underwriting. Others might pay an independent third-party company for the services.

Florida’s market is instead dominated by insurance companies that pay their affiliated companies for the work said Jack Nicholson who led Florida’s Hurricane Catastrophe Fund for decades.

Experts say there’s a reason why many Florida insurance companies are set up like this. After Hurricane Andrew national insurance companies dramatically reduced their risk in Florida especially along the coast.

State regulators and lawmakers encouraged new Florida-based insurance companies to operate but those companies needed to raise tens of millions of dollars to get off the ground.

“How do you incentivize investors to do something like that?” said Florida State University College of Business professor Chuck Nyce. “That’s why you see that structure in Florida.”

A long-running trend

An insurance company’s relationship with its affiliated companies can turn a loss into a profit the Sarasota Herald-Tribune found during its 2011 Pulitzer Prize-winning series on Florida’s insurance market.

Homeowners Choice Inc. reported 2009 losses of $650000 for the regulated insurance company and a 2009 profit of $11 million profit for the holding company the newspaper found. That was in part because the insurance company paid an affiliated management firm $24 million for management services that cost $15.4 million.

In 2008 alone investors and executives moved a collective $1.9 billion in policyholder money out of Florida insurers to their affiliated companies the newspaper found.

Since Poe’s collapse state regulators have repeatedly tied insurance company failures to excessive or unusual payouts to affiliated companies state reports show:

After the 2009 failure of First Commercial Insurance Co. and one of its affiliates auditors wrote that its “officers appear to have been stripping the company of cash.”

out more than $1 million in dividends to its investors which included current and former officers of the company Magnolia Insurance Co. existed for two years and still managed to payout more than $1 million in dividends to its investors which included current and former officers of the company auditors wrote

At Seminole Casualty Insurance Co. which mostly offered automobile coverage auditors cited “excessive and unreasonable” fees paid to “related parties” for its 2011 demise.

After the 2011 failure of Aequicap Insurance Co. auditors noted the company “paid commissions claims servicing and management fees to various related parties” but the company didn’t keep enough records for auditors to know if the agreements should have been approved by state regulators.

After Homewise Insurance Co. and one of its affiliates went insolvent in 2011 auditors wrote that in both cases the fault “appears to be the result of an excessive outflow of cash from the company to Homewise Management Company” its parent company.

final years at workers’ compensation underwriter Insurance Company of the Americas the company funded “questionable payments to other … companies” It folded in 2018. During thefinal years at workers’ compensation underwriterInsurance Company of the Americas the company funded “questionable payments to other … companies” auditors wrote It folded in 2018.

At Sunshine State Insurance Co. auditors found the company was paying affiliates for “overlapping services” including some that were not approved by state regulators before its 2014 collapse.

Under state law the Department of Financial Services is required to report the causes behind each insurance company’s insolvency. None of these reports about the seven companies that have gone insolvent for the last two years have been released.

When an insurance company fails it falls into receivership with the department. Agency spokesperson Devin Galetta said that under state law the department can’t release an insolvency report until “the end of the lifetime of the estate.” The estates can last five to seven years he said.

Of the reports for the companies that have gone insolvent between 2008 and 2018 none cite litigation as a reason for the companies’ demise.

Big paydays

Some of the companies that are now struggling awarded big payouts to their CEOs during Florida’s storm-free years.

When Heritage Insurance Cos. was starting up in 2013 the state-run Citizens Property Insurance Board of Governors made the unusual decision to pay the company up to $52 million to take out policies.

Republican lawmakers raised concerns about the deal and questions revolved around the $110000 the company donated to then-Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign account the Palm Beach Post reported at the time.

The company became highly profitable. In 2015 the CEO of Heritage’s parent company Bruce Lucas was awarded more than $11 million in cash and another $16 million in stock. That same year Heritage’s insurance company asked Florida regulators for permission to raise rates on some customers by up to 25% the Palm Beach Post reported. (In 2015 he sold nearly $19 million in stock according to federal filings.)

Lucas’ wife who was also a director of Heritage’s insurance company with a $150000 salary was also paid as a $400-per-hour consultant in 2017 earning an additional $440000 that year corporate filings show.

Since Lucas left the company has reported steady losses and is limiting its exposure in Florida.

In 2017 Universal’s CEO Sean Downes was the highest-paid property and casualty insurance company executive in the nation according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. At $19.3 million Downes was paid more than the CEOs of Allstate ($17.1 million) Travelers ($14.8 million) and Progressive ($9.3 million).

Between 2013 and 2019 Downes earned between $9 million and $25 million each year federal filings show.

Universal Florida’s largest domestic insurer with about 872000 policies has shed about 100000 policies in the state over the last year although it remains healthier than most other domestic insurers.

Since 2019 the company’s executive compensation has changed considerably Chief Strategy Officer Arash Soleimani said in a statement.

“Since that time we have meaningfully restructured and reduced executive compensation including major reductions to salaries cash bonuses and equity grants” Soleimani said adding that more than 90% of its shareholders voted in favor of the compensation plan at its most recent meeting.

CEOs at other domestic companies routinely made over $1 million and family members also benefitted public filings show.

At United Insurance Holdings the parent company of United Property & Casualty which fell under state supervision last week after heavy losses CEO Daniel Peed regularly earned more than $4 million a year in stock dividends. (The quarterly dividend payments ended in this year’s second quarter.)

The executive compensation at the companies has fallen sharply in the last few years and executives who didn’t sell their company stock have lost millions of dollars in net worth noted Paul Handerhan president of the consumer-oriented Federal Association for Insurance Reform based in Fort Lauderdale. The current CEO of Universal for example reported $3.5 million in compensation last year.

“When we had no storms all the insurance companies were making money and they were all making great income” Handerhan said. “From 2017 on all their executive compensation has taken a nosedive.”

Last year state lawmakers — at the urging of regulators — allowed for more oversight of sister and parent companies of insurance providers.

The Office of Insurance Regulation said that it “routinely reviews” the agreements between insurers and affiliates. In 2010 the office ordered Southern Oak Insurance to reduce the commissions it was paying to one of its affiliates.

In its 2020 request for information to insurance companies the agency asked them to disclose how much money their affiliates made from providing their services about any physical office space insurers gave to their affiliates without charge and about any loans the insurers received and from whom.

Legislation introduced for this week’s special session would allow state regulators to examine insurers after hurricanes if they have “made significant payments” to their affiliate companies in the storm’s aftermath.

Otherwise lawmakers are proposing to leave insurers’ affiliates untouched.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2RhdmlkLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4MzYxMjAw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Christopher Obituary - Lake Ridge Chapel and Memorial Designers - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/david-christopher-obituary?id=38361200 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2RhdmlkLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4MzYxMjAw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

These highlights take the form of cards arranged in a grid layout. What’s shown depends on the topic though a carousel of images is consistently the first thing that appears. In the case of cities you get “Weather averages” (as high/low for the month) how long it takes to “Get there” from your current location a map and description.

When looking up dishes/recipes the description appears first followed by videos and articles including a “Things to know” carousel.” On mobile these cards are often themed to the content (e.g. pesto green ragù red etc). However many cards are just blue.

As you scroll the usual web results appear. On mobile we’re only seeing this Knowledge Panel redesign for those two aforementioned categories.

On desktop we’re just seeing it for people. Notably there’s now a large Knowledge Panel grid that starts with images and highlights things like age spouse and a social media account. Athletes might also get cards for height net worth and recent recap video. The right sidebar is still used for the About description and other information.

This grid being the first thing that appears after the Search bar is quite prominent and draws your attention.

Google has yet to widely roll out this new card redesign for all Knowledge Panel categories or even every result within one. Besides information Google will highlight “content from creators on the open web.”

For topics like cities you may see visual stories and short videos from people who have visited tips on how to explore the city things to do how to get there and other important aspects you might want to know about as you plan your travels.

These highlights take the form of cards arranged in a grid layout. What’s shown depends on the topic though a carousel of images is consistently the first thing that appears. In the case of cities you get “Weather averages” (as high/low for the month) how long it takes to “Get there” from your current location a map and description.

When looking up dishes/recipes the description appears first followed by videos and articles including a “Things to know” carousel.” On mobile these cards are often themed to the content (e.g. pesto green ragù red etc). However many cards are just blue.

As you scroll the usual web results appear. On mobile we’re only seeing this Knowledge Panel redesign for those two aforementioned categories.

On desktop we’re just seeing it for people. Notably there’s now a large Knowledge Panel grid that starts with images and highlights things like age spouse and a social media account. Athletes might also get cards for height net worth and recent recap video. The right sidebar is still used for the About description and other information.

This grid being the first thing that appears after the Search bar is quite prominent and draws your attention.

Google has yet to widely roll out this new card redesign for all Knowledge Panel categories or even every result within one. Besides information Google will highlight “content from creators on the open web.”

For topics like cities you may see visual stories and short videos from people who have visited tips on how to explore the city things to do how to get there and other important aspects you might want to know about as you plan your travels.

MO,Altria,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzExL2dvdC0xMDAwLTItdmFsdWUtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWJ1eS1ub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Got $1000? 2 Value Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Altria and Dollar General could be great buys in this uncertain economic climate.

Although recent inflation has severely reduced its real-world purchasing power $1000 is still a lot of money for most people. And for investors looking to put that money to work the stock market offers reasonably priced equities now which can turn that money into significantly more over the long term.

Let's discuss two ideas: cigarette maker Altria Group (MO 0.43%) and discount retailer Dollar General (DG 0.06%). Both could make excellent buys today.



Altria Group

Up 5% in the trailing 12 months Altria's stock has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 which has dropped roughly 15% in the same period. The large-cap tobacco company can continue to hold its own because of its stable business model and the shedding of risks related to its investment in vaping start-up Juul Labs.

In 2018 Altria paid $12.8 billion to acquire a 35% stake in Juul which was valued at $38 billion at the time. Since then the investment has been a drag on Altria's performance as Juul was hit by a series of regulatory headwinds culminating in its products being banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (although that decision is currently suspended pending an appeal). The good news is that Juul-related headwinds are likely already baked into Altria's stock price and investors can finally move on.

As of June 30 Altria has written down its Juul stake by 96.5% to $450 million. And in September it ended its noncompete agreement with Juul amid plans to build its own portfolio of e-vapor products -- a market opportunity projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% to $42.9 billion by 2028 according to market research group Facts & Factors. In the meantime Altria's traditional tobacco business remains a stable and profitable foundation.

Management expects full-year earnings per share to grow by 4.5% to 6% (to between $4.81 and $4.89). And the company returns value to shareholders through a generous dividend yielding 8%. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 9.6 the shares are cheaper than the S&P 500 average of 21.

Dollar General

Up 12% over the last 12 months Dollar General stock is another excellent pick for investors who want to duck the bear market. The company's discount business model makes it recession resistant. And a reasonable valuation could position it for continued success.

According to an October poll of economists conducted by Bloomberg 60% expect the U.S. economy to enter a recession in the next 12 months. For most companies an economic slowdown would be bad news because it erodes consumer purchasing power. But Dollar General thrives in these situations because it presents people with lower-priced alternatives to pricier big-box retailers.

But Dollar General doesn't necessarily need a recession to grow. Third-quarter net sales jumped $11.1% to $9.5 billion as the company continues to enjoy healthy same-store-sales growth and location expansion -- adding 734 new stores to bring its total to 18818. Dollar General is also becoming increasingly popular with higher earners. According to CEO Todd Vasos it has started attracting more customers earning six-figure salaries looking to save money as inflation pushes up the cost of living.

With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19.8 Dollar General is only slightly cheaper than the S&P 500 average. But the company looks like a good deal considering how well-positioned it is to handle the current macroeconomic challenges.

Which company is best for you?

Dollar General and Altria are both excellent picks for value investors who want to protect their portfolios against challenges like recession and inflation but they serve slightly different investment strategies. With its lower valuation and massive dividend Altria is the more defensive option. Dollar General stock is more expensive but probably has more long-term growth potential.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvaGVhbHRoL2p1dWwtc2V0dGxlbWVudC10ZWVuLXZhcGluZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vaping Settlement by Juul Is Said to Total $1.7 Billion (Published 2022),"Juul Labs has agreed to pay $1.7 billion to settle more than 5000 lawsuits by school districts local governments and individuals who claimed that its e-cigarettes were more addictive than advertised according to people with knowledge of the deal.

The amount for the deal which involves a consolidation of cases centered in Northern California is more than three times the sum reported for other Juul settlements in other state and local cases thus far.

The settlement amount was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

In September the company agreed to pay $438.5 million to settle a multistate investigation into whether the company had targeted young people. States investigating the company bristled at ads featuring young models and fruit and dessert flavors that appealed to adolescents. The resulting settlement restricted Juul from aiming marketing of its products at young people.

Full terms of the settlement reached earlier this week have not been disclosed. But Juul has repeatedly denied targeting minors and has not admitted wrongdoing in reaching other agreements with plaintiffs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIxMjExL2p1dWwtcmVhY2hlcy1zZXR0bGVtZW50c2NvdmVyaW5nLXRob3VzYW5kcy1sYXdzdWl0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Juul reaches settlementscovering thousands of lawsuits | Business,"Embattled vaping company Juul Labs has reached settlements covering thousands of lawsuits over its e-cigarettes which in recent years became a scourge in schools and communities nationwide.

Financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed but Juul said that it has secured an equity investment to fund it.

Buffeted by lawsuits Juul announced hundreds of layoffs last month and bankruptcy appeared increasingly likely as it secured financing to continue operations.

The e-cigarette maker faced more than 8000 lawsuits suits brought by individuals and families of Juul users school districts city governments and Native American tribes. This week’s settlement resolves most of those cases which had been consolidated in a California federal court pending several bellwether trials.

“These settlements represent a major step toward strengthening Juul Labs’ operations and securing the company’s path forward” a company spokeswoman said in a statement.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs said in a statement that the deal would “put meaningful compensation in hands of victims and their families” and provide schools and local governments with funding for anti-vaping education programmes. A judge is expected to soon review and approve the settlement.

Juul rocketed to the top of the US vaping market five years ago on the popularity of flavours like mango mint and crème brûlée. But the startup’s rise was fuelled by use among teenagers some of whom became hooked on Juul’s high-nicotine pods.

Parents school administrators and politicians largely blamed the company for a surge in underage vaping which now includes dozens of flavoured e-cigarette brands that are the preferred choice among teens.

Amid the backlash of lawsuits and government sanctions Juul dropped all US advertising and discontinued most of its flavours in 2019.

In June the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected Juul’s application to keep its product on the market as a smoking alternative for adults throwing its future into uncertainty. The FDA said Juul did not adequately address key questions about the potential for chemicals to leach from its device. The FDA has placed a temporary hold on its initial decision while Juul files an appeal.

Then in September the San Francisco company agreed to pay nearly US$440 million to settle a two-year investigation by 33 states into the marketing of its high-nicotine vaping products.

That same month the company’s largest investor tobacco giant Altria announced plans to resume competing on its own in the e-cigarette space.

Altria pulled its own e-cigarettes off the market in 2018 after taking a nearly US$13 billion stake in Juul. But that investment has lost more than 95 per cent of its value as Juul’s prospects have dimmed giving Altria the option to exit its non-compete agreement.

That means Juul could soon be forced to battle for space on retail shelves with Marlboro-maker Altria along with long-standing competitors like Reynolds American’s Vuse which recently edged past Juul to become the leading US vaping brand.

Juul has also settled with 37 states and territories over the last year and said it is in ongoing talks with other key stakeholders to resolve remaining litigation.

Anti-tobacco advocates said it was impossible to evaluate the terms of the settlement without knowing how much Juul will pay.

“We are extremely troubled by the lack of settlement details provided and by Juul’s apparent public controlling of this settlement narrative” said Meredith Berkman of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes.

EDWARDSVILLE Ill. — One year after a tornado struck an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville Ill. killing six employees an official said the company has “done a deep dive” on its emergency response and preparedness protocols and new changes have been implemented.

What You Need To Know As a result of the tornado Amazon said there has been an increase in drills more training has been provided for managers emergency cards have been given to all employees and a meteorologist has been hired





One St. Charles County warehouse employee claims to not have received the emergency cards yet and said he has only been involved in one tornado drill since last year





The tornado sparked a congressional investigation into Amazon’s workplace safety policies led by the House Oversight Committee





Amazon told Spectrum News in June and reiterated again Friday that they’ve worked with the committee since the start and continue to fully cooperate





The push for change is not just at the federal level but at the state level too. Illinois HB 1563 would create the Warehouse Safety Standards Task Force Act

On Dec. 10 2021 an EF-3 tornado hit the DLI4 Amazon delivery warehouse in Edwardsville. Forty-five employees survived and one employee was air-lifted to a hospital for injuries. Federal safety investigators have said Amazon’s severe weather policies in place at the time of the tornado “met minimal federal safety guidelines for storm sheltering” but the online retailer needs to do more to protect workers and drivers in the future.

As a result of the tornado Kelly Nantel director of global media relations for Amazon told Spectrum News that managers have received more training in addition to making sure that everyone is trained on day one and there has been an increase in drills from one to two every quarter.

Nantel noted that the STL4 Amazon site in Edwardsville does drills twice every quarter at different shifts and times reaching as many employees as possible “so that people know how to react.”

“Part of what Amazon does is always try to raise the bar for ourselves and for our employees. This event presented an opportunity for us to go back and do a really deep dive on our emergency response and preparedness protocols how we handled events like that tornado and as a result we’ve done a lot of things” she said.

Amazon also has hired a meteorologist to its global team which Nantel says has been “a great addition.”

“Being able to go from just monitoring the weather to actually forecasting the weather is a great advantage for us” Nantel said. “We saw a lot of opportunity with that during the hurricanes that hit Florida and the panhandle of Florida this year.”

“We were able to pre-deploy goods and resources to the area we were able to make decisions to close sites that were going be in the hurricane’s path so that our employees didn’t have to worry about whether or not they had to go to work that they could focus on evacuating and following those orders.”

Additionally Nantel said employees nationwide have been given emergency cards that include a facility map and information on what to do during and after emergency and severe weather events.

“Every employee has these on their lanyard and any visitor who comes into our facility say a delivery driver or a contractor would be given this on their lanyard” she said.

However J Lopez an Amazon warehouse employee at STL8 in St. Charles County told Spectrum News he has not received emergency cards but that does not necessarily mean they have not been distributed to others at that site.

In response Amazon’s Global Safety PR team said they have reviewed official documentation and confirmed with the STL8 general manager that the emergency response cards were distributed to employees back in June and all new hires have been getting them on their first day. Spectrum News has reached out to Lopez for comment following Amazon's latest response.

Lopez has been working at Amazon Fulfillment Center STL8 over the past three years and says the Edwardsville tornado incident set him in motion to become an advocate for workers’ rights at Amazon.

“Since then it really opened me up to wanting Amazon to be held more accountable for their lack of action” Lopez said.

Since December 2021 tornado Lopez said he has been involved in one tornado drill where workers were still confused on protocol.

“(Amazon officials) have been able to organize themselves and figure out all of their metrics but they cannot figure out how to increase safety in our warehouse” Lopez said.

This past spring he said there was a tornado warning and employees received emergency texts from the National Weather Service to seek shelter while at work but employees were told to “stand by.”

“There’s a difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning and there are different steps that you take depending on which one it is” Nantel said.

“When there is adverse weather in the area employees are advised to stand by for more direction. If there is a need to take an action then they’re told to take the action. And those are the things that they’re taught in training.”

In response to Lopez’s claim of only being involved in one drill Nantel said she would be interested in doing her due diligence and look into that.

“Raising the bar in safety is something that is really important to us and we’re investing millions of dollars to make sure that we can do that” Nantel said. “Ensuring that we have really good policies procedures and most importantly practices that help people understand how to take action in inclement weather is really important.”

“Our focus right now this weekend is to support our employees in the community during this really somber recognition event. We’ll be at our sites with our employees and honoring those who we lost last year” she added.

Earlier this week the Edwardsville City Council observed a moment of silence to remember the victims. They are Clayton Cope of Alton; Kevin Dickey of Carlyle; Etheria Hebb of St. Louis; Austin McEwen of Edwardsville; DeAndre Morrow of St. Louis; and Larry Virden of Collinsville.

Several of the victims’ families and some survivors have filed lawsuits following the tragedy.

Pending legislation

The tornado sparked a congressional investigation into Amazon’s workplace safety policies led by the House Oversight Committee which counts U.S. Rep. Cori Bush D-St. Louis as a member. The committee launched an investigation into the company’s severe weather policies in April and by June members of congress accused Amazon of “obstructing” their investigation by not submitting requested documents as part of the probe.

Nantel told Spectrum News in June and reiterated again Friday that they’ve worked with the committee since the start.

“We’ve been fully supportive since they sent an initial letter asking for an enormous amount of documentation. We’ve produced over 3500 pages of documents so far. We started producing that after about two weeks after the letter was written to us and so we’re going to continue fully cooperate with them” Nantel said..

In September Bush introduced the Worker Safety in Climate Disasters Act to guarantee job and wage protection for workers who walked off the job during a severe weather event and the Wind Safety Standard Act which would require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or OSHA to form a standard “for preventing workplace injuries caused by high winds.” J Lopez is working with Bush on this legislation.

""I want every worker to know that I will continue to fight for their dignity safety and security in the workplace including during climate disasters. Even as the climate crisis rages on and disasters become more and more frequent we cannot allow a repeat of what happened in Edwardsville one year ago. All our workers deserve better protection and care than what Amazon provided that day” said Rep. Bush in a statement about the one-year anniversary of the collapse.

But with less than a month left in the current session of Congress and other issues like the budget still on the table prospects for the legislation would appear dim as the bills have not made it out of committee and would likely have to be attached to some other pieces of legislation.

Democrats will lose control of the House at the end of the session meaning legislative priorities and control of committee investigations will be in the hands of Republicans.

The efforts in congress also have the support of Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin.

“My heart goes out to the victims’ families as they go through yet another holiday season without their loved ones. I have pushed Amazon to develop and implement a stronger emergency action plan at their warehouses and I’m hopeful they will work to ensure the future safety of their workers” said Sen. Durbin.

The push for change is not just at the federal level but at the state level too. Illinois HB 1563 would create the Warehouse Safety Standards Task Force Act.

State Rep. Katie Stuart D-Collinsville is sponsoring the bill. She represents the community where the tragedy happened.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvYWxleGEtdGhhbmstbXktZHJpdmVyLXNjb3JlLXlvdXItYW1hem9uLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWRyaXZlci1hLTUtdGlwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Alexa Thank My Driver': Score Your Amazon Delivery Driver a $5 Tip,"During these busy times Amazon drivers are delivering a whole lot of packages. Odds are you've had a package (or 10 we aren't judging) delivered to your home and wouldn't it be nice to have an easy way to thank the driver without having to try to catch them when they're at your house? Amazon is doing just that this holiday season. Introducing ""Alexa thank my driver.""

By using this simple Alexa command you can score your delivery driver a $5 tip at no cost to you. That's right Amazon will pay drivers a $5 tip for each thank you received so why wouldn't you give it a shot? It takes less than a minute and these gestures can go a long way to the people who bring us our packages all year long.

Odds are you do a lot of your shopping on Amazon these days. From easy ways to save money with coupons to the lack of shipping fees and the great subscribe and save benefits it would be easy to just keep getting more deliveries without thinking about the people who are making them during.

How to reward your Amazon driver with a $5 tip

You don't even have to be home in order to thank your next delivery driver. Amazon

If you have an Alexa device at home like an Echo Echo Dot or even just the mobile app (Alexa or Amazon Shopping) all you have to do is say ""Alexa thank my driver"" and the delivery driver who made the most recent package delivery to your home will be notified of your appreciation. Amazon is going to be paying out a $5 tip per thank you for each of the first 1 million thank yous received and to sweeten the pot even more the five drivers who get the most thank yous during this period will be awarded an extra $10000 for them and $10000 for a charity of their choice.

Which drivers are eligible for the $5 tip?

Amazon will be rewarding its Flex delivery partners delivery associates employed by Amazon Delivery Service Partners and Hub DP drivers. Deliveries made by other partners like the USPS FedEx and UPS will not be eligible for the money but Amazon will continue to share the thanks with them.

How will you know if your driver will get the $5 tip?

After you say ""Alexa thank my driver"" Alexa will respond with different messages. If your order was eligible and your driver will receive a tip Alexa will reply saying ""Glad you enjoyed your most recent delivery. Since you shared your appreciation with your driver as a special thanks this holiday season your driver will receive an extra $5 at no cost to you. This promotion is for a limited time only.""

What happens after the 1 million thank yous are paid out?

After the 1 millionth thank you Amazon will continue to share your appreciation with the drivers though there will be no monetary incentive for them at that time.

It's worth noting that this comes hot on the heels of Amazon being sued for allegedly withholding tips from drivers on its Amazon Flex service though we do believe that Amazon will actually make these payments for the promotional period.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS8yMDIyLzEyLzEwL2FtYXpvbnMtYWxleGEtdGhhbmstZHJpdmVyLXRpcC1wcm9tb3Rpb24tZW5kcy8xMDg3MjY2NjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does 'Alexa thank my driver' still send tips?

After years of kneeling at the altar of long-term thinking and bold experimentation Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) finally seems to be getting religion on the bottom line.

The company is cutting costs like never before taking an ax to formerly promising new ventures like Amazon Care and announcing its first major round of layoffs dismissing 10000 corporate employees. A sizable portion of those layoffs are coming from the company's Alexa and Devices division where according to Business Insider the company is losing $10 billion a year on the voice-activated technology.

The revelation that Alexa has become a financial quagmire begs the question of what else Amazon is wasting money on. Its international business seems like one target for savings. The division which is mostly made up of e-commerce operations outside of North America loses money in most years and has posted an operating loss of $5.5 billion through the first three quarters of this year.

Another division that seems deserving of more scrutiny is Prime Video which Amazon doesn't directly account for on its financial statements. With the exception of a la carte spending on streaming rentals and sales Amazon doesn't directly monetize Prime Video using it instead as a perk to attract Prime members.

The company spent $13 billion on video and music content in 2021 and video spending was estimated to increase to $15 billion in 2022 including sports. That's more than all of its peers including even Netflix (NFLX -0.20%) which was expected to spend $13.6 billion on an amortized basis this year.

Since video is only loosely connected to online shopping investors should be asking if that $15 billion is money well spent.

Prime-o-nomics

Unlike peers like Netflix or Disney (DIS -0.01%) Amazon keeps its subscriber metrics close to the vest. Last April's shareholder letter said the company now has 200 million Prime members globally.

Amazon charges different prices for Prime around the world but if you assume every one of those members paid $139 a year that would bring in $27.8 billion in annual membership fees. That's close to the $34.1 billion it brought in with subscriber fees over the last four quarters which comes from Prime and other subscription businesses like Kindle Unlimited Audible and Amazon Music.

Based on those numbers $30 billion in Prime revenue seems to be a fair estimate. That means Amazon is spending half of its Prime membership revenue on Prime Video leaving only $15 billion to be allocated toward other Prime benefits like two-day shipping and free returns the biggest driver of membership. Amazon also spent $82.4 billion on shipping costs over the last year and at least some of that is allocated to Prime.

Of course the argument for spending on Prime Video is that signing up new Prime members and incentivizing existing ones encourages them to do more online shopping on Amazon. Explaining the company's differentiated approach to Hollywood founder Jeff Bezos once said: ""When we win a Golden Globe it helps us sell more shoes.""

That line of thinking also explains why the company is shelling out $1 billion annually on Thursday Night Football which it said led to a record number of Prime sign-ups in a three-hour period.

However there are likely diminshing marginal returns to spending on Prime Video at this point. Anyone who is a frequent online shopper has probably already joined Prime which has been around since 2005. The relationship between video streaming and online shopping is also tangential. If Amazon has $15 billion to spend to improve Prime benefits would it not be better off spending it on faster delivery better customer service or lower prices?

There's nothing magical about the relationship between Prime Video and online shopping.

The streaming reality

Amazon is ramping up video spending at a time when nearly all of its competitors are tightening their belts. Netflix has had two rounds of layoffs. Disney said it would prioritize streaming profitability over subscriber growth implying that layoffs were a possibility and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD 1.37%) has also announced layoffs.

The competitive dynamics in streaming in other words are undergoing a correction. Too many companies have entered the field and they're not charging subscribers enough to offset the costs of content.

Netflix Co-CEO Reed Hastings may have said it best in his company's recent shareholder letter: ""Our best estimate is that all of these competitors are losing money on streaming with aggregate annual direct operating losses this year alone that could be well in excess of $10 billion compared with our +$5-$6 billion of annual operating profit.""

Amazon is clearly one of those competitors losing money no matter how you account for the $15 billion in content spending. Throwing even more money at video at a time when the rest of the streaming industry is realizing the economics aren't so favorable seems like a losing battle.

Amazon should be held accountable here just like its streaming peers are. Now that the massive losses in Alexa have been revealed investors should demand more transparency on how the company spends money including justifying the $15 billion video budget.

The good news here is that there's significant opportunity for improvement. Amazon has a number of high-margin profit machines including Amazon Web Services advertising and its third-party marketplace and the company could be much more profitable than it is today.

For Amazon being conservative with Prime Video spending only makes sense given what's happening in the industry and padding the bottom line at a time when the stock has been cut in half would almost certainly earn a round of applause from investors.

As the company realizes there are limits to its money-losing ventures Prime Video deserves a thorough examination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS81MDUzNTYwNC9hZnRlci1yYXBpZC1wYW5kZW1pYy1leHBhbnNpb24tYW1hem9uLWRlbGF5cy1vcGVuaW5nLW5ldy13ZWJlci1jb3VudHktd2FyZWhvdXNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After rapid pandemic expansion Amazon delays opening new Weber County warehouse,"Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes

MARRIOTT-SLATERVILLE — If you're waiting for Christmas packages to be delivered to your door this year they're not going to come through the brand-new warehouse sitting just off I-15 in Weber County.

That warehouse in Marriott-Slaterville looks complete from the outside but its opening could be delayed until 2024 due to supply chain problems in receiving equipment to operate the last-mile delivery hub.

Bill Morris city administrator for Marriott-Slaterville said Amazon has never talked to him directly about the 183000-square-foot facility; rather he's only heard information second-hand through the building's landlord. ""Amazon is just leasing that site"" he said.

Morris said he's heard that once opened the warehouse will employ between 400 and 600 people. The facility is intended for last-mile delivery in Weber County serving six zip codes in the nearby area he said.

The massive online retailer already operates 16 facilities in Utah and employs thousands of people at corporate offices sorting and fulfillment centers delivery stations and a pharmacy distribution center. Amazon opened its first same-day fulfillment center in the state in West Jordan in May offering certain items for rapid delivery. The Weber County center was initially described to be a connecting facility as products make their way to others in the state.

Though Cyber Monday and Black Friday again set sales records this year the Associated Press reports that after a pandemic boom in online shopping Amazon has been scaling back its aggressive warehouse expansion plans and axing some projects in a cost-cutting move. Like other large tech companies Amazon has also announced layoffs of around 10000 employees in technology and corporate roles.

CNBC reported in September that the retail giant had ""closed or canceled 44 facilities and delayed the opening of 25 sites"" as of then after nearly doubling its footprint between 2019 and 2021 with the Marriott-Slaterville facility listed as one with ""equipment delays.""

Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from KSL.com about its plans for the Weber County warehouse. Back in June a company spokeswoman in San Francisco told the Standard-Examiner that the company had no new information to share about the project including reasons for the delay or an expected opening date.

There's one advantage to the delay: It's giving Marriott-Slaterville time to prepare for the increased traffic congestion the city anticipates once the warehouse becomes operational.

Morris said the road the warehouse interfaces with is the same road where Business Depot Ogden sends much of its truck traffic creating gridlock at the I-15 interchange at 400 North at certain times of the day.

""What we're looking at is possibly two additional stoplights on 400 North"" Morris said. ""We have some time to do some homework on that.""

Morris said traffic signals cost anywhere from half a million dollars to $1 million each.

""The market is so weird right now with supply issues"" he said. ""One day it's going down and things are cheaper. And the next day there's a shortage."""

According to Stewart “The Caribbean is a region as diverse in its stunning beauty as it is in the cultures that bring its storied islands to life. But for all its remarkable differences island countries have a collective requirement: the need to cross the sea to get there. And for that the region has turned again and again to American Airlines.”

He further explains “Their (American Airlines) unwavering support in connecting the Caribbean to the world has been a marvel to visitors discovering our home and a crucial link to Caribbean people who rely on the economic engine that is tourism.

“As we look to the future we are proud of our long and steadfast partnership that has served our customers and Caribbean communities so well.”

Participants report that the discussions between SRI and American Airlines demonstrated the strength of the relationship between them and their joint commitment to the critical issue of air travel to the Caribbean.

As Stewart says “Advocating to preserve and expand air access in the region is indeed good for Sandals but more than that it is good for the Caribbean. Our team has the resources and the ability to demonstrate the power of increased lift on Caribbean economies. “Ensuring reliable connections between major international markets in economies driven by tourism therefore means more jobs and more opportunity.

“And We rise together.”

AA’s Managing Director Caribbean Latin America and Florida Sales Christine Valls recognised the airline’s long-standing and valuable relationship with Sandals saying: “American is proud to serve as a leading airline in the Caribbean and we are encouraged by our partnership with Sandals Resorts International together having a tremendous economic impact on the entire region and helping open the doors of the Caribbean to the world.”

The SRI team led by Stewart also included Chief Executive Officer Gebhard Rainier and Unique Vacations Inc. (UVI) the worldwide representatives for Sandals and Beaches Resorts were also in attendance with a team including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Clarke Executive Vice-President of Sales and Industry Relations Gary Sadler Senior Vice President of Brand Development Tony Cortizas Vice President of Trade Sales Garth Laird Vice President of Tour Operators Sales and Marketing Melissa Sangster and Vice President of Airline Relations and Sales Development Alex Marte.

The American Airlines team comprised: Chief Customer Officer Alison Taylor Vice President of Global Sales Thomas Rajan Vice President of Operations and Commercial MCLA Jose Frieg Managing Director Caribbean Latin America and Florida Sales Christine Valls Managing Director Global Brand Marketing Dana Lawrence Managing Director Global Network Planning Jason Reisinger Managing Director AAdvantage – Member Engagement Heather Samp Sales Director Florida Caribbean Central America US Latin Guyana & Suriname Haydee Blanco Director Sales Programs Jared Cox and Sales Manager Caribbean US Latin Guyana & Suriname Marvin Alvarez-Ochoa.

Gary Sadler Executive Vice-President of Sales and Industry Relations for UVI said: “The meeting showcases Sandals’ continued commitment to the entire Caribbean tourism sector. He added that the incredible relationship Sandals has with AA has been fueling efforts to ensure that the region gets the level of service and increased seats it needs for its survival.”

According to Sadler “American is the largest airline partner in the world and its relationship with other airlines as part of the One World Alliance is crucial to drive connectivity to the region. In fact they just announced a partnership with Gol Airlines from Latin America which will see additional flights into Curacao and Barbados. They understand the value of partnership and we will continue to work with them to ensure that the Caribbean region gets what it deserves.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9kYWxsYXMvMjAyMi8xMi8xMC9wb3dlci1wbGF5ZXJzLWRhbGxhcy1jdWJhbi1qYWluLWJyb2FkbmF40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Axios Dallas Power Players: Mark Cuban Mattie Parker Anurag Jain and more,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/local/dallas/2022/12/10/power-players-dallas-cuban-jain-broadnax on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9kYWxsYXMvMjAyMi8xMi8xMC9wb3dlci1wbGF5ZXJzLWRhbGxhcy1jdWJhbi1qYWluLWJyb2FkbmF40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3Mub3V0bG9va2luZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RhdGEtZ3JvdXAtbGVkLWFpci1pbmRpYS10by1idXktNTAwLWpldHMtZnJvbS1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLXJlcG9ydC1uZXdzLTI0NDE5N9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3Mub3V0bG9va2luZGlhLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvbmV3cy90YXRhLWdyb3VwLWxlZC1haXItaW5kaWEtdG8tYnV5LTUwMC1qZXRzLWZyb20tYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1yZXBvcnQtbmV3cy0yNDQxOTc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tata Group-Led Air India To Buy 500 Jets From Boeing Airbus: Report,With the whole merger and historic deal as per Reuters Air India could easily be touted as the country’s largest international carrier and second largest in the domestic market.

In fact it's one of the first airports designed to be LEED v4 certified.

MCO's Terminal C is also home to the country's second Plaza Premium Lounge. There are more than 250 Plaza Premium Lounge locations worldwide but they have only recently expanded into the U.S. with a lounge at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) that opened in 2020. Its newest location is in the theme park capital of the world.

TARAH CHIEFFI/THE POINTS GUY

The 10000-square-foot lounge has thoughtfully designed spaces where kids can expend pent-up energy before a flight while parents relax. Business travelers can work in a quiet environment overnight travelers can freshen up after a long flight and all guests can enjoy chef-inspired food and fresh coffee or mixologist-crafted cocktails.

TPG got a first look at Orlando's Plaza Premium Lounge which is now open to all travelers. Here's everything you need to know about the lounge including how you can visit the next time you pass through Orlando.

Access and location

Terminal C is currently home to nine international airlines (Aer Lingus Caribbean Airlines Azul Emirates Lufthansa British Airways Gol Norse Atlantic Airways and Icelandair) plus domestic carrier JetBlue. You must be flying through Terminal C to access the Plaza Premium Lounge. Other guests should use lounges in Terminals A and B.

The Plaza Premium Lounge is located in what's called the Palm Court area of Terminal C. Palm Court is on the departure level (level 4) between the security checkpoint and the boarding gates. This is where most of the dining and shopping outlets are located.

TARAH CHIEFFI/THE POINTS GUY

Terminal C is connected to Terminals A and B via a shuttle bus or the Terminal Link APM. The shuttle bus drops guests off on level 6 (arrivals) and the APM stops in the Terminal C parking garage. From there it's a five- to 10-minute walk to the terminal. When I visited signage in the main terminal indicated it would take 16 to 20 minutes to reach Terminal C. I timed it and even after stopping to take a few photos it took me a little more than 12 minutes.

TARAH CHIEFFI/THE POINTS GUY

The lounge looms large on the second floor of Palm Court. With floor-to-ceiling windows and signage that's much more conspicuous than most airport lounges it's easy to spot from the moment you enter the Palm Court area.

The entrance to the lounge is on the first floor of Palm Court. You'll check in at the entrance and then take either an elevator or staircase to the second floor; there staff will confirm your check-in before you are granted entry.

TARAH CHIEFFI/THE POINTS GUY

There are three ways to access the Plaza Premium Lounge. The Platinum Card® from American Express the Centurion Card from American Express American Express cobranded cards Capital One Venture X Credit Card Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card and Capital One Spark Miles for Business cardholders can enter the lounge with their card and a same-day boarding pass. Plaza Premium has also partnered with the airlines flying out of the new terminal to make the lounge available to first- and business-class passengers. Aside from those you can purchase a one-time or multiuse pass on the Plaza Premium website or upon arrival though advance reservations are encouraged.

The lounge is currently open from noon to 9 p.m. daily but those hours will likely change as service to the terminal expands in the coming months.

The information for the Centurion Card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Layout

As you enter the lounge it's clear that Plaza Premium values Orlando's designation as one of the world's top destinations for families. The lounge immediately opens to a large area designed for families with a variety of seating options as well as toys and activities to keep kids entertained. Along the wall in this area is a curated selection of artwork from the Orlando Museum of Art.

After passing through the family area you enter the lounge's main area. Here you'll find a variety of seating options most of which are only an arm's reach away from international charging ports. This is also where the full-service bar and food service area are located. The high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides of the space give it a bright open feel.

Beyond the main area is a dedicated quiet zone. The seating in this area was custom-made for privacy and comfort with a small hook for your coat or purse an international charging port a reading light a pillow and a small work table. Seats are also situated in such a way that you can do a bit of planespotting while you work.

The lounge also has three shower facilities near the front entrance and five individual restrooms. Accessible showers and restrooms are both available.

Food and beverage

The Orlando Plaza Premium Lounge's culinary offerings range from freshly made pastries desserts and cookies to gourmet dishes like bourbon chicken teriyaki and beef meatloaf with demi-glace. There is also a grab-and-go cold case with fresh fruits desserts and salads.

There is a large interactive screen with a game called Tasty Turtle Treats where kids can move a turtle back and forth on the screen and attempt to catch falling treats.

How to Choose the Right Travel Credit Card for You

There's no single credit card out there that's the best fit for everyone. As such it's important that you take the time to consider your travel goals and spending habits to determine the right fit for you. Many of these cards offer bonus rewards on select spending categories so if you spend a lot in one or two areas try to find a card that will reward you more for those purchases.

While some of these cards charge hefty annual fees if you travel often enough it can be easy to make up for them. Look for benefits and features that are the most important to you and the type of experience you want to have. And don't forget that most of the top travel rewards credit cards require good or excellent credit which means a credit score of 670 or above. If you're not there yet take some time to work on building your credit before you apply.

Grant Wahl was one such journalist with a storied career covering various sporting events personalities and prescient issues in sports and beyond. Early in his career he covered multiple sports but over time he devoted most of his attention to his one true love: soccer. His death has shocked fans and supporters across the world with tributes pouring in as some question the circumstances of his passing.

The Indian Express takes a look at who Grant Wahl was some of his famous stories his coverage of the Qatar World Cup and his tragic untimely death.

Grant Wahl: sportswriter with an ability to tell stories that transcended the game

Advertisement

Wahl burst into the the consciousness of American readers in 2002 with a story on a teenage basketball phenom from Akron Ohio on the covers of Sports Illustrated (SI). While he had already received some critical acclaim notably for a piece titled Where’s Daddy (1998) about illegitimate children born to professional athletes his latest story would leave a profound impact on his legacy and that of the athlete he covered. Lebron James arguably the greatest basketball player of all time would be dubbed as the “Chosen One” by Wahl all the way back in 2002. Two decades later the level of insight and understanding that Wahl displayed in the SI piece still amazes many.

Wahl would write as many as 50 cover stories for SI many of them intimate investigations into the athlete or team he was covering. He was not just about the tactics of the game or the skills of the player. Wahl was more of a philosopher with an acute eye for details that others might miss.

For instance his first book The Beckham Experiment (2009) chronicled the astonishing move of English football’s biggest superstar David Beckham to Major League Soccer (MLS) in the US. The brilliance of the book lay in how it stitched together personal stories from Beckham and those around him with larger structural issues in American soccer. This book would go on to become a NYT Bestseller.

While he would cover many sports his enduring love would be soccer. For the American public he was the foremost authority on the game. In many ways he played a role in growing the game in the US to where it is now. Wahl covered the US Women’s Team at a time when no one seemed to care. He wrote about the problems with MLS at a time when the world thought that the league was on the rise. While not being a cynic he saw things for what they are and wrote with a hope of making them better.

Tryst with Fifa presidentship

Seeing Sepp Blatter’s corrupt and sycophantic reign ruin the game he loved he decided to challenge the Swiss administrator in the 2010 elections for Fifa president. He never had a realistic chance of winning the elections and withdrew his candidature after failing to secure a nomination from any national association. However he made the statement he had set out to make.

In his extremely “progressive” agenda he promised to revolutionise the game for the better.

He promised the introduction of goal line technology (something that Blatter would himself undertake when he retained his position)

He planned to abolish quotas for different nationalities when it comes to the appointment of referees for the World Cup (a radical stance against the sport’s eurocentric establishment)

He promised to appoint of a woman in the position of secretary general for FIFA (something that only happened in 2016)

He promised to release of documents related to the past dealings by FIFA (this is likely to never happen) and

Planned to ban yellow cards for goal-scoring celebrations (will anything be better?)

While he failed to become president just his improbable presence in the field of candidates generally comprising politicians and businessmen shed light into major issues that plagued the game on and off the field.

Covering the Qatar World Cup

The World Cup in Qatar has been notoriously riddled with off the pitch controversies: from human rights abuses and labour exploitation to corruption. In his coverage of Qatar Wahl covered many of these issues. In his pieces he was extremely critical of the Qatari regime. On December 9 he wrote about the death of a migrant worker during the tournament “They just don’t care. Qatari World Cup organisers don’t even hide their apathy over migrant worker deaths.” His writings showed the world a glimpse of the human cost of this World Cup but did not win him any fans in the country. According to his brother he received multiple death threats during the tournament.

On November 21 Wahl wore a rainbow T-shirt in support of LGBTQ rights to the United States’ World Cup opener against Wales. He would be detained outside the stadium for over 25 minutes with security refusing him entry and asking him to remove the shirt. The picture of Wahl being detained in his rainbow shirt almost overshadowed the game. Yet again he had managed to make his point. A subsequent piece detailing his detainment would be one of his most read pieces on Substack.

Sudden death in unclear circumstance

Wahl was tweeting throughout the Argentina-Netherlands match with his final tweet coming after the Netherlands’ tying goal near the end of the second half. “Just an incredible set-piece goal by the Netherlands” he wrote. Still in the stands as the match went into extra-time he would collapse with paramedics unable to rescue him. A Qatari hospital would pronounce him dead on Saturday morning sending the footballing fraternity into shock.

The USMNT released a statement as did the MLS. In a post-game presser LeBron James spoke with sorrow “Any time his name would come up I’ll always think back to me as a teenager having Grant in our building down at St. V’s. It’s a tragic loss. It’s unfortunate to lose someone as great as he was. I wish his family the best. May he rest in paradise.”

The circumstances of his death the threats he received and the content of his writing has led to lots of speculation of foul play on social media. His brother added further fuel to this speculation taking to Instagram to say “My name is Eric Wahl. I live in Seattle Washington. I am Grant Wahl’s brother. I’m gay. I’m the reason he wore the rainbow shirt to the World Cup. My brother was healthy. He told me he received death threats. I do not believe my brother just died. I believe he was killed. I beg for any help”

However Grant Wahl had not been keeping very well. Earlier this week Wahl wrote “My body finally broke down on me. Three weeks of little sleep high stress and lots of work can do that to you… What had been a cold over the last 10 days turned into something more severe on the night of the USA-Netherlands game and I could feel my upper chest take on a new level of pressure and discomfort.” He tested negative for Covid-19 and felt better after a round of antibiotics.

More news is awaited about the details of his death.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL211bWJhaS9paXQtYm9tYmF5LXBsYWNlbWVudHMtb3Zlci0xNTAwLW9mZmVycy1tYWRlLTI1LW9mLXRoZW0tbW9yZS10aGFuLXJzLTEtY3ItcGVyLXllYXItODMxNzc5NC_SAY8BaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NpdGllcy9tdW1iYWkvaWl0LWJvbWJheS1wbGFjZW1lbnRzLW92ZXItMTUwMC1vZmZlcnMtbWFkZS0yNS1vZi10aGVtLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1ycy0xLWNyLXBlci15ZWFyLTgzMTc3OTQvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IIT-Bombay placements: Over 1500 offers made 25 of them more than Rs 1 cr per year,"Phase one of the placements will continue until December 15 a statement issued by the institute said.

Fogel was arrested at the Sheremetyevo Airport carrying less than 20 grams of cannabis that had been prescribed to him in Pennsylvania for medical purposes. He was sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. In similar fashion Griner was arrested in February in Russia when airport security found hashish cartridges in her luggage containing less than a gram of hashish oil. However nearly three months after Griner’s arrest the U.S. State Department reclassified her as “wrongfully detained”—a status Fogel never received.

Griner was later sentenced to nine years but this week Griner was released after 10 months in holding in a high-profile prisoner exchange. Fogel’s family is hoping for a similar outcome in his case.

“The Fogel family is very happy for the Griner family and hopes that the U.S. government will apply the same kind of effort to get Marc out” Thomas Firestone the family’s attorney tells TIME. “This is just an extremely unfair sentence and we hope that the U.S. government will do everything in its power to get Marc home safely.”

Fogel hailing from Pennsylvania has been a history teacher at various international schools throughout his career in Colombia Venezuela Oman and Malaysia. From 2012 until his arrest Fogel had been working at the Anglo-American School in Moscow an elite private school that teaches the children of American diplomats and those of other international political figures.

In June a judge ruled that Fogel would serve 14 years in a labor camp under charges of large-scale drug trafficking. Before his conviction Fogel’s doctor had verified his medical marijuana prescription was for chronic pain. According to Firestone Fogel has a history of spinal illness. The marijuana that Griner had when she was arrested was also testified to be medically prescribed. Russian penal code outlaws marijuana possession and doesn’t make exceptions for medical use.

“It seems pretty clear that they [Russia] have embarked on a policy of using Americans who are arrested in Russia as bargaining chips for other political ends and we think that Mark got caught up in that” Firestone says.

Fogel’s family and friends have been advocating for his release and greater action from the American government since his arrest particularly because of the harsh conditions he’s been subject to in prison. Russian penal colonies descended from the soviet-era Gulags are notorious for their intense work geographic isolation violence and other human rights issues. Firestone says that Fogel hasn’t been receiving adequate medical treatment in prison.

Firestone says that it has been and will continue to be a long journey to free Fogel but he believes that the first steps are making sure people know about Fogel and getting him reclassified as wrongfully detained. That measure would entail Secretary of State Antony Blinken assessing Fogel’s case and determining holistically if it meets the criteria outlined in the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act.

“We’re working around the world including in Russia to make sure that any American who is being unjustly detained comes home. And we’ve been doing this day in day out since the beginning of this administration” Blinken said when asked about Fogel and any plans to release more American prisoners on a livestream with CBS News this week. “The President has made in many cases the hard decisions required to bring them home. We’re doing that. I am not going to rest until we get everyone back that we possibly can.”

Once the secretary determines that someone’s been wrongfully detained the State Department and other government agencies begin a collaborative effort to secure their release through diplomacy media pressure intelligence monitoring and other strategies. A group of nine bipartisan Senators sent Blinken a letter last summer asking him to reclassify Fogel as they were gravely concerned for Fogel’s safety. The State Department has previously asked Russian officials to release Fogel on humanitarian grounds.

“The President did not mention him [Fogel] at the press conferences” Firestone says. “They have consistently mentioned Griner and Whelan which is great that they’re giving such attention to their cases. We saw a great result in the Griner matter. People criticize the nature of the exchange but it is an unambiguously great result that she is out.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsb3dyZXN0bGluZy5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTAxMjI4NzUtMjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLWZhc3QtZmFjdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 World Cup Fast Facts,"1.

As a refresher Dish Network first sued the fitness companies in the spring of 2021 alleging infringement upon five of their patents. In particular the suit deals with Dish Network’s ability to stream different qualities of video based on the bandwidth of the connected user which can prevent streaming and buffering issues.

In addition to suing Dish Network also sent a request to the U.S. International Trade Commission asking them to block imports from the companies until the suit was settled.

This past September a judge declared that the companies infringe upon four Dish Network patents paving the way for a potential import ban. However the U.S. International Trade Commission has now agreed to take a closer look at the judge’s findings. The latest filing states:

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to review in part the final initial determination (“Final ID”) issued by the presiding chief administrative law judge (“CALJ”) on September 9 2022. The Commission requests briefing from the parties on certain issues under review as indicated in this notice. The Commission also requests briefing from the parties interested government agencies and interested persons on the issues of remedy the public interest and bonding.

The Commission will also be looking to address questions regarding whether a potential import ban would affect those who already own the products in question.

Parties involved in the investigation had through December 2 to file written submissions. It has not been stated how long it will take the US ITC to rule on the next steps.

If Portland wants to get in with the big-boy cities we need some 50- and 70-story buildings scraping those ubiquitous winter clouds. —Envious for Skyscrapers

My initial reaction to all this talk of skyscraper envy and getting with the big boys Envious was to conclude you have an obsession with mightily thrusting towers that might be better suited to Dr. Freud than Dr. Know. Upon reflection however I decided you’re hardly the first to use the size of a city’s buildings as a proxy for overall municipal status. If a pecking order among cities is inevitable I guess I can understand why you’d rather be a pecker than a peckee.

That said you might want to invest in a peck-proof helmet: The closest thing we have to a 50-story building is the U.S. Bancorp Tower (aka Big Pink) at 42 floors—and it’s probably the closest thing we’ll ever have so get used to it.

The main reason for our edificial inadequacy is that there’s a legal limit to how tall a building in Portland can be. Under normal circumstances that limit is 460 feet. (The city has occasionally granted variances to go a bit higher but they usually regret it.) That means the tallest possible building you could erect in Portland would be in a 10-way tie for 1072nd-tallest in America which doesn’t give you much to wave your big “We’re #1!” foam finger about.

Worse (at least for a size queen like yourself) we’re not likely to get many buildings even that tall anytime soon. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but demand for office space in downtown Portland is not exactly through the roof at the moment which is the kind of thing that makes banks a bit skittish about lending money.

Demand for residential space is through the roof of course. However there’s a lot of opposition to satisfying that demand by building tall residential towers downtown most of it from people who already live in tall residential towers downtown and are worried about their view of the mountain or whatever. That’s obviously bullshit but they have money and lawyers so don’t hold your breath.

In short (heh heh) you should probably learn to love our modestly endowed city as is. You know what they say: It’s not the size of your high-rise but the zoning where you’re owning that really counts.

Designed by the Austin office of the global architecture firm HKS and interior design by Britt Design Group Wilson Tower at its completion will reach 1035 feet in height across 80 floors making it an iconic contribution to Austin’s growing skyline.

“We are proud to be part of the redevelopment of East 5th Street – being a native Austinite it has been a journey to watch the evolution of the city over the last decade” says Taylor Wilson Wilson Capital. “We believe it is important to add intentionally designed density along the city’s transit corridors to accommodate the unprecedented level of population growth Austin is experiencing. We are passionate about making a meaningful contribution to the city we call home.”

The 450-unit multifamily development will offer exceptional features with hospitality-based services and sophisticated design setting a new standard amongst Austin’s high-rise apartment towers. In addition to unobstructed skyline views a signature ground floor restaurant and bar an activated streetscape and more Wilson Tower will offer valet plus four full floors of amenities that will include an expansive pool deck with food and beverage service full-service fitness and wellness center resident cocktail lounge and movie theater coworking spaces and a floor dedicated to pets outfitted with a pet playroom grooming center and dog run.

Units will range from studios all the way up to 3 and 4-bedroom penthouses.

“Our vision for Wilson Tower is to set a new bar in skyscraper residences for Austin that we believe will foster creativity and social connection” said Brad Wilkins Principal and Design Director for HKS Austin. “Along with welcoming outdoor terraces and gardens the tower itself is wrapped in a brise soleil that offers protection from the hot Texas sun and wind while also providing structural strength. This brise soleil gives the building uniquely shaded and comfortable outdoor living spaces on every level.”

Wilson Tower is the redevelopment of a 0.8-acre site spanning a half-city block previously home to the Avenue Lofts building.

Taking Our Daughter to the Top of the Eiffel Tower

We last visited Paris in December of 2019 and our daughter was five at the time but loved seeing it and has grown her affection over time. I surprised my family with the quick trip to Paris from London so the visit was mostly unexpected. That said we had a schedule change that granted us an extra day and buying tickets online doesn’t ensure good weather and clear skies for viewing so it was best to wait until we arrived.

There was an incredible joy and fascination our daughter showed an unbridled enthusiasm that she hasn’t shown for other destinations and it was wonderful to be able to give her that experience.

I don’t love heights especially on a metal tower built in the 1800s (by Gustave Eiffel naturally) and selfishly tried to persuade her to try the 1st and 2nd levels rather than go to the top. But I recognized my error and corrected it. We were headed for the summit.

The Website Can Be Difficult to Use

This is not our first visit to Paris. On previous occasions we had tried to book tickets in advance on the website but had difficulty with processing our cards. This time we found there was no availability on the day of our visit and had some navigational trouble but were accessing the site from our mobile device.

It wasn’t that there was no availability to book the Eiffel Tower summit (top floor) nor the 2nd floor of the Eiffel tower it was that there was no availability for pre-booked time slots.

We consulted our hotel concierge who offered very expensive Skip The Line tickets with a guided tour but for our purposes the cost (€75/person irrespective of age) was steep and she was unwilling to help us otherwise. That’s ok we knew we could take our chances at the base of the tower.

Eiffel Tower Ticket Costs

The cost of tickets to the top of the Eiffel tower depends on the type of ticket you would like to purchase. There are several options available including an Adult ticket a Child ticket a Senior ticket and a Disabled Access ticket. There are also two levels the second floor and the top (summit) of the Eiffel tower.

It’s free to enter the base area of the tower and explore underneath. There is metal detection security to go through but plenty to explore for those who are heights-adverse.

Pricing for the 1st and 2nd Floors

Adult tickets cost €17.10 Youth rate tickets cost €8.60 (valid for ages 12-24) Child and Disabled tickets cost €4.30 (ages 4-11) and children under 4 are free. Stair tickets are €10.70 (Adult) €5.40 (Youth) and €2.70 (Child and Disabled.) Additionally there is also the option of purchasing a priority pass for €25 which will give you priority access to the lift and the summit. All tickets can be purchased online or on–site.

Pricing for the Summit Access

Adult tickets cost €26.80 Youth rate tickets cost €13.40 (valid for ages 12-24) Child and Disabled tickets cost €6.70 (ages 4-11) and children under 4 are free. There is no option to take the stairs to the Summit. Like the 1st and 2nd floor all tickets can be purchased online or on–site for access to visit the Eiffel tower.

Our Secret To Getting Eiffel Tower Tickets

There are plenty of places to buy tickets from the official website to Expedia or Viator. While some of those may include an option to skip the long lines that can plague visits or a guided tour of the Eiffel Tower booking in advance may mean limited access or no access at all. Today for example the Summit is unavailable due to weather.

Our secret and advice we would give readers and clients is to wait until the day of the visit to ensure good weather buy in-person upon your arrival at the Eiffel Tower and skip the 1st and 2nd floors in favor of the Summit. If visitors have mobility issues are elderly or are pregnant they can move to the front of the line for purchasing but not to the front of the line for elevators.

Go Late

While it might not suit everyone’s plans we prefer to go late at night when the views of Paris lit up are best. The closer to closing time (on our visit 10 PM) the better. Lines are shorter it’s less crowded on all levels and less waiting. The Seine River Champs de Mars and the Arc de Triomphe are all beautiful sights after dark.

Going late at night also meant it was easier to get pictures together and access the coveted telescopes (€1 for a few minutes.) Our daughter loved it all. By the time we came down from the Summit we had the place virtually to ourselves.

Conclusion

The website can be tough to use and hotel concierges can’t always be relied upon. Weather changes and access limitations can make pre-booked tickets problematic. Booking in advance can also limit the opportunity to visit depending on capacity but walk-up tickets are nearly always available. Going later in the evening creates better views fewer crowds and a faster overall experience.

What do you think? How was your experience visiting the Eiffel Tower?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzEwL3RoZS1zcGFjZS1yYWNlLWxlZC10by1zb21lLXNoYWR5LWFsbGlhbmNlcy1iZXR3ZWVuLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1hbmQtbmF6aS1zY2llbnRpc3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Space Race led to some shady alliances between Americans and former Nazi scientists,"The moment that American astronaut Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon is considered defining in the history of humanity — a victory for our species that led to a profound global philosophical and political conversation about mankind's place in the universe and one in which countries set aside their differences to congratulate the United States for its soaring engineering achievement.

Yet the political decisions that led up to that moment were not nearly as pure of heart. Indeed the saga of the Space Race and its culmination in the moon landing is a story that would perhaps be more inspiring if America hadn't stooped to recruiting former Nazis in order to prevail.

The Space Race was an era when the world's most powerful nations the United States and its ideological rival the Soviet Union engaged in a heated competition to see who could make more progress exploring Earth's solar system. A manned mission to the Moon was considered by most to be the marker for ""victory."" Yet the Space Race that occurred in the quarter-century after the Cold War was significantly different from any analogous space race (such as one involving China) that may exist today.

The Soviet Union upped the ante on Oct. 4 1957 when they launched the first artificial object ever to enter Earth's orbit a satellite known as Sputnik.

The reason is simple: In the decades after World War II most of the world was convinced that if the ""wrong"" side won the Space Race humanity would be literally doomed. In a sense the Space Race is a perfect example of how the science and exploration realms can become political.

Historians have differing opinions about the precise moment when the Space Race began but the most logical starting point involves a technological breakthrough only tangentially related to space exploration. In August 1949 the Soviet Union detonated its first publicly-announced atomic weapon effectively ending the brief period of America's undisputed technological and military supremacy that had started with the close of World War II in 1945. As a result Americans became convinced that they were enmeshed in a battle for global dominance against ""Communism"" (particularly since the Soviet Union had recently engaged in a number of acts of international aggression) one that required extreme measures of all kinds. Whether it was building up a military-industrial complex rooting out supposed spies in all walks of life or making sure that Americans were ""the best"" when compared to their Soviet counterparts there was no realm immune to the pressures of this new international competition.

The Soviet Union upped the ante on Oct. 4 1957 when they launched the first artificial object ever to enter Earth's orbit a satellite known as Sputnik. Perhaps even more ominously the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik using a sophisticated new type of Soviet R-7 intercontinental ballistic missile. In effect the Soviet Union demonstrated with a single one-two punch that it was capable of literally sending satellites over American soil and dangerous missiles into its populated areas.

Clearly the situation was becoming intolerable from an American vantage point and by the following year the United States had launched its own satellite (Explorer 1) and formed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In addition to expanding the frontiers of human knowledge NASA was tasked with two more mundane objectives: Determining how America could establish military supremacy in space and figuring out how to use satellite technology to spy on the Soviet Union. It took time for America to catch up with the Soviets however and the next few milestones were still achieved by the Russia-controlled empire: They launched the first space probe to make contact with the Moon Luna 2 in 1959 and two years later they sent the first human being to ever enter space with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. Finally in May 1961 President John F. Kennedy announced that America would put a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.

The United States had a trick up its sleeve albeit a morally dubious one: A crew of former Nazi engineers and scientists.

The United States had a trick up its sleeve albeit a morally dubious one: A crew of former Nazi engineers and scientists. In a campaign known as Operation Paperclip the United States aggressively recruited former Nazis who had worked for Adolf Hitler's regime in various scientific projects. Although the Soviet Union eventually began to do the same thing America had a head start in cultivating Nazis and picked up some crucial names in the fields of rocketry and aeronautics: Adolf Busemann who would help design faster and safer aircrafts; Arthur Rudolph who helped develop key systems such as those which ran the Saturn V Moon rocket and the Pershing missile; jet engine engineer Anselm Franz who helped America develop the T53 the T55 the AGT-1500 and the PLF1A-2; and most notably Wernher von Braun who was the chief architect of the Saturn V launch vehicle that made moon missions possible.

Moral qualms aside from a scientific perspective America's recruitment of Nazi scientists was an undeniable success. On July 20 1969 the full measure of all America's efforts paid off when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first human beings to set foot on the moon. In that moment as far as many Americans were concerned the country ""won"" the Space Race. It would not be until later years that they grappled with the ethical issues of working with scientists who had directly assisted Hitler; von Braun for instance is known to have opportunistically sought and savored the privileges Nazis could give him because of his aristocratic birth even if there are no indications that he sincerely subscribed to the Nazi ideology.

There are other legacies to the Space Race. Much of the aeronautics technology that exists today would be unimaginable without the massive public investment into research and development that occurred because of the Space Race. Culturally the Space Race remains iconic in the American experience; the images of Apollo 11 launching the vehicles that would put men on the moon or of Neil Armstrong taking his first steps on lunar soil are as widely known as the American flag itself. Politically the Space Race reveals the very origins of US-Russia tensions which persist today despite the two nations working together now on space issues."

When analog ruled the video world a big switch panel was key to effective results.

Devices like [Glen]’s Grass Valley Series 300 Crosspoint Switch Panel were an important part of that world. With tools like that a human operator could set up a composited preview feed in true WYSIWYG style and switch to live on cue. All done with relatively simple CMOS ICs and buttons. Lots and lots of buttons.

[Glen] reverse engineers the panel to show how it works and most of the heavy lifting is done by the MC14051B analog multiplexer/demultiplexer and the MC14532B 8-bit priority encoder. Once that’s figured out the door is open to modernizing things a little by using a microcontroller to drive the device turning it into a USB peripheral.

With a little design work [Glen] builds a PCB around the EFM8UB2 8-bit microcontroller to act as a USB peripheral and control the switch panel taking care of things like key scanning and lamp control. The last step: a GUI application for monitoring and controlling the panel over USB.

The company shared the news following a review of Apple’s non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) which previously excluded language surrounding the discussion of working conditions.

In a note titled “Our Commitment to an Open and Collaborative Workplace” Apple says “employees have the right to speak freely about their workplace conditions including harassment and discrimination.” It adds that an independent reviewer only found provisions that could “be interpreted as restricting a person’s ability to speak about such conduct” in “limited instances” and that Apple has “committed to not enforce those restrictions and to make improvements and clarifications going forward.” The company already includes language from California’s Silenced No More Act in separation agreements for employees across the US.

Apple’s use of concealment clauses drew scrutiny after Cher Scarlett an #AppleToo organizer and former Apple engineer left the company and accused it of engaging “in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.” As noted by a report from Insider Scarlett claimed that Apple prevented her from talking in detail about her departure from the company as part of a separation agreement.

These measures significantly expand the ability of BIS to curtail technology transfer by end-use to China.

Markets responded in kind with billions of dollars wiped from equities in integrated circuits (IC) and wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) — a segment dominated by US companies like Applied Materials KLA and Lam Research. BIS scrambled to clarify various legal ambiguities and it is increasingly clear that the fabs manufacturing less sophisticated ‘legacy nodes’ are relatively unaffected. US Korean and Taiwanese firms with chip manufacturing facilities in China have also secured temporary one-year licenses to use US technologies at these sites.

But the respite may be temporary. In mid-November US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dispatched her undersecretary to the Netherlands and Japan to urge them to take further action. It is unknown whether these countries — specialists in the lithography process a crucial step in IC production — will agree to US requests.

It is difficult to ascertain what more the Biden administration can demand from its allies. Their dual-use lists already include relevant lithography equipment. Export controls are already subject to treaty commitments and close coordination between the United States Japan and European Union (EU) member states. The Netherlands also denies export licences on any Extreme UV (EUV) that is used for scale production of very miniaturised chipsets.

While market valuations have stabilised October’s developments should not be underestimated. These measures are a departure from the ‘sliding scale’ approach that had kept the United States and its allies one or two generations ahead in key technologies. As US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan declared – the latest export controls are designed to foster ’as large of a lead as possible’.

It is striking how the US government has mirrored China’s state-run regime by wrestling control of the free market. Under the foreign direct product rule BIS’s controls apply extraterritorially due to a global reliance on US patents and talent. The US Department of Commerce can issue export licenses to whichever entities it wants and block sales deemed contrary to US commercial or strategic interests.

Such power naturally causes unease among US allies. Even Japanese trade officials — known for their measured demeanour — were ’bemused by how Japan’s sovereignty could be so disregarded’. However US diplomats and lobbyists are keen to ensure that Dutch and Japanese firms are equally unable to serve the world’s largest chip market.

This focus on ‘Burden Sharing’ is conveniently timed. Prior to October US export controls targeted lithography equipment but remained laissez-faire on half a dozen critical production steps where US companies happened to dominate. China broke the 7 nanometre-chip barrier not by using Dutch EUV equipment but ‘deposition and etching’ — an alternative process that relied on US tools. Some analysts suggest that the world’s three largest WFEs — which are all American — have increased their Chinese sales by US$5.4 billion since 2019 significantly displacing foreign competition.

The two largest national economies now impose similar state controls over an industry that once epitomised free trade and most-favoured nation principles and there is little scope for future moderation. While Chinese firms have been removed from the BIS’ Entity List before the odds of October’s controls being relaxed are as unlikely as Beijing abandoning its pursuit of military–civil fusion. Escalation looks more probable as both US Republican and Democratic parties continue to frame technological rivalry as existential. Further US restrictions have already been mooted on related investments.

Market intervention comes at a price — production silos are rarely economically efficient. US industry losses are measured in billions. Firms in Taiwan Japan South Korea and Europe must also restructure their organisations to stay onside. Even when BIS issues export licenses the procedural opacity stokes hysteria about favouritism or US protectionism. For the EU the disproportionate focus on lithography was just another example of successive US administrations using China as a pretext to neutralise Europe’s lead. Similar suspicions were also raised over US attempts to enter the 5G race.

Public funding through various ‘Chip Acts’ is hardly an adequate substitute to drive innovation — not least in China’s quest for semiconductor autonomy. Beijing has thrown US$50 billion at its own ‘Big Fund’ with mixed results. Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp a top recipient has become a competitive force in producing NAND flash memory chips but state aid has been overly focused on fabrication and has neglected semiconductor design and manufacturing equipment.

Yet China has been reluctant to respond to US export controls. Beijing could have retaliated by imposing restrictions on access to critical raw materials or on US companies operating within its jurisdiction. But in reality exacerbation of this problem goes against its short-term instincts and interests. Beijing still thinks and acts like a rule-taker — and state control is an amendment to the rulebook it will accept.

Export controls are not insurmountable in the medium term. In the past much less resourceful nations than China have circumvented stricter embargoes and non-proliferation treaties for weapons of mass destruction. Elsewhere the first Chinese 7-nanometre chip was manufactured by the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — a state-owned enterprise that BIS has sanctioned since December 2020.

Beijing — the ultimate savant of power-based statecraft — can simply bide its time. And time as always is on China’s side.

Image captured on a wildlife camera by Steve Goodman a conservation biologist with National Parks Conservation Association.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission said Dec. 9 that it has issued charges in a case where three bears were found mutilated — with their paws cut off and their entrails in a bucket — in Woodfin in late November.

John Robert Bunkley Jr. 26 who currently lives in Buncombe County faces a long list of citations according to the agency. Those are:

Attempt to take a deer during closed season

Littering

Three counts of unlawful transportation

Three counts of unlawful possession

Three counts of failure to register

Three counts of failure to validate

Taking a sow bear with cubs at its side

Two counts of going over the bear limit

No hunting license

No e-stamp — warning

No big game license

More:‘Bear poaching is rampant in WNC’ Advocate says of black bears found mutilated in Woodfin

""We will continue to work with the Buncombe County District Attorney’s Office until the case is adjudicated"" spokesperson Mindy Wharton said. ""The community response was incredible and we are appreciative of the information given to Help Asheville Bears that led us to the suspect.""

Help Asheville Bears or HAB offered a monetary reward for information leading to an arrest. The group advocates for local bears and runs a Facebook page with more than 300000 followers.

Bunkley has not been arrested. The charges were issued the evening of Dec. 9 Wharton said.

This area on Moore Street in Woodfin is where residents found three mutilated black bear carcasses Nov. 27.

""We had multiple things come in"" said HAB founder Jody Williams. ""For example seeing a vehicle in that spot and saying something and letting us know what they saw ... There was multiple people that called. Some of it was irrelevant just as always but you've got to track down every lead.""

""There's people like us in the community that's watching out for things and our rewards will bring in information"" he said. ""And if you're doing illegal stuff and not following the rules or laws of hunting you're likely to get caught.""

The bears' carcasses were found off Moore Street close to a small neighborhood neighbors previously told the Citizen Times. Those neighbors believed the dead bears to be a mother and her two cubs though the wildlife commission said that the bears' carcasses were so deteriorated that their weight could not be determined. Alongside the carcasses neighbors found the bears' paws cut off with a bucket of entrails nearby.

Wildlife violations can be reported by calling 800-662-7137.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

During a recent visit to Atlanta Vice President Kamala Harris stopped to ask the Morehouse student government president about the sentiment on campus about the conflict how students felt about Mr. Biden’s visit and what the graduating class would like to hear from him on May 19.

Then on Friday the White House dispatched the leader of its public engagement office and one of its most senior Black officials Stephen K. Benjamin to the Morehouse campus for meetings to take the temperature of students faculty members and administrators.

The reasons for concern are clear: Nationwide demonstrations over the war and Mr. Biden’s approach to it have inflamed more than 60 colleges and universities stoked tensions within the Democratic Party and created new headaches for his re-election bid.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbi1kYXVnaHRlci1oZWxkLWd1bnBvaW50LWNvcHMtMjI0MjAyMjg1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man and Daughter Held at Gunpoint by Cops During Traffic Stop,"Heart-stopping video shows armed cops pulling over a dad and his daughter.

George Floyd “Bud” Hughes 83 of Ranlo NC departed this life on December 9 2022 at Caromont Regional Medical Center. He died peacefully embraced in the love of his Creator and his family.

He was born in Mount Holly NC to the late Turner Jones Hughes Jr. and Jessie Edge Hughes. At sixteen he left high school and began working at Rex Mills (later Ti-Caro and Dixie Yarns) in Ranlo as a sweeper. During his career at the mill he worked in the lab winding packing and as second shift spinning supervisor. When the mill closed Bud had worked there faithfully for 40 years. He continued his textile career at Pharr Yarns and retired in 2001.

In 1958 Bud’s life changed during a Billy Graham crusade in Charlotte NC. After going to revival that week Bud dedicated his life to Christ. After making this commitment he found a church home in Ranlo Baptist. Here he was nurtured by many loving people and grew in his faith. He faithfully served the church as a deacon an usher offering counter and Sunday School teacher. His green beans were a “fan favorite” at the covered dish dinners and he delighted in making everyone feel welcome with a warm handshake and an atomic fireball.

Bud was an excellent baker and folks delighted in eating his biscuits cornbread and cakes. He enjoyed cooking and sharing food with shut-ins or others in need of a good meal. During his retirement days Bud loved being a member of the South Gastonia Water Aerobics Class and served as the social coordinator for their monthly meal outings.

In addition to his parents his beloved siblings preceded him in death: James Hughes Hazel Hughes Tucker Marvin Hughes Betty Jo Hughes Whisnant and Clara Mae Hughes McBee.

Left to cherish his memory are his wife of 53 years Jane Randolph Hughes; his daughter Lou Ann Hughes Gilliam and husband Paul R. Gilliam III; his son David R. Hughes and wife Laura Cloninger Hughes. He loved being “Poppy” to his grandchildren Matty Grace Gilliam Gabriel Hughes and Noah Hughes; and treasured being Uncle Bud to his many nieces and nephews and their children and grandchildren. Bud is also survived by a large extended family and friends.

The family would like to express appreciation for his many family members special friends first responders and health care providers that “kept him ticking” over the years as well as those who compassionately served him in the last days of his life.

The family will receive friends at McLean Funeral Directors of Gastonia on Wednesday December 14 from 5:00-7:00 pm. The funeral service is Thursday December 15 at 11:00 am at Ranlo Baptist Church in Ranlo NC. Graveside service to immediately follow at Gaston Memorial Park.

Officers responded and learned two suspects were last seen fleeing the bank in a white Jeep Grand Cherokee.

A large police presence was reported at the bank.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was notified and will be leading the investigation police officials said.

The New York Innovation Center is a partnership between the New York Fed and the Bank of International Settlements founded in 2021. The center announced the pilot program to see how the institution would run transactions using a central bank digital currency or CBDC.

A CBDC is a form of digital currency that is issued and regulated by the federal government through a central bank such as the greater Federal Reserve.

In comparison cryptocurrencies — such as bitcoin and ethereum — are decentralized forms of digital currency that are issued by private entities. As a result the government has little authority to regulate them.

The Fed published a paper on Jan. 20 discussing if a government should implement a CBDC. It stemmed from research between the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The New York Fed released results on Nov. 4 from the experiment’s first phase called “Project Cedar.”

It simulated a foreign exchange spot trade that involved a prototype of a wholesale CBDC. The center observed if the blockchain technology of the digital currency helped make international transaction spot trades faster cost-effective and accessible.

Most foreign exchange spot trades typically take two days to settle. During that time the sender and the recipient each are vulnerable to “settlement counterparty and credit risk” according to the report. This hinders the bank’s ability to convert assets into cash.

The center said it has found that it takes transactions on a distributed ledger system that’s enabled through the blockchain under 15 seconds to settle on average. The recipient and sender settle their transaction at the same time – or not at all. Plus the system’s design enables payment to be made no matter the date or time.

The financial institutions participating in the pilot program include Bank of New York Mellon Corp. Citigroup Inc. HSBC Holdings PLC Mastercard Inc. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. TD Bank NA Truist Financial Corp. U.S. Bancorp. and Wells Fargo & Co.

The 12-week-long pilot project followed Phase 1 also called the “Regulated Liability Network U.S. Proof of Concept.”

The nine institutions will explore how to use a regulated liability network and test the distributed ledger system’s ability to exchange and use information concurrently.

“The NYIC looks forward to collaborating with members of the banking community to advance research on asset tokenization and the future of financial market infrastructures in the U.S. as money and banking evolve” Innovation Center Director Per von Zelowitz said in a press release.

The New York Fed said it does not intend to use the results of the pilot program to launch a specific policy or make a decision about issuing a CBDC whether for retail or wholesale use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5cmFjdXNlLmNvbS9yZWFsZXN0YXRlLzIwMjIvMTIvMjc1LW1pbGxpb24taG9tZS1pbi1za2FuZWF0ZWxlcy1zZWUtMTUyLWhvbWUtc2FsZXMtaW4tb25vbmRhZ2EtY291bnR5Lmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3lyYWN1c2UuY29tL3JlYWxlc3RhdGUvMjAyMi8xMi8yNzUtbWlsbGlvbi1ob21lLWluLXNrYW5lYXRlbGVzLXNlZS0xNTItaG9tZS1zYWxlcy1pbi1vbm9uZGFnYS1jb3VudHkuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$2.75 million home in Skaneateles: See 152 home sales in Onondaga County,"The Onondaga County Clerk’s office recorded 152 home sales between Nov. 28 and Dec. 2.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hkYWlseS5jb20vMTAxNjI5Ny9qb2NoZW9uLXlva2phbmctYmF0aC1hdGVsaWVyLWl0Y2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jocheon Yokjang Bath / Atelier ITCH,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hkYWlseS5jb20vMTAxNjI5Ny9qb2NoZW9uLXlva2phbmctYmF0aC1hdGVsaWVyLWl0Y2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E8354E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

Static kill-curve experiments

All drug experiments and growth controls were performed in duplicate at 37 °C and ambient air. Isoniazid (40 mg/mL) and rifampicin (83 mg/L) stock solutions were prepared with sterile distilled water directly from the drug vials (Becton Dickinson—MGIT 960 SIRE KIT). Stock solutions were then diluted to drug experiment conditions containing 250 1000 or 8000 ng/mL of isoniazid and 12.5 50 and 400 ng/mL rifampicin alone or in combination with 10% OADC-supplemented Middlebrook broth 7H9 (Becton Dickinson—BBL MGIT 7ML).

M. tuberculosis H37Rv (NCTC 7416 ATCC 9360 obtained from Public Health England culture collections) was incubated in a MGIT Tubes containing 7 mL Middlebrook broth 7H9 (Becton Dickinson—BBL MGIT 7ML) supplemented with 10% OADC (Becton Dickinson—MGIT OADC ENRICHMENT 6 VIALS) prior to the first evolution cycle. There was a master tube for each experiment and evolution cycle one was started once the bacterial load of the master culture reached 105.5 CFU/mL. Each drug experiment or growth control experiment started with inoculating MGIT tubes containing 7 mL Middlebrook broth 7H9 with pellets from the master tube resuspended in 0.5 mL 7H9 0.8 mL OADC and 0.2 mL drug or blank solution rendering a total volume of 8.5 mL with a bacterial load of ~ 105.5 CFU/mL.

The bacteria were separated from media by centrifugation at 2683 Relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 10 min at the end of the first evolution cycle and the regrowth phase of the experiment. Pellets were washed in Sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted at 2683 RCF for 10 min twice. Thereafter the pellets were resuspended in the new condition at the start of the second or third stage in volumes as described for initial inocula.

Daily samples of 50 μL were taken for bacterial load quantification and three samples (baseline after the first and after the second evolution cycle) were taken for Whole Genome Sequencing.

Hollow-fibre infection model experiments

A cellulosic (C3008 FibreCellSystems Ltd) cartridge was inoculated with 20 mL 105.5 CFU/mL M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. Incubation followed the identical procedure as per kill-curve experiments. A drug-free incubation phase of 2–3 days preceded the start of the drug experiments.

Isoniazid and rifampicin concentration–time profiles mimicked unbound concentrations in the granuloma under the assumption that there is equilibrium between unbound drug concentrations in plasma and the granuloma28. Model predictions were obtained with a previously published model adjusted for 42% and 83% plasma protein binding for isoniazid and rifampicin respectively29. The following pharmacokinetic properties were mimicked for the OD and TDS standard dosage experiments: isoniazid C max = 3.32 mg/l and rifampicin C max = 0.788 mg/l with t 1/2 = 4.7 h). For the TDS experiment with 1/3 of standard dosing isoniazid C max was 1.06 mg/l and rifampicin C max = 0.263 mg/l with a t 1/2 at 4.7 h. The OD experiment at 3 times standard dosing simulated isoniazid C max at 9.50 mg/l and rifampicin C max at 2.36 mg/l with a t 1/2 at 4.7 h. A web application (https://pkpdia.shinyapps.io/hfs_app/)28 was subsequently used to convert secondary pharmacokinetic parameter estimates CMAX/C0 and t1/2 into pump settings at a system volume of 108 mL (central reservoir 50 mL; intracapillary space and tubing 44 mL; and extracapillary space 14 mL). First-order absorption of the drugs to mimic oral absorption characteristics was omitted and replaced by bolus administration in the central reservoir in these experiments to avoid complex experimental setups.

Growth control and drug experiments lasted for 14 and 7 days respectively. Drug concentrations in the hollow-fibre medium were not measured during the experiments but pump-settings were validated using bacteria free experiments to ensure in-vivo mimicking pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated in-vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Daily samples of 50 μL were taken for bacterial load quantification and two samples at baseline at the end of the drug experiments were taken for Whole Genome Sequencing.

Bacterial load quantification

Fifty μL samples from kill-curve and hollow-fibre infection model experiments were inoculated in fresh MGIT tubes containing 7 mL Middlebrook broth 7H9 with 0.8 mL OADC. MGIT-TTP was used as measure of bacterial load23.

Whole genome sequencing

The CTAB method was used to extract genomic DNA and Qubit dsDNA kits (Life Technologies) were used to quantify DNA prior to sequencing30. WGS for start culture and evolution cycle two samples were performed using an Illumina HiSeq platform and samples from the first evolution cycle and all Hollow-fibre infection model experiments were performed using the Illumina NextSeq platform. WGS was performed following the manufacturers’ instructions and local validated protocols and results have been deposited (Supplementary Table S1).

Drug quantification

Pharmacokinetic validation experiments were performed under identical conditions as described above apart from that the cartridge was not inoculated with M. tuberculosis and broth was not supplemented with OADC. Broth samples (2 mL) were taken from the central reservoir 0 3 6 8 and 23 h post bolus dose and from the extra capillary space 3 and 24 h post bolus dose. Samples were kept in − 80 °C until analysis using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric detection. Details on the analytical method have been published previously28.

Pharmacodynamic modelling

A compartmental model was developed to describe MGIT-TTP data from time kill curve experiments (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Data file S1). Model estimates were computed using the SAEM estimation method in nlmixr 2.0.4 on a Windows 10 operating system. Minus twice the log likelihood of the data was used as objective function value (OFV) and a drop in OFV of at least 3.84 (P = 0.05) was considered to improve the model’s ability to fit the data with statistical significance after inclusion of one degree of freedom to a nested hierarchical model. Assessment of model performance was further supported by goodness-of-fit diagnostics including observation-population predictions observations-individual predictions Normalised Prediction Distribution Errors (NPDE)-population predictions and NPDE-time.

Baseline MGIT-TTP at experiment level (\({P}_{i}\)) was estimated using a typical baseline MGIT-TTP (\({\theta }_{TV}\)) and a deviation from the typical baseline MGIT-TTP described by between experiment variability (η) (Eq. 1).

$${P}_{i}={e}^{\mathrm{log}\left({\theta }_{TV}\right)+\eta }.$$ (1)

Data from the growth control experiments were used to develop a log-growth model (Eq. 2) describing changes in MGIT TTP bacterial load (B) over time using the parameters net growth (\({\theta }_{{k}_{net}}\)) and maximum carrying capacity (\({\theta }_{{B}_{MAX}}\)). The parameters \({\theta }_{{k}_{net}}\) and \({\theta }_{{B}_{MAX}}\) followed log-normal distribution for between experiment variability as described in Eq. (1). Data from re-growth experiments was subsequently included and predictive performance of the models was evaluated.

$$\frac{dB}{dt}={-k}_{net}\times \mathrm{log}\left(\frac{B}{{B}_{MAX}}\right)\times B.$$ (2)

Isoniazid and rifampicin anti-mycobacterial effects were parameterised (Eq. 3) using maximum drug efficacy (\({\theta }_{{E}_{MAX}}\)) and potency (\({\theta }_{{IC}_{50}}\)) i.e. the concentration at which half-maximum inhibition is achieved with C being the isoniazid or rifampicin concentration and (\({\theta }_{\gamma }\)) being the shape factor.

$$Effect={\theta }_{{E}_{MAX}}\times \frac{{C}^{{\theta }_{\gamma }}}{{{\theta }_{{IC}_{50}}}^{{\theta }_{\gamma }}+ {C}^{{\theta }_{\gamma }}}.$$ (3)

Loss of susceptibility to isoniazid and or rifampicin over the course of the experiment was parameterised using \({\theta }_{BETA}\) i.e. magnitude of susceptibility loss and \({\theta }_{\lambda }\) i.e. onset of susceptibility loss as a function of time (Eq. 4).

$$Resistance\ emergence= 1- \beta \times \left(1- {e}^{-time\times {\theta }_{\lambda }}\right).$$ (4)

Drug combinations were evaluated as additive drug effects at first i.e. \(Effect=(Effec{t}_{isoniazid}\times Effec{t}_{tim{e}_{isoniazid}})+(Effec{t}_{rifampicin}\times Effec{t}_{tim{e}_{rifampicin}}))\) and subsequently the Bliss independence model was tested and retained31 i.e. \(Effect=((Effec{t}_{isoniazid}\times Effec{t}_{tim{e}_{isoniazid}})+(Effec{t}_{rifampicin}\times Effec{t}_{tim{e}_{rifampicin}}))-((Effec{t}_{isoniazid}\times Effec{t}_{tim{e}_{isoniazid}})\times (Effec{t}_{rifampicin}\times Effec{t}_{tim{e}_{rifampicin}}))\). Synergism and antagonism were evaluated as categorical effects for presence of drugs in combination and a drop in OFV of at least 3.84 (P = 0.05) was considered to improve the model’s ability to fit the data with statistical significance in stepwise covariate model building32.

Whole genome sequence analysis

Analysis of WGS data was divided in two steps. First all mutations relative to the H37Rv reference genome were determined for 33 genes of interest associated with resistance to rifampicin isoniazid ethambutol pyrazinamide streptomycin ethionamide amikacin capreomycin kanamycin fluoroquinolones para-aminosalicylic acid cycloserine linezolid bedaquiline clofazimine and delamanid (rpoB rpoC fabG1 inhA katG kasA ahpC embR embC embA embB rpsA pncA panD rpsL gid rrs ethA ethR tlyA eis gyrB gyrA folC ribD thyX thyA ald alr rplC rrl Rv0678 and fbiA). Bcftools (v. 1.11) bwa (v. 0.7.12) and samtools (v. 1.9) were used for variant calling using the number of forward reference reverse reference forward non-reference reverse non-reference alleles. The percentage of base pairs changed within genes were stratified by genes associated with isoniazid and/or rifampicin resistance (katG inhA fabG1 kasA rpoB and rpoC). Only base pairs with ≥ 15% changed to the H37Rv reference genome were used to calculate the percentage of base pairs changed within genes.

Tb-profiler (v. 3.0.1) was used to determine the SNPs by nucleotide changes33. Results were stratified by drug resistant nucleotide changes i.e. isoniazid and rifampicin associated resistance and other resistance that associate with any other of the aforementioned drugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather he says his motivation in accumulating wealth has always been about securing independence the freedom to do what he wishes in business and in life — and he wishes more people would follow his example.

""The world is not driven by greed. It's driven by envy"" Munger said at the annual meeting of the Daily Journal the newspaper company where he is a director earlier this year.

The 98-year-old who has amassed a fortune that Forbes estimates at $2.2 billion added that it's easy and common for people to become envious. No matter how much some people have someone else will always have more he noted.

It's a sentiment that Munger has expressed in the past and one he's previously attributed to his longtime friend and investment partner Warren Buffett. But Munger seems confident that he's overcome the tendency himself.

""I have conquered envy in my own life. I don't envy anybody"" Munger said. ""I don't give a damn what someone else has. But other people are driven crazy by it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9uZXctcHJvdmlkZW5jZS9zZWN0aW9ucy9hcnRzLWFuZC1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FydGljbGVzL2xvY2FsLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWFnZW50cy1naXZlLWJhY2stdG8tdGhlLWNvbW11bml0eS10aGV5LWxvdmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local Real Estate Agents Give Back to the Community They Love,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/new-providence/sections/arts-and-entertainment/articles/local-real-estate-agents-give-back-to-the-community-they-love on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9uZXctcHJvdmlkZW5jZS9zZWN0aW9ucy9hcnRzLWFuZC1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FydGljbGVzL2xvY2FsLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWFnZW50cy1naXZlLWJhY2stdG8tdGhlLWNvbW11bml0eS10aGV5LWxvdmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xMC90aGVtYXRpYy1ldGYtYm9vbS1zdGlsbC1nb2luZy1zdHJvbmctZGVzcGl0ZS1icnV0YWwteWVhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The $115 billion thematic ETF boom is still going strong despite a brutal year: 'We are narrative creatures',"Thematic investing can be traced as far back as 1948 when a mutual fund named the Television Fund was launched. And if it’s lasted this long it can survive the ravages of an inflation-lashed year — at least as far as proponents like Kenneth Lamont are concerned.

Aggressive rate hikes by central banks as they battle surging prices have been brutal for thematic ETFs a cohort of funds that target investments based on trends like robotics or electric cars. Rising borrowing costs have been hammering these riskier speculative bets.

Yet Lamont a nine-year veteran at Morningstar UK Ltd. sees reason for optimism. Even with an average drawdown of 30% for US thematic ETFs in 2022 — almost double the losses of the S&P 500 — outflows are less than 1% of the $115 billion in assets under management data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. It displays continuing faith in one of the hottest areas of investing that has helped power record-setting launches and growth for the $6 trillion ETF industry.

“It’s almost incredible how little the net outflow has been” Lamont Morningstar’s senior manager research analyst said by phone. “If these were really being used trendily we would’ve expected to see a sort of stampede for the door.”

Year-to-date 53% of thematic funds are underwater since their inception. Launches in 2022 have slowed to 38 from the 77 seen in the previous year while closures have picked up to 20 from five data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.

All the while investors have stuck around. Most famously Cathie Wood’s bellwether ARK Innovation ETF has added cash even as its price crashed 63% this year.

“From the demand side for these funds the genie is out of the bottle” said Lamont. “Thematic investing is captivating. We are narrative creatures and each fund and investment styles come with an inbuilt narrative.”

More broadly as of Dec. 7 firms have launched 422 new ETFs this year five more than the number seen over the same period in 2021. That total puts 2022 on track to surpass last year’s record for debuts even amid recent market turmoil across asset classes.

Among thematic funds innovation and emerging markets technology were the top themes driving inflows year-to-date to the tune of $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion respectively. Tech and communications saw the most outflows with $3.2 billion leaving such funds followed by cloud computing at $1.2 billion and robotics and artificial intelligence at $941 million.

The flight of money may not come as a big surprise as the tech sector faced multiple headwinds this year. Companies including Twitter Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have slashed their workforces by the thousands while other firms have been trimming staff and slowing hiring as they grapple with higher interest rates and a pullback in consumer spending.

The backdrop for equities remains challenged for the year ahead as concerns about the impact of Fed policy on growth and corporate earnings run rampant. To Athanasios Psarofagis a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst that suggests tougher times ahead in the thematic space.

“There’s likely going to be a purge” he said by phone. “The market is going to be more difficult going forward there’s just no way it will be able to support these.”

Issuers are unlikely to give up without a fight. Thematic ETFs charge a higher expense ratio by roughly 50 basis points compared to the average ETF according to data by Bloomberg Intelligence — a compelling reason to keep them trading and even to launch more.

Still Sylvia Jablonski chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs is bullish on the space. Investor conviction will be enough to support these funds she said most of which revolve around innovation digitalization artificial intelligence and advances in computing.

“As markets evolve and new themes become investable investors are more comfortable with the diversification of innovation in a basket versus banking on one name” she said. “There have been so many advances in classic sectors like energy tech communication pharma alternative energy and that has opened the doors for issuers with great ideas.”

In the hours and days following her death many of Alley’s co-stars from shows like Cheers and movies like Look Who’s Talking took to social media to pay tribute to their fellow actor and friend who also shined in everything from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan to Scream Queens and more.

As a way to pay our respects to the late award-winning actress we have put together a list of the best Kirstie Alley movies and TV shows you can watch streaming that can both serve as a reminder of her talent for longtime fans as well as an introduction to those not as familiar with her body of work. She may be gone but the dynamic actress will never be forgotten.

Cheers (1987 - 1993)

The long-running NBC sitcom Cheers was a show that had its fair share of memorable characters throughout its 11-season run including several that were introduced later that became some of the most iconic faces on the small screen. Woody Harrelson’s barkeep Woody Kelsey Grammer’s Frasier and Kirstie Alley’s Rebecca Howe all three fall into that camp.

Introduced during the sixth season of Cheers as the new manager of Sam Malone’s (Ted Danson) titular bar Alley originally started as a replacement for Shelley Long but quickly became one of the most dynamic members of the cast  receiving a Golden Globe an Emmy and multiple other accolades for her hilarious raw and fully realized portrayal of a classic TV character.

Look Who’s Talking (1989)

After having the child of her married boss accountant Mollie Jensen (Kirstie Alley) tries her best to raise her young son Mikey (voiced by Bruce Willis) a process that is both helped and hindered by cabbie James Ubriacco (John Travolta) who has a thing for the single mom.

Look Who’s Talking is remembered mostly for Willis’s iconic performance (which happens to be one of his best ) but the 1989 romantic comedy also features some of the best work from Alley and Travolta who have incredible chemistry throughout the film as well as its sequels.

Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan (1982)

Considered by most to be the best Star Trek movie  1982’s Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan has gone down as the most quotable dynamic and personal entry in the franchise. After the formidable Khan (Ricardo Montalban) wages war on James Kirk (William Shatner) and Starfleet the captain of the USS Enterprise must take the battle to the genetically enhanced superhuman and fight fire with fire.

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was Kirstie Alley’s feature film debut which makes her incredibly powerful portrayal of Spock’s (Leonard Nimoy) young protégé Saavik all the more impressive especially with the way in which she handles herself next to such accomplished actors.

Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)

The 1999 dark comedy mockumentary Drop Dead Gorgeous centers on the world of small-town beauty pageants specifically the teenage girls (and their mothers) preparing for the Sarah Rose Cosmetics Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant only for the contestants to start dying mysterious and highly suspicious deaths.

The Drop Dead Gorgeous cast is filled with tremendous actresses from top to bottom with the likes of Kirsten Dunst Denise Richards and even star-in-the-making Amy Adams . One of the best unsurprisingly is Kirstie Alley’s Gladys Leeman the head of the pageant committee who takes the competition to the extreme in a hilarious performance.

It Takes Two (1995)

The 1995 comedy It Takes Two follows Alyssa (Ashley Olsen) and Amanda (Mary-Kate Olsen) as two identical strangers who meet at summer camp and put together a plan that will solve all of their problems: swap places and make their caregivers fall in love.

The movie is mostly remembered for the Olsen Twins  but Kirstie Alley who plays Amanda’s social worker Diane and Steve Guttenberg who plays Alyssa’s father Roger add another level of charm to the family-friendly comedy creating an oldie but a goodie worth revisiting.

David’s Mother (1994)

The 1994 CBS movie David’s Mother follows Sally Goodson (Kirstie Alley) a divorcée who tries to raise her autistic teenage son (Michael A. Goorjian) and prevent him from being placed in a care home by social services while also trying to live out her own hopes and dreams.

Alley would win a Primetime Emmy Award for her incredible portrayal of a devoted and caring mother in this at times heartwarming and heartbreaking made-for-TV movie. Though not talked about as much as some of her more high-profile movies David’s Mom is right up there with anything else from her career.

For Richer Or Poorer (1997)

The 1997 comedy For Richer or Poorer follows New York City millionaires Brad (Tim Allen) and Caroline Sexton (Kirstie Alley) as they are forced to leave their life of luxury behind and hide out in an Amish community to avoid prosecution by the IRS after their accountant (Wayne Knight) files false tax returns and makes off with their cash.

Two of the biggest TV stars at the time Alley and Allen are at the top of their respective games in For Richer or Poorer and give two great performances and seem to be having a lot of fun on screen despite the movie failing to hit with audiences and critics upon release.

Deconstructing Harry (1998)

Woody Allen’s 1997 comedy film Deconstructing Harry has one of the most impressive casts from the writer-director’s career with names like Billy Crystal Robin Williams Demi Moore Elisabeth Shue and Tobey Maguire all appearing. This also includes Kirstie Alley who plays Allen’s on-screen wife Joan who catches her writer husband in an affair.

The scene in which Joan confronts Harry about his infidelity is honestly one of the best of Allen’s filmography and it balances pure and raw emotion (Joan crying on the floor) with great comedic timing (one of Joan’s psychiatry patients coming in midway) and continues to stand out 25 years later.

The Last Don (1997)

Years after crafting his masterpiece The Godfather Mario Puzo wrote another crime epic called The Last Don which was turned into the 1997 CBS miniseries of the same name. Following the Clericuzio crime family led by Don Domenico (Danny Aiello) the nearly four-hour story chronicles the ups and downs of the tumultuous family and the crime world in which they are part.

Kirstie Alley plays Rose Marie Clericuzio the daughter of Don Domenico who has perhaps the most tragic of all the outcomes in the sprawling epic. The depiction earned Alley heaps of praise including a Golden Globe nomination.

Summer School (1987)

Right around the same time she landed a role on Cheers Kirstie Alley appeared in the high school comedy  Summer School which saw her play Robin Bishop the love interest of Mark Harmon’s Freddy Shoop. The movie centers around Shoop a coach who is tricked into teaching a summer school class which leads to more than a few hilarious moments.

The pairing of Alley and Harmon really adds another dimension to the immature and goofy 1987 comedy about a slacker coach and a group of rambunctious troublemakers. Too bad it’s not talked about as much as its contemporaries.

Scream Queens (2016)

We also have the Ryan Murphy slasher comedy TV show  Scream Queens which ran on Fox for two seasons between 2015 and 2016. The first season is set on a college campus and follows the faculty and students as they deal with a serial killer who has returned and started to dress up as the school’s mascot while the second shifted things over to a hospital that finds the main characters once again dealing with a masked killer.

Kirstie Alley joined the Scream Queens Season 2 cast as Ingrid Hoffel an antagonistic character who makes it her mission to make life miserable for the show’s central characters at every turn. After seeing Alley play more likable characters over the years it was fun to see her go all-in with her portrayal on Scream Queens.

Veronica's Closet (1997 - 2000)

And then we have Veronica's Closet. A few years after Cheers closed up shop for good Kirstie Alley found her way back to NBC’s primetime slate with this sitcom. The series which debuted behind Seinfeld in the network’s “Must See TV” Thursday night block saw Alley play Veronica “Ronnie” Chase the owner of a lingerie company based in New York City.

The show which ran for four seasons and earned Alley a number of awards and other accolades was pretty much inescapable in the late ‘90s and early 2000s but there is currently no way to watch the series online or on DVD though we still felt her work in the series needed to be mentioned here.

Arizona Treasurer Kimberly Yee said in a statement released Thursday that the state treasury's Investment Risk Management Committee (IRMC) began to assess the relationship between the state's trust fund and BlackRock in late 2021.

""Part of the review by IRMC involved reading the annual letters by CEO Larry Fink which in recent years began dictating to businesses in the United States to follow his personal political beliefs"" Yee wrote. ""In short BlackRock moved from a traditional asset manager to a political action committee. Our internal investment team believed this moved the firm away from its fiduciary duty in general as an asset manager.""

ESG FALLOUT: BLACKROCK CEO LARRY FINK SHOULD RESIGN SAYS STATE TREASURER

In response to those findings Yee noted that Arizona began to divest over $543 million from BlackRock money market funds in February 2022 and ""reduced our direct exposure to BlackRock by 97%"" over the course of the year. Yee added that Arizona ""will continue to reduce our remaining exposure in BlackRock over time in a phased in approach that takes into consideration safe and prudent investment strategy that protects the taxpayers.""

Although the state will continue to hold some BlackRock stock through shares in a passive index of the top 1500 American corporations Arizona will have ""minimal direct exposure"" to BlackRock amounting to ""less than 1 tenth of one percent of our total assets under management"" as of the end of November. Yee said that Arizona intends to vote its shares in the index in an effort to ""change the political activism of BlackRock.""

""We will continue to fight back against the dangerous path of companies pushing their social issues and wokeism inside of the investment space and return to traditional money management that puts the people first"" Yee's statement concluded.

BLACKROCK'S ESG PUSH PUTS CEO LARRY FINK IN ACTIVIST CROSSHAIRS

BlackRock is currently the world's largest asset manager with roughly $8 trillion under management and is one of several major financial institutions that have led the charge for the adoption of ESG standards in recent years. The ESG movement broadly seeks to promote a green energy transition and left-wing social priorities through the financial sector. Critics of the ESG movement argue that its focus on green investments runs contrary to the fiduciary responsibility of firms to pursue the best possible returns for investors.

BlackRock pushed back against criticisms of its investment strategy in a statement to Fox Business which read in part: ""Over the past year BlackRock has been subject to campaigns suggesting we are either ‘too progressive’ or ‘too conservative’ in how we manage our clients’ money. We are neither. We are a fiduciary. We put our clients’ interests first and deliver the investment choices and performance they need. We will not let these campaigns sway us from delivering for our clients.""

The statement added ""In the U.S. alone clients awarded BlackRock $84 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter and $275 billion over the last twelve months.""

DESANTIS PRAISED FOR PULLING MONEY FROM BLACKROCK OVER ESG CONCERNS: ‘ILLEGAL LEFTIST SCAM’

The ESG policies advanced by BlackRock have drawn the ire of some investors and state policymakers alike.

Florida's chief financial officer announced recently that the state's treasury is taking action to remove about $2 billion in assets from BlackRock's stewardship before the end of this year. In October Louisiana and Missouri announced they would reallocate state pension funds away from BlackRock which amounted to roughly $1.3 billion in combined assets. Taken together with Arizona's divestment roughly $3.8 billion in state funds have been divested from BlackRock by those four states alone.

Additionally North Carolina's state treasurer has called for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's resignation and the Texas legislature has subpoenaed BlackRock for financial documents .

The investment firm has also taken heat from activists who argue BlackRock isn't doing enough to follow through with its ESG commitments. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander wrote to Fink in September citing an ""alarming"" contradiction between the company's words and its deeds. Lander wrote ""BlackRock cannot simultaneously declare that climate risk is a systemic financial risk and argue that BlackRock has no role in mitigating the risks that climate change poses to its investments by supporting decarbonization in the real economy.""

BlackRock has insisted that its ""role in the transition is as a fiduciary to our clients"" and ""to help them navigate investment risks and opportunities not to engineer a specific decarbonization outcome in the real economy.""

For months Republicans have been attacking ESG the financial shorthand for how some companies consider all the ways the environment social issues and corporate governance impact their bottom line. One of the GOP’s recent targets is BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager which oversees some $8 trillion in assets as a symbol of the financial community’s growing recognition that climate change is too big to ignore.

Republican leaders call the business world’s recognition of climate science a symptom of “wokeism.” In a white paper released this week the Republican minority on the Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs recently called out the “big three” firms BlackRock Vanguard and States Street “as our new emperors” taking issue with their involvement in a non-binding coalition that supports reaching a portfolio of net-zero emissions by 2050.

“The conclusions are built on flawed premises and risk harming millions of everyday investors that rely on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to help them retire with dignity” BlackRock said in response to the GOP’s report.

ESG may be the right’s new boogeyman but it’s a misunderstood concept that has been around for a long time; in 2004 the UN secretary-general challenged financial institutions to better account for environmental social and corporate governance issues. But ESG gained visibility in the past few years especially after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink penned a letter to CEOs in 2021 urging ESG as the future.

ESG is not a regulation or a set of rules and it does not require any real action from a corporation. It’s mostly used as a catch-all term for any investment that considers social and environmental responsibility. In fact what counts as ESG is so ill-defined and malleable it has been criticized as a way to “greenwash” corporate actions.

One of the defining ideas of ESG is that a company is better off accounting and reporting environmental and social risks to investors and clients rather than being willfully blind to the world around it. This can include a broad swath of issues such as a company’s reliance on oil gas and coal or exposure to sea-level rise in coastal operations human rights violations of the countries it operates in and lack of board diversity and CEO transparency. A big part of the ESG movement at least right now is largely about disclosure of these potential bottom-line risks in the future not necessarily doing anything differently in the present.

But Republican officials in West Virginia Texas Louisiana Missouri and now Florida have withdrawn billions of dollars from BlackRock’s management. Proponents are planning to introduce a slew of bills in at least 15 states next year to divest pensions and boycott companies for considering sustainability as an aim. At the federal level House GOP lawmakers are preparing antitrust investigations.

To get to the bottom of what is driving this I spoke to one of the state officials leading the attack on ESG Riley Moore state treasurer of West Virginia. The way he sees it “banks are coercing capital away” from coal gas and oil industries. He explains he doesn’t want the coal- and gas-reliant state to contract its financial services with a company that is “trying to diminish those dollars. They want less coal mining they want less fracking.”

This is getting much bigger than BlackRock State Street and Vanguard companies that used to be solidly at the right of corporate America. There are real stakes for pensioners red-state taxpayers and the wider economy if the GOP succeeds in scaring off financial institutions from pursuing climate targets.

ESG isn’t woke but it is evidence of the free market at work

The backlash began early in 2021 when three events sent the signal that ESG was here to stay. The first was Larry Fink’s embrace of ESG noting in his 2021 letter that “No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients’ lists of priorities. They ask us about it nearly every day.” The second came in March when the Biden administration proposed a regulation to require climate risk disclosure from publicly traded companies parallel to rules being adopted by the European Union. The third and final was an unlikely coup staged at the annual Exxon shareholder board meeting.

Last year Engine No. 1 a small hedge fund earned enough votes to gain three Exxon board seats despite the company’s recommendation against it. It wouldn’t have been possible without the support of Exxon’s three largest shareholders BlackRock Vanguard and State Street voting representing 20 percent of the voting share. The new board members’ mission was focused on understanding the risks climate change and regulation will pose to the company.

The win was the clearest sign yet that there was a realignment happening in financial markets and that even the fossil fuel industry couldn’t ignore the effects of climate change. Investors as the Engine No. 1 win showed are already clamoring for this kind of information. The assets BlackRock handles far outnumber what Republicans could divest. For example two-thirds of BlackRock’s largest clients in its strategic partner program representing assets over $3 trillion support the energy transition according to BlackRock. ESG isn’t going away — by 2025 global ESG assets are expected to make up a third of all projected assets under management — and it keeps growing. ESG funds are also now packaged for retail use like for retirement savings.

On the left ESG has for years come under criticism as a form of greenwashing and ESG disclosure isn’t the same thing as corporate behavior. As Harvard Business Review noted the funding in ESG is “dedicated to assuring returns for shareholders not delivering positive planetary impact.” Many environmentalists think ESG is a distraction from the main issue they’d like to see traction on: companies disclosing the impact their products and investments have on the world around them and accounting for that in decisions.

ESG doesn’t go this far. In no way will disclosure be enough to save the planet from climate change. There are no binding requirements either. But what Republican critics of ESG really fear is that the financial world will realign with climate science and no longer see new coal plants and offshore drilling as viable projects to finance.

Many of the Republican attacks on ESG stem from a misrepresentation of what it actually means. It’s not always motivated by an altruistic climate or social agenda. ESG also helps banks and public companies meet their one goal by screening investments for various risks. “They’ve got a fiduciary duty to generate returns. So they’re not going to impose some agenda whether it’s climate or social agenda that’s going to get in the way of returns” said University of Oxford business expert Robert Eccles.

As baseless as the attacks have been the pressure could still work. Vanguard on Wednesday announced it is withdrawing from the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition in which companies voluntarily committed to reaching net-zero emissions in their portfolios by 2050. In an apparent nod to the ongoing GOP’s investigations Vanguard said it withdrew “so that we can provide the clarity our investors desire about the role of index funds and about how we think about material risks including climate-related risks — and to make clear that Vanguard speaks independently on matters of importance to our investors.”

The right’s baffling one-year campaign against ESG

After Engine No. 1’s coup the attacks started to crystallize from the right spearheaded by conservative advocacy circles. There have been two groups at the center of these attacks both supported by the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo who led the right’s legal strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade. Those groups Consumers Research and State Financial Officers Foundation are conservative nonprofits also funded by groups with anonymous funding.

These groups’ involvement suggests a deep-pocketed campaign. “This is an artificially created conversation topic that’s not being led by financial stakeholders. It’s political stakeholders that are driving this forward” said Jacey Bingler senior communications campaigner of the climate finance advocacy group Sunrise Project.

There have been four main prongs to the right’s strategy. Republicans plan to undertake antitrust investigations next year at the state and federal levels against these giant corporations. Just before the election Senate Republicans sent a letter to top law firms warning of investigations around ESG claiming they suspect collusion. The second is what states like West Virginia and Florida have already done: pulling their state operating funds from BlackRock and other banks’ management.

The final two prongs are considered potentially the most damaging to taxpayers and pensioners in red states. One is the model bill that is circulating in red states called the State Government Employee Retirement Protection Act. It divests teachers police officers state-employed nurses and other employees’ pensions from companies that are on a boycott list. Eventually experts worry this ban could mean the pensions are overweighted in fossil fuels and less diverse leaving the people depending on their retirement subject to more market volatility.

The final tactic is a boycott list where the state only seeks contracts with financing from companies that do not consider climate change in their calculations. Practically speaking that means if a state wants to build a highway and needs financing it could wind up being charged higher fees because there is less need for those banks to compete with better deals.

The ESG backlash is an extension of the right’s ideological schism on climate change

It’s not clear what’s motivating this new front in the GOP’s culture wars. It’s not a winning political issue given that most voters aren’t familiar with terms like ESG nor is ESG a top priority of the climate movement.

There’s another theory though. “It’s intended to delay climate action without having to admit that that’s what they’re attempting to do” Sunrise’s Bingler said. “Republicans have essentially created a new installment in this culture war where they tend to pick relatively niche topics that don’t necessarily resonate with large parts of society without this artificial attempt to continue to fan the flames.”

For over a decade the main plank of the GOP has ignored climate science cycling through various excuses not to take action on greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the electorate thinks climate change is real and is concerned to some degree about it and rising extreme weather is making it more undeniable.

But many Republican leaders don’t recognize that science. West Virginia’s treasurer Moore is one of them.

“You’re talking about climate changing you know in 100 years” he said. “I mean these folks are hedging on what the climate might look like in 100 years. Tell me exactly for a pension beneficiary who is going to retire in the next 10 years how carbon emissions is going to affect the financial outcomes and vitality of a given publicly traded company.”

“So what you’re telling me is you’re going to have sea levels rise by X amount of centimeters in 100 years and that somehow is going to affect the profitability of a company?” he continued. “Not sure I follow that.”

Climate activists — and even some investors — have said that the GOP pushback against ESG is a political issue not primarily an economic one. There’s also no clear anti-ESG consensus among typical allies of Republicans; the Kentucky Bankers Association in November sued the state attorney general for overstepping his authority by demanding documents related to ESG.

So the issue’s salience in the next two years will depend entirely on how it resonates with voters and potentially factors into the presidential election. Many experts were skeptical it could ever gain political relevance but still worry what the endgame is. Does this mean a future of “blue banks” and “red banks”? Will financial behemoths be frightened into weakening already-weak climate targets? It’s too early to say.

But the right’s war on banks won’t necessarily drive a back-pedaling on climate goals. BlackRock has tempered its interest in climate publicly since the ESG attacks began but other institutions have pushed ahead.

“Market participants will continue to demand ESG data and incorporate it in risk models” said Ivan Frishberg chief sustainability officer of Amalgamated Bank a bank with a socially responsible mission. “That is capitalism doing what it does best: seeking more data for better client responsiveness and a more systemic view. The pushback on ESG is essentially a denial of capitalism. Ultimately our clients are going to drive the products and approaches we take and guide how we respond as a firm.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYmxhY2ttb24vMjAyMi8xMi8xMC9kaW1vbi1oaWdobGlnaHRzLW5lZWQtZm9yLW1vcmUtb2lsLWFuZC1nYXMtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1hcy12YW5ndWFyZC1iYWlscy1vbi1lc2ctZ3JvdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dimon Highlights Need For More Oil And Gas Investment As Vanguard Bails On ESG Group,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2022/12/10/dimon-highlights-need-for-more-oil-and-gas-investment-as-vanguard-bails-on-esg-group/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYmxhY2ttb24vMjAyMi8xMi8xMC9kaW1vbi1oaWdobGlnaHRzLW5lZWQtZm9yLW1vcmUtb2lsLWFuZC1nYXMtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1hcy12YW5ndWFyZC1iYWlscy1vbi1lc2ctZ3JvdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWUvaXJlbGFuZC9vcmdhbmlzZXItb2YtYW5udWFsLWNocmlzdG1hcy1tZWFsLWZvci12dWxuZXJhYmxlLXBlb3BsZS1zYXlzLWZlYXItb2YtY292aWQtcmVtYWlucy0xNDA0MjcyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Organiser of annual Christmas meal for vulnerable people says fear of Covid remains,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWUvaXJlbGFuZC9vcmdhbmlzZXItb2YtYW5udWFsLWNocmlzdG1hcy1tZWFsLWZvci12dWxuZXJhYmxlLXBlb3BsZS1zYXlzLWZlYXItb2YtY292aWQtcmVtYWlucy0xNDA0MjcyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00DD70BE0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

(Olivia Vanni / The Herald)

Company doctors found it “difficult” to link chemicals to worker ailments. A thorough study would’ve been “inviting liability” an attorney said.

Editor’s note: This is part of ongoing coverage examining the dangers of chemical exposure to Boeing workers in the Puget Sound region including the Everett plant. According to records obtained exclusively by The Daily Herald the aerospace company has attempted to study the toxicity of chemicals used in its factories — and their potential to impact worker health — with mixed results.

AUBURN — After a series of miscarriages among her pregnant colleagues in 1985 a shop steward in Plastics Fabrication was the first to ask the troubling question.

Women in building 17.05 of the Boeing Company’s Auburn plant began to wonder if the chemicals they used were to blame. Their concerns triggered a company study.

But the answer was neither simple nor definitive.

In short Boeing’s health and safety experts found what appeared to be an “elevated” rate of miscarriages: 11 of 41 pregnancies among the cohort of study participants or about 27 percent of cases according to a health survey. The normal rate was more like 10 to 20 percent according to studies cited by Boeing.

Further analysis found the worker sample size was too small to “conclude with certainty whether or not the overall rate of miscarriage in the Auburn Plastic Bench Mechanics is higher than the overall rate of miscarriage in the general population.” A corporate memo reported that “no single agent can be identified as a cause of miscarriage in this study” but pointed to a few chemical products that were “implicated by this study as being associated with miscarriage” records show.

The Environmental Protection Agency reviewed the results of the miscarriage study and opined that it warranted further research. However according to depositions of Boeing officials this year that follow-up never happened.

The internal documents were among hundreds of pages of historical company records discussed in the depositions taken in a series of lawsuits claiming Boeing factory employees sustained reproductive harm from chemicals they handled on the job. The exposure resulted in “catastrophic” birth defects in the workers’ children born between 1980 and 2014 the lawsuits allege. The families’ attorneys suspect there are many more people who suffer from lifelong health problems or genetic disorders because of the toxins their parents worked at Boeing manufacturing facilities during the past four decades.

Over the years Boeing has tried to analyze the health repercussions of industrial poisons routinely used by its workforce the records show. Yet some of these efforts fizzled before reaching any firm conclusions.

Company epidemiologists spent years building the foundation for a database to find links between specific chemicals employees used and workers’ health ailments according to the testimony of Dr. J. Michael Muhm manager of epidemiology for Boeing from 1987 to 1992.

But as Muhm explained in a June 7 deposition “it was very very difficult to link the chemicals with which employees worked to the employees.”

“It was not something that was reasonably done on a corporate-wide — or on a company basis” said Muhm who worked for Boeing until he retired in 2010. “… I think this was an intent but I don’t believe we were ever successful at creating this database.”

The documents underscore the complexities of understanding the harm workers could suffer — and possibly pass on to their children.

“One of the realities of industrial workplaces is that unless the company chooses to do a study to determine whether the chemicals it’s using are causing adverse effects amongst its workers and the children of its workers then it’s very hard for regulators and the scientific community to know what is going on and what health effects are occurring” said plaintiff’s attorney Michael Connett a partner at Waters Kraus & Paul who specializes in birth defect litigation.

That’s a massive conflict of interest he explained.

If a study provides evidence that chemicals cause harm “then the company is inviting liability” Connett said. “So companies are disincentivized from doing studies that would bring to light the full spectrum of consequences of the chemicals it handles.”

Boeing has declined to comment on the lawsuits and depositions citing company policy.

In court filings the company has argued that the children’s birth defects were not caused by chemicals in its facilities and that it has always taken measures to protect its employees from potential health hazards.

In October the company reached terms on an out-of-court settlement with one of the plaintiffs a North Bend woman born with a heart defect in 1980 when her mother worked at a Boeing Field factory.

Two other lawsuits still pending were filed by the families of two men who became fathers while working as mechanics at the Everett plant.

While reporting on the litigation The Daily Herald obtained eight depositions of current and former employees including more than a hundred exhibits of corporate memos reports and scientific studies discussed by high-ranking company officials over the past 40 years.

‘The baseline data’

As early as the 1940s there was recognition in the medical community that pregnant women are more sensitive to industrial chemicals than the general population.

A top doctor at Boeing warned the company president in 1980 of the disastrous potential of a long list of chemicals and urged improvements to the “industrial hygiene” program The Herald has reported.

But the suggestion wasn’t well received by then-President Malcolm Stamper noted Dr. Barry Dunphy then the company’s occupational health manager. Dunphy remarked that Stamper “did not appear at all sympathetic or indeed faintly happy” about having “this organizational problem brought to his attention” the deposition records show.

The Auburn Reproductive Health Survey marked a recognition by the company in July 1986 that more information was needed about the harmful effects of chemicals in use at its workplace.

Despite growing concerns about reproductive hazards childbearing women and their partners might encounter on the job the survey noted “many chemicals have not been studied for reproductive health effects.”

“The reasons for lack of information on reproductive effects of chemicals include insufficient data from animal experiments on most commercial chemicals and the difficulty of collecting valid information from studies of human populations exposed to chemicals” says the survey report written by a company epidemiologist.

The Auburn plant study considered dozens of chemicals including some organic solvents already suspected of being dangerous to the reproductive system. On the list were toluene xylene petroleum distillates and methyl ethyl ketone — some of the same organic solvents named in the recent birth defect lawsuits.

Following the initial 1986 survey Boeing began evaluating more of its materials for the potential to cause reproductive harm to mothers and fathers working in its factories records show. An internal report drafted in 1987 outlined the company’s plan to build a list and “continue to add to our information profile” as scientific knowledge advanced.

“At the same time an increasing number of chemicals are being introduced into the workplace and new industrial processes/tasks are utilized” says the report. “Evaluation of potential exposure should keep pace with these developments and this represents the baseline data upon which future studies can be performed.”

‘Study the relationship’

Two years after the first report on the Auburn plant miscarriages the company’s corporate health and safety manager documented mixed conclusions about the data in a 1988 memo addressed to the Auburn Human Relations and the Auburn Executive Safety Council.

“The overall rate of miscarriage in the organizations included in this study is not conclusively higher than that in the general population but the results of this study do more to support that contention than to refute it” says a draft of the memo.

Chemicals associated with higher rates of miscarriage included solvent components in “Frekote 700” a parting compound and “Scotchweld adhesive film AF 163-2K.” Miscarriages were also clustered among women whose jobs involved heavy lifting.

The memo noted the study’s limitations including its small size. It also only accounted for “medically confirmed” pregnancies so it could have missed early-term miscarriages.

“My understanding of the conclusion of the study was that there wasn’t a significant difference in the number of miscarriages in this group compared to the general population” said Boeing Senior Toxicologist Brittany Weldon when she was deposed to speak on the company’s behalf in August.

She was not aware of any further study of the miscarriages.

But according to the January 1988 memo Boeing had plans to revisit the issue.

“The Boeing Company is currently developing an Employee Health and Safety Module as part of the Integrated Employee Record System a computerized data base which will enhance our ability to study the relationship between exposure to various hazardous agents and adverse medical outcomes” wrote M. H. Stewart Boeing’s corporate safety and health manager in the memo. “When this system is functional a study of the Auburn area will be repeated to reassess the rate of miscarriage in Plastic Bench Mechanics.”

That spring Boeing also shared these plans with the EPA when disclosing the Auburn study results as required by the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA asked Boeing to report back with any further findings and suggested that there were other outcomes such as low birth rate that Boeing could examine for signs of reproductive harm.

“Boeing’s investigations demonstrate the difficulty involved in studying reproductive hazards in the workplace” says an EPA report from April 1988.

“Although it cannot be determined that any particular chemical exposure or process or workplace activity was the cause of miscarriages among the employees at this Boeing facility” the report continues “the studies do signal the need for a more extensive examination of the rate of miscarriages at the facility and suggest the need for a monitoring program for workplace exposure to numerous chemicals.”

‘White with dust’

In the 1980s and 1990s Boeing faced mounting pressure for more information about the connection between chemicals and workforce maladies. Controversy erupted in 1987 over the use of phenol formaldehyde resin a component in a woven fiberglass cloth that the company began using that year to meet Federal Aviation Administration regulations on flammability.

Though the company discontinued the use of the chemical the following year it faced the blowback for the next decade including criticism for its handling of related workers compensation claims and scrutiny from regulators. A lawsuit brought by sickened workers led to a landmark state Supreme Court ruling and — ultimately — a multi-million dollar settlement.

When the company began testing the new material at the Auburn plant in February 1987 a supervisor noted employees “complained of dizziness dryness in nose and throat burning eyes and upset stomach” according to court records in the lawsuit.

There was an “obnoxious odor” according to the court records and the air at the production facility was “white with dust.” The supervisor remarked that he expected the problem would only get worse “as temperatures rise and production increases.” Records show he asked for improved ventilation but management denied the request saying odors didn’t warrant the cost of the upgrades.

The problem did indeed get worse according to court records and media reports.

Workers started to pass out on the job.

The company discontinued the use of phenol formaldehyde in December 1988 the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported.

Dozens of workers filed claims with the company’s in-house insurance saying they had been sickened by the chemical during the short time it was in use. Boeing questioned the legitimacy of many of them.

A physician panel assembled by the company to review the claims opined in 1989 that some of the physical symptoms were likely the result of anxiety and there was no clear link between the chemical and the health problems.

The complaints fueled a growing recognition among doctors that more research was needed to understand the impact of industrial toxins on workers’ health. Some doctors adopted the term “multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome” to refer to chemically induced illness. However many in the mainstream medical community didn’t accept the term as a real diagnosis. The concept remains controversial today.

Fourteen of the Auburn factory workers took their concerns to King County Superior Court in 1991. They sued the company alleging they suffered lasting injuries and disabilities because of Boeing’s “deliberate intent to injure” and “outrageous conduct.”

The plaintiffs accused the company of removing chemical labels harassing employees who sought protective gear threatening to fire those who sought medical restrictions and using workers as human experiment subjects without their consent. They also alleged the company would clean facilities and ventilation before regulatory inspections to skew test results.

The Washington State Supreme Court remarked in a 1995 ruling that the case was the first to reach the court “in which the acts alleged go beyond gross negligence of the employer and involve willful disregard of actual knowledge by the employer of continuing injuries to employees.”

The landmark ruling in the case Birklid v. Boeing Co. expanded the ability of workers to sue companies for injuries they sustained on the job. The state’s highest court held the plaintiffs “demonstrated facts sufficient to justify a jury in finding a deliberate intention by Boeing to injure them.”

“Boeing contended that the workers were not exposed to toxic chemicals beyond safe levels” the ruling said. “The plaintiffs note however that regardless of so-called ‘safe’ levels of exposure Boeing anticipated that those levels would make its workers sick and in fact the workers became sick.”

The company settled the case out of court for an undisclosed amount according to a 1997 report by The Seattle Times. One source told The P-I it was in the millions of dollars.

‘High exposures’

Amid the controversy over phenol formaldehyde worker unions and scientific experts questioned whether regulations were enough to protect workers given that federal officials found levels of the chemical passed air quality tests at the Auburn plant.

Deposition records in the recent lawsuits also highlight potential shortfalls of regulatory limits on chemicals in workplace air — especially when it comes to birth defects.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys have argued that federally accepted standards weren’t designed to protect everyone.

As of 1991 Boeing’s Occupational Health Examination Guide for Physicians acknowledged that “the potential for adverse reproductive effects were given only minimal consideration” in establishing widely used safety limits for worker chemical exposure.

“Nevertheless if exposures are maintained within these limits the possibility of any adverse reproductive effects will be minimized” says the guide.

A 1990s-era “instructor’s guide” for Boeing’s hazard communication training advises that chemicals can still cause adverse health effects even below legal thresholds set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

For decades OSHA has required companies to inventory their chemicals and disclose the risks of each to its workers.

“For many substances exposure below the limits can be hazardous” says the instructor’s pamphlet created to guide factory worker training. “In addition people vary a lot in their response to chemicals. There are always people who will react to even low concentrations of chemicals.”

As the pamphlet explains the only way to know if someone’s exposure to a chemical exceeds the legal limit is monitoring — by measuring the concentration of the chemical in their breathing zone.

The most effective ways to protect workers from overexposure include “replacing hazardous chemicals with safer ones” and “local exhaust ventilation are the best controls” says the guide. Boeing also instructed workers on when and how to wear personal protective equipment or PPE such as gloves and respirators.

But protective gear can only do so much the instructor’s guide says.

“It does nothing to remove chemicals from the environment” it says “so that if the PPE is no good or fails high exposures could result.”

‘A very weak type of study’

As a Renton-based corporate epidemiologist Dr. Muhm tried to find data sources to analyze the health of Boeing’s workforce in the late 1980s and early 1990s he testified. His team laid the groundwork for an analysis of employee mortality data for any “unusual” trends among the company’s employees or subgroups of workers.

“That was an end point that was fairly definite and could be used to determine if the employees of The Boeing Company had health experiences similar to the general population or higher” he explained. “… The company used a number of toxic chemicals and clearly we were interested if there was any adverse effects of those.”

The epidemiology group collected employee death certificates showing how current and former employees died he said. The group also gathered corporate illness and injury statistics as well as some health information from the employee health insurance provider.

“There were efforts to modify externally sourced databases and make them work in the Boeing environment” Muhm said. “That was an exceedingly complex and for me frustrating effort that had never (come) to pass.”

Muhm said there might also have been some “rudimentary analysis” when he was a manager of the epidemiology group but said that he did not remember the results.

“The best we could do at that point was called a proportionate mortality study where you looked at the portions of deaths out of the total number of deaths due to a certain cause and determine whether or not those proportions were similar to or different from that in a standard population and as a very — a very weak type of study” he said.

Toward the end of his time in the epidemiology group he was reassigned to a “corporate-wide search” for any documentation of negative health effects that the company had failed to turn over to regulators.

The Toxic Substances Control Act required such documents be turned over to the EPA at a price of roughly $25000 per day late per document. However the federal agency had announced an amnesty program allowing companies to turn them in without penalty according to Muhm’s testimony. Muhm said he didn’t remember exactly how many documents he gathered that met the legal reporting requirements — or what they said.

But what he found he testified was enough to save the company millions.

‘By submitted diagnosis’

From 1992 to 2000 Muhm served as manager of Boeing Occupational Health Services in the medical department. He oversaw a program “responsible for testing and monitoring health of 40000 employees” according to his curriculum vitae.

During his time in the role the company obtained employee insurance claims data from King County Medical deposition records show.

“Occupational Health Services has recently begun processing the Boeing employee insurance claims data received from King County Medical” Muhm wrote in a 1994 internal memo to the company’s medical director. “To date we have counted the numbers of employees submitting claims and the number of claims submitted by submitted diagnosis. This provides information that is of value to other physicians in Boeing Medical.”

Attached to the memo was a one-page “sample report” that listed employee claims data for 200 different cancers diseases and other health conditions from 1987-1993. However the one-page list lacks context such as the total number of employees whose data was sought or the baseline prevalence of the diagnoses in the general population.

In his deposition Muhm said he could not recall any further analysis of the data.

“Whether or not we went beyond this I don’t know” Muhm testified when asked about the numbers “but we did get access to this private insurance data.”

In the mid-1990s the company also contracted with the University of Washington to study the incidence of lung cancer among Boeing workers who used chromium.

The study did not rely on insurance claims data though. Instead the cancer data came from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Cancer Surveillance System said Muhm one of the study’s authors.

The study cost Boeing about $30000 according to a contract with the university. Boeing provided the school with employee job history data and UW agreed not to identify Boeing in the study published in 1996.

The study cohort consisted of 2500 workers who had spent at least six months in jobs involving hexavalent chromium exposure from 1974 to 1994. Among them researchers counted fifteen cases of lung cancer and four other cases of respiratory cancer.

“Although based on few cases an elevated lung cancer risk was found in subjects who had worked for 5 or more years as a chrome plater or surface processor tank tender … and sander/masker or polisher” the study concluded. “A clear association was not observed between chromate exposure and the risk of lung cancer in this population of workers.”

Today Chromium-6 or hexavalent chromium is widely considered carcinogenic to workers. According to OSHA the longer a worker is exposed the more likely they are to develop lung nasal and sinus cancer.

‘Historically exposed’

For years Boeing also collected data on employee health through “medical surveillance” or health monitoring as part of its occupational health and safety program.

According to the 1991 physicians’ exam guide these periodic examinations were required for employees who were exposed to chemicals over certain thresholds established either by law or the corporate medical director. Sometimes the exams included “biological monitoring” tests of a worker’s blood or urine.

As a result of new OSHA regulations in the 1990s Boeing was required to offer medical screenings to employees who worked with materials containing cadmium records show.

In 1994 Boeing began testing employees who were being exposed to cadmium on the job.

As of August of that year more than 500 Boeing Puget Sound employees had been tested according to an internal company memo. About 10 of those tests yielded abnormal results Muhm wrote in the memo.

“Boeing’s tested population continues to be very similar to the OSHA non exposed populations in all measures” says the memo.

With promising early results the company initially hoped to get a “variance from the requirement to identify and biomonitor historically exposed employees” records show.

But they encountered resistance from the union representative who still wanted to see testing results from employees who might have been exposed in the past. Muhm was involved in identifying who needed to be tested to comply with the new rules according to his deposition. As he confirmed in his deposition as more time passed cadmium levels measurable in those employees’ bodies would diminish.

To meet the regulations Boeing began offering medical screening to employees whose past assignments involved potential exposure to cadmium for five years or more.

In January 1995 the company started by mailing screening paperwork to “historically exposed” workers in Everett. Those results too largely came back normal records show.

But at Muhm’s recommendation employees considered “historically exposed” were given the chance to opt out of screenings.

“In this case the exposures no longer exist for historically exposed employees (or they would be currently exposed) and the information gained by the testing will have little/no effect on their health” Muhm wrote in a 1994 memo.

“It will have more of an impact on the company’s liability” he added “should any of these employees develop renal failure or lung cancer somewhere down the road.”

Silverstein Properties has opened up a $1.5 billion fund to convert unwanted offices into housing.

The move comes at a time when several major cities are grappling with high office vacancies in their downtown core.

Silverstein is targeting acquisitions in New York San Francisco Boston and Washington D.C.

That empty high-rise office building in your neighborhood may soon be turned into housing.

Silverstein Properties one of America's largest commercial landlords announced in the first week of December that it is raising more than $1.5 billion to convert unwanted office space into residential housing in markets ranging from New York to San Francisco.

Prior to the pandemic office buildings were the lifeblood of central business districts across the country. Central offices were the reason that employees braved traffic congestion hopped on public transportation and bought their morning coffee and bagel at a local bakery. But in the two-plus years since the start of pandemic office occupancy rates have not fully recovered as remote work continues to gut downtown areas.

For example data from commercial real estate giant CBRE shows that about 25% of all New York's offices remain available for lease while other markets like San Francisco and Boston face similarly high vacancy rates. These figures are well-above their pre-pandemic averages and seem unlikely to change given the high demand for remote and hybrid work opportunities.

Silverstein's move also comes at a time when commercial real estate property values are declining. Data from Green Street a commercial real estate market analysis firm shows that commercial property values have declined by 13% over the past 12 months which lowers the financial barrier to entry for developers who want to take on conversion projects.

Silverstein CEO Marty Burger told Bloomberg in a recent interview that these market conditions have created an estimated $10 billion opportunity to convert unwanted offices into new residential housing.

""Now is the perfect storm where office is not in favor and the residential market is very hot"" Burger said. ""Hopefully we can acquire some of these office buildings that may be obsolete or may not be their highest and best use as an office building and convert them to residential use which the city desperately needs.""

Such conversion projects — also described as adaptive reuse — became a go-to tactic for many residential developers during the pandemic as banks hotel chains and even some churches shed their real estate holdings in order to maintain stable financial footing.

According to a November study from RentCafe developers created more than 28000 apartments through conversion projects in 2021 an increase of 25% when compared to 2020. The same study estimates that roughly 77000 new apartments will be added nationally via adaptive reuse conversions by the end of 2022. Should pandemic conditions linger and companies continue to allow employees to work from home this figure could grow even more in the coming years.

Doug Ressler a business intelligence manager at Yardi Matrix which helped RentCafe compile the report said that larger office buildings in central business districts and downtown areas are better suited for conversion projects because they're in dense areas with high demand for housing compared to buildings in more suburban markets.

And having already been down a similar path before Silverstein Properties is positioning itself as a leader in the emerging market. The company converted an office at 116 John Street in New York's Financial District into a 416-unit market-rate apartment complex in 2021 rental listing site StreetEasy indicates.

Then in May 2022 Silverstein and Metro Loft acquired a 30-story tower at 55 Broad Street also in the heart of New York's Financial District for roughly $180 million and plans on turning the building into market-rate apartments Commercial Observed reported in May.







Other developers such as Emily Hubbard co-founder of Sage Investment Group which specializes in multifamily conversion projects suggest that conversions are a cheaper alternative to building new homes from the ground up given that the cost of borrowing money and construction materials have both skyrocketed over the past two years.

Conversions can also be profitable Hubbard said. Sage acquired Econo Lodge and a Travel Lodge in Tacoma Washington for $14.2 million and plans to convert both buildings into apartments. Hubbard told Insider in September that Sage is expecting each building to produce a return rate of around 40% similar to other conversion projects that Sage has completed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvY2VsZWJyaXR5L2FydGljbGUvMzIwMjY5Mi9pbnNpZGUtbWFyay13YWhsYmVyZ3MtdXMyODUtbWlsbGlvbi1lbnRvdXJhZ2UtbWFuc2lvbi1zcHJhd2xpbmctcHJvcGVydHktZmVhdHVyZWQtaGl0LXNob3fSAZkBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL2NlbGVicml0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMDI2OTIvaW5zaWRlLW1hcmstd2FobGJlcmdzLXVzMjg1LW1pbGxpb24tZW50b3VyYWdlLW1hbnNpb24tc3ByYXdsaW5nLXByb3BlcnR5LWZlYXR1cmVkLWhpdC1zaG93?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Mark Wahlberg’s US$28.5 million Entourage mansion in Beverly Hills,"Then in the early 2000s he starred in big-budget action films including The Perfect Storm and Planet of the Apes.

The site features a Google-like search service where users can type in questions like “do masks reduce the spread of COVID?” In seconds the screen displays a list of scientific papers on the subject along with a sentence summarizing the key findings of each one.

A pair of former college football players turned entrepreneurs say they’ve cracked the code with a new search engine designed to make complex academic papers accessible to anybody.

The latest artificial intelligence systems can create original works of art or write high-quality essays without human assistance. But are they smart enough to make sense of the latest in scientific research?

“We really built this for people like ourselves” said Christian Salem who played backup quarterback for Northwestern University in suburban Chicago from 2012 to 2016 and graduated with a degree in economics. “We are technology professionals who secretly wish that we were scientists . . . but don’t have the time or attention span to read scientific papers.”

Cofounder Eric Olson a native of Sudbury played right tackle at Northwestern and earned a master’s degree in predictive analytics. Olson later worked as a data scientist at Boston-based sports betting company DraftKings while Salem became a product manager for the National Football League.

Olson and Salem aren’t the first to try their hand at a science search engine. Since 2015 Seattle’s Allen Institute for AI has operated Semantic Scholar a website that summarizes the contents of academic research papers.

And in mid-November tech titan Meta the parent of Facebook launched a public beta version of a tool called Galactica that had been trained to summarize 48 million academic papers. But Galactica was shut down after just two days because its results were often meaningless gibberish.

“At launch we outlined the limitations that come with large language models such as Galactica including the potential for it to generate inaccurate and unreliable output” Meta said in a statement. “Given the propensity of large language models such as Galactica to generate text that may appear authentic but is inaccurate . . . we chose to remove the demo from public availability.”

Carl Bergstrom a professor of biology at the University of Washington who gave it a try said the Galactica AI would often crank out answers that seemed believable but were dead wrong. “If you give it something it doesn’t know” Bergstrom said “it just makes up stuff out of whole cloth.”

Instead of trying to summarize academic papers Consensus simply identifies and highlights key findings. Bergstrom said the results are far more useful. “I really really really dislike Galactica” he said “and I like this.”

Olson and Salem had been thinking about a scientific search engine for years. But they got serious about it when they saw how readily a traditional search engine like Google could spread false information. The problem Olson said is that Google’s algorithm tends to favor the most popular Internet sources not the most trustworthy.

“Searching for what the experts think . . . is really really really difficult” Olson said. “Google is just not designed to do this for us.”

Meanwhile Olson and Salem realized that AI systems had become far more powerful in recent years and were now capable of understanding words and phrases in their larger contexts. This convinced them that an AI could be taught to break down a document into its key sections and display only the most important parts.

In 2021 the two men hired three software engineers and raised $1.3 million in funding. The biggest chunk came from Winklevoss Capital a company founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss best known for their bitter legal feud with Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook.

Olson and Salem began with a preexisting AI model that had already been trained on scientific documents written by humans. Next they hired scientists to read and annotate about 100000 academic papers in various fields. These papers and the scientists’ notes were then used to teach the AI to recognize specific features found in all academic papers especially the parts that summarize authors’ conclusions.

The Consensus search engine is linked to a database of 200 million academic papers in the public domain. When a user asks a question Consensus takes about five seconds to reply with a long list of excerpts from scientific journal articles. The system doesn’t seek to provide simple answers but to give the user a spectrum of academic research on the topic. Ask Consensus “is nuclear power safe?” and it serves up citations from multiple papers some supportive of nuclear power and others more skeptical. But all the citations come from reputable academic publications rather than opinionated amateurs.

For now Consensus can’t access many millions of academic papers locked behind paywalls by subscription-only publishers. Salem said Consensus plans to work with the publishers to negotiate a solution. In addition the Biden administration in August announced that all research papers produced with federal funding must be made accessible to the public starting in 2025.

Since Consensus opened for public use in September about 15000 people have logged on. Salem said the service gets lots of queries from health and fitness buffs from parents in search of child-rearing advice and students looking for homework help. Salem and Olson plan to offer a premium version that will provide more detailed summaries of each paper such as information about the organizations that funded the research. But for now Olson said “we’re completely free and we’d like to keep part of the product free forever.”

Breyanzi’s ability to keep LBCL in check remained strong over a longer period in the phase 3 TRANSFORM trial. After a median follow-up of 17.5 months Breyanzi cut the risk of tumor nonresponse disease progression or death by 64.4% compared with a standard of care involving stem cell transplant.

The results shared at the American Society of Hematology 2022 annual meeting almost matched the 65.1% risk reduction Breyanzi registered during an interim analysis of TRANSFORM which was performed at 6.2 months of median follow-up.

The new results also look similar to what Gilead’s rival CAR-T therapy Yescarta posted last year. After a median follow-up of more than two years the ZUMA-7 trial showed Yescarta pared down the same risk by 60.2%.

For Breyanzi the BMS drug also eradicated signs of cancer in more patients than control therapy did. At the longer follow-up Breyanzi posted a complete response rate of 74% versus 43% for the control arm.

The more mature data establish Breyanzi as a new standard of care option for second-line LBCL Anne Kerber BMS’ head of cell therapy development said in an interview with Fierce Pharma ahead of the data presentation.

While the latest Breyanzi follow-up was still shorter than Yescarta’s Kerber said she doesn’t believe that matters.

“There is no ambiguity in there” Kerber said pointing to large consistent improvements across all trial endpoints.

Breyanzi also showed promise in prolonging patient lives although its 27.6% reduction in the risk of death didn’t meet statistical significance. Investigators estimated that 73.1% of patients would still be alive in the Breyanzi arm at 18 months versus 60.6% in the control group.

The TRANSFORM trial wasn’t designed to show a statistically significant survival benefit Kerber said. But she noted the data demonstrated a “clinically relevant difference” because the survival curves between the two treatment arms separated “very nicely.”

Targeting a “very efficient sample size” BMS only enrolled 92 patients in each treatment arm to avoid randomizing a large number of patients to existing standard of care Kerber explained. The trial therefore wasn’t powered for an overall survival analysis. In addition 67% patients in the control arm actually went on to receive Breyanzi after disease progression.

While clinical data suggest Breyanzi could put up a fight against Yescarta several factors are currently holding the BMS drug back from reaching its full commercial potential despite it boasting a broader label than Yescarta.

In a recent interview with Mizuho Ran Reshef M.D. leader of Columbia University Medical Center’s cell therapy program said he likes both Breyanzi and Yescarta based on their efficacy. But he views Yescarta as having an edge because of better manufacturing success and consistent turnaround time according to a Mizuho note published Monday.

By comparison BMS reported issues with its Breyanzi manufacturing success rate in the third quarter. While the company said the underlying issue has been resolved and that it expects the rate to improve doctors’ perceptions of the product could take time to rebound.

Meanwhile BMS has been struggling to meet demand for its CAR-T therapies. Back in July BMS pushed back its timeline to have increased Breyanzi supply to early next year.

“Delivering that capacity is a top priority” BMS Chief Commercial Officer Chris Boerner Ph.D. said during a conference call in July. He noted that the company’s focus is on increasing both vector supply and drug production slot availability.

In a statement to Fierce Pharma a BMS spokesperson said the company has been encouraged by “a steady increase” in Breyanzi’s manufacturing capacity pointing to a new approved suite for producing viral vectors a key component to deliver cell therapies. BMS current has cell therapy facilities in Warren and Summit New Jersey along with Bothell Washington. One new facility in Devens Massachusetts is expected to come online in 2023 as is one in the Netherlands in 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvZ3NrLWV4cGxvcmVzLW5ldy1hdmVudWVzLWphay1kcnVnLTE5Yi1zaWVycmEtYnV5LWFtaWQtcGVuZGluZy1mZGEtZGVjaXNpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GSK explores new avenues for JAK drug in $1.9B Sierra buy amid pending FDA decision,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gsk-explores-new-avenues-jak-drug-19b-sierra-buy-amid-pending-fda-decision on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvZ3NrLWV4cGxvcmVzLW5ldy1hdmVudWVzLWphay1kcnVnLTE5Yi1zaWVycmEtYnV5LWFtaWQtcGVuZGluZy1mZGEtZGVjaXNpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2FzY29wb3N0LmNvbS9pc3N1ZXMvZGVjZW1iZXItMTAtMjAyMi9zdHVkeS1maW5kcy1wYXRyaXR1bWFiLWRlcnV4dGVjYW4tYWN0aXZlLWluLWhlcjMtZXhwcmVzc2luZy1tZXRhc3RhdGljLWJyZWFzdC1jYW5jZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Study Finds Patritumab Deruxtecan Active in HER3-Expressing Metastatic Breast Cancer,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='ascopost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /issues/december-10-2022/study-finds-patritumab-deruxtecan-active-in-her3-expressing-metastatic-breast-cancer/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E1FD2A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2FzY29wb3N0LmNvbS9pc3N1ZXMvZGVjZW1iZXItMTAtMjAyMi9zdHVkeS1maW5kcy1wYXRyaXR1bWFiLWRlcnV4dGVjYW4tYWN0aXZlLWluLWhlcjMtZXhwcmVzc2luZy1tZXRhc3RhdGljLWJyZWFzdC1jYW5jZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vbWVldGluZ2NvdmVyYWdlL2FzaGhlbWF0b2xvZ3kvMTAyMTg20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Talquetamab Offers New Hope in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma,"NEW ORLEANS -- Talquetamab had substantial antitumor effects in patients with heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma a researcher reported here.

In a 288-patient phase I/II study that assessed the agent's efficacy with two different dosing regimens -- 0.4 mg/kg weekly and 0.8 mg/kg every other week -- response rates were 74.1% and 73.1% respectively according to Ajai Chari MD of the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai in New York City.

Chari called the results with talquetamab a novel off-the-shelf bispecific antibody against the target GPRC5D ""incredible."" He also pointed out that these rates included very good partial responses or better in almost 60% of patients in each dosing group ""demonstrating a high depth of response.""

""To put this into context historically for novel agents to get approved in myeloma by accelerated approval we needed a response rate of 20% to 30% "" Chari said during a press briefing at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting. ""Now we are saying [percentages in the] 70s is the new 20s to 30s.""

Chari added that these response rates were consistent across important subgroups including stage III disease baseline cytogenetic risk number of prior therapies and refractoriness to prior therapy. Even patients with extramedullary disease achieved a response rate of about 50% he noted.

Chari and colleagues analyzed a third arm of 51 patients who had progressed after treatment with T-cell redirection therapies which Chari called a ""new unmet need"" in myeloma. These patients received either of the dosing schedules and had a response rate of 62.7% with 72.2% and 44.4% rates for patients with prior CAR T therapy and bispecific antibody treatment respectively.

""It looks like they are seeing responses even in people who are heavily pretreated ... and with other agents similar to it"" said ASH press conference moderator Stephanie Lee MD MPH of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. Patients who are penta-refractory often have inferior outcomes which makes the current data ""quite exciting"" she said. These patients are refractory to the five most active multiple myeloma drugs: proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (Velcade) and carfilzomib (Kyprolis); immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide (Revlimid) and pomalidomide; and the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies.

Chari also reported that among patients randomized to the 0.4-mg (n=143) and 0.8-mg (n=145) regimens median progression-free survival was 7.5 months and 11.9 months respectively with a median duration of response of 9.3 months and 13.0 months.

""And impressively those patients who had a [complete response] or better which means we completely eradicated the disease we don't even know how long the remissions last"" he said. ""So this is really life changing for these patients.""

The MonumenTAL-1 study included 339 patients. Of those 74 were from the pivotal phase I dose-escalation trial the results of which were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The phase I study showed response rates ranging from 64%-70%.

Eligibility criteria included patients with measurable disease and in the phase I portion of the study patients had to have progressed on or were intolerant to all established therapy and have an ECOG performance status of 0-1. Patients in the phase II study had to have at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitors IMiD and anti-CD38 antibody and an ECOG status of 0-2.

Patients were typical of those with relapsed/refractory disease Chari said with a median age of 67. About 60% of patients considered high-risk in some way (extramedullary disease high-risk genetics and stage III myeloma). These patients also had a median of five lines of prior therapy over the 6.7 years since their diagnosis.

He pointed out that almost all patients were refractory to a CD38 monoclonal antibody while three-quarters were triple-class exposed/refractory. ""And almost every single patient was progressing on their last line of therapy"" he added. ""So this is a tough population of patients who have exhausted a lot of the available therapies. In spite of that we saw this impressive response rate.""

As for safety Chari noted that as a first-in-class agent targeting a novel target talquetamab has a different safety profile.

High-grade adverse events (AE) were uncommon he said and when seen were typically hematologic AEs. Most high-grade AEs were cytopenias and were mostly limited to the first few cycles of treatment.

Infections occurred in 57.3% and 50.3% of patients in the 0.4-mg and 0.8-mg dosing regimens respectively with grade 3/4 rates of 16.8% and 11.7%.

Chari also noted that 9.1% and 11.0% patients had COVID-19 respectively with two patients dying from that infection.

About three-quarters of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome while 60% experienced skin-related AEs such as rash and about about half reported taste changes and nail disorders.

Discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 4.9% and 6.2% of 0.4-mg and 0.8-mg dosing regimens respectively.

Talquetamab developer Janssen/Johnson & Johnson submitted a Biologics License Application to the FDA on Friday for the agent as treament for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Why Trust Us?

Bobbi Brown shared exactly how to use each shade of her iconic .

“I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said.

The versatile formula can be used as a skin tint blush and highlighter.

Bobbi Brown’s have disrupted the makeup scene over the last few years. Since their launch Brown has expanded the shade range from four to 12 colors allowing each to serve a specific purpose for different skin tones. In a new video the makeup artist explained exactly how to use Miracle Balm and offered tips for application for every shade.

In general the Miracle Balms are an enhancement a problem solver and a lifter Brown said. “If you’re someone who is of a certain age and you feel like you’ve been not looking your best you’ve been looking tired when you put this on it automatically makes you look better. And usually by the way when you look better you start feeling better.”

Below is Brown’s guide to wearing her hero product—plus how you can layer them to get an angelic natural glow.

Jones Road Miracle Balm skin tints

Tints essentially give the face a healthy wash of color. is “great for women who have fair to medium skin” Brown said. is her personal go-to she added as the deep mauve is ideal for those who have olive-yellow skin tones and want to counteract it. “There’s enough red in it so it just looks like a combination of bronzer tint and blush” she said. “It also looks great on the lips.” she uses all over when she “want[s] to look healthy like I have a tan.” is great for those who have red undertones because it helps “cut the redness” she said. Lastly there’s  which works great on medium to dark skin tones as an all over tint—it can even be used on the lips.

To apply the skin tints Brown suggested using your fingers to blend it into to your cheeks forehead nose and chin.

Jones Road Miracle Balm blushes

If you’d rather not apply the balm all over opt for one of the blush shades. is the “most beautiful pink” that some people also use on their lips Brown explained. “I use it on top of Tawny.” Then there’s  which is more of a peachy coral and the newest blush shade is . “It sits somewhere between Dusty Rose and Flushed” Brown explained. “It’s great for very fair to dark skin tones.”

Jones Road Miracle Balm highlighters

is a cool-toned highlight with silvery hues and is like its “warm sister” Brown said. The latter shade is great for people with dark skin or those who prefer bronze tones she explained. The newest highlighter shade is  a frosty pink. “As a mom of three boys I never got to do the pink thing ... I love sequins I love ballerinas I love tulle. So Happy Hour reminds me of that.” Lastly is colorless for those who don’t like sparkle. Instead it uses its emollient texture to give the high points of the face—cheekbones bridge of the nose forehead cupids bow—a lit-from-within gleam.

Jones Road Miracle Balm application tips

The shades you choose may determine how you apply your balm but Brown cleared the air by saying you can really put it wherever you want. For a natural full-face routine however you can use one from each category—a tint to start a blush on the cheeks and lips and a highlight on cheekbones. If you have oily skin Brown recommended putting your balms of choice over a light veil of loose powder. On the flip side they float effortlessly over and hydrate dry mature skin. “I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL3ZpZGVvLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvam9zaC1icm93bi1vbi1hbWF6b24tdGhpcy1pcy10aGUtbmV3LWFwcGxlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Josh Brown on Amazon: ""This is the new Apple""","Share Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email

Global venture capital funding for semiconductor startups reached new heights in 2020 and 2021 after several years of modest growth but this year's economic realities have translated into substantially less capital for privately held silicon firms that rely on investor cash to survive or grow.

According to data provided by PitchBook global VC funding for semiconductor startups in 2022 reached $7.8 billion as of December 5. That's a 46 percent decline from the record $14.5 billion investors pumped into silicon firms last year and a 24 percent decline from the $10.3 billion raised in 2020.

At the same time while the number of worldwide semiconductor funding deals fell this year to 618 it only declined by nearly 20 percent from the 771 deals recorded last year and it was actually nearly 21 percent higher than the mere 511 funding rounds in 2020.

Investor scrutiny increases creating greater risk for some startups

Ruta Belwalkar private investor and chip designer told The Register that this year's slowdown in economic activity has increased investor scrutiny over the viability of semiconductor startups.

While the bar has always been higher for silicon firms than software startups because of how capital-intensive they are investor money was easier to come by previously.

""But now specifically what they're asking is 'Do you have a customer? Have you taped out your first chip? And do you have a roadmap to the future generations?'"" Belwalkar said.

Belwalkar is referring to fabless chip design firms that need to raise enough money to hire people design integrated circuits and then pay tens of millions for a tape-out the final step of the design process where a photomask is sent to a contract chipmaker like Taiwan's TSMC for manufacturing.

One chip design startup that apparently lost investor interest this year is Mythic.

The Texas-based firm which had raised a $70 million round last year tried to stand out by designing analog chips for edge AI use cases but it ran out of venture capital funding before it was able to generate revenue according to a November post by a top executive in November. (Company officials have declined to comment further.)

Belwalkar said she wouldn't be surprised if other chip design startups met a similar demise soon because they didn't transition fast enough from research and development to commercialization.

""Now if a startup doesn't have the runway to survive the next year and they can't raise money by mid next year then maybe they will run out of money. I'm not saying that their IP is bad or anything. It's just there are high chances. Sustaining that many people on the team it's tough"" she said.

Alternatively a startup could end up acquired if there is an interested buyer.

However such interest could be diminished by increased regulatory scrutiny over merger and acquisition deals as well as capabilities developed by incumbent semiconductor firms according to a recent note by PitchBook analyst Brendan Burke on the state of AI chip startups.

Burke is talking about the objections by Western regulators that killed Nvidia's $66 billion bid to acquire Arm earlier this year plus acquisitions made by Intel and AMD over the past few years – Habana Labs and Xilinx respectively – that boosted each of their AI chip capabilities.

There is an area where chip startups could see more M&A interest – automotive – due to larger players like AMD and Nvidia lacking some capabilities compared to auto-focused chip companies.

""The size of the market encourages large bets to capture market share from the range of automotive chipmakers led by Infineon NXP and Renesas"" Burke said.

In commercialization some stumble while others puff their chest

Even if a semiconductor startup starts selling to customers it doesn't guarantee future success a reality that can become more pronounced when the economy goes down.

Graphcore a well-funded Bristol UK-based AI chip startup that has aimed to compete with Nvidia reportedly had its private valuation slashed by $1 billion this year after losing a key deal with Microsoft amid other financial woes. The Times reported in October that while Graphcore's revenue grew slightly to $5 million last year so did the company's losses to $185 million. The struggles prompted Graphcore to lay off roughly 170 employees this year the newspaper added.

""Graphcore has significant cash reserves and is well positioned … however the macroeconomic backdrop is extremely challenging. This means making some hard but necessary decisions around our priorities to put us in the best possible position for sustainable growth in 2023"" Graphcore said in a statement to The Times.

The 2022 State of AI Report authored by two AI-focused venture capitalists underlined the difficulty of smaller AI chip companies competing with Nvidia showing that GPUs are referenced in AI research papers 90 times more than chips from Graphcore Intel's Habana Labs units and three other well-funded startups: Cerebras Systems SambaNova and Cambricon. Out of the smaller Nvidia rivals Graphcore had the most citations in research papers in 2021 and 2022.

""We've got years of runway and we've got many paying customers and I don't think the others have"" Andrew Feldman CEO of the Silicon Valley wafer-scale AI chip company Cerebras Systems told The Register.

Feldman declined to discuss financial figures of his own company but he said customers are buying more of its systems ""year-over-year."" He added that the startup won't have to raise another funding round for the next six to nine months.

""How do you know when you're doing well in a difficult market? When your customers buy more when you have more customers and when you're solving really hard problems for them"" he said.

For some now's the best time to build

Cerebras isn't the only venture-backed silicon firm that's feeling confident about the future in the midst of an economic downturn and for two startups one major reason is how they plan to take advantage of two growing trends in the semiconductor space.

One of them is Eliyan. The Silicon Valley startup announced in November that it had raised a $40 million funding round to commercialize its die-to-die interconnect technology which the company claims will make chiplet design – increasingly embraced by the industry as the superior way to design chips – more economical and efficient than advanced packaging solutions.

Ramin Farjadrad Eliyan's CEO told The Register that with the economy weighing down on margins for semiconductor firms the need for its solution has increased because it could help them save on chiplet manufacturing costs in the future.

""One of the key things that we offer as part of our technology by eliminating advanced packaging is improving the overall cost for these types of products"" he said.

Farjadrad said the current downturn has come with other benefits. With demand cooling in the industry Farjadrad said he has been able to obtain certain materials for less money and quicker. And with semiconductor stocks down from earlier this year the labor market has become less competitive and made it easier for Eliyan to hire technical talent from larger companies.

""Even up to six months ago we had maybe trouble snatching really good guys from the big companies because their [restricted stock units] were high and so on and so forth"" he said. ""But right now it's much easier. People even approached us so we don't have to spend as much money for recruitment.""

Astera Labs is also in the middle of a hiring spree though the semiconductor startup wasn't originally planning to do so as a privately held company for much longer. That's because it had hoped to go public before the year's end and then decided against it.

Instead Astera Labs raised another funding round this year from investors worth $150 million that more than tripled its valuation to $3.2 billion going against 2022's trend of tech companies seeing their valuations dramatically reduced.

Jitendra Mohan CEO and founder of Astera Labs told The Register that the Silicon Valley firm didn't need to raise more capital because it has already been generating a ""tremendous amount of revenue"" and has a decent balance sheet.

However Astera Labs and its investors believe the company is on the cusp of a major opportunity because it is developing chip architectures that will allow hyperscale and cloud customers to take advantage of Compute Express Link. CXL is a standard being introduced in new Intel- and AMD-based servers that will among other things enable cheaper more flexible and larger DRAM configurations as well as memory pooling.

""We find ourselves in a leadership position on CXL. Our investors along with us looked at the business and said 'Look it's time to put the pedal on the gas'"" he said. ®",,,,,,,,,,,,

Posted on: December 11 2022 05:28h.

Last updated on: December 11 2022 06:30h.

Golden Entertainment (NASDAQ: GDEN) could render a decision on the fate of the currently shuttered Colorado Belle in Laughlin Nevada next year. But it’s unlikely the operator will reopen the riverboat casino.

In an interview with Richard Velotta of the Las Vegas Review-Journal Blake Sartini II the son of Golden Chairman and CEO Blake Sartini said the operator would like to make a decision on what’s next for the Colorado Belle in 2023.

I think the reopening is probably something we would not approach again” said Sartini II in the interview. “We were successful in moving that business to the other two properties. What that has allowed us to do now is to focus on what can we do with that land.”

The elder Sartini addressed the fate of the Colorado Belle earlier this year on the company’s second-quarter earnings conference call. The chief executive officer noted the operator is maintaining the gaming license for the riverfront casino-hotel while “exploring A to Z opportunities for that piece of property.”

Colorado Belle: Victim of Coronavirus Shutdown

While the vast majority of Nevada casinos reopened following the state-mandated coronavirus closures in early 2020 some have not and the Colorado Belle is part of that group and has been shuttered for more than 30 months.

As is the case with other gaming companies that operate multiple casinos in the same market Golden shifted business from the Colorado Belle to the Aquarius and Edgewater — its other Laughlin venues.

As the gaming license holder and real estate owner Golden holds all the cards regarding Colorado Belle’s future. The operator could demolish the venue turn it into a non-gaming venue or sell it to a competitor. In the Review-Journal interview Sartini II didn’t mention the possibility of selling the venue.

It’s possible that an operator looking to enter Nevada could be interested in buying the Colorado Belle. But under that scenario the prospective buyer would be entering into direct competition with Golden and Caesars Entertainment — the two dominant players in the Laughlin market.

Options Abound for Colorado Belle

While Golden reopening the venue appears highly unlikely and sale talk is just speculation at this point there are still plenty of options for what the owner can do with the Colorado Belle.

“It’s a premium piece of land in that market. It might be nice to maybe put the event center down in that space and have an event center right there on the river. It’s something we’ve often talked about as well” said Sartini II in the Review-Journal interview.

Separately Sartini II said Golden is has expansion plans for its PT’s Pub brand. The operator is adding another PT’s location at Desert Inn and Durango in Las Vegas in the second quarter with the possibility of several more venues coming online in the second half of 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtY29sdW1ucy9rYXRzL2FkZWxlLWNhbGxzLW91dC10by1jZWxpbmUtd2UtbmVlZC10by1zaW5nLW91ci1oZWFydHMtb3V0LTI2OTIxODYv0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1jb2x1bW5zL2thdHMvYWRlbGUtY2FsbHMtb3V0LXRvLWNlbGluZS13ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXNpbmctb3VyLWhlYXJ0cy1vdXQtMjY5MjE4Ni9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adele calls out to Celine ‘We need to sing our hearts out’,"Adele witnessed Celine Dion perform in the Colosseum recalling “It was one of the best shows I ever saw.”

Some 3½ years after she left Celine Dion’s influence is still felt at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. The venue’s current resident headliner Adele reminded of Dion’s impact while calling out a message of support Friday night.

. @Adele showed her support to @celinedion last night on her #WeekendsWithAdele show. The whole world is looking after you Celine. ❤️pic.twitter.com/51Gzuz5ZiW — Celine Dion Stats (@celinedata_) December 10 2022

“On less of a light note this week there was some devastating news about Celine Dion’s ongoing health problems which is absolutely devastating” Adele said as she sat at the piano. “I saw her in this room — this room was built for Celine. I’m want to wish her a speedy recovery.”

Adele said of the seeing Dion play the Colosseum “It was one of the best shows I ever saw. We need to sing our hearts out extra loud for her tonight so she can hear us wherever she is.”

It was Adele’s first performance since Dion announced Wednesday she was suffering from Stiff Person Syndrome canceling and postponing several tour dates in 2023. She has yet to schedule any shows at Resorts World Theatre where she was originally due to premiere in November 2021.

Adele’s onstage tribute recalled New Year’s Eve 2015 when Dion unexpectedly covered Adele’s “Hello” at the Colosseum.

“Tonight I would like Adele to be part of our New Year’s Eve” Dion said that night. “So don’t panic she’s not in the building.” She then said her mic was cutting out using it as a cell phone. “Adele? Hello? Hello? Just for fun OK?” Then she sang Adele’s hit flawlessly.

WAFB reported that an in-flight malfunction required an emergency landing at the base located near Knob Noster.

Upon landing a fire broke out on the B-2 prompting the WAFB fire department to respond and extinguish the blaze.

No injuries were reported during the incident but the aircraft was reportedly damaged.

Whiteman issued a ""NOTAM"" Saturday night at 11 p.m.

The emergency landing caused damage to Runway 1/19 and remains closed until Dec. 16.

An investigation is on-going.

The 509th Bomb Wing Public Affairs office issued the following statement:

""A U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit experienced an in-flight malfunction during routine operations today and was damaged on the runway at Whiteman Air Force Base after it successfully completed an emergency landing. There were no personnel injuries. There was a fire associated with the aircraft after landing and the base fire department extinguished the fire. The incident is under investigation.""

Whiteman produced a video released Nov. 7 showcasing the readiness of the 20-bomber fleet and the airmen who are responsible for the program which first arrived at the mid-Missouri base Dec. 17 1993.

The U.S. Air Force on Dec. 2 publicly unveiled the B-21 Raider the first new long-range strike bomber in a generation and an aircraft specifically designed to be the multifunctional backbone of the modernized bomber fleet according to WAFB.

The next-generation stealth plane looks very similar to the B-2 but will reportedly be capable of flying without a crew on board.

While the B-21 isn’t expected to be operational and introduced into service for several more years the formal unveiling ceremony hosted by Northrop Grumman Corporation at its production facilities in California is a significant milestone in the Air Force’s effort to modernize combat capabilities Whiteman said.

The B-21 is designed to be a more capable and adaptable state-of-the-art aircraft that will gradually replace the aging B-1 Lancer and B-2 Spirit bombers now in service.

While the precise date when the B-21 will enter service is unknown basing decisions have been made. Ellsworth AFB South Dakota will become the first Main Operating Base and formal training unit for the B-21.

Whiteman AFB Missouri and Dyess AFB Texas are the preferred locations for the remaining home bases. Each will receive aircraft as they become available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd2Nyei5jb20vcmVudC1pbmRvb3Itc2FsdHdhdGVyLXBvb2wtYnVydG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Escape the Winter Blues Renting This Burton Indoor Pool Oasis,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd2Nyei5jb20vcmVudC1pbmRvb3Itc2FsdHdhdGVyLXBvb2wtYnVydG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E3F5660>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth won the seventh edition of Capital One's The Match Saturday with a 3-and-2 victory over Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair Florida.

The superstar quartet enjoyed some evening golf during the 12-hole competition.

Thomas and Spieth took the lead and never looked back after JT drained a long birdie putt to win the second hole.

Spieth drained a 15-foot birdie putt on the next one to put his team two holes up.

The 455-yard par-four fourth hole featured the one-club challenge. Thomas took centerstage again by making par on a 455-yard hole using nothing but a 5-wood:

JT made an impressive two-putt thanks in part to Spieth and reporter Kathryn Tappen who both helped lift a cable to get the ball onto the green.

He knocked in a six-footer from there.

Thomas was arguably the star of the show Saturday as he also delivered the line of the night to Charles Barkley on the next hole.

Neither team won the fifth or sixth holes but Woods and McIlroy got one back on the par-five seventh after the latter golfer knocked home a 20-foot birdie.

However Thomas put Woods and McIlroy on the ropes by nailing a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-three eighth for the 3-up lead.

The ninth hole was a heartbreaker for Woods and McIlroy who each had birdie chances from under 20 feet to win the hole. Neither shot dropped though and that duo found itself needing to win the final three holes just to tie.

McIlroy put his team in position to do just that with a birdie but Spieth matched him to halve the hole and win the match.

Thomas Spieth and McIlroy made their Match debuts. Woods had played twice losing to Phil Mickelson in the inaugural competition before teaming with Peyton Manning to defeat Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS90aGUtcmV3YXJkcy1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1saW5rLXRvLXRheWxvci1zd2lmdC1hbmQtZnR4LXJvdW5kdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Rewards Credit Card Link To Taylor Swift And FTX?

Bank of America Travel Rewards Credit Card

If you're thinking about just dipping your toes in the water of travel rewards or you generally like to avoid fees the Bank of America Travel Rewards credit card could be a great fit with its $0 annual fee. Here's what you'll get with the card:

25000 bonus points after you spend $1000 in the first 90 days from account opening plus an introductory 0% APR on purchases and on balance transfers made within the first 60 days for 18 billing cycles.

Three points per dollar on travel booked through the Bank of America Travel Center and 1.5 points per dollar on all other purchases.

Earn up to 75% more rewards as a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member which requires at least $20000 in deposits between eligible Bank of America and Merrill Lynch accounts.

Redeem points for travel through Bank of America at a rate of 1 cent per point.

While the card doesn't offer any valuable benefits beyond its rewards program it can be a great option for casual travelers who are unsure about paying a big annual fee.

How to Choose the Right Travel Credit Card for You

There's no single credit card out there that's the best fit for everyone. As such it's important that you take the time to consider your travel goals and spending habits to determine the right fit for you. Many of these cards offer bonus rewards on select spending categories so if you spend a lot in one or two areas try to find a card that will reward you more for those purchases.

While some of these cards charge hefty annual fees if you travel often enough it can be easy to make up for them. Look for benefits and features that are the most important to you and the type of experience you want to have. And don't forget that most of the top travel rewards credit cards require good or excellent credit which means a credit score of 670 or above. If you're not there yet take some time to work on building your credit before you apply.

Professional golf played at night?

Yes there was indeed high-profile golf played under the lights instead of daylight.

And that's just one of the unique but entertaining twists featured at the seventh edition of Capital One's The Match which saw Rory McIlroy team up with Tiger Woods to go head-to-head with the pairing of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.

The 12-hole competition was played in the evening at the Pelican Golf Club in Belleair Florida to settle a few scores between four of golf's biggest stars and support Florida in its effort to bounce back from the statewide devastation in the wake of Hurricane Ian.

By the end of the night it was Spieth and Thomas prevailing 3 and 2 after taking the lead early and never looking back after the latter went for a long birdie to win the second hole and hit the Michael Jordan shrug.

Ever the showman Woods started things off with a birdie on the opening hole that was ""smooth as a Tootsie Roll"" but that would be the lone highlight for him on the night.

From there Spieth and Thomas went on to combine for a few pars and two more birdies to finish off their opponents on the 10th hole.

There were some beautiful shots and competitive flourishes from the superstar quartet to the delight of fans including JT's use of a 5-wood to make par on a 455-yard hole.

But as much as there was great action and gamesmanship on the links it was the trash talk and other hilarious moments along the way that made this event must-see TV.

All four athletes traded barbs leading up to Saturday night but the trolling really got underway during and after The Match.

""Hey Tiger and Rory...what happened?!?!"" Spieth and Thomas joked on Twitter afterward.

""How do you lose to us two?"" Spieth said.

It's all right...everybody does."" JT added.

Probably the biggest burn was directed at Charles Barkley the announcer for the night.

Barbs directed at Sir Charles is par for the course considering everyone took a swipe before the match. That included Woods who when prompted with the question of ""are you going to listen to Charles throughout the day or are you pretty much going to mute him?"" responded with ""if we had an option we'd never listen to him.""

Thomas has history with the Round Mound of Rebound especially with Barkley an Auburn alum goading him about having attended ""Alabama University"" so it's no surprise the line of the night came from him.

""Chuck's looking at that moon like it's an Oreo"" he said.

That was the best zinger on the night from JT but it wasn't his only one.

Before the first drive he made reference to toeing the line when it comes to Barkley and getting the adult beverage of choice on the course.

""If you call Charles Barkley a fat ass they will not give you the drink that you requested on the golf course.""

Not to be outdone Barkley had some great color commentary of his own.

After McIIroy missed a birdie putt that would have cut the lead at the fifth hole Barkley hilariously exhaled on behalf of his network TNT.

""Man we needed that. We need this to go the full 12 holes. I mean TNT got another 795 commercials to run"" he said.

Then there was Barkley's earlier dig at JT's nuptials.

""Best night of my life. I wish I could have it over again"" Thomas said.

""Well it's early. You could do it again"" Barkley replied.

JT and Barkley's back-and-forth was the highlight of the whole event but Spieth got in one last zinger before signing off.

After winning he took a jab at Woods.

""The joy out of getting this does not match the joy of standing here with Tiger just being so upset that he has to stand here for this"" he said.

Laughter aside it was all for a great cause adding more much-needed funds to the Hurricane Ian relief efforts in Florida."

Currently based in New Orleans the Carnival Cruise Line vessel will begin sailing out of Port Canaveral starting in May 2024.

According to Carnival’s Brand Ambassador John Heald the Conquest-Class ship is set to offer three- and -four-night cruises departing from the Florida homeport.

Taking over the program of the Carnival Liberty the Glory will offer Friday and Monday departures for itineraries visiting the Bahamas.

In addition to one day at sea the three-night weekend cruises feature a visit to either Nassau or Bimini.

Sailing during weekdays the four-night cruises include two different itineraries. While both comprise a full day at sea the first feature visits to Bimini and Nassau while the second sails to Nassau and Princess Cays – one of Carnival Corporation’s private destinations in the Bahamas.

The Carnival Glory currently offers weeklong cruises to the Western and Eastern Caribbean departing from the Port of New Orleans.

Along with the Carnival Valor the 2004-built vessel has been sailing out of the Big Easy since early 2019.

With the two ships sailing year-round from the port Carnival Cruise Line currently carries approximately 400000 passengers annually out of New Orleans.

Carnival hasn’t announced a replacement ship for the Glory in New Orleans.

In September 2021 the Glory became the first cruise ship to resume revenue service from the Louisiana homeport.

Also in 2021 on the aftermath of the Hurricane Ida the Glory was chartered by FEMA serving as emergency housing for frontline workers directly involved in New Orleans infrastructure recovery and healthcare needs.

During the period the ship remained docked in the city while provisioning accommodations food water and materials for up to 2600 hospital workers city and utility workers in addition to other emergency personnel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2NydWlzZS9waG90by10b3VyLW9mLXRoZS1uZXctY2Fybml2YWwtY2VsZWJyYXRpb24tY3J1aXNlLXNoaXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photo Tour of the New Carnival Celebration Cruise Ship,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/gallery/cruise/photo-tour-of-the-new-carnival-celebration-cruise-ship on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2NydWlzZS9waG90by10b3VyLW9mLXRoZS1uZXctY2Fybml2YWwtY2VsZWJyYXRpb24tY3J1aXNlLXNoaXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWNyaXRpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3LWNydWlzZS1zaGlwcy1jb21pbmctaW4tMjAyMy10aGF0LXdlLWNhbnQtd2FpdC10by1zZWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Cruise Ships Coming in 2023 That We Can't Wait to See,"New cruise ships debut every year but 2023 looks like a particularly exciting one.

Highlights include another new Carnival cruise ship (with a roller coaster!); and multiple new ships from MSC Cruises both in the mainstream and -- for the first time -- the luxury category.

Other big cruise ship milestones to watch for: the last of the Celebrity Edge Class ships Celebrity Ascent; a second Prima Class ship from NCL Norwegian Viva and Resilient Lady the next ""lady ship"" from Virgin Voyages.

Luxury cruise ship lovers also have things to look forward to. Regent Seven Seas will be coming out with Seven Seas Grandeur which aims to raise the bar on opulence on the ocean. Silversea will have the first of a new class of ship in Silver Nova. Oceania will also come out with its first newbuild in over a decade Oceania Vista.

Finally the expedition cruise ship trend that started in 2019 and ramped up in 2021 and 2022 will continue with several newbuilds including a second Seabourn Expedition ship Seabourn Pursuit.

Here are some of the noteworthy new cruise ships that are scheduled to debut in 2023 -- and why we're excited about them.

The Big Cruise Ships We're Excited for in 2023

Carnival Cruise Line's New Ship Carnival Jubilee Continues Excel-Class Success

Following on the heels of 2021's Carnival Mardi Gras and 2022's Carnival Celebration Carnival Jubilee will debut in Galveston in December 2023 and instantly become the biggest Carnival ship in the Texas port.

What makes Carnival Jubilee exciting will be the Bolt rollercoaster onboard as well as all of the expanded versions of Carnival favorites such as a supersized Guy's Burgers the Patio outdoor area on Deck 6 and a two-story Red Frog-themed tiki bar. This class of Carnival ship also has themed neighborhoods; expect Jubilee to have at least one that is different from its siblings.

MSC Euribia Continues to Fuel the Line's Growth

MSC Cruises continues its rapid expansion in 2023 with not one but two cruise ships -- one of them marking the debut of a luxury expedition cruise line (more on that later).

MSC Euribia arrives in June 2023. The 6334-passenger ship will be powered by liquid natural gas and be the third in the line's Meraviglia-Plus Class. While details on the ship are still light expect it to resemble sibling ships MSC Grandiosa and MSC Virtuosa.

Celebrity Ascent Will Be the New Celebrity Cruise Ship

The last of the popular Edge Class ships Celebrity Ascent will make its debut in December 2023. Expect to see features that were made popular on Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Apex such as the Magic Carpet movable deck that does triple duty as a restaurant a bar and an embarkation area.

The infinite balconies will be part of the mix as well. On Celebrity Ascent the line will put the first ones developed specifically for solo travelers. Suite life also gets a boost with Icon and Edge Villas -- the latter featuring private plunge pools -- as well as the large Retreat complex.

Norwegian Viva Will Have a Racetrack Two Freefall Slides and Large Haven Area

Arriving in August 2023 Norwegian Viva will be the second ship in NCL's Prima Class with features that mimic those debuting on Norwegian Prima in 2022. Thrill seekers are going to love the bigger and better go-kart racetrack which winds around the ship's funnel as well as drop dry slides that will make you scream.

Like Norwegian Prima Norwegian Viva will place The Haven -- NCL's ship-within-a-ship complex -- at the back of the ship. This grouping will make The Haven feel more private and also allow special suite-only perks such as the private pool sundeck restaurants and bars to be all in one place.

Resilient Lady Brings Virgin Voyages to the Greek Isles Australia

The third of Virgin Voyages' ""lady ships"" Resilient Lady will launch with adult-only cruises in spring 2023. Carrying 2770 passengers the ship will have a similar design and attitude to Scarlet Lady and Valiant Lady. Expect fun parties delicious food and plenty of opportunities to detox and retox.

Resilient Lady will spend its first season in the Greek Isles before heading to Australia for the Down Under summer.

The Luxury and Small Ships We're Excited for in 2023

Viking Saturn Continues Viking Ocean's Run of Excellence

Viking Ocean Cruises has hit on a formula for success for its small 930-passenger vessels -- and we know that Viking Saturn will continue that pattern. Debuting in early 2023 Viking Saturn will have all the features that people love about the line -- included specialty dining wine and beer at lunch and dinner and at least one shore excursion offered in every port.

All this plus the best included thermal spa at sea and sleek Scandinavian decor make Viking Saturn a great choice for adults -- the line doesn't accept passengers under 18 -- who love learning and enrichment in a sophisticated environment.

Vista Will Be Oceania's First New Ship Since 2012

The first of the line's Allura Class ships Oceania's Vista will have a lot of new restaurants and features; understandably so as it's the first newbuild for Oceania Cruises since 2012. Debuting in April 2023 Oceania's Vista will continue the line's focus on outstanding cuisine; new venues include Ember which serves American food and Aquamar Kitchen which will have a focus on healthy food (not surprising for a line that pioneered a plant-based menu).

In a nod to solo travelers Oceania's Vista will have a new category of balcony cabins dedicated to those cruisers who are either on their own or want their own space. The highest-level cabins -- Vista Suites and Owners Suites -- have 24-hour butler service with the latter category of suites boasting design details from Ralph Lauren Home.

Silver Nova Will Be the Luxury Line's First Nova Class Ship

The first ship in the luxury Silversea fleet to have all balconies Silver Nova will debut in summer 2023. With 728 passengers Silver Nova will be the biggest ship for Silversea and also have the line's first hybrid technology; the goal is to be totally emissions free in port.

Silver Nova will also be the line's first ship to have a pool on the side of the ship as opposed to being enclosed. Expect the line's highly regarded S.A.L.T. culinary program to play a starring role among a roster that has a high bar of eight restaurants.

Regent Seven Seas Grandeur Will Push the Envelope for Luxury on a Ship

The third of a series of newbuilds for Regent Seven Seas Grandeur will likely try to top the title of ""world's most luxurious cruise ship"" which the line dubbed sister ship Silver Seas Explorer when it debuted. Coming in November 2023 Seven Seas Grandeur will have its version of the $11000-per-night Regent Suite and the line is already stating that the ship will have the highest space and crew ratio per passenger in the industry.

On Seven Seas Grandeur Regent is aiming to fight sister line Oceania's claim for top marks among foodies. The ship will have four restaurants and debut a new version of Compass Rose the ship's main dining room. Expect eye-catching sculptures plenty of crystal and a menu that focuses on the most extravagant ingredients.

Crystal Cruises Re-emerges With New Ownership

After filing for bankruptcy in 2022 Crystal Cruises has found a new owner in luxury travel group Abercrombie & Kent and former Silversea head Manfredi Lefebvre d'Ovidio. The company plans a relaunch of the brand on Crystal's former ships and with former Crystal President Jack Anderson in 2023.

Crystal lovers have been promised extensive refurbishments to Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony. And while we still don't know much else the rebooted line seems to be bringing back many of its top executives and crew -- the same that made Crystal a beloved luxury brand. We're eager to see how this turns out.

The Expedition Ships We're Excited About in 2023

Explora 1 Will Be the First Ship in MSC's Luxury Expedition Cruise Line Explora Journeys

The first ship in the new cruise line created by MSC Cruises called Explora Journeys will arrive in July 2023. While not many details have been released about Explora I we know that at 922 passengers the ship will be at the larger end of the luxury segment. (That's not necessarily a bad thing as that means there will be more venues and things to do onboard.)

Early word on the ship notes nine dining ""experiences"" and cabins that start at a generous 377 square feet. Outdoor space will be highlighted with 64 private pool cabanas across three outdoor pools; a fourth pool will have a retractable glass roof to allow swimming in any weather.

Seabourn Pursuit Will Be Second Luxury Expedition Ship for the Line

Coming in September 2023 Seabourn Pursuit combines the luxury of a Seabourn ocean cruise ship with the adventurous spirit of an expedition ship. What does that mean? Think PC6 Polar Class standards and advanced technology to get to remote regions as well as two submarines that add underwater exploration to the things you can do above water such as Zodiac tours and kayaking.

One feature of Seabourn Pursuit that you'll only find on its sister expedition ship Seabourn Venture which debuts in 2022 are the two-story suites that have double height windows and telescopes for wildlife spotting. Everyone onboard can enjoy the Discovery Center and Expedition Lounge where naturalists and expedition guides will give daily lectures briefings and enrichment programs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydXplbHkuY29tL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNlbGVicmF0aW9uLWNydWlzZS1ndWlkZS1waG90by10b3VyLXJldmlldy10aGluZ3MtdG8ta25vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Celebration Cruise Guide: Photo Tour Review & Things to Know,"Carnival Celebration marks the second Excel-class cruise ship built for Carnival’s fleet. A sister to the popular Mardi Gras the ships mark a push from the cruise line toward vessels that are bigger than the rest of the fleet carry more people and offer more to do see and eat onboard.

And to say that Carnival Celebration is big is an understatement. At 180000 gross tons it’s approximately 35% larger than Vista-class ships Carnival’s previous build of vessels. Meanwhile it holds about 5300 passengers at double occupancy along with 1800 crew members.

In short apart from Mardi Gras Carnival Celebration is like nothing else in the fleet. From the restaurants available to all-new entertainment venues activities and more… it has the most of everything in the lineup.

We recently had the opportunity to sail aboard Carnival Celebration. Below we provide a full guide to sailing on the ship including a tour tips things to know and our full thoughts.

First Impressions & Ship Highlights

If you want to win someone over then the first impression is important. In the case of Celebration that first impression is made as you board right into an area known as Celebration Central. This spot takes over instead of having a typical atrium like you see. It offers a three-deck performance area (complete with stage and video backdrop) where performances are held throughout the entire cruise that’s also combined with a path through the rest of the ship.

But what you quickly realize — even at first — is that there is a lot onboard. Walking through the ship is seemingly a never-ending lineup of bars restaurants shops and venues. And given that Celebration is so much larger than other ships it also means that while the favorites that are well-known across Carnival are still there it also has a lot of offerings that aren’t on other ships.

Design/Feel

Let’s start with the design and feel of Carnival Celebration. First and foremost we felt that the design is much more contemporary than other vessels in the fleet. Frankly we’ve always felt the design of Carnival ships was a bit more dated and wild — especially with older ships. That’s not the case here.

But while the style matches with present-day design it’s also very comfortable. There is also lots of fun artwork and features around the ship that add to the “fun” feeling. In other words while some cruise lines try to go toward more high-end (such as Norwegian Cruise Line) Carnival has modernized the design but not gone away from its roots.

One thing that’s especially unique about Celebration is that it pays homage to Carnival’s history with a number of unique features. In the middle of Deck 6 you’ll see the Rolls-Royce that sailed for decades aboard Carnival Ecstasy. The Golden Jubilee bar features pieces that were part of past Carnival ships. And there is even one of the original engine telegraphs that was part of the Carnivale.

The main activity on the interior of the ship goes from Deck 6 through Deck 8. These three decks run the length of Celebration with everything from theaters to restaurants to shops to a pool (Deck 8). We found these areas relatively easy to navigate as they run through the ship though they do wind and weave some. However just be ready for lots of people on these decks which can lead to a crowded feel during busy times.

Decks 16-18 at the top of the ship are the pool/outdoor decks. Here you’ll find everything from the main pool to the buffet an aft pool with bar Guy’s Burger Joint the Serenity adults-only area and the Ultimate Playground.

The Ultimate Playground is the name for the outdoor play area on Deck 18 which includes mini-golf the waterpark sport court ropes course and the BOLT roller coaster (which is technically Deck 19).

In total we thought Celebration simply “feels” like a Carnival ship in that it’s approachable and relaxed but also a more modern style. However we must note that it also feels more crowded than we are used to. With so many people and so many venues there isn’t much open space on the ship.

Activities & Entertainment

One thing about a ship this large is that there is never a shortage of things to do onboard. Between the activities available around Celebration to the entertainment put on by the cruise line if you’re bored then it’s your own fault.

Let’s start with the outdoor decks. You have the main pool area but then you also have the largest Serenity deck that we’ve seen. Then there are other pools at the back of the ship on both Deck 16 and Deck 8. These are all open to everyone.

For more private spots Celebration has Loft 19 at the very top of the ship with access for suite guests… or you can pay hefty $500 a day to rent a private cabana. There’s also a private Loft 19 pool. And Havana cabins also make an appearance with their own private pool that I actually thought offered the best views of any pool onboard.

Want something more active? The waterpark on Celebration is complete with three slides that are all fun to ride. As mentioned there’s the ropes course as well as a mini-golf course and a full-sized enclosed basketball court plus the BOLT roller coaster.

Head indoors and you get the same sort of “Carnival on steroids” vibe.

First there are two main theaters. The Grand Spectrum sits at the front of the ship. This is your typical theater with a stage and rows of seats. Shows here include Family Feud Live which is a legit 100% rendition of Family Feud where passengers form the teams and compete to win cruise cash for the trip.

Color My World as you might guess from the name is a show all about color. It is performances of songs focused on colors (Paint It Black Purple Rain Yellow etc.) but all given a twist compared to the originals. Then there is the element of large video screens at the back of the stage that serve as the set background. Compared to traditional stage sets the technology really adds another level to the performance.

But the show you have to see is at Center Stage in Celebration Central the second theater in the middle of the ship. It is called The Most Magnificent Circus. The show is themed as an old-time eclectic circus. Hanging from the ceiling are several cables with fixtures attached to each.

During the show performers climb on these items as they rise three decks into the air. From there they perform all sorts of acrobatics and contortions spin and more. Meanwhile the video background screen offers even more visuals while other performers move through the crowd and on stage. There can be so much going on that you literally don’t know which area to watch at any time.

Other things to enjoy include the Piano Bar 88 the Punchliner Comedy Club live Deal or No Deal and live music performed around the ship.

Food & Beverage

It’s impossible to go hungry or thirsty aboard Carnival Celebration. Let’s start with the notable bars onboard.

The Golden Jubilee on Deck 6 pays homage to Carnival’s 50 years of history complete with features that are recreated or actually part of past Carnival ships including brass doors that were once the entrance to the Mardi Gras Nightclub on Carnivale. Just outside is the original telegraph from Carnivale.

Latitudes is another addition with drinks from all over the world and a travel theme complete with a flipboard like an old train station that displays changing messages. Other bars include Bar 820 in the Miami-themed 820 Biscayne neighborhood The Watering Hole Tropicale Bar Havana Bar Alchemy Bar and more.

Then there is the food. So of course you have the main dining room and the buffet (Lido Marketplace). And the staples like BlueIguana Guy’s Burger Joint Guy’s Pig & Anchor and Cucina Del Capitano are also there as you’d expect on a Carnival ship. But there is a ton that’s new to this class.

Here Emeril’s Bistro 1397 is available serving up New Orleans-style food for a small upcharge. There’s the Fahrenheit 555 steakhouse Seafood Shack Bonsai Sushi and Rudi’s Seagrill that do cost extra as well.

But the food that’s included with your cruise fare offers a lot of variety. ChiBang! which serves both Mexican and Asian food in one location is free for lunch and dinner. Previously mentioned Cucina Del Capitano is available if you want Italian.

Guy’s Pig & Anchor BBQ is also included. There’s Fresh Creations for salads up in the Serenity area Street Eats out by the main pool and Big Chicken which serves chicken sandwiches is also new to this class of ships. There’s also Miami Slice and the Deco Deli if you want some pizza or a sandwich.

So no matter if you want a quick bite or want to sit down and have the full meal experience you have plenty of options.

What We Liked About Carnival Celebration

After a week on the ship it became clear that there were a few things that really stood out about sailing on Celebration.

First compared to other Carnival ships there is so much more to see and do. In our eyes Royal Caribbean has always pushed to have the most things to do on a ship. Celebration brings the two lines on more even footing. Sure there are the classic cruise activities like the pool deck casino and bars/lounges to enjoy.

But then Carnival has put a big emphasis on things like the waterpark. The BOLT roller coaster is a big draw. The cruise line has also pushed more entertainment including shipboard editions of shows like Family Feud and Deal or No Deal. The theater shows are also stepped up including The Most Magnificent Circus that was mentioned earlier.

Whether you want to watch a great show or you want to do more active things like ride a roller coaster or hit the waterpark there’s a lot going on during the entire cruise. As someone who enjoys a more active experience this was a welcome change.

Another thing that stood out were the food options. The trend in cruising seems to be having a buffet and main dining room along with maybe 1-2 other options included in your cruise fare. That’s not the case sailing on Celebration.

Carnival has filled the ship with different restaurants ranging from easy grab-and-go items (Street Eats Guy’s Burger Joint Big Chicken etc.) all the way to high-end dining (Rudi’s Seagrill Fahrenheit 555 Steakhouse). But the big difference is that so many are included with your fare.

This includes spots like Guy’s Pig & Anchor BBQ Cucina del Capitano ChiBang! Miami Slice Deco Deli Big Chicken Guy’s Burger Joint and BlueIguana. It’s no exaggeration that you could sail for a week and never eat in the buffet or dining room.

During our cruise we found the food to be very good across the board. Special mention should be given to Emeril’s Bistro 1397 where we had a shrimp poboy ($7) that was fantastic. We also thought that Big Chicken could go toe-to-toe with any chicken sandwich you find on land.

That sort of variety and options is a major plus in our book.

What Could Be Improved

Not everything about Celebration is perfect. Let’s talk about the size of the ship. During our cruise Celebration had about 5300 passengers onboard and this ship feels busy. It can feel crowded. And part of that isn’t just the number of people on the ship but also the ship design.

Take the elevators. Carnival seems to have opted for smaller elevators but more of them. Either way they are slow to arrive and when you do get on one it’s much more cramped than usual.

Around the ship there are chokepoints like on the main pool deck. Here because of all the people and furniture it just feels more tight. This seemed to be a consistent theme around the ship.

The Center Stage theater in the middle of the ship is another good example. Seating is a major issue. Since it’s not set up like a normal theater there just weren’t a ton of spots to sit down and still see the stage.

When we watched the popular circus show we showed up 20 minutes early and there wasn’t a seat to be found. Instead we watched from the extreme left of the stage and just stood the entire time. (In fact they actually put on the show twice a night for two nights to accommodate everyone.) And even the cabin bathroom felt like the smallest we’ve seen on a cruise ship.

So when you sail be ready for a little less elbow room. It’s the trade-off for packing so much onboard.

Carnival Celebration Tips & Things to Know

During our time on the ship we found out a few tips and things to know that could make your cruise even better.

Each Stairwell Has a Different Color to Help You Navigate

Celebration is big and there’s stuff happening all over the ship. That means you’ll be walking aft and forward and sometimes not be sure where you are on the ship. If you hit an elevator bank check the color of the nearby stairwell. Each one has a different color wallpaper (red green yellow) to help you identify which area of the ship you are in.

The Lanai Is a Hidden Secret

If you want to connect to the sea check out the Lanai. It’s a small section of deck chairs hidden away on Deck 8 that overlook the water. This spot is located on the port side of the ship and you have to pass around outdoor seating for some restaurants to get there. For that reason seemingly no one realizes it is there. We checked it out several times during the cruise and never saw more than 3-4 people there.

Stairs Are WAY Faster on Celebration

Ok one thing that nobody will want to hear is that the elevators on the ship are slow. It seems that Carnival opted for more elevators but made them smaller. So even when one does arrive it may already be full. For that reason if you can it’s a smart idea to just take the stairs. It will save you considerable time on getting around the ship.

Want to Ride BOLT? Don’t Wait to Book

During our cruise we had two days at sea at the end of the trip and made plans to ride the roller coaster then. Unfortunately those two days were windy (especially with the ship underway) and BOLT never operated. The lesson? If you know what you want to ride then go ahead and book it for as early in the cruise as possible to make sure that you get a chance. Days in port are when you’ll find the best combination of calm weather (since the ship is stationary) and shorter lines as most people are off the ship.

Don’t Miss the Details in The Golden Jubilee

The Golden Jubilee is a bar with a theme dedicated to Carnival’s history. And at first you might notice only a couple of things like the blueprints of past ships adorning the ceiling. But check out the QR code at the back of the drink menu for a link to information about all the items in the bar. There are the original doors that went to the nightclub on the retired Carnivale. The tables with Al Hirschfield drawings are from Carnival Fascination and there is even a glass-wall panel that used to be in the casino on the original Mardi Gras.

Want a Show? Order The Sakura From Latitudes

One of the unique bars on Celebration is the Latitudes — and not just for the cool flipboard sign (like you’d see in an old train station) that’s above the bar. The menu is filled with drinks inspired from around the world from a paloma (Mexico) to a bramble (England).

Be sure to try The Sakura. It’s a sake-based drink with pomegranate liqueur and other flavors. But when it’s served the bartender puts a huge bubble on it that you pop with tiny rose petals as you make a wish. We’ve never seen anything like it.

Try’s Guy’s Pig & Anchor for an Easy Breakfast

Breakfast is served in a lot of places around the ship but if you want one of the easiest then try Guy’s Pig & Anchor. The spot serves BBQ for lunch and dinner but for breakfast it offers the same lineup that you’ll get at the morning buffet (minus the omelet station). So instead of having to go all the way to Deck 16 you can eat on Deck 8 in a spot that’s much less busy.

The Best Pool Belongs to Havana Rooms

There are a number of pools around Celebration from the Serenity deck (adults only) to the main pool in the middle of the ship. But the best pool in our opinion is one that sits in the exclusive Havana area. Not everyone can access this area — it’s reserved for passengers staying in Havana rooms. But if you have access then you get a great view. The pool isn’t big but sits right over the water.

Final Thoughts on Celebration

Apart from its sister-ship Mardi Gras Carnival Celebration is like nothing else in the Carnival fleet.

If you’ve sailed Carnival but haven’t sailed ships like Celebration then you really don’t know what you’re missing. That same Carnival atmosphere is still there… but it’s definitely taken to a whole other level. From the venues onboard to the entertainment to the food and more it’s all bigger and better than what you find on older ships in the fleet.

For some the size and scale of Celebration may be off-putting. And yes the crowds around the ship can be heavy. But for those that want the most options to enjoy their vacation Carnival Celebration is it.

Founded on June 11 1946 as Capitol Airways by Jesse F. Stallings Richmond McGinnes and Francis Roach Army Air Corps pilots it was incorporated in Delaware but headquartered in Smyrna Tennessee. It initially operated twin-engine Douglas DC-3s and Curtiss C-46 Commandos.

Military service was a significant part of its early history. In 1954 for example it carried priority freight for the US Air Force and two years later was contracted to transport passengers for the Logistic Air Support (LOGAIR) Program. The Douglas DC-4 and Lockheed L-749A Constellation its first quad-engine pistonliners facilitated international charter expansion.

“One (of BOAC’s 749As) had served Capitol Airways which had three other 749As having purchased the first from Avianca in 1957” according to M. J. Hardy in The Lockheed Constellation (Arco Publishing Company 1973 p. 51). “Capitol later built up a fleet of a dozen Super Constellations.”

By the end of the decade its US operations were relocated from Tennessee to Wilmington Delaware’s New Castle Airport.

Capitol Airways Constellation at Palma de Mallorca Airport in 1967.

The Constellation fleet continued to increase with acquisition of the first Super or stretched-fuselage L-1049G in January of 1960 which had been produced for Howard Hughes and was first delivered to him four years earlier on February 24. It marked the beginning of a significant number of them.

“In the summer of 1962 Seaboard World Airways leased seven of its Super Constellations (three L-1049Ds and four L-1049Hs) to Capitol Airways which exercising an option to purchase them eventually bought two L-1049Ds and an L-1049H” according to Hardy (ibid p. 73).

Caribbean/Mexican and transatlantic operating authorizations respectively received on September 30 1965 and April 5 1966 enabled it to expand its charter service whose lower fares were facilitated by lower operating costs high daily aircraft utilization of between 12 and 15 hours reduced overhead expenses high-density single-class accommodation and guaranteed load factors mostly supplied by tour operator bookings.

Nevertheless it still provided this service for the military one of its principle contracts entailing a transatlantic route from Frankfurt’s Rhein-Main Air Base to Charleston Air Force Base in South Carolina with an intermediate stop at the Bradley Air National Guard Base in Windsor Locks Connecticut.

Although its fleet of 17 standard-and stretched-fuselage Constellations had constituted its long-range workhorse during the 14-year period from 1955 to 1968 they began to be replaced in the 1960s with the first JT4A turbojet-powered Douglas DC-8-33s. Aircraft N900CL one of these was initially operated by Pan Am. These were supplemented by the JT8D turbofan-powered DC-8-54JT Jet Traders which featured forward left upward-opening cargo doors enabling airlines to carry all-freight all-passengers or mixtures of the two on the main deck.

Capitol Airways Douglas DC-8-63.

“Introduction of the convertible aircraft led to a new type of customer the supplemental carrier” according to Terry Waddington in Douglas DC-8 (World Transport Press 1996 p. 52). “The first to place an order was Trans International Airlines (TIA) a military charter specialist…”

1967 proved to be an important year in Capitol’s history. On March 21 it became a public company and the following day it added “international” to its name thus becoming Capitol International Airways.

Stretched-fuselage DC-8-61s configured for 252 single-class passengers in a three-three arrangement with a single aisle and acquired from Eastern Airlines soon supplemented the standard-length DC-8-33s and -54s facilitating low seat-mile cost military and civilian charter operations. At the beginning of the 1970s it relocated to Smyrna Tennessee.

Scheduled Carrier

Deregulation served as the threshold to scheduled service. Granted such authority in September of 1978 it inaugurated passenger operations to Brussels from New York the following year on May 5 and from Chicago and Boston on June 19.

Like other international supplemental carriers such as Trans International (later Transamerica) and World Airways it applied the low-cost low-fare single-class charter formula to the scheduled arena attaining low seat-mile cost high-load-factor profitability and challenging incumbent carriers. Branded “Sky Saver Service” it consistently attracted capacity-exceeding demand and sparked explosive growth. Annual passenger totals progressively increased- from 611400 in 1980 to 1150000 in 1981 and to 1824000 in 1982.

Passengers unaware of deregulation-molded carriers whose low fares could only attain profitability with used aircraft high-density seating and lower-wage nonunion employees often voiced criticism about Capitol Air’s non-interline policy and refusal to provide meals and hotel rooms during delays and compensation during missed other-airline connections. Nevertheless its fares in the New York-Los Angeles market ranged from an unrestricted $149 based upon a round-trip purchase to a one-way $189 while the majors’ unrestricted tariffs in the market hovered at the $450 mark. As a result Capitol Air’s load factors exceeded 90 percent.

Capitol Air DC-8-61 in its new paint scheme

Its JFK ground operations initially located in the Delta-Northwest Terminal was mostly manual with stamped boarding passes the old-fashioned peel-and-stick seat charts—with selection itself moved from the main check-in counter to a mid-terminal service center and finally to the departure gate-luggage destination tags hand-written tickets filled-in weight-and-balance sheets and uncontainerized baggage and cargo loading. However the reservations system was computerized (Gabriel I) its call center was located in Garden City Long Island and air and hotel packages were offered through its Sky Saver Tour department.

A significant major carrier image change occurred in 1981 when Capitol International acquired its first two widebody DC-10-10s registered N904WA and N905WA from Western. Configured for 345 single-class passengers in a two-five-two forward and three-four-three mid and aft cabin arrangement they were deployed transcontinentally and to the Caribbean offering audio-visual infight entertainment. Subsequent DC-10 acquisitions with seating for 360 featured a uniform ten-abreast configuration throughout.

1982 marked several improvements: a name change to the more simplified “Capitol Air” a relocation to the British Airways Terminal at JFK an expanded system timetable with other-carrier flight connections and an upgrade to Braniff’s Cowboy computerized reservations system with expanded automated functions.

Two other aircraft types broke the Douglas/McDonnell-Douglas DC-8-61 DC-8-63 and DC-10-10 monopoly—a single Boeing 727-200 registered N590CA and a single 315-passenger Airbus A300B4-103 registered D-AHLZ.

Capitol Air advertised itself as “Capitol Air the lowest fare” according to its December 1 1982 – March 15 1983 system timetable. “Serving the public for 36 years” it emphasized.

It explained its “Capitol Ideas” as follows: “The finest possible service at the lowest possible fares-Super DC-8 and widebody DC-10 jet fleet; complimentary meals snacks and beverages; full bar service; movies and stereo on all DC-10 and some DC-8 flights (specifically to Zurich to compete with Swissair); duty-free shopping on international flights; modern airport terminals; and streamlined baggage service.”

It considered its reach as “the star-spangled skies of Capitol Air.” stating that “there are now 13 Capitol cities of the world—with more to come:” Aguadilla Boston Brussels Chicago Frankfurt Los Angeles Miami New York Philadelphia Puerto Plata San Francisco San Juan and Zurich. “Best of all” it pointed out “Capitol’s Star-Spangled Service includes heavenly prices wherever we go.”

It offered daily nonstop flights from JFK to Chicago Los Angeles and San Francisco in the US with two round-trip frequencies to Los Angeles (Flights Cl 211 and CL 209) and one one-stop via Chicago (Flight CL 219); Aguadilla and San Juan Puerto Rico and Puerto Plata Dominican Republic in the Caribbean with the San Juan outbound sectors operating as Flight CL 215 and CL 217); and Brussels Frankfurt and Zurich in Europe. Other JFK-bypassing segments included Chicago-Miami-San Juan Chicago-Los Angeles Chicago-San Francisco and Boston-Philadelphia-San Juan.

It explained its fares as follows: “We’re the ones who started it all. Capitol originated the concept of one-class low-fare unrestricted flights. With no advance purchase no minimum stay and no hassle. And we refuse to be undersold for this kind of service. “So we keep tabs on the competition to make sure our fares are always the lowest. And we keep fares low without cutting back on our Star-Spangled Service—the kind you always expect on the more expensive airlines.”

“How low are Capitol’s fares?” it queried. “Our everyday unrestricted fares often save you up to 50% compared to economy class on other airlines. That’s right; we said economy not first class. No wonder Capitol is the best buy in the sky wherever we fly! Come take us up on it.”

Competition-Caused Decline

Capitol’s successful low-cost full-service challenge to the major airlines such as American TWA and United in the US as well as to Lufthansa Sabena and Swissair across the Atlantic was brief as they temporarily lowered their own fares to retain or regain market share forcing it to serve competition-devoid niche routes like those to Aguadilla and Puerto Plata. But inroads into these markets were eventually also made by the established operators.

George Batchelor Capitol Air’s latest owner progressively transferred assets to Arrow Air an airline which itself had transitioned from charter to scheduled service and which was also under his financial control leaving Capitol Air employees without paychecks for several weeks.

Finally now dismantled and deep in debt it was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and on November 23 1984 ceased operations ending a 38-year career as a charter and scheduled passenger carrier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc3RyYXRlZ3kvYWlyYXNpYS1jYW1ib2RpYS10by1iZS1jb3VudHJ5cy1sYXJnZXN0LWNhcnJpZXItY2FwaXRhbC1hLzE1MTMwMC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AirAsia Cambodia to be country's largest carrier: Capital A,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.flightglobal.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /strategy/airasia-cambodia-to-be-countrys-largest-carrier-capital-a/151300.article (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00FBF8A00>, 'Connection to www.flightglobal.com timed out.

However right on their doorstep a different sort of airline has quietly but steadily been building its very own multinational empire stretching all the way from Morocco to Pakistan and from Sudan to Armenia.

It’s barely 20 miles as the crow flies from Dubai’s downtown to Sharjah International Airport (SHJ) where Air Arabia has its main base.

However Air Arabia’s strategy couldn’t be more different.

Instead of trying to connect distant continents through a single massive hub Air Arabia has focused on point to point flights to and from multiple bases. Rather than trying to offer the most luxurious experience up in the sky Air Arabia has opted for the tried and tested single cabin no frills value model.

The product and market overlap is limited enough that Air Arabia’s no frills business model could be considered complementary to that of other full service carriers in the region.

This is the logic that underlies Air Arabia’s recent expansion into Abu Dhabi (AUH) where its partner is none other than the local carrier Etihad.

By inviting Air Arabia to set up shop in its home base Etihad expects to complement its existing full service offering by reaching out to additional market segments and destinations that may be less well suited to its mainline operation. This is a symbiotic relationship similar to that enjoyed by Emirates and flyDubai at Dubai international airport (DXB).

With this arrangement Abu Dhabi became Air Arabia’s third base in the UAE (in addition to its main Sharja base it also runs a small operation out of the emirate of Ras-Al-Khaima) but its ambitions reach far beyond the confines of the UAE the Gulf region or even the larger Middle East.

Air Arabia’s decentralized growth strategy has led it to establish a number of joint ventures with local partners in several different countries a formula that helps Air Arabia expand into new markets while navigating the intricacies of each particular market.

This is the case of two of Air Arabia’s earlier and most successful forays out of Sharjah: its Moroccan and Egyptian subsidiaries launched in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

In both countries Air Arabia operates under its own brand as it also did in Jordan before closing down operations in that country in 2018.

More recently Air Arabia has announced plans to launch a new venture in Sudan which will also use its own brand. For this project which was announced last September Air Arabia has allied itself with a Sudanese firm the DAL Group.

Air Arabia Sudan will be operating out of Khartoum International Airport (KRT) and is expected to replicate the operational model of its sister companies elsewhere.

This year has also seen the launch of Fly Arna a joint venture with the government-owned Armenia National Interests Fund (ANIF) which aspires to become Armenia’s national carrier. While in this case the new airline uses a different brand Air Arabia is in charge of its management and operations.

Fly Arna started operations this summer with a couple of Airbus A320s and a small network linking Yerevan (EVN) to destinations in Georgia Russia and Egypt.

Zvartnots International airport welcomed FlyArna’s first aircraft and launch destinations announced. H.E. Nikol Pashinyan Prime Minister of Armenia attended the launch ceremony along with key senior delegates. More information is available on https://t.co/tUVay1M275#FlyArna pic.twitter.com/7ZDISAV9eG — Fly Arna (@Fly_Arna) June 10 2022

Another airline which will operate under its own differentiated brand but under a similar management model is Fly Jinnah a joint venture with Pakistan’s Lakson Group.

Fly Jinnah which will be based in Karachi and at the time of publication is expected to launch imminently is part of a new crop of Pakistani budget carriers that aim to dynamize the air travel market in the populous country.

All these projects have a common denominator a textbook classical low cost airline model based on a single-class no frills cabin supplemented by a whole range of add-on ancillary services.

Likewise you can find commonality in the fleet with all airlines in Air Arabia’s galaxy exclusively operating Airbus A320 family aircraft mostly A320-200s but also some A321s and A321LRs. The long-running relationship between Air Arabia and the European manufacturer was further strengthened in 2019 when the airline placed an order for an additional 120 new Airbus aircraft (73 A320neos 27 A321neos and 20 A321XLRs).

By giving the A321s an increasingly more prominent role in its fleet Air Arabia appears to be following the likes of Wizz Air and other low-cost carriers in up-gauging as a way to increase capacity and drive down costs per passenger on key routes.

Interestingly the order included 20 of the longer range XLR version which opens up a handful of possibilities when it comes to the number of new destinations that could be reached from Air Arabia’s many and geographically dispersed bases."

The test took place at a mine in Arizona and it marked an important milestone in Caterpillar's efforts to reduce emissions and improve the sustainability of its products regardless of size.

The new electric mining truck can haul loads of up to 360 tons and like most modern EVs regardless of size it draws juice from a lithium-ion battery (whose capacity has yet to be revealed but it's safe to say it's going to be massive) allowing it to operate for up to eight hours on one charge. According to Caterpillar the truck can be fully charged in two hours meaning its downtime will be relatively low.

Announced in 2021 the 793 AC Electric Drive is part of Caterpillar's broader efforts to develop electric powertrain technology for its mining vehicles. In addition to reducing emissions the company believes that electric trucks will be more cost-effective to operate in the long run as they require less maintenance and have lower fuel costs.

The demonstration in the video took place over a 4.3-mile (7-kilometer) course in an Arizona mine where the vehicle reached a top speed of 37.3 mph (60 km/h) it was able to climb a 10 percent grade while maintaining 7.5 mph (12 km/h) and it also recovered energy when going down a similarly steep slope. These figures put it about on par with the diesel-burning 793 which has an 85-liter 16-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine that makes up 2500 horsepower.

Caterpillar says it is on a path of sustainability with the company investing heavily in research and development to improve the efficiency of its combustion engines and reduce the environmental impact of its operations. It currently offers diesel hybrid and fully-electric vehicles for various industrial roles and it plans to shift more and more towards full BEV solutions.

The Catocala also known as the underwing moth is a genus of moths with bark-like forewings and very bright underwings. They are common in North America Asia and Europe and are known for their unique ability to camouflage with their environment and keep predators away by flashing their rear wings.

5 Incredible Underwing Moth Facts

Seemingly bland in color at first glance underwing moths have a very colorful rear wing.

If agitated the underwing moths flash their rear wings to the predator and begin flapping their wings in a motion so fast that it looks like it’s vibrating.

Although their rear wings have bright colors that scream “danger” to a predator they do not actually have any poison to guard themselves against a potential predatory attack.

There are about 250-260 underwing moths species all over the world.

Underwing moths have particular sensory organs that allow them to “hear” the sound of bats from a distance.

Scientific Name

Scientifically known as Catocala the underwing moths are a genus that belongs to the family Erebidae. They were named by Franz von Paula Schrank in 1802. This genus contains at least 250-260 species of underwing moths. The name Catocala comes from two greek words – kato meaning lower and kalos meaning beautiful. This name comes from the beautiful rear wings of these moths. This name is pronounced as kah-TAH-kuh-luh.

Underwing Moth Appearance

The underwing moths have very colorful and bright rear wings. Their forewings look like tree bark or leaves which allows them to hide from their predators. On the other hand their rear wings are bright in color and patterned in different ways. When camouflaging they conceal their rear wings to prevent predators from seeing them.

Their hind wings have stripes which can vary in color to orange pink white red or black depending on the species. When threatened these moths show their rear wings which throws off the enemy – a phenomenon known as deflective coloration. When flying the underwing moths occasionally hide their rear wings in mid-air to deceive possible predators also called flash coloration. These moths usually have a wingspan of about 2-5 inches almost as long as a human thumb.

The caterpillars of an underwing moth are grey or brown allowing them to camouflage into their habitat. In addition underwing moth larvae can change color to blend with their environment.

Behavior

The underwing moth is a nocturnal genus meaning they spend the day resting on trees and the nights wandering. At night they fly from tree to tree in search of food or during the breeding season a place to lay their eggs. This genus of moths is docile and they tend to stick to themselves. So they do not fly in groups but remain solitary. They remain passive unless threatened or bothered which is when they begin to move rapidly and show their rear wings. They also start flapping their wings so fast that it appears as though they are vibrating.

Another behavior of the underwing moth is “playing dead.” They can become extraordinarily still if they feel threatened to try and cause predators to lose interest. Underwing moths also use camouflage to protect themselves. They only sit on trees that have the same color as their forewings making them almost indistinguishable from the bark.

It is thought that any loud noise triggers their sense of smell instead of a startled response. In addition they have sensory organs that allow them to detect vibrations or sounds at a specific frequency such as that of a bat which is one of their main predators.

Habitat

Underwing moths live in forests with the same color bark as their wings allowing them to camouflage effectively. This means that they typically thrive in deciduous trees. However they can also be found in caves under rocks and ledges and in other bushes or areas that allow them to camouflage.

The caterpillars of underwing moths live in tree canopies or soil. During the day they hide at the trunk base and at night they return to the tree to feed on the leaves.

Almost half of all underwing moth species are found in North America and the remaining species are found in Asia and Europe. In addition a few unique species are found in the northern Neotropics and Indomalaya.

Diet

Underwing moths are herbivores meaning that their diet is entirely based on plants. Most of the species feed on deciduous tree leaves in the forest. However they can also feed on grass and other vegetation in their habitat.

What Eats Underwing Moths?

The underwing moths are preyed on by larger carnivorous animals and insectivores. These include but are not limited to birds bats lizards and spiders. The moths often escape these predators by flashing their rear wings and rapidly flapping their wings. The bright color of their rear wings also gives some predators the impression that they are poisonous. However they are not poisonous creatures.

What Does The Underwing Moth Eat?

The primary food of an underwing moth varies depending on its habitat and the surrounding trees. But overall this genus feeds on the leaves of the trees within their habitat usually deciduous trees. They can also feed on grass and other plants within their habitat. Underwing moth caterpillars typically eat poplars and willows.

Underwing Moth Predators and Threats

Since underwing moths are tiny creatures they are preyed on by many larger animals such as birds bats lizards and spiders.

Predators aside other threats that underwing moths face are habitat loss deforestation and pesticides. Too much artificial light and a sudden climate change also significantly affect their population.

Reproduction And Lifecycle

The underwing moth goes through a complete lifecycle before becoming fully grown. In the mating season males locate the females by their pheromones. And once the mating process has occurred the female lays her eggs soon after. In the summer the female underwing moths deposit eggs on tree branches either one at a time or in small clusters. These eggs only take 4-10 days to hatch if laid during the summer but in winter it can take up to 3 weeks. Once they hatch they become a worm-like larva known as a caterpillar. At this stage of the cycle they do not have wings. Instead they wriggle around and hide on the branches of trees. After about one month they become adult moths and the cycle repeats.

Babies

Baby underwing moths are called caterpillars and have elongated bodies with no wings. These are similar larvae to butterflies except they are brown and grey instead while butterfly caterpillars are more colorful. They eat plant material and leaves in their habitat and take about a month to fully mature. At the end of the caterpillar’s cycle they form a chrysalis and its body digests itself and forms an entirely new body with wings.

Lifespan

The average lifespan of an underwing moth is not very long only one to six months after which they begin to wear out and spend less time flying. Towards the end of their lives they become susceptible to some common ailments. These include:

An infestation of fungus on their bodies

Wing withering diseases – diseases that affect the moth’s wings and impair their flying ability.

Underwing Moth Population

The overall population of the underwing moth genus is unknown. There are around 250-260 underwing moth species living all over the world most of which have stable populations. However two of their species in Missouri have a status of Vulnerable. The rest remain Least Concern considering their rapid reproductive cycle.

The humble acorn a staple fall food for many wild animals is scarce this year - a ripple effect of the infestation of spongy moth caterpillars in 2020 and 2021.

The local conservation authority is bringing attention to what could be called a “moth effect.""

An invasive species with a taste for oak trees might have caused a food scarcity problem for bears and other wildlife that rely on the fat and carbohydrate-rich acorn for their fall chow downs.

File this one under the list of things blamed on the spongy moth (formerly known as the gypsy moth) infestation and the voracious appetite of their adolescent larvae phase: the very hungry caterpillars.

Many Simcoe County residents will likely remember the cacophony of caterpillars the burlap around the tree trunks to lure the hairy wormy creatures into a trap so they can be scraped into a bucket of soapy water and left to liquefy.

The spongy moth – aka Lymantria dispar dispar – is native to Europe and Asia. Its latest name comes from the spongy texture of the egg clusters deposited on tree trunks by the moths at the end of their lives. Considered an invasive species in North America the blue-and-red spotted caterpillars have found a foliage smorgasbord and have done away with self-control.

The year 2021 was an “outbreak” year but not because of COVID-19. In 2020 and moreso in 2021 spongy moth caterpillars were so prolific frass (their droppings) seemed to rain from leafless trees. But the caterpillars' glutton has been their demise and the population of the invasive species has dropped since past generations don't seem to have any instincts to leave some leaves for the next guys.

According to Kyra Howes manager of lands and operations for the Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority the infestation of spongy moth caterpillars was classified as “severe” in 2021 which means more than 75 per cent of the forests in the watershed region were impacted.

In 2022 the infestation is classified as “light” which means about 40 per cent or fewer trees are impacted.

But the voracious appetites of the spongy moths in 2021 has left a shortage of one important staple for many wild animals.

“I didn’t see one acorn this year” said Howes.

Acorns grow on oak trees which happen to be the prime rib on the buffet for spongy moths. During the 2021 outbreak spongy moths ate foliage indiscriminately like locusts in a Biblical plague. But Howes said the moth larva does prefer hardwoods: firstly oaks then birch and poplars. Last year they ate the needles off the tamarack trees.

“It’s just like if you and I were at a buffet we’ll pick our preferred food first but if we’re at the end of the line of the buffet then we’ll go for the carrot sticks and things” said Howes.

Since the oak trees had to focus on growing several sets of leaves in a season they rerouted what energy would have been used to make acorns causing very few maybe none to grow this year.

“Acorns are an important food source for a lot of species including deer ruffed grouse turkeys squirrels and blue jays” said Howes.

Bears also love acorns and often rely on them for a season each year. The NVCA notes acorns are a fall staple for bears looking to bulk up for hibernation because an acorn is high in fat and carbohydrates.

“You will see for example deer will congregate whenever there’s an acorn proliferation in a spot” said Howes. “A lot of species are able to diversify … survive without acorns. But it’s definitely beneficial when they do have a lot of acorns.”

Without a ready supply of the fall nut bears may have to travel farther for food and that could include venturing into more residential areas.

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) hasn’t collected information on whether there is a decline in acorn production but acknowledged oak trees are very susceptible to defoliation by spongy moth caterpillars. Defoliation can reduce the number of acorns produced by reducing the flowers that develop into acorns and reducing the number of flower buds formed.

“Oak tree acorn production depends on weather and tree age size and vigour” stated the MNRF in an email to OrilliaMatters. “Typically trees with larger crowns generally produce more acorns … heavy defoliation or mortality of trees that consistently produce large acorn crops could affect acorn availability and consequently natural oak regeneration in affected areas in the short term.”

The ministry doesn’t collect data to correlate spongy moth infestations with bear sightings but less food means more looking for food.

“When there are a lot of natural foods available the number of reported bear sightings is lower” stated the MNRF. “When natural food sources are scarce reported sightings are higher because black bears will look for alternative food sources – sometimes in urban or developed areas.”

According to data collected by the ministry the number of non-emergency bear sightings reported to the Bear Wise reporting line in 2021 in the Midhurst district (which includes Collingwood and Simcoe County) was approximately double the number of bear sightings reported in 2022.

“This would suggest natural food sources for bears were lower in 2022 than 2021 in this general area” stated the MNRF.

While tree-attacking invasive species are not new to Simcoe County and the NVCA watershed – the emerald ash borer has made a rarity of ash trees – this is the first time the area has seen such an infestation of the spongy moth and it’s the first one that’s targeted oak trees.

Howes isn’t aware of anything that has caused an acorn shortage on such a “landscape level.”

“Oaks were our stoic solid presence in the forests” said Howes. “There will still be things that impact them drought for example but not on such a landscape level.”

About five per cent of the trees in the Nottawasaga watershed are oak trees but the distribution isn’t uniform. They are concentrated in specific areas including Wasaga Beach and the Oro Moraine.

Acorns grow on a two-year cycle so the trees that didn’t work on them in 2021 because of the caterpillars should be able to produce them for 2023 she explained.

The bears and other animals will have to find alternative food sources but don't be tempted to assist in their search. Setting food out for wild animals can do more harm than good experts warn.

The NVCA and MNRF suggest taking steps to avoid potential conflicts with bears at any time not just during acorn shortages.

The best way to avoid conflict with bears is to avoid attracting them. There are tips online to help residents be bear-wise. They include:

Only put garbage out on the morning of garbage day not the night before pick-up.

Store meat scraps in the freezer until garbage day.

Frequently wash garbage cans and store them with tight-fitting lids in a basement or garage where possible.

Fill bird feeders only through the winter months and take them away in the spring. You can offer birds natural alternatives such as nesting boxes flowers and fresh water.

Keep your barbecue clean by burning off food residue washing the grill and emptying the grease trap.

Do not leave pet food outdoors in screened enclosures or on porches.

You can report a non-emergency bear sighting to the MNRF by calling 1-866-514-2327. Call 911 in an emergency."

Deloitte an international audit and consulting firm in mid-December will relocate its Omaha workforce to the structure’s top floor marking the first traditional office-user at the Capitol District site touted primarily as an entertainment district.

Millions in TIF

The broader multimillion-dollar Capitol District campus which spans a few blocks is bookended by a 333-room Marriott hotel and an apartment tower. A key feature is an outdoor plaza with a stage surrounded by bars restaurants and other retailers.

Omaha officials selected the Capitol District project in 2011 to rise on the site of what then were public parking lots. Actual construction was delayed several years and relied in part on up to $35 million in City Council-approved public tax-increment financing to get off the ground.

Deloitte currently in 26000 square feet at the First National Tower at 16th and Dodge Streets is to move to about 10000 square feet of the mixed-use office building — which was the last structural piece to complete the $205 million-plus Capitol District in late 2020.

That finish two years ago came during the pandemic when many employees were working remotely and office space was not in demand by professional service companies.

Office market improves

More recently though the Gene Leahy Mall was overhauled. More apartment complexes are rising nearby. Entertainment venues such as the Steelhouse Omaha concert hall and Kiewit Luminarium science museum also are about to open around the Capitol District.

Mutual of Omaha also has plans to build a $600 million office tower the tallest in the central business district on the site of the demolished main public library.

While Deloitte is downsizing its footprint and shifting from one urban core spot to another the latest office market report shows improved activity overall in the downtown market.

According to Colliers International of Omaha the vacancy rate during the third quarter of this year was 6.4% in the downtown area compared to nearly 8% a year ago.

Kristi Andersen of CBRE which is handling some of the leasing at the Capitol District said her team sees excitement mounting in and around the district with the various amenities planned.

Said Deloitte spokesman Dan Kinsella: “As a longstanding member of the Omaha community we’re excited to commit to the Capitol District and be at the center of Omaha’s ongoing revitalization of the urban core.”

Andersen acknowledged caution in that some office space both downtown and elsewhere in the metro is leased and producing rent but is not being fully used because of the increase in remote work. The wait is on to see what happens to those properties but Andersen said she she remains optimistic for downtown’s future.

Let it Fly

Also headed to the Capitol District is a new retailer: a 350-seat 10000-square-foot sports bar called Let It Fly.

Inside will be a glass-enclosed podcast studio and a 48-foot diagonal curved LED screen above the main bar which will allow patrons to watch sports broadcasters Mike’l Severe and Josh Jones interview athletes and coaches while they dine.

Slated to open in spring 2023 the sports bar and restaurant — with two outdoor patios and a retail shop — will join more than 20 restaurants bars and businesses in the Capitol District whose lead investor is Paul Smith’s Black Dog Management.

Additional retail and office space is available for lease at the district’s mixed-use office building. Let It Fly will be next to Texas de Brazil in that structure 1100 Capitol Ave.

Let It Fly founder and president Mike Miller is a former NBA basketball player for teams including the Memphis Grizzlies Minnesota Timberwolves and Miami Heat. Among others involved in the venture according to CBRE is investor Ryan Miller who also is assistant basketball coach at Creighton University.

The Let It Fly partners said the Capitol District location will become the flagship for its restaurants which also are in Germantown Tennessee and Sioux Falls South Dakota.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3Jlc2VhcmNoLXBvbGljeS9zaW5nYXBvcmUtYm9vc3RzLWxhbmQtc3VwcGx5LWJ5LTE3LXRvLXRhbWUtcmlzaW5nLWhvdXNpbmctcHJpY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singapore Boosts Residential Land Supply by 17%,"After seeing housing prices rise in defiance of escalating interest rates and punitive stamp duties Singapore authorities have announced plans to sell more housing sites during the first half of 2023 than in any period over the past decade.

In documents published late last week Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said it will auction off seven residential and flexible use “white sites” within the first six months of 2023 that could yield up to 4090 new homes.

“Given that underlying housing demand remains resilient and continues to accumulate pushing out new housing supply would mitigate a potential sharp recovery in prices when market conditions recover” said Xian Yang Wong research head for Singapore at Cushman & Wakefield.

The government land sale plan (GLS) which features substantial plots in the emerging commercial hub of Jurong Lake District as well as in Marina Bay in the central business district also includes projects that will yield 106400 square metres (1.15 million square feet) of new commercial space across the city-state.

Expanding Home Pipeline

The land use planning agency has now increased its half-year government land sale programme five times in a row “to cater to strong demand from homebuyers” – making the latest list the largest since the first half of 2014 when the GLS rolled out sites capable of yielding up to 4630 new homes.

The residential plots in URA’s latest confirmed list – which contains sites with definitive plans for for public tender in the next six months – can provide up to 3390 private homes and 700 executive condominiums (a kind of hybrid public-private housing). That figure is 17 percent higher than the 3505 potential units offered in the second half of 2022.

A plot on Marina Gardens Crescent in Singapore’s central business district is one of the highest profile sites on the list. The parcel in the Marina South area which is designated as a “white site” which allows development for a flexible range of commercial and residential uses would be only the second project to go on sale in the corner of the Marina Bay area.

Located next to a Marina Gardens Lane plot launched for sale last week the Marina Gardens Crescent site is scheduled to be auctioned off around June 2023 and offers 1.73 hectares (4.3 acres) land that can yield up to 775 residential units and 6000 square metres of retail space.

For Chia Siew Chuin JLL’s head of residential research in Singapore participation in the Marina South tender will likely be limited due to the expected cost of the site.

“Potential bidders are likely to form joint ventures in order to consolidate and leverage resources strengthen competitive edge and dilute market competition” Chia said.

Largest Commercial Supply Since 2016

The biggest plot on the program is a sprawling 6.8 hectare white site in Jurong Lake District linking to the Jurong East MRT interchange.

With the potential to provide up to 150000 square metres of office space 1760 private homes and 75000 square metres of retail hotel or community space the project is slated to be developed in phases over the next five to 10 years.

For the first phase of the project the winning bidder is required to build at least 70000 square metres of office space and 600 homes.

CBRE Southeast Asia research head Tricia Song said the sheer size of the project means developers will need to pay at least S$2 billion ($1.48 billion) in land premiums or an estimated S$1300 per square foot of built area which will push companies to form bidding consortia.

“This marks the largest GLS office space supply since 2016 and the largest in a decentralised location” she said. “Based on the targeted release date of June 2023 on GLS and assuming 3-6 months of tender period we expect the earliest office completion will likely be in 2028.”

PropNex Realty CEO Ismail Gafoor predicts that the project will attract large real estate companies with a “strong track record in project development financial credibility and long-term vision.”

Feeding Housing Demand

JLL’s Chia said residential sites at Media Circle in the one-north area and on Champions Way in northern Singapore’s Woodlands district show the government adding new projects in undersupplied locations.

The projects in Media Circle and Champions Way are attractive for developers she added providing up to 345 homes in Champions Way and as many as 355 units along with 400 square metres of commercial space for the Media Circle site.

The other private residential sites are in Jalan Tembusu Katong and Lentor Central in Ang Mo Kio as well as an EC site in Tampines Street in the city’s northeast region.

Under its reserve list which is used to designate sites which could be launched for tender if there is sufficient demand the URA has included six residential plots which could provide a combined 3625 residential units and one white site which would yield up to 93350 square metres of commercial space and a 530-key hotel.

“In mitigating escalating costs and increasing risks from economic uncertainty and rising interest rates the sites that developers might consider triggering would be the smaller ones where 500 units or less can be built as larger sites in excess of 700 units are less appetising given the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty for housing developers” said Leonard Tay research head at Knight Frank Singapore.

Home Market Heats Up

The URA’s boost to Singapore’s land supply comes as the city’s housing market has seen prices continue to rise in the second half of 2022 with new projects routinely selling out within weeks of launch. Prices of private homes across the city have now risen for 10 straight quarters.

Government data shows that home prices rose by 3.8 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months accelerating from 3.5 percent price growth in the second quarter.

Copen Grand an executive condo project launched by City Developments Ltd and MCL Land in October is the latest example of housing demand in the city.

The project in western Singapore’s Tengah Town saw all of its 639 units sold at an average price of S$1300 per square foot within one month of its launch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL2hvbWVjby1ib29zdHMtZnVuZC1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtMjQyLTUtbWlsbGlvbi1kZWFsLTIwMjIxMjA4LXA1YzR2ai5odG1s0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb21wYW5pZXMvaG9tZWNvLWJvb3N0cy1mdW5kLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtd2l0aC0yNDItNS1taWxsaW9uLWRlYWwtMjAyMjEyMDgtcDVjNHZqLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HomeCo boosts fund management with $242.5 million deal,"David Di Pilla’s funds management group HMC Capital has splashed out $242.5 million to buy two shopping centres from Lendlease in the largest deal for the retail sector in four years.

Attorney General-elect Tim Griffin announced on Friday his senior staff and plans to restructure the state's legal team.

Griffin also announced the creation of the Office of General Counsel which will provide legal advice internally within the attorney general's office and externally through the opinions and state agencies divisions both of which will be led by the deputy general counsel.

""I am excited to announce my senior staff and restructuring"" Griffin said in a news release. ""This talented team will serve with excellence and the highest level of professionalism. They share my commitment to protecting Arkansans from criminals unscrupulous actors and an overreaching federal government.""

Griffin the current lieutenant governor told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Friday that the restructuring plan is consistent with his vision for the office and that he believes it will better serve Arkansans. Rep. David Ray R-Maumelle and spokesman for Griffin's campaign said the changes will be implemented within the existing fiscal structure of the office and will not require additional positions.

The Republican's restructuring plan includes the elimination of the chief of staff position and two deputy chief of staff positions and will implement a supervisory structure headed by Chief Deputy Attorney General Bob Brooks a Fort Smith native and a current partner at Capitol Counsel LLC.

Brooks served as chief of staff to former Louisiana congressman and Capitol Counsel partner Jim McCrery. He has served as an operative for the national Republican senatorial committee and the Republican National Committee's presidential campaign team.

Griffin also plans to create a special litigation section under the Civil Litigation Division.

""This new section of experienced litigators will handle the most complex cases and work in tandem with the outstanding appellate practice of the solicitor general's office"" the news release states.

Zach Mayo will serve as general counsel. Mayo currently serves as criminal justice counsel for the governor's office and has served as a clerk for Arkansas Supreme Court Associate Justice Shawn Womack and deputy director of external relations for the Federalist Society.

Carl Vogelpohl a Little Rock native serving as Griffin's chief of staff and a former chief of staff in the attorney general's office will be a senior advisor.

What happened next forever changed trial jury awards and has had a lasting impact on multiple industries across the U.S. especially commercial transportation.

Liebeck who was in the passenger seat of her grandson’s car spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap scalding her thighs buttocks and groin.

The 79-year-old woman was taken to a hospital where she was treated for third-degree burns on 6% of her skin. Liebeck needed surgery to repair the damage caused by the hot coffee which was later determined to have had a temperature between 180 and 190 degrees.

Liebeck reportedly didn’t want to go to court at first only asking McDonald’s to pay her $20000 medical expenses. McDonald’s refused leading her to file a lawsuit against the company in 1993.

In 1994 a jury concluded that McDonald’s handling of its coffee was irresponsible and awarded Liebeck $2.9 million (equivalent to more than $6 million in 2022). Liebeck later settled for less than $600000.

The exponential rise of nuclear verdicts

Nuclear verdicts have become prominent in the trucking industry relatively recently but have been around in other sectors of the economy for decades.

In 1994 a jury awarded $5 billion in the Exxon Valdez oil spill case to thousands of Alaska commercial fishermen and property owners. In 1999 a Los Angeles jury awarded $4.9 billion





against General Motors to six burn victims who were permanently disfigured when the GM car they were riding in on Christmas Eve 1993 burst into flames after being hit in a rear-end collision.

While there had been other famous cases before it the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) said Liebeck’s 1994 lawsuit against McDonald’s captured the country’s attention in a way jury awards had never done before in its 2020 report “Understanding the Impact of Nuclear Verdicts on the Trucking Industry.”

“While this amount was reduced after appeal and settled for an undisclosed amount large verdicts captured America’s attention becoming fodder for late-night television and legal scholars alike” ATRI said in the report.

ATRI defines a “nuclear verdict” as a monetary award in excess of $10 million.

Nuclear verdicts against the trucking industry seem to be an American phenomenon and don’t occur in neighboring countries.

“Mexico is much different” Mark Vickers executive vice president of international logistics at Chattanooga Tennessee-based trucking industry provider Reliance Partners told FreightWaves.

“There is limited legal recourse and liability claims in Mexico will most likely not have the same catastrophic consequences as we are seeing for fleets and brokerages in the U.S.” Vickers said. “But that’s not to say it can’t happen. When legal teams in Mexico realize what is sticking in the United States they will begin to pattern their cases accordingly.”

In the U.S. the watershed moment in trucking-related nuclear verdicts came in 2011 when a jury in Cobb County Georgia awarded $40 million in a wrongful death suit according to ATRI.





The case was filed by Theresa Foster who was seeking to hold a Florida trucking company accountable for a 2007 collision that killed her husband William Foster as well as a friend Jay Demont and caused her serious injuries.

“The jury deliberated for five hours and it resulted in a verdict of $40 million with $28.7 million being attributed to the value of the life of [William Foster] for his future business venture” ATRI said.

Vickers said nuclear verdicts are now extending beyond the trucking company with freight brokerages getting pulled into lawsuits.

“It’s costing them big” Vickers said.

The National Law Journal reported the average jury award among the top 100 U.S. verdicts more than tripled between 2015 and 2019 skyrocketing from $64 million to $214 million. More than 30% of verdicts surpassed the $100 million threshold in 2019 compared to 2015.

According to research from Reliance Partners there have been 11 adverse rulings against brokers at the circuit federal or state court levels in just the last 17 months finding that a broker may be held liable under state common law for the actions of a motor carrier.

I'm senior reporter Phil Rosen. I've just finished teeing up your weekend reads — and there are some doozies on deck.

Today's newsletter features my conversation with Liz Ann Sonders of Charles Schwab and why she thinks the economy's already in a recession.

Then we'll dig into some of the best reads from across Insider's award-winning newsroom.

If this was forwarded to you sign up here. Download Insider's app here.

Liz Ann Sonders is the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Phil Rosen: Can you explain your ""rolling recession"" assessment of the US economy?

Liz Ann Sonders: Typically when you go into a recession everything's sort of hit all at once. That was certainly the case with the COVID recession and financial crisis.

But now specific categories have gone into recession territory like housing consumer confidence CEO confidence or metrics like the inverted yield curve. But you have that offsetting positive because of the pent-up demand that's still finding its way into services and keeping the labor market afloat.

Eventually you'll see a rolling over there in part because that's precisely what the Fed's trying to do weaken the labor market such that inflation continues to decelerate. I think it's only a matter of time before many of the segments not yet hit do get hit — a situation where weakness rolls through.

How deep do you expect the downturn to get?

LAS: Some pockets have been hit you've seen pretty deep contractions. But overall I would expect that we can avoid a major deterioration in GDP because of the rolling nature but also because we don't have the kind of imbalances that we did in the 2007 to 2009 period.







When the housing bust happened it took the entire global financial system down. But there's none of that now so it should keep GDP contractions limited barring some black swan event. But it might last a longer time because of the rolling nature.

How do you see the Fed navigating the coming months?

LAS: The Fed's trying to perfectly thread the needle of weakening the labor market trying to crush job openings without crushing employment. That's always tricky. Either they overshoot and you have a more severe contraction in the economy or they declare victory too soon on the inflation front.

Because we haven't seen significant enough loosening in the labor market you have a kind of 1970s-type story. But conditions surrounding today's inflation are quite different from the '70s. What really caused Volcker in the 1980s to have to ""pull a Volcker"" and hike rates was because of the mistake in the '70s — when the Fed thought inflation was tackled they loosened policy it reignited again.

So the Fed wants to avoid the fits and starts that ended up leading Volcker to do what he did. They want the medicine to be applied with more consistency.

Near-term pain in the labor market sets up a better long-term economic outlook.

How will stock market investing change in 2023?

LAS: There's important shifts that started this year that will continue next year and one is that fundamentals have gotten reconnected to prices. Equal weight [stocks] are doing much better relative to cap weight; active managers are having a much better year than has been the case in the past. A lot of this has to do with the fact there's actually a risk-free rate again.

Investors should focus on ""what's missing"" in the macro sense. In other words for example we're in a declining earnings revisions environment meaning forward earnings estimates are coming down you then want to look for companies that have positive earnings surprises.

We're not in an environment where making a sector call or two is going to be the way to do well. It's going to be more based on fundamentals and I think that's actually a positive backdrop even if we're still in an environment where volatility is likely to persist because what I think is not yet priced into the market is the further deterioration in earnings.

Can you share a book recommendation?

LAS: I have my absolute favorite book of all time ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator."" That was the first book given to me when I started in this business in 1986 and it's the one I recommend all the time.

It really helps people understand how psychology comes into play as a more important driver of what markets do than any other fundamentals.

And your favorite quote about markets?

LAS: It's what I think John Templeton is most known for: ""Bull markets are born on pessimism grown on skepticism mature on optimism and die on euphoria.""

The Charles Schwab Cup Championship marks the end of the PGA Tour Champions. It is the final of the three-event playoff series. The player with the most points gathered during the entire tour goes on to win the Charles Schwab Cup and with it the huge bonus prize.

Throughout the events of the PGA Tour Champions all the money the players earn is converted to points. 54 players with the highest points go on to the second leg and the top 36 go on to the final game which is the Charles Schwab Cup Championship.

The Charles Schwab Cup Championship format

The Charles Schwab Cup Championship’s format is different from that of the regular tour tournaments. It is a 72-hole event. The 36 total fields are split into 18 twosomes for the initial two rounds. The players compete within the same group on both days with the same pairs playing together.

In the third and fourth rounds pairings and tee times are all based on how each player did in the second and third rounds. Players with the highest overall score proceed first followed by the two with the next highest and so on. This continues with the final group being the last two players who have the lowest scores.

The Championship is a no-cut event. This means that even after 36 holes no players are cut and the entire field is eligible to play all four rounds. Phil Mickelson won the event last year but he has since signed with LIV Golf so he won’t be there to defend his title.

The purse and split of the Charles Schwab Cup Championship

The 2022 Charles Schwab Cup Championship sees a total purse of 2.5 million USD of which the winner will receive $440000 in prize money. The total purse is split up among the entire field of 36.

After the event the winner of the Charles Schwab Cup is also determined based on points. Bernhard Langer was the one who won it last year for the sixth time. The top five players in the Charles Schwab Cup receive a bonus. The winner receives a million dollars while the runner-up receives $500000. The third and fourth places get $300000 and $200000 respectively while the fifth player wins $100000. This is in addition to their winnings in the championship.

Charles Schwab

In an interview with Insider Charles Schwab's Liz Ann Sonders explained her economic outlook for 2023.

The US is already in the midst of a ""rolling recession"" she said.

Sonders shared her stock investing strategy as well as her favorite book of all time.

Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders doesn't think a US recession is going to hit sometime in 2023.

That's because it's already arrived — but in the form of a ""rolling recession.""

In fact the best-case scenario would be a continuation of this rolling recession she explained as it would mean there isn't a complete bottoming-out all at once unlike in 2009 when the economy exhibited much more severe imbalances.

""When you have certain pockets that are weak you've got offsetting pockets of strength"" Sonders said in an interview with Insider.

Housing several goods-oriented sectors consumer confidence CEO confidence and the inverted yield curve have already entered recession territory this year she said. But there remain strong points like household balance sheets and pent-up demand that's keeping the jobs market resilient.

Eventually the labor market will turn south too which is how the Fed will rein in inflation Sonders predicted. But the central bank must avoid loosening monetary policy too soon and investors shouldn't expect a quick Fed pivot.

""I think the Fed is still having a difficult time getting market participants to understand that once they get to the terminal rate they're likely to be there for a while"" Sonders said noting that the Fed will have to weigh near-term pain in the labor market versus long-term strength in the economy.

How to invest in stocks in 2023

Sonders said the stock market endured several shifts that are set to continue next year most notable being that fundamentals have reconnected with prices and mega-cap tech companies will hold less gravity in indexes.

That being said investors should be focused on ""what's missing"" in the macro sense she said.

""In other words we're in a declining earnings revisions environment meaning forward earnings estimates are coming down — a factor of the weakening economy"" Sonders explained adding that investors should look for companies that have positive earnings surprises.

And with fundamentals returning to the fore that puts greater emphasis on picking individual stocks rather than favoring overall sectors.

""I just think for now we're not in an environment where making a sector call or two is going to be the way to do well"" she said. ""It's going to be more based on fundamentals and I think that's actually a positive backdrop even if we're still in an environment where volatility is likely to persist and ongoing bouts of weakness because of what I think is not yet priced into the market is the further deterioration in earnings.""







'My absolute favorite book of all time'

Sonders said her ""absolute favorite book of all time"" is the 1923 novel ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" by Edwin Lefèvre a first-person fictional tale of a character inspired by the real-life day trader Jesse Livermore.

She said she admires how the book illustrates the importance of psychology as a key driver in markets and how it influences trades more than fundamentals.

""That was the first book given to me when I started in this business in 1986"" she said. ""It's the one I recommend all the time.""",,,

DALLAS Texas — A Dallas contracting company that hired capital murder suspect Tanner Horner to drive for FedEx has yet to provide details about the 31-year-old's employment history or any hiring protocols he had to pass to drive for the shipping giant.

Horner is charged with capital murder and aggravated kidnapping after telling investigators that he backed into 7-year-old Athena Strand while delivering a Christmas package to her home in Wise County last Wednesday.

Per his confession Horner panicked about the consequences of the accident and abducted little Athena only to strangle her and dump her body in a rural part of Boyd.

The contracting company that hired Horner 'Big Topspin Inc.' was named in his arrest warrant and aided in his arrest per investigators.

The address for the company was also listed in the documents and led WFAA to a four-bedroom home in North Dallas off River Hill Drive.

When WFAA arrived at the home a woman who lived there could not comment about Horner's employment history or Strand's death but confirmed her husband owned the company.

Contact information for WFAA was passed along and a representative has yet to reach out about the mentioned inquiries.

Across the country FedEx relies on its 6000 contractors that provide package pickup and delivery services using their employees.

Per a FedEx spokesperson ""The employees of these service provider companies are subject to criminal history background checks as part of the driver eligibility process. As is common across the industry and considered standard employment practice the background check process is administered by a third party.""

Horner has no known criminal history and FedEx didn't elaborate when asked questions about his employment.

This week WFAA reached out to the shipping giant and asked how long Horner had been contracted to work with FedEx when he began driving for the company how many drivers are contracted through Big Topspin and what FedEx's prescribed hiring protocols are for Big Topspin.

The spokesperson replied ""Service provider companies utilize their own employees vehicles and equipment. As such we are not at liberty to discuss details of personnel employed by service providers.""

These are all questions that attorneys for Strand's mother Maitlyn Gandy will likely start asking too.

Gandy announced Thursday at a press conference in Wise County that Varghese Summersett of Fort Worth was representing her.

Attorneys for the firm revealed they would be investigating the situation and were prepared to hold anyone accountable for Athena's death responsible.

That might very well end up being FedEx. But how could that play out litigiously?

Attorney Mike Lyons of Lyons & Simmons LLP in Dallas has been extensively speaking with WFAA on this topic.

He reached a hefty settlement with Charter Communications after a third-party cable installer raped a 72-year-old woman with Alzheimer's in Dallas in 2017.

Lyons has also been in court with FedEx before.

""Companies have really slick good-looking policies on paper and they're great theoretical constructs. The question is whether or not in practice they're actually doing what they say they should be doing"" Lyons said.

""If this guy is going to show up in your front yard he needs to be properly vetted trained and someone needs to make sure that this guy is not some type of threat. The big question is how does this guy end up driving for FedEx and what is his past?""

Lyons said most don't realize that people delivering packages for FedEx don't actually work for the company but still wear their logo as a third-party driver.

""The guy behind the wheel may not be an employee -- he may be some guy working for some other contractor"" Lyons said.

And even so FedEx may face liability for what happened to little Athena -- even if Horner had no criminal past and he belonged to a third-party contractor.

Lyons' most important question if he were on the case was whether Horner or Big Topspin was fit to be contractors for the company in the first place.

""There's law in Texas that says if you don't exercise reasonable diligence in hiring a contractor and you hire someone who's unfit then you may have liability"" Lyons said.

""FedEx requires guidelines procedures and protocols where they are exercising control over their contractor. Otherwise they can't have these guys driving around in their trucks. You either are or you aren't controlling the details of their work. And if it turns out that they are whether through their hiring practices or their supervision they may have liability.""",,,,,,
CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaW50aGVzZXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2xvdWlzaWFuYS1sYW5kLWxvc3MtZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWxzLXJlcGFyYXRpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil Companies Have Plundered Louisiana's Coast. They Owe Us Reparations.,"The call for accountability against oil and gas companies is critical but the dominant narrative misses an essential component: There’s no mention of financial reparations for Indigenous and historically Black communities in southern Louisiana who suffer the most loss and damages due to land loss and climate change and who are being actively displaced.

And this is just the beginning. Recently a federal court ordered a nine-year-old lawsuit to return to state court. The suit was filed against Chevron USA Exxon Mobil Corp. ConocoPhillips Co. and BP America. Over 40 similar legal challenges may follow against the oil and gas companies that have caused and are causing Louisiana’s wetlands to disappear at an alarming rate. These lawsuits could win billions of dollars in damages.

I can’t tell you in numbers the cost of a dying delta. I can tell you that since 1970 the oil and gas industry has raked in $52 trillion in profits.

The Jean Charles Choctaw Nation which recently changed its name from the Isle de Jean Charles band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw a neighboring tribe related to the Houma recently relocated from their home island in Terrebonne Parish which shrunk from its original 35 miles to less than 1 square mile. Elders will tell you that Isle de Jean Charles used to be walkable to Pointe-aux-Chenes the tiny Houma-French speaking town where my dad was raised and where my family lives. This trek is no longer possible.

Since oil and gas established corporate-colonial occupation over the area in the 1930s Louisiana has lost more than 2000 square miles of land. Companies dredged thousands of miles of canals through the marsh to get to and from oil and gas wells carving up Native bayou communities. These canals directly destroy wetlands disrupt wetland hydrology and act as avenues for salt water intrusion causing the coastal marshes our necessary and natural barriers to hurricanes to rapidly erode.

Oil and gas companies have long opposed Indigenous tribes in Southern Louisiana achieving federal recognition. They fear that Native people will reclaim the oil-rich ocean-accessible lands that fossil fuel corporations have been ruining for nearly a century.

Southern Louisiana is home to large Native communities including my own the Houma. While many Houma still live on our ancestral lands it is the fastest disappearing region in the country. Our lands are unprotected because no Indigenous tribe in the southernmost regions of Louisiana has federal recognition and the state of Louisiana is heavily invested in fossil fuels.

Likewise historically Black communities such as Ironton a freedmen’s town located in Plaquemines Parish continue to resist displacement. After hurricanes Katrina and Isaac only about 50 families remain in the community. In 2021 Hurricane Ida scattered dozens of unearthed coffins from Ironton’s community cemetery and left few houses unscathed; recovery is ongoing. It is not incidental that Ironton is surrounded by polluting infrastructure including the 2400-acre Phillips 66 Alliance oil refinery a grain terminal and two coal export terminals. Not far from Ironton a company called Venture Global is preparing to construct a pipeline and an export terminal Plaquemines LNG for liquified natural gas.

Oil and gas companies argue that they are legally allowed to destroy wetlands under state and federal rules put in place decades ago. Over time the fossil fuel industry has ramped up destructive practices despite knowing the severe environmental consequences; it has become a wealthy and powerful machine that can manipulate laws in its favor.

At the same time oil and gas wells and canals are sinking the Louisiana coast sea levels are rising due to climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has removed the names of 31 bodies of water from their maps of Louisiana as bayou and bay borders disappear and become open water. The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act will add another layer to these injuries by reinstating $190 million in bids from fossil fuel companies to drill in the Gulf.

At the recent COP27 climate conference one of the primary points of discussion was sourcing funding for ​“loss and damages” from climate change. Environmental leaders from across the world called on colonizing countries such as the United States and European countries to reinstate their extracted wealth to countries in the Global South who have contributed the least to climate change but are experiencing the worst impacts.

Likewise our conversations around loss and damages here in the United States must include accountability for the rich extractive polluting industry that has torn up the Louisiana coast while emphasizing a just transition. In a an essay calling for reparations from oil and gas corporations New Orleanian artist and researcher Imani Jacqueline Brown invoked the doctrine of ​“unjust enrichment:” If an entity profits by impoverishing another then these profits are unjust and must be reinstated.

In October Shell reported its second highest quarterly profit ever at $9.5 billion. Chevron made $11.2 billion and Exxon made $19.7 billion. Despite being an oil and gas state — which is supposed to mean jobs and prosperity according to fossil fuel corporations — Louisiana is the second poorest state in the United States with one of the highest racial wealth divides.

I can’t tell you in numbers the cost of a dying delta: It is invaluable and irreplaceable. I can tell you that since 1970 the oil and gas industry has raked in $52 trillion in profits or nearly $3 billion per day for the last 50 years.

The solution: It’s time for oil and gas to pay the costs. These companies owe reparations and need to forfeit their wealth.

It must be acknowledged that successful litigation and money gifts while necessary only slow or reframe the problem — they do not change the system that allowed the harm in the first place or guarantee protections from more legal extraction. Our impacted communities need financial reparations to recover from past abuse and brace for future loss and damages as we fight for systemic change. And we should treat those reparations as a means by which to end to the extractive industry once and for all. It’s too cheap for them to exploit us and even after major environmental victories they are set up to do it again.

We need true systemic change. We need Pachamama—inalienable rights of nature that safeguard our natural environments from living creatures to our water and air. And ultimately the government needs to give land back to Indigenous people so that Native communities like the Houma can protect their ancestral lands from companies that would plunder them for profit. Our future generations deserve to live on the lands of their elders and ancestors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG5ldC5jb20vbmV3cy9vbi10dWxhbGlwLXJlc2VydmF0aW9uLWdhcy1wcmljZXMtZmFsbC1iZWxvdy0zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On Tulalip Reservation gas prices fall below $3 | HeraldNet.com,"TULALIP — Gas prices at two stations on the Tulalip Reservation plummeted to $2.99 a gallon on Thursday thanks to a deal the tribes struck with a Yakama Nation-owned distributor.

The Tulalip Market gas station at 2832 116th St. NE in Tulalip just north of the tribes’ Quil Ceda Village shopping center was bustling Thursday afternoon. No pump was left unoccupied for more than a moment before another vehicle pulled up. An electronic sign on the street corner nearby advertised the switch to a new less-expensive fuel. The tribes’ other gas station at 3110 Marine Drive showed the same low prices.

The drastic price drop comes courtesy of the Tulalip Tribes’ recent switch from its previous Chevron distributor to Cougar Den a fuel distribution company owned by the Yakama Nation said Quil Ceda Village general manager Martin Napeahi.

Napeahi said that since fuel is being sold from one Indigenous tribe to another it’s not subject to state gas taxes. In 2019 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Yakama Nation Treaty of 1855 preempted a Washington state law claiming the ability to tax fuel bought by a tribal corporation for sale to tribal members. The result is that the tribes can pass on those savings to consumers Napeahi said.

“With the holiday season coming up and with us heading to a recession if not already in one we wanted to provide a bit of relief at the pump if we can” Napeahi said.

Tulalip’s prices were the lowest in the Everett area as of Friday according to price-tracking site GasBuddy. Typical rates hovered between $3.80 to $4.20 with the Everett Costco and an independent station on West Casino Road tied for the lowest in the city at $3.69 a gallon. The only serious competition seemed to be $2.70 gas in Anacortes if you’re willing to make the trek to Skagit County.

Gas prices on the Tulalip Reservation are already typically lower than other options in the area thanks to the tribes’ tax arrangement with the state. The tribes keep the state gas tax of 49 cents per gallon so they have more flexibility in their pricing. That tax revenue is earmarked for road maintenance and infrastructure Napeahi said.

Napeahi said one goal of the dramatic decrease in prices was to increase the volume of gas sold and bring in more tax funds for those services. Like everyone else tribal expenses have skyrocketed in the era of inflation he said. So tribal leaders hope to bring in some extra revenue while helping others save a few bucks too.

“Of course we want to be competitive but our intention here isn’t to start a price war” Napeahi said. “We want to help cut down on some of the stress of everyday living where we can.”

Ulster Town Police Chief Kyle S. Berardi said that around 6:30 a.m. an unknown male dressed in all-black clothing entered the fast-food Mexican eatery at 1217 Ulster Ave. approached an employee in the dining area and announced a robbery.

Berardi said a brief struggle ensued and other employees came out from the back of the restaurant and saw what was going on.

The man then pointed a gun at the employees exited the store and fled on foot on Ulster Avenue Berardi said. No money was taken during the course of the incident he said.

One of the employees who was not identified sustained minor injuries and was taken by Mobile Life Support Services ambulance to HealthAlliance Hospital in Kingston Berardi said.

Police described the suspect as being in his late 20s approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium complexion and long back hair.

Berardi said the attempted robbery remains under investigation and they’re asking anyone with any information about the incident to call Ulster Town Police (845) 382-1111.

Mainstream chains are adding more and more vegan options to their menus. Since everyone is posting their Spotify Wrapped we thought we’d share our “VegOut Rewind” covering the best vegan fast-food launches of 2022.

Chipotle Vegan Chorizo

The year kicked off with a new vegan protein at Chipotle. In addition to its Sofritas the vegan-friendly chain offered plant-based chorizo for a limited time. While the item has since left the menu we hope Chipotle brings it back for good.

Who else can’t get over the fact that Cold Stone Creamery now offers vegan ice cream? Yep that’s right! All scoop shops carry Silk’s Chocolate Almondmilk Frozen Dessert. So find your nearest store and indulge in a vegan ice cream masterpiece.

Panda Express Beyond Beef

After testing vegan orange chicken in 2021 Panda Express branched out to another meat alternative. Last January the fast-food chain debuted Beyond Beef at its test kitchen in Pasadena California. Although the protein option is no longer available we have a good feeling Panda Express will continue to innovate its vegan options.

Smashburger expanded its vegan portfolio this June with the launch of plant-based milkshakes. The sippable desserts came about in partnership with the vegan ice cream brand Eclipse Foods. At this time Smashburger offers vegan shakes in Vanilla Strawberry Chocolate and Oreo flavors. However the whipped cream is not vegan so be sure to order your shake without it.

Surprisingly Burger King has quite a few vegan options. Most recently they introduced their Impossible Original Chick’n Sandwich in Cincinnati Ohio this summer. Customers got to try the new vegan chicken patty on a toasted sesame bun with lettuce.

Shake Shack shook us all with this vegan milkshake and custard trial last May. At 10 locations across Florida and New York guests tested NotCo’s chocolate vegan custard. Available in scoops and milkshakes this dessert was a hit to say the least.

Hot dog chain Portillo’s launched its Plant-Based Garden Dog in June. It features a Field Roast Signature Stadium Dog and your desired toppings in a poppy seed bun. The best part? This item is still available nationwide!

Taco Bell Proprietary Vegan Meat Alternative

In August Taco Bell ran a limited trial of a plant-based proprietary meat in Birmingham Alabama. The beef-like product contains soy and pea protein with Taco Bell’s signature flavor. So it was a great substitute in popular items like crunchy tacos or burritos. Who knows maybe Doja Cat can help us vegans bring it to stores nationwide!

Panda Express Orange Chicken

Without a doubt the biggest vegan fast-food launch this year was Panda Express’ orange chicken. The restaurant tested this product in 2021 at select locations in New York and LA. But this September marked the nationwide debut of Beyond The Original Orange Chicken at all restaurants across the country.

We’ve seen a lot of great vegan-friendly strides from Taco Bell this year! In October Beyond Carne Asada Steak appeared on menus in Dayton Ohio. Best of all Taco Bell didn’t charge extra to sub the vegan steak for animal-based meat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3RvcGNsYXNzYWN0aW9ucy5jb20vbGF3c3VpdC1zZXR0bGVtZW50cy9jb25zdW1lci1wcm9kdWN0cy9yZWNhbGxzL2J5aGVhcnQtcmVjYWxsLWFubm91bmNlZC1mb3Itd2hvbGUtbnV0cml0aW9uLWluZmFudC1mb3JtdWxhLWR1ZS10by1wb3NzaWJsZS1iYWN0ZXJpYWwtY29udGFtaW5hdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ByHeart recall announced for Whole Nutrition Infant Formula due to possible bacterial contamination,"Top Class Actions’s website and social media posts use affiliate links.

Byheart infant formula recall overview:

Who: ByHeart has recalled some of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula.

Why: The product has the potential for cross-contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii.

Where: The ByHeart infant formula recall is active in the United States.

ByHeart has recalled five batches of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula due to the potential for cross-contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii.

The voluntary recall notice was published Dec. 11 on the U.S. Food & Drug Administration website and applies to ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula Milk Based Powder with Iron for 0-12 Months in 24-ounce containers.

The formula under recall can be identified by the number on the bottom of the can. Recalled product batches are 22273 C1 22276 C1 22277 C1 22278 C1 and 22280 C1 printed with use by 01 JAN 24 or 01 JUL 24.

The recall has been initiated out of an abundance of caution and none of the distributed ByHeart product has tested positive for the bacteria the company said. There have been no consumer complaints of illness to date ByHeart said.

Formula recalled after contamination at canning factory

ByHeart said the potential contamination happened at the final canning stage which is done by a “reputable third-party packager.”

“ByHeart is taking this precautionary measure because one test sample collected from the third-party packaging facility tested positive for Cronobacter sakazakii” it said.

ByHeart said all product packaged that day and the first production on the next day was isolated for destruction and not distributed.

“Out of an abundance of caution we are now recalling all product produced during the entire production run.”

Cronobacter bacteria can cause severe life-threatening infections or meningitis. If a baby has already consumed all of the formula there is no reason for concern and no additional action is needed the company said.

Customers should dispose of cans of the affected formula. The company said it will replace the missed formula by covering the cost of two cans of alternate formula. Additionally affected customers will receive two cans of their next order of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Formula for free it said.

In October Abbott recalled certain lots of ready-to-feed liquid products for infants and children sold under various brands including Similac and Pedialyte as some of the bottles may not be sealed properly.

Financial failure is so terrifying to consider that we occasionally trivialize the prospect — like the ever-lurking ""Bankrupt"" tiles on the titular ""Wheel of Fortune."" Real-life bankruptcy is no laughing matter of course — something the fast food industry knows all too well.

Since approximately 80% of all restaurants close within five years of opening (via CNBC) the threat of bankruptcy — and permanently shuttering — is an unfortunate ever-present one for fast food businesses. But while filing for bankruptcy is never a cause for celebration it's not an automatic death knell either. After all two types of bankruptcy are available to restaurants (via Total Food Service): Chapter 7 where a company's assets are sold to pay any outstanding debts and the business likely ends; and Chapter 11 which involves restructuring and reorganizing a company's debts allowing it to stay in business.

Now we don't explicitly enjoy highlighting a business' prior low points. But discussing fast food joints that utilized this legal safeguard can still be somewhat interesting — ghoulishly-speaking that is. So read on and learn about those unlucky fast food chains that at one time or another filed for bankruptcy."

Three weeks ago Cincinnati went on the road and limited Titans running back Derrick Henry to his second-fewest yards per carry (2.2) up to that point in the season.

Browns running back Nick Chubb would suffer a similar fate Sunday afternoon as he was limited to a near season-low 34 rushing yards (2.4 yards per carry) in the Bengals’ 23-10 win over Cleveland.

That’s a stark contrast to the last time the Bengals faced Chubb on Halloween night in Week 8. Chubb ran for 101 yards and two touchdowns as the Browns thumped Cincinnati 32-13. The Bengals’ defense had limited answers as they trailed 25-0 at one point in that loss.

But the Bengals found an answer five weeks later.

“I could go one-by-one and press those guys up front but that’s a great plan by (defensive coordinator) Lou (Anarumo) and all the defensive staff” Taylor said. “They gave us our best chance to win it and then the offense found a way to overcome that adversity and score some points. But it really started with our defense.”

Recommended Bengals stories

One could start going one-by-one by pointing at defensive tackle D.J. Reader. Reader was out for the first meeting between the two teams as he was still nursing a knee injury. He would make an impact against the Browns just as he did against Tennessee finishing the afternoon with five combined tackles a quarterback hit and yet another pass deflection.

Chubb who was the league’s second-leading rusher entering Week 14 had multiple attempts to get past Reader in open space. Reader didn’t just practice anticipating those moments in practice this week. He also maximized his preparation during his downtime.

“It’s like when I wrestle with my son. I know he’s gonna try me every time. I gotta throw him to the ground every time. So I know when it’s coming. And you know when it finally comes I get excited” Reader joked after the game. “When he’s (Chubb) clear and I’m clear if he thinks he’s running over me that’s not happening.”

Chubb entered Sunday’s game with the sixth best DVOA (Defensive-adjusted Value Over Average) among running backs this season (16.8%). That means the Browns are 16.8% better than average when Chubb touches the ball. Aside from a 13-yard run that gave the Browns a first down early in the game Chubb couldn’t produce any other first downs due in part to a defensive line anchored by Reader.

“He’s one of the best defensive tackles in the league and for some reason not really anybody knows about him. It’s time people start knowing about him” Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow said in his postgame press conference.

All of the praise shouldn’t be reserved for Reader though. Reader’s fellow tackle B.J. Hill made three big tackles as he helped Reader contain Chubb and Kareem Hunt who only had six rushing yards on four carries. Chubb ran for just six total yards in the second half alone.

“It’s a collective effort. Guys on the inside B.J (Hill) doing an unreal job back in and rallying to the ball Logan (Wilson) and Jermaine (Pratt) coming down hill really it’s just a collective effort” Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard told cleveland.com after the game. “There’s no other way to beat that team with their attack.”

The tackling of linebackers like Germaine Pratt and Logan Wilson is part of the missing ingredient that kept the Bengals from stopping Chubb back in October. Wilson had a season-high and game-high 17 combined tackles while Pratt added five total tackles two of them for loss. The presence of Reader in contrast to Week 8 allowed Wilson and Pratt to find holes and create less distance near the line of scrimmage for Chubb to run.

“I don’t even know how most of those tackles happened. I was just in the right place at the right time” Wilson said.

Part of the challenge for the Bengals coming out of the bye week was being able to stop players like Henry and Chubb. Those are boxes than be confidently checked off. ‘Complimentary football’ is a cliche term but the way the defensive line has disrupted elite backs like those two allows for the linebacker duo of Pratt and Wilson to play at the high-caliber level they’ve played at most of this season.

Wilson added that players “need to start peaking at the end of the season.” That’s been the trajectory the Bengals’ defense has been on. Stopping Henry was just the start. Limiting Chubb is more than an example of how Reader says the Bengals exemplified those efforts.

“I think guys just take pride in it and that’s what it is the pride and physical thing. And we pride ourselves on being a physical team that’s going to answer the bell every time” Reader said.

The network which includes the Catholic Theological Society of America and similar groups around the world promotes collaborative research projects by theologians from different cultures and encourages dialogue with scholars from other churches other religions and various scientific disciplines.

In his prepared text Francis told members of the group that theology is ""a significant and necessary ecclesial ministry"" because ""it is part of our Catholic faith to explain the reason for our hope to all those who ask.""

Construction is nearing completion on the St. Charbel Maronite Church in Doha Qatar with plans to open its doors to worshippers in 2025 coinciding with the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year according to Father Charbel Mhanna from Qatar’s Maronite parish.

In an interview with ACI Mena CNA’s Arabic-language news partner Mhanna explained that with a capacity of about 3000 people St. Charbel will be the country’s largest church open to all Catholics. Once completed it will be Qatar’s second Catholic church joining the existing Church of Our Lady of the Rosary.

While precise statistics on the Christian population in Qatar are lacking Mhanna estimates there are close to 1 million Christians there of which about 70% are Catholic. Approximately 12000 belong to the Maronite rite which is in full communion with the pope.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvZmlyc3QtcGFyaXNoLWNodXJjaC1kb29tLXBhaW50aW5nLWluLTUwMC15ZWFycy11bnZlaWxlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First parish church Doom painting in 500 years unveiled,"The painting depicts the righteous climbing from their graves to eternal life and the unrighteous – including a clergyman and king – departing to their eternal punishment.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Mr Lawes said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

‘Desire to bring the painting to life’

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

What started as an innocent childhood adventure led to a discovery that would take nearly six decades to reveal its true significance.

Childhood Games Historic Finds

It was a different time when Jan and his brother crawling through the spaces dug by Nazi soldiers during World War II to store ammunition stumbled upon what they thought were just cool trinkets to enhance their playtime. Among these were 14 silver coins an amber bead and nine needles all found in a setting that couldn’t be further from a typical playground.

Little did they know their ‘playthings’ were genuine artifacts. The coins safely tucked away in a small yellow Kodak slide box were forgotten as the brothers grew up only to be rediscovered by Jan in November 2023 nearly 60 years later. This prompted him to report the find to the local authorities in Møre og Romsdal County.

A Treasure Dating Back to the Middle Ages

The coins weren’t just old; they were ancient. Preliminary analysis by archaeologists suggested these pieces dated back to the Middle Ages. “We were just kids doing a treasure hunt under the church not realizing how rare these coins were” Jan shared. This sentiment echoed a childlike wonder akin to a poignant scene from the film Amélie where childhood treasures hold emotional value only in Jan’s case these items held substantial archaeological value as well.

Carl-Fredrik Wahr-Hansen Vemmestad the county archaeologist identified that some coins might date back to around 1280 during the reign of King Marcus VI of Norway. Others could be a bit more recent from the time of King Christian I who ruled from 1450 to 1481. “Such finds are extremely rare as there are literally only a handful of these coins that have survived to this day in central Norway” explained Vemmestad.

More Than Just Coins

The seemingly mundane items found alongside the coins also turned out to be historically significant. The needles were dated to the 13th century likely part of a garment belonging to a deceased individual while the amber bead might have come from a prayer crown used by priests and deacons.

Following the guidelines of Norway’s archaeological preservation policy which states that all artifacts found that were made before 1605 are considered state property unless owned privately before 1905 Jan handed over his childhood treasures to the local authorities. These artifacts are now slated for preservation and may even be displayed to the public.

In a twist fit for the movies what Jan and his brother saw as simple elements of childhood games turned out to be treasures of a nation preserving a slice of history beneath the floorboards of a quiet church. This story not only highlights the unexpected corners where history can lurk but also reminds us of the pure joy of discovery a feeling that doesn’t fade even after 60 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzExL2EtZGVhcnRoLW9mLXByaWVzdHMtc3VnZ2VzdHMtdGhlLWNhdGhvbGljLWNodXJjaC1zaG91bGQtd2lkZW4tcmVjcnVpdG1lbnTSAYcBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2NvbW1lbnRpc2ZyZWUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8xMS9hLWRlYXJ0aC1vZi1wcmllc3RzLXN1Z2dlc3RzLXRoZS1jYXRob2xpYy1jaHVyY2gtc2hvdWxkLXdpZGVuLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A dearth of priests suggests the Catholic church should widen recruitment,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzExL2EtZGVhcnRoLW9mLXByaWVzdHMtc3VnZ2VzdHMtdGhlLWNhdGhvbGljLWNodXJjaC1zaG91bGQtd2lkZW4tcmVjcnVpdG1lbnTSAYcBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2NvbW1lbnRpc2ZyZWUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8xMS9hLWRlYXJ0aC1vZi1wcmllc3RzLXN1Z2dlc3RzLXRoZS1jYXRob2xpYy1jaHVyY2gtc2hvdWxkLXdpZGVuLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E823130>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Why You Need Dental Insurance

No matter your age preventative dental care is critical to keeping both your body and your mouth healthy. Poor oral hygiene can contribute to a variety of chronic conditions including diabetes and heart disease. Through dental insurance preventative care is covered with no waiting period so you can see a dentist and get the benefits of these services right away.

Dental insurance also covers a portion of more expensive procedures that you may need down the road such as implants bridges and crowns. Putting off these types of treatments will only lead to bigger more costly problems while also damaging your overall health.

According to the American Dental Associate the dental spending per capita in 2020 was $430. A good dental insurance plan can help offset those costs.

Pria kelahiran 1984 itu dirumorkan menyimpan kisah romantis terhadap sejumlah wanita sebelum akhirnya menikah dengan istrinya Ri Sol Ju.

Kim setidaknya disebut punya hubungan dengan dua perempuan lain. Diberitakan Telegraph wanita pertama yang dirumorkan sempat berhubungan dengan Kim yakni Seo Un Hyang.

Sumber di Korea Utara mengatakan kepada surat kabar Chosun Ilbo Korea Selatan bahwa Seo pernah belajar musik di sebuah universitas dan pernah membintangi sejumlah film propaganda.

Dia digambarkan sebagai sosok penyanyi yang ""baik dan memiliki kepribadian yang ramah"" menurut sumber tersebut.

""Ada desas-desus bahwa Kim Jong Un jatuh cinta pada fitur Baratnya"" kata sumber itu.

Selain dengan Seo Kim juga dirumorkan memiliki hubungan asmara dengan Hyon Song Wol seorang pentolan girl group Moranbong Band dari Korea Utara.

Grup itu sejak dulu dikenal sebagai favorit Kim. Bahkan Kim sendiri yang membentuk Moranbong Band pada Juli 2012 silam.

Rumor hubungan Kim dengan Hyon ini pun sempat mencapai puncaknya ketika Hyon menggantikan tugas adik Kim Jong Un Kim Yo Jong untuk mengantar sejumlah pejabat ke tempat duduk mereka saat parade militer 10 Oktober 2020.

Padahal pada 2013 Hyon sempat dikabarkan ditembak mati karena dugaan video porno.

Namun kabar itu ditepis pada 2014 setelah Hyon tampil memberikan pidato di rapat umum pekerja kreatif.

Baik Hyon maupun Kim hingga kini pun masih disebut bertemu secara diam-diam seperti diberitakan New Zealand Herald.

Kendati digosipkan terlibat hubungan asmara dengan Seo dan Hyon Kim justru memilih untuk menikah dengan Ri Sol Ju.

Pernikahan itu dihelat pada 2009. Namun kemunculan Ri di hadapan publik baru dimulai pada 2011. Saat itu merupakan hari pemakaman Kim Jong Il.

Perjalanan cinta Kaesang Pangarep kerap menjadi perbincangan hangat di internet termasuk kisah cintanya dengan Erina Gudono. Lika-liku kisah cinta Kaesang jelas gak mudah hingga akhirnya bertemu dengan Erina Gudono yang berhasil menjadi pelabuhan terakhirnya.

Banyak perjuangan yang harus dilakukan oleh Kaesang dan juga Erina. Untuk itu inilah deretan pelajaran cinta yang bisa dipetik dari perjalanan Kaesang dan Erina!

1. Cinta selalu tahu ke mana dia harus pulang Kaesang Pangarep dan Erina Gudono (instagram.com/erinagudono) Sebelum berlabuh ke Erina Gudono diketahui bahwa Kaesang sudah pernah menjalin kisah cinta dengan beberapa perempuan. Namun ternyata kisah cintanya itu harus kandas. Setelah bertahun-tahun mencari 'tempat pulang' akhirnya Kaesang bertemu dengan Erina dan memutuskan untuk menikahinya. Dari perjalanan cinta Kaesang dapat diketahui bahwa jodoh memang gak langsung bertemu. Mungkin kamu harus melewati perjalanan yang panjang seperti Kaesang. Namun pada akhirnya kamu akan kembali pulang kepada seseorang yang menjadi 'rumah' untukmu. Sama halnya seperti Kaesang sepanjang apa pun perjalanan cintanya akhirnya hanya Erina yang menjadi pelabuhan terakhirnya. Sejauh dan selama apa pun kita bertualang pada akhirnya hanya akan berlabuh di dermaga yang memang ditakdirkan untuk kita.

2. Kisah cinta gak selalu berjalan mulus namun bukan berarti kamu harus menyerah Kaesang Pangarep dan Erina Gudono (instagram.com/kaesangp) Meskipun kamu sudah menemukan orang yang tepat namun bukan berarti kisah cinta akan berjalan dengan mulus karena pasti akan ada konflik atau perdebatan kecil di dalamnya. Walau begitu bukan berarti kamu harus menyerah. Sebaliknya tetaplah perjuangkan segala hal yang memang patut diperjuangkan. Menemukan sosok yang tepat memang bukan hal yang mudah karena akan banyak ujian yang diberikan oleh Tuhan. Sama seperti kisah cinta Kaesang dan Erina yang perjalanannya gak mudah dan cenderung rumit. ""Kelak kau akan bertemu dengan pria yang kau cintai dan dia juga mencintaimu. Jalan kalian gak akan mudah rumit diuji dengan ego dan waktu"" tulis Erina Gudono di salah satu unggahan di laman Instagram-nya. Kesulitan dan konflik bagi pasangan yang saling mencintai tentunya datang dari Tuhan sebagai ujian. Sehingga kedua belah pihak akan sama-sama berjuang untuk mempertahankan hubungan yang telah dibentuk. Dengan begitu kedua belah pihak gak akan berpikir untuk berpisah karena perjalanannya pun gak mudah.

The networking equipment major said it's working on a patch to address the vulnerability which is tracked as CVE-2022-20968 (CVSS score: 8.1) and stems from a case of insufficient input validation of received Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packets.

CDP is a proprietary network-independent protocol that is used for collecting information related to nearby directly connected devices such as hardware software and device name among others. It's enabled by default.

""An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol traffic to an affected device"" the company said in an alert published on December 8 2022.

""A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow resulting in possible remote code execution or a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.""

Cisco IP phones running firmware version 14.2 and earlier are impacted. A patch is scheduled for release in January 2023 with the company stating that there are no updates or workarounds to remediate the issue.

However on deployments that support both CDP and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for neighbor discovery users can opt to disable CDP so that the affected devices switch to LLDP for advertising their identity and capabilities to directly connected peers in a local area network (LAN).

""This is not a trivial change and will require diligence on behalf of the enterprise to evaluate any potential impact to devices as well as the best approach to deploy this change in their enterprise"" the company said.

It further cautioned that it's aware of the availability of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit and that the shortcoming has been publicly disclosed. There's no evidence that the vulnerability has been actively abused in the wild to date.

Qian Chen from the Codesafe Team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group has been credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzEwL3BhbG8tYWx0by1uZXR3b3Jrcy1iZWNhbWUtZ29sZC1zdGFuZGFyZC1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXN0YXktdG9wL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Palo Alto Networks became the gold standard of cybersecurity - and what it has to do to stay on top,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='siliconangle.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/12/10/palo-alto-networks-became-gold-standard-cybersecurity-stay-top/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E894B20>, 'Connection to siliconangle.com timed out.

You must love the economic model at some of Rhode Island's top hospitals — fail and get a massive multi-million dollar salary and a bonus.

In 2020 at the height of the pandemic Lifespan CEO Timothy Babineau announced that he would not take a salary due to the hospital’s poor financial situation.

Well that was not true.

Not only did Babineau take his full salary but the company’s annual financials also show Babineau grabbed nearly $4 million as first reported by WPRI. That number included a significant bonus — $768000.

Ironically unions voiced outrage in 2011 because Babineau received compensation of more than $1.1 million. Now a decade later Babineau's compensation increased more than 250%.

Babineau and the board of Lifespan have had a less-than-spectacular performance in recent years.

Lifespan is recording mammoth financial losses. The hospital group has had multiple failed mergers. The most ridiculous was its anti-competitive effort to merge with Care New England — the state's second-largest hospital group. It was a proposed merger that was flawed from the beginning and was blasted by both the Federal Trade Commission and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha.

And the staff departures are at a record pace. For those employees working the front line through COVID RSV the flu and the “normal” healthcare challenges they will be further horrified to learn of the administration’s greed.

Care New England’s outgoing Dr. James Fanale also grabbed millions — $1.8 million. That hospital group has been a financial basket case for a decade and has had over a half-dozen failed mergers. Fanale received a 15% increase over the prior year.

Fanale has failed to properly fund the employees' pension fund and basic maintenance spending is far below industry standards.

And remember these bonus-driven salaries were for 2020.

Both Fanale and Babineau left their CEO posts in 2022 so it will be two years before we actually learn what these two grabbed going out the door.

While Neronha has been aggressive in regulating the for-profit hospital group CharterCARE he has been less than aggressive in reviewing Lifespan and Care New England. (Neronha’s wife is an employee of Lifespan according to the Attorney General’s Ethics Commission Financial Disclosure Statement).

Before the General Assembly considers any further special appropriations legislative leaders should demand the public disclose corporate compensation for 2021 2022 and what is budgeted for 2023.

These hospital groups are dripping with self-dealing and greed. It is time to turn on the light.

Your employment is contingent upon you moving and your employer refuses to discuss it with you.

Or imagine developing an innovative plan for more flexible at-home work options that will reduce your company’s carbon emissions and save your employer money. Your manager instead of praising your efforts admonishes you and tells you to focus on your core work — not to “rock the boat.”

Workers around the world face dilemmas like these on a regular basis. At their core they touch on the notion of worker voice: workers’ capacities and opportunities to speak up and effect change at work.

In light of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic recent labour disputes concerns about worker shortages and racism and inequality a growing chorus of people are asking: how can all workers have the opportunity to meaningfully influence workplace decisions and have their voices heard?

Worker voice

Worker voice doesn’t just empower workers. It also has wide-ranging benefits for employers and broader society as well. It can help protect workers’ interests improve workplace performance and contribute to societal democratization.

Unfortunately unless Canadian workers are covered by a collective agreement opportunities to shape decisions at work are largely at the whim of their employer. This leads to situations in which some workers have ample opportunities to speak up at work while others — often those more marginalized — have almost none.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Lars Hagberg

Even our most robust channels like collective bargaining and grievance procedures have been criticized by some as being too adversarial or not protective enough of individual rights and interests of their diverse membership.

Clearly our practices and systems need an upgrade. The question is: what kind of upgrade would best serve workers and our economy as a whole?

Building a democratic assembly

To tackle this issue we gathered a group of 32 Ontarians to serve in the Ontario Assembly on Workplace Democracy (OAWD). This was a first-of-its-kind effort that used a democratic innovation known as a “citizens’ assembly.”

The process involved selecting individuals through a democratic lottery which generated a group of participants representative of the diversity of the province in their union status sector gender income level and age. They were far from the usual suspects typically involved in policy discussions about this topic.

Over five intensive working sessions spanning the summer and fall of 2022 OAWD members re-imagined how workers shape organizational decision-making in Ontario.

They had frank conversations with each other about their experiences speaking up at work developed principles that should underpin any robust system of worker voice and brainstormed recommendations for employers unions and governments to improve worker voice. These discussions were aided by a dedicated team of facilitators and a diverse group of expert and stakeholder witnesses.

Barriers to worker voice

A final report compiling the participants’ main conclusions has just been published through the University of Toronto’s Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources which sponsored the project.

Insights from the final report have much to offer to workers managers labour advocates and policymakers. First they pointed to numerous challenges and barriers people face when speaking up at work that need to be addressed.

Some of these barriers included fearing retaliation and negative repercussions from employers and a lack of structured opportunities for having their voices heard at work. Participants also highlighted that many people lacked basic information and knowledge about worker voice government protections under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and their right to unionize.

Participants also highlighted how traditionally marginalized groups of workers like migrant workers or those with disabilities face systematic barriers to voice especially when they brought up concerns about discrimination at work.

Report recommendations

After identifying these barriers assembly participants produced a set of 14 comprehensive recommendations for improving worker voice. These recommendations were grounded in a common set of values including the financial success and sustainability of the participants’ employers a greater balance of power between workers and their employers and accountability.

Managers labour advocates and policymakers interested in worker voice can get started on five of these recommendations right now. Firstly all of these groups can — and should — do a better job of educating workers about their rights and responsibilities when it comes to voicing ideas and concerns at work.

Secondly employers can implement best practices to encourage worker voice at work through things like worker councils and self-managed teams. Thirdly employers should also ensure workers are both incentivized and protected to use these tools and resources. Fourthly employers should measure their progress toward improving worker voice and benchmark it against their competitors.

And lastly labour unions can open themselves up to more involvement from their diverse membership and provide greater transparency about their finances and decision-making processes.

Worker perspectives are critical

While worker voice is important it often flies under our collective radar. To date much of the void has been filled by academics think tanks and organizations like chambers of commerce and labour unions. But the perspective of everyday people is just as important.

The OAWD put a spotlight on how everyday people experience work and what they want done to make work better and their voices heard. Participants embraced their responsibility and worked hard to deliver on the assembly’s mandate.

To improve the ability of workers to have a say in workplace decision-making these recommendations should be read and considered widely by policymakers politicians the media and the broader public. It is up to these leaders to listen to workers and take the necessary steps to create fairer safer more inclusive and sustainable workplaces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vNmFiYy5jb20vYXJteW5hdnktZ2FtZS1hcm15LWZvb3RiYWxsLW5hdnktY29sbGVnZS8xMjU1MDU0NC_SAUdodHRwczovLzZhYmMuY29tL2FtcC9hcm15bmF2eS1nYW1lLWFybXktZm9vdGJhbGwtbmF2eS1jb2xsZWdlLzEyNTUwNTQ0Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Army-Navy weekend gets underway in Philadelphia with big game at Lincoln Financial Field,"The game day festivities kick-off on Saturday at 11 a.m.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- It's a big weekend for the United States Armed Forces.

The Army-Navy game is happening at Lincoln Financial Field this weekend when our nation's finest will battle it out on the football field.

But before the two teams clashed on the gridiron the cadets and midshipmen met in the Patriot Games.

The first event was on Friday morning - something of a ""Rocky"" relay event on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

It was a timed challenge for Army and Navy.

Both men and women had to do 30 pushups jump rope 75 times and then carry 40-pound kettlebells up and down the steps.

""I'm pretty confident in our team"" said Caitlin Johnson of the Army. ""They've been training really hard they're really driven individuals. I think they'll excel.""

That confidence came through for Army who won the relay event.

But Navy muscled through the pullup challenge beating Army in a tiebreaker that received a roar from spectators who crowded the shops at Liberty Place.

""We've been very blessed by Philadelphia"" said Josh Temeles of the Navy.

Army didn't give up the fight. An intense game of tug of war brought the Black Knights right back in the lead. It was a strong finish on Navy turf at the Battleship New Jersey in Camden.

Some 50000 people are projected to flock to Philadelphia this weekend to watch the game.

""We were at the game last year in New York or New Jersey. First time in Philadelphia it's been fantastic"" said Bob Dalton who was visiting from Phoenix Arizona. ""The atmosphere is great. Philadelphia has been really really good to us.""

PHL sports projects this Army-Navy weekend will generate about $30 million in economic impact for the city.

""Ninety of the last 123 games have been hosted by Philadelphia. We know how to host the Army Navy game. We know what we're doing we know how to show them a good time and we're really looking forward to this weekend"" said Executive Director of Greater Philadelphia Hotel Association Ed Grose. ""Normally this weekend in December is very quiet. It's just another great event that's good for us as we come off the pandemic.""

The game day festivities kick-off on Saturday starting at 11 a.m.

The Exclusive Fan Tailgate starts at 11 a.m. Saturday and goes until 1 p.m. It's being held inside Citizens Bank Park's Hall of Fame Club.

Also at 11 a.m. the Army-Navy Fan Fest will take place inside Lincoln Financial Field's HeadHouse Plaza. Fans can enjoy live music games face painting and giveaways before the start of the game.

The time-honored tradition ""march-on"" to the field kicks-off at 12:15 p.m.

And finally the Stadium Obstacle Relay will take place at 1:15 p.m.

The game officially kick's off at 3:10 p.m.

SEPTA announced that they will be adding extra service for Army-Navy Game.

In a press release they wrote ""SEPTA will accommodate passengers traveling to the game with a total of 10 sports express

trains on the Broad Street Line to NRG Station. The Sports Express trips will run every 10

minutes departing Fern Rock Station beginning at 9:05 a.m. until 12:20 p.m. stopping at Olney;

Park Ji-young wins opening match of 2023 KLPGA season

Park Ji-young won the opening match of the 2023 KLPGA season the Singapore Women's Open on Sunday after playing just 36 holes as the match was shortened to two rounds due to inclement weather.After carding a 11-under-par 133 Park was set to head into the third and final round on Sunday when the event was canceled due to rain and lightning.Only the first seven groups were able to tee off on the Tampines Course on Sunday after the tournament was halted at 8: 15 a.m. The decision to cancel the final round was made after about three hours at 11: 30 a.m. and Park was named the winner.The KLPGA Tour regulations dictate that matches where players complete 36 holes can be considered as official competitions and the full purse can be given out.""I didn't think that I would win this way"" said Park on Sunday. ""I am very happy to start my new season with a win. I am happy that I was lucky enough to win the title and will think of it as a gift that encourages me to play better golf.""This win marks Park's fifth career title ever. Her last victory was at the Mediheal Hankookilbo Championship in April when she carded a 270 to win her sole title of the 2022 season.Park has had a good 2022 season making the cut in all but two matches and finishing in the top 10 in seven matches.""Playing the 2022 season I felt the need to improve my short game"" said Park. ""I am going to try and do that over the winter and improve my shots overall.""KLPGA golfers Park Hyun-kyung Hong Jung-min and Lee So-young finished tied for second one stroke behind Park Ji-young with a total score of 10-under 134.Thai LPGA golfer Atthaya Thitikul who tried her hand at her very first KLPGA tournament finished tied for ninth with a total score of seven-under 137.The top-10 finish is a good start for the 2022 LPGA Rookie of the Year.Thitikul headed to the Singapore Women's Open after a successful 2022 season when she reached world No. 1 for the first time in her career. At age 19 Thithikul became the second-youngest female golfer to reach the top spot. New Zealander Lydia Ko who became No. 1 at 17-years-old is the youngest.Thitikul was able to stay at the top for two weeks before Nelly Korda of the United States passed her on Nov. 14. Korda is now No. 2 and Ko took No. 1 after winning the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship.KLPGA favorite Park Min-ji tied with Thitikul for ninth also setting herself up for another great season. For Park Min-ji the Singapore Open may have been a chance to test out her skills abroad as she had said that she has her sights set on playing on a bigger stage possibly meaning that she is considering playing in the LPGA Tour.Over the last two years Park Min-ji dominated the KLPGA Tour playing 47 events and winning 12 titles. She has won one title in every four tournaments and is now No. 14 in the world rankings. She is the fourth-highest ranked Korean following LPGA golfers No. 5 Ko Jin-young No. 7 Chun In-gee and No. 9 Kim Hyo-joo.After winning the 2021 KLPGA Player of the Year award Park finished her 2022 season with a bang winning the last tournament the SK Shieldus-SK Telecom Championship 2022 and topping the KLPGA money standings.The KLPGA Tour continues next week with the PLK Pacificlinks Championship with SBS Golf at the Twin Doves Golf Club in Vietnam with 96 golfers vying for the top prize.BY YUN SO-HYANG [yun.sohyang@joongang.co.kr]",,,,,,

KOLKATA: A low-cost energy-efficient technology developed by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre that can burn any waste - municipal hazardous and even nuclear - to produce gases that can then be used to generate electricity was transferred to a Kolkata-based firm that will now develop commercial grade incinerators that can each process 100 tonne waste per day.Like gas cutters used to slice metals the technology uses air plasma torch generating high energy particles that bombard the waste breaking them down into an ionised state leaving behind some dust and synthesized gas - carbon monoxide and nitrogen - that can then be used to produce energy.Scientists said 1kg of municipal solid waste can yield 0.6-7 kWh of electricity. Any waste that contains hydrocarbons can lead to energy production including plastic waste and e-waste.While burning plastic below 850°C leads to release of dioxin and furans that are very toxic and carcinogenic when burnt at higher temperature it breaks the bonds leaving behind only a small amount of neutralised ash and the synthesized gas. In this process 9kg of waste generates only 27 gm of ash.""What is required is to set up a chamber with plasma torches at the bottom. These torches take air and convert them into plasma jets or beams that can produce a high temperature of over 5000°C or higher than the surface temperature of the sun. We need temperatures of just over 1300°C-1800°C to break all the inorganic bonds inside the waste material"" said Srikumar Ghorui head of Thermal Plasma Technologies Section at BARC Trombay.Ghorui is the developer of the air plasma gasifier technology that can transform the way waste is treated including toxic waste and plastic that are environmentally damaging.While American firm Westinghouse has also developed a 250 kWh plasma torch that produces jet length of 15cm and temperature of 5000 kelvin the plasma torch developed at BARC costs around Rs 1.5 lakh uses 35 kWh power produces jet length of 60 cm and can reach a temperature of over 10000 kelvin.""The torch developed by BARC uses lower power to achieve higher efficiency at a better economy and saves fossil fuel "" said Amar Banerjee head of tech transfer and collaboration in BARC.The system by BARC can dispose up to 3.5 tonne per day. Shyama Prasad Manna director of Kolkata-based company Positoronics India to which the technology was transferred said they would attempt to produce incinerators that could each process 100 tonne of waste per day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9CYXRlbGNvd2luc3ByZXN0aWdpb3VzR2xvdGVsQXdhcmQuYXNweD9jbXM9cThGbUZKZ2lzY0wyZndJek9OMSUyQkRzS3JoWTRNSW01Uk04VU5NU284TkRRJTNE0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Batelco wins prestigious Glotel Award,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bna.bh', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/BatelcowinsprestigiousGlotelAward.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDsKrhY4MIm5RM8UNMSo8NDQ%3D (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00DE1B550>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9CYXRlbGNvd2luc3ByZXN0aWdpb3VzR2xvdGVsQXdhcmQuYXNweD9jbXM9cThGbUZKZ2lzY0wyZndJek9OMSUyQkRzS3JoWTRNSW01Uk04VU5NU284TkRRJTNE0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL3Bvd2VyLWRlZmljaXQtaW4tbm92ZW1iZXItZmFsbHMtdG8tMC0yLXBlci1jZW50LWZyb20tMi1wZXItY2VudC1pbi1hcHJpbC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjE0NTc4OC5jbXPSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9wb3dlci9wb3dlci1kZWZpY2l0LWluLW5vdmVtYmVyLWZhbGxzLXRvLTAtMi1wZXItY2VudC1mcm9tLTItcGVyLWNlbnQtaW4tYXByaWwvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MTQ1Nzg4LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power deficit in November falls to 0.2 per cent from 2 per cent in April,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL3Bvd2VyLWRlZmljaXQtaW4tbm92ZW1iZXItZmFsbHMtdG8tMC0yLXBlci1jZW50LWZyb20tMi1wZXItY2VudC1pbi1hcHJpbC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjE0NTc4OC5jbXPSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9wb3dlci9wb3dlci1kZWZpY2l0LWluLW5vdmVtYmVyLWZhbGxzLXRvLTAtMi1wZXItY2VudC1mcm9tLTItcGVyLWNlbnQtaW4tYXByaWwvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MTQ1Nzg4LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00DE1AEF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

A 25-year Tale of Two Cities,"Is Coke Or Pepsi More Popular? A 25-year Tale of Two Cities

Coca-Cola and Pepsi are two of the largest brand names in the beverage industry comprising over 70% of the United States carbonated beverage market by combined volume share (see figure 1). Established in 1898 by pharmacist Caleb Bradham the young Pepsi grew in the wake of Atlanta’s Coca-Cola a primary competitor having been established twelve years prior by John Pemberton. Originally taking advantage of an economy in depression Pepsi prided itself in selling large quantities of product for a reasonable price through the 1930s creating demand around a product similar to Coca-Cola that appealed to a larger customer base because of its relatively low cost.

Moreover the two brands remained confined in the industry of carbonated beverages through the 1950s with Pepsi eventually taking steps to introduce the first nationally-distributed diet soda in 1964 Diet Pepsi and Coca-Cola following with its own in 1984. Both firms demonstrated the ability to expand in respect to their products as each company added different carbonated beverages to their repertoire through the 1980s; however a decision made by PepsiCo in the late 1990s to further diversify their product line exists as an important point of focus in this examination as it can likely be attributed to a large part of their present-day success.

In 1997 the firm took steps outside of the realm of carbonated beverages and launched Aquafina a product that would quickly become America’s top-selling bottled water brand; the underdog was able to take a risky step in expanding their brand name a key part in their success over the past few decades. Pepsi’s zeal for expansion and product diversity has given the company extensive opportunities for growth and has proven to be a successful business model in the past twenty-five years allowing the firm to steadily inch closer to the success of the ever-mighty Coca-Cola.

Since the 1990s PepsiCo not only demonstrated an expertise in expanding their brand name. But also found great success in their efforts to acquire and merge with various firms in which they saw potential. Following the 1961 merger of Fritos and Lays two popular potato chip brands that conjoined in the creation of Frito-Lay Inc. Pepsi was able to follow suit in one of their most successful expansive decisions to date a merger with Frito-Lay that would officially give the firm the name PepsiCo; selling two complimentary products a salty snack and a refreshing beverage the two companies saw mutual potential potential that has since turned into immense success for PepsiCo.

In 2021 for example 46% of the firm’s operating profits were derived from their snack and food-related products the vast majority of which stem from the Frito-Lay merger; while this is clear evidence of the success that has followed Pepsi’s efforts to expand and diversify their product line it is also information that lies in stark contrast to the 90% of annual profits that Coca-Cola generates solely from their carbonated beverages.

PepsiCo’s past mergers and acquisitions such as the aforementioned merger with Frito Lay and their 2001 acquisition of The Quaker Oats Company have proven to be pivotal in the firm’s success.

Furthermore Pepsi’s various joint ventures accounted for over 40% of their total sales in 2021. So if PepsiCo has seen such great success with their expansive business model with their diverse mergers and acquisitions generating a large portion of the firm’s annual profits why has Coca-Cola not taken the same route?

It is undeniable that Coca-Cola has been able to expand their brand name in the realm of beverages having worked with firms like Walt Disney and Nestlé S.A. to market unique products that differ from their carbonated staples.

With their acquisition of Costa Coffee in 2018 Coca-Cola even gained ownership of the largest coffee company in the United Kingdom.

However a trend seems to arise when looking at the Coca-Cola’s expansion.

Unlike PepsiCo Coca-Cola made minimal progress in expanding outside of the beverage industry.

For instance little success followed their 1982 acquisition of Columbia Pictures. An example of a poor use of capital. With their ownership of the film studio lasting a mere seven years before Sony purchased it. It is possible that Coca-Cola has applied their “think local act local” strategy–an ambitious effort to restructure the firm proposed in 2000 by former Chairman Douglas Daft–to their product line as they have remained quite “local” or confined in respect to their staple products.

In conclusion whether or not this correlation applies to the firm and its business model evidence shows that over the last twenty-five years PepsiCo has kept a greater emphasis on branching out looking to market a wider range of products with a wider range of partners; this practice present within the firm since the late 1900s has and likely will continue to give them an upper hand on the ever-mighty Coca-Cola.

You know the one: a convoy of brightly lit big red lorries lots of sleigh bells much festive cheer and that catchy ‘holidays are coming’ music.

Thing is the Coca-Cola Christmas Trucks are beginning to show their age. The advert has been around since 1995 and the vehicles in it look like American big rigs which great big thundering engines. But we have good news: Coca-Cola trucks have been given an electric makeover. Well sort of.

E-mobility news is coming to your inbox with our FREE newsletter

To be precise: Coca-Cola’s Belgian distribution arm has put 30 Renault E-Tech electric trucks to work for last-mile deliveries. The first five are already in operation in Antwerp.

But the deal could lead to more: it’s part of a partnership between Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) and Renault Trucks. CCEP is one of the world's largest Coca-Cola bottling companies with operations across Europe Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.

The firm has committed to becoming carbon-neutral by 2040 and the 30 electric trucks will mean that a fifth of its fleet in Belgium will now be zero-emission machines – making it the latest electric truck fleet in the country.

The trucks will be a mix of Renault Trucks’s E-Tech D and D Wide machines and will be run from distribution centres in Antwerp Ghent and Chaudfontaine. CCEP says that its Belgian trucks average just over 90 miles a day so they’ve chosen a configuration of truck with a 125-mile range.

Each truck will be charged overnight at its distribution centre using what CCEP calls “100 per cent green energy” generated on site.

The two firms are in talks to expand the partnership further in future years. So while for the moment we’ll enjoy the classic Coca-Cola Christmas trucks advert on the telly and dream of a time when they’ll be a shiny new fully electric version.

As per the company’s regulatory filing sourced from business intelligence platform Tofler the company garnered a total income (standalone) of ₹9147.74 crore in FY 22 up 30.6 per cent over FY 21. The company said it has been substantially investing to ramp up manufacturing capacity for 2023 and beyond.

Volume revenue growth

Responding to a businessline’s queries Melvin Tan Chief Financial Officer Hindustan Coca–Cola Beverages (HCCB) Pvt Ltd said the increase in profits after tax was on account of robust volume and revenue growth. “HCCB has been able to build positive momentum and deliver strong results post-Covid on the back of renewed consumer confidence and strong execution” he added.

The company recently underwent a leadership transition as Juan Pablo Rodriguez took over as the new CEO of HCCB with the retirement of former CEO Neeraj Garg. HCCB invested about Rs 684 crore to ramp up manufacturing capacity in FY22.

“We stay committed to India’s growth story and continue to find the right investment opportunities. Earlier this year we made a few announcements which include ₹1000 crore investment for a greenfield site in Banda Thimmapur Telangana and capacity expansion worth ₹550 crore and ₹330 crore in Khordha Odisha and Goblej Gujarat respectively. These investments will help us build capacity for 2023 and beyond” Tan added.

He pointed out that investments are not just limited to line expansion at factories. “We also have substantial feet on the street that manages our vast distribution network. A lot of our capex is also invested in sales-generating infrastructures like visi- coolers IT and digital distribution and logistics” Tan added.

For Coca-Cola India the June quarter in the ongoing fiscal was the “best-ever” in terms of volume growth on the back of a strong summer season sales. The beverage major has stepped up focus on smaller packs such as 200 ml returnable glass bottles150 ml tetrapak and 250 ml PET bottles to grow volumes amidst challenges such as inflationary pressures.

Coca-Cola Christmas truck 2022: New locations revealed - check if it's your hometown

The Coca-Cola Christmas truck tour is ready to head to both Baldock and Manchester tomorrow as the latest two places to be announced on the roadshow are revealed.

The festive jaunt will stay at the Trafford Centre in Manchester on Monday before rolling on to the Co-op at East Leake in Nottinghamshire for a second visit on the same day.

The annual trip began on November 25 at Bluewater shopping centre in Dartford Kent going on to visit Renfrewshire in Scotland London Manchester Bristol West Yorkshire Cardiff Leeds Bradford and Coventry.

Belfast is set to play host to the iconic red lorry on December 16 and 17 and there are still more stops to be confirmed over the coming days Coca-Cola bosses said.

Previously the fizzy drink company teased its 2022 return on Twitter responding to a user with a winking emoji: ""Christmas is coming but is the truck tour? You will have to watch this space.""

Brits are usually able to enjoy a can of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Diet Coke or Coca-Cola Classic in a 'winter wonderland' setting.

The tour was cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic but returned last year on a smaller scale than usual with dates and destinations only announced a day or so before to avoid Covid-related cancellations.

Back in November and December 2019 it stopped off at 19 locations - starting at Edinburgh and ending in London. It was the truck's ninth tour of the country.

In 2017 it visited a total of 42 locations across the UK.

Last weekend a Coca-cola truck burst into flames on the Romanian leg of its tour across Europe.

Nobody was hurt in the fire that ripped through the legendary festive vehicle in Bucharest ahead of its weekend visits.

Horrified onlookers could be seen standing on the side of the road helplessly watching the lorry roll down the road in flames.

Thankfully towards the end of the viral clip the blaze can be seen to have been extinguished as smoke continues to billow into the night air.

Footage posted by TikToker Stan Dumitru Arthur showed people desperately trying to control the smoke.

The good news is that the show will go on - Coca-Cola own a number of the trucks and the company are hopeful they won't have to disappoint hundreds of thousands of people.

The soft drink firm told local media it was taking measures to prevent further incidents."

For many facilities in the US the company’s new recyclable tubes are indistinguishable from those made from more common plactics prompting recyclers to reject them

By Daniela Sirtori-Cortina / Bloomberg





Colgate-Palmolive Co spent years devising a recyclable toothpaste tube. Pulling it off was a technical masterstroke substituting plastic for a mix of materials that was historically tough to reclaim. The result was “nice squeezability” one executive said.

One big problem remains: Many sorting centers in the US and elsewhere do not accept them.

The gap between Colgate’s engineering success and the practicalities of where-do-we-toss-our-empties underscores a persistent challenge for the corporate US: Switching to packaging that can bypass landfills is not enough if there is no easy way to recycle it. In Colgate’s case that is 9 billion tubes a year requiring extra effort to avoid the trash heap.

The new tubes which cover 78 percent of the company’s US toothpaste lineup are made with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) the recyclable plastic used for products such as milk jugs.

In the fragmented US system however companies making recyclable products have to persuade a wide range of stakeholders from local governments to private companies to accept the items sort them and turn them into something new. It is a process that can take years. The tubes are still not classified as recyclable by How2Recycle an organization that issues standardized labels with instructions on how to dispose of packaging.

Goods eligible for collection vary by community and an estimated 40 million US households do not have access to recycling services from their homes. This all means that plastics get reclaimed at rates of only 8 to 28 percent depending on the type.

In light of the challenge Colgate said it has engaged players across the supply chain for years. It has also shared its new tube design with other companies and said competitors would adopt similar recyclable plastic tubes by 2025.

“It is not easy work given the many aspects of the process but we are committed and we believe we are on the right path” Colgate said.

The company has pledged to shrink its plastic waste and use “100 percent recyclable reusable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025” it said.

Sarah Dearman chief innovation officer at the Recycling Partnership an industry-funded group working to improve the system said the new tubes are “a great step.”

However consumers must also have access to collection systems that accept the tube.

It is not clear how many do nationwide assessment by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition an industry working group said.

Colgate said the tube has a third-party certification showing it can be processed alongside HDPE bottles which 87 percent of Americans can put in recycling bins.

That type of plastic ends up being recycled nearly 30 percent of the time one of the highest rates among recyclable materials in the US.

However Colgate said that acceptance might still be limited and advised consumers to check with local community programs.

The company started updating the artwork on its boxes to provide more information.

Some consumers are taking note.

Ethan Helvering a tech worker living in Los Angeles said he was looking for sustainable toothpaste alternatives when he stumbled upon Colgate’s new tube. He sees recyclability as a selling point and is glad to see the company’s efforts although he has questions about what ultimately happens.

“If there’s an option to put something in the recycling I’ll do it” Helvering said. “Hopefully processes improve and at some point it becomes an actual reality.”

Colgate’s new tubes usually get sorted to the correct group once they reach plants that recover materials and bundle similar plastics together a test commissioned by the company showed.

However most US recovery facilities do not take tubes because the recyclable and traditional versions are so similar said Sandeep Kulkarni a technical consultant at the Association of Plastic Recyclers a trade group.

The old tubes could cause contamination if consumers put them in the recycling bin so it is still easier for recycling facilities to reject toothpaste tubes across the board he said.

Waste Management Inc which offers recycling and disposal services said the tubes are not in its list of acceptable items.

Another concern is leftover toothpaste causing contamination said Pete Keller an executive at waste disposal company Republic Services Inc.

Shapiro had been in office for just two years first elected in 2004 in an uphill battle for an open seat once held by his Republican opponent a former member of Congress. Shapiro won by 10 percentage points and his campaign became a model for centrist Democrats seeking to strengthen the party’s base in red parts of the state.

Although he was a newcomer Shapiro quickly gained the respect of his Democratic colleagues. The party had just won control of the state House but they had a one-seat majority and couldn’t agree on who should be speaker. That’s when Shapiro made a phone call.

On the other end of the line was Republican state Rep. Dennis O’Brien. Shapiro suggested a deal: O’Brien could become the Republican speaker for a Democrat-held chamber and Shapiro would be the first-ever deputy speaker. The trade — a Democratic majority for Shapiro’s newly created leadership position — foretold the style of politics Shapiro would engage in over the next 15 years.

Since his win in Pennsylvania’s gubernatorial race last month Gov.-elect Shapiro has packed his transition team with Republicans lobbyists wealthy donors and corporate executives from companies like Comcast Aramark and Independence Blue Cross. But one member of Shapiro’s transition personnel committee stood out: Though Shapiro’s entire election strategy was that he was the anti-MAGA candidate his team included James Schultz a former associate White House counsel under President Donald Trump.

Shapiro’s team which declined to comment for this article framed Schultz’s appointment as an effort by the incoming governor to encourage bipartisanship building a broad tent and bringing people together in an extension of his campaign messaging. During the GOP primary Shapiro spent ad money publicizing Republican candidate Doug Mastriano’s pro-Trump positions; Mastriano said he owed Shapiro a debt of gratitude. Then Shapiro undertook a strategy of waving his centrist banner and beat Mastriano by almost 15 percentage points in the general election.

Winning over Republicans that opposed Trump’s full-throated embrace of election denialism was a key part of the strategy according to a memo released by the Shapiro campaign on Thursday. His campaign was backed by prominent Republicans including Schultz who defected from the GOP after Mastriano an election denier won the primary; Schultz said Mastriano would “damage the conservative mission.”

“Josh campaigned as a moderating voice so it’s not surprising that he would surround himself with diverse perspectives” said Ken Snyder a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania. “Jim worked for Trump but also stood up to him by opposing his endorsed candidate Doug Mastriano. In today’s Republican Party that shows courage. It’s good that Josh would reward courage.”

After serving as a lawyer for Trump’s 2016 Republican National Convention and transition team Schultz took his position as a White House attorney for much of Trump’s first year in office. As he was leaving office he said his plan was always to do a short stint and that the controversies around Trump did not affect his decision.

In an interview at the time with Politico Schultz defended the Trump White House saying it was being unfairly maligned by critics lusting for power. “Some in the news media unfairly criticize this administration and take every opportunity to take shots even when they’re not justified” he said. “There have been folks out there trying to make a name for themselves in that space by being critics in order to set themselves up for other positions down the road.” He also praised Trump’s work reshaping the federal judiciary.

In the past Schultz sometimes took a hard-line conservative tack. In 2013 when he was general counsel under former Republican Gov. Tom Corbett Schultz wrote a brief opposing same-sex marriage that included a comparison of gay marriage to child marriage. The brief was widely denounced — including by Schultz’s boss at the time Corbett who disavowed the comparison after the fact as well as Shapiro who has long been vocal in support for the right to gay marriage.

Mark Segal founder and publisher of Philadelphia Gay News said he worked with Schultz on an affordable LGBTQ+ housing project under Corbett and considered him a friend. Segal said he later lobbied Corbett through Schultz to stand down on the gay marriage case. Asked about Schultz’s later work for Trump Segal said “I think right now we’ve all learned that Trump does not listen to his attorneys.”

Among fellow Democrats Shapiro’s critics have long feared that his ascent would mean compromises with Republicans that put the party at risk by spurning the base that got him elected. They cited his support for everything from scholarships for alternatives to public educations that could bleed Philadelphia’s crumbling school district to his moderate positions on criminal justice reforms.

In the 2022 gubernatorial race Schultz praised Shapiro for being “tough on crime” and opposing Larry Krasner Philadelphia’s embattled progressive district attorney. Shapiro and Krasner have butted heads since the chief city prosecutor took office though Shapiro has refused to comment on an unprecedented Republican-led effort to impeach Krasner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZHdtYWdpYy5jb20vd2R3bWFnaWMtcGx1cy9kaXNuZXlwbHVzL25ld3MvMTBkZWMyMDIyLWRpc25leXMtbmV3LWFkLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1kaXNuZXktc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uLXRpZXItbWVhbnMtaXQtd2lsbC1jb3N0LXlvdS1tb3JlLXRvLXN0YXktYWQtZnJlZS5odG3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney's new ad-supported Disney+ subscription tier means it will cost you more to watch ad-free,"Forum Forums

Here’s a recent college football column via the AP:

The Alabama Crimson Tide will play a football game Saturday that means ... well absolutely nothing.

Not being cruel.

It’s just the way things work in Tuscaloosa.

The Southeastern Conference championship is out of reach. All hope of claiming a spot in the College Football Playoff is gone. Which means there’s no chance of Bama winning its seventh national title since Nick Saban arrived 15 years ago.

Which means of course that the season is effectively over for the Tide.

Just how momentous of an occasion is this for the greatest dynasty in college football history?

One must go all the way back to Nov. 13 2010 for the last time Alabama played a regular-season game sans impact on the national championship race.

Since that day more than a dozen years ago the Tide has hoarded five national titles finished as the runner-up three other times and lost in the semifinals the first year of the playoff. The other two seasons Bama was eliminated from the title race by gut-wrenching defeats at the hands of rival Auburn in the regular-season finale.

With two losses — gasp! — already this season Alabama will trot on the field at Bryant-Denny Stadium for an expected beatdown of Austin Peay relying on motivational goals that are generally reserved for the common folks.

Things like pride and a better bowl bid.

“We’ve still got goals we’d like to reach” linebacker Jalen Moody insisted without naming them. “We’ve got to go out there and prepare every day so we can go out the way we came in. We can’t win a championship now but we’ve still got to finish the right way.”

Alabama’s elimination is good news for the rest of the nation which had grown weary of spending most every January watching Saban’s behemoth win or at least contend for championships.

Then again it seems a good time to add some perspective to just what an amazing run this has been for the Tide:

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Saban’s coaching colleagues in the SEC were Steve Spurrier Urban Meyer Mark Richt Gene Chizik Les Miles Bobby Petrino Houston Nutt Dan Mullen Joker Phillips Derek Dooley and Robbie Caldwell. No need to mention the Texas A&M and Missouri coaches; those schools were still two seasons away from joining the SEC.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Barack Obama was approaching the midway point of his first term and less than two weeks removed from a huge Democratic defeat in the midterm elections.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game the Miami Heat’s “Big Three” — LeBron James Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh — were off to a sluggish 5-4 start in their first season together.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game people still used BlackBerry phones hailed a cab when they needed a ride read a newspaper to figure out what was going on in the world and shopped at places known as malls.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Tom Brady was a mere child of 33 and the Buffalo Bills were 0-8 at the midway point of the NFL season.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Ke$ha had the No. 1 song in the land with “We R Who We R” and “Megamind” was the top-grossing movie.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Donald Trump was hosting “The Apprentice” and most of us had never heard of Elon Musk.

Some are wondering — hoping might be a better word — that this slight dip of a season is a sign that Saban’s grip on the game is loosening.

He just turned 71. Nothing lasts forever.

Sorry that’s just wishful thinking. While undoubtedly a disappointing season by Alabama’s standards the two defeats came on a last-second field goal at Tennessee and a 2-point conversion at LSU in overtime.

The Tide is just four points away from being undefeated and right back in the thick of things. Come 2023 there’s no reason to think the school won’t be one of the leading title contenders again.

For now Alabama still has next week’s regular-season finale — the Iron Bowl against Auburn — to stir its competitive fire.

Depending on how things shake out the Tide could end up in a major bowl though it’s hard to envision future NFLers like quarterback Bryce Young and linebacker Will Anderson risking injury to play in a postseason game that doesn’t really matter.

These days Saban sounds more like a motivational speaker than a football coach. He figures the last few games as hollow as they truly are will go a long way toward establishing if this is just a blip in his dynasty or the first indication of a more significant decline.

“You know we talk a lot about culture we talk a lot about identity but really what makes you sort of motivated — what creates an identity for all of us? We all strive for self-respect but how do we go about doing it?” Saban mused this week.

“Playing this game for what we want to accomplish what we want to do re-establish the identity that we want in Alabama football” he went on. “That’s what we’re gonna try to finish and do and it’ll be interesting to see how players choose to do that.”

Never bet against Nick Saban.

Just enjoy this rare chance to spend the next couple of months without him.

They Owe Us Reparations.,"The call for accountability against oil and gas companies is critical but the dominant narrative misses an essential component: There’s no mention of financial reparations for Indigenous and historically Black communities in southern Louisiana who suffer the most loss and damages due to land loss and climate change and who are being actively displaced.

And this is just the beginning. Recently a federal court ordered a nine-year-old lawsuit to return to state court. The suit was filed against Chevron USA Exxon Mobil Corp. ConocoPhillips Co. and BP America. Over 40 similar legal challenges may follow against the oil and gas companies that have caused and are causing Louisiana’s wetlands to disappear at an alarming rate. These lawsuits could win billions of dollars in damages.

I can’t tell you in numbers the cost of a dying delta. I can tell you that since 1970 the oil and gas industry has raked in $52 trillion in profits.

The Jean Charles Choctaw Nation which recently changed its name from the Isle de Jean Charles band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw a neighboring tribe related to the Houma recently relocated from their home island in Terrebonne Parish which shrunk from its original 35 miles to less than 1 square mile. Elders will tell you that Isle de Jean Charles used to be walkable to Pointe-aux-Chenes the tiny Houma-French speaking town where my dad was raised and where my family lives. This trek is no longer possible.

Since oil and gas established corporate-colonial occupation over the area in the 1930s Louisiana has lost more than 2000 square miles of land. Companies dredged thousands of miles of canals through the marsh to get to and from oil and gas wells carving up Native bayou communities. These canals directly destroy wetlands disrupt wetland hydrology and act as avenues for salt water intrusion causing the coastal marshes our necessary and natural barriers to hurricanes to rapidly erode.

Oil and gas companies have long opposed Indigenous tribes in Southern Louisiana achieving federal recognition. They fear that Native people will reclaim the oil-rich ocean-accessible lands that fossil fuel corporations have been ruining for nearly a century.

Southern Louisiana is home to large Native communities including my own the Houma. While many Houma still live on our ancestral lands it is the fastest disappearing region in the country. Our lands are unprotected because no Indigenous tribe in the southernmost regions of Louisiana has federal recognition and the state of Louisiana is heavily invested in fossil fuels.

Likewise historically Black communities such as Ironton a freedmen’s town located in Plaquemines Parish continue to resist displacement. After hurricanes Katrina and Isaac only about 50 families remain in the community. In 2021 Hurricane Ida scattered dozens of unearthed coffins from Ironton’s community cemetery and left few houses unscathed; recovery is ongoing. It is not incidental that Ironton is surrounded by polluting infrastructure including the 2400-acre Phillips 66 Alliance oil refinery a grain terminal and two coal export terminals. Not far from Ironton a company called Venture Global is preparing to construct a pipeline and an export terminal Plaquemines LNG for liquified natural gas.

Oil and gas companies argue that they are legally allowed to destroy wetlands under state and federal rules put in place decades ago. Over time the fossil fuel industry has ramped up destructive practices despite knowing the severe environmental consequences; it has become a wealthy and powerful machine that can manipulate laws in its favor.

At the same time oil and gas wells and canals are sinking the Louisiana coast sea levels are rising due to climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has removed the names of 31 bodies of water from their maps of Louisiana as bayou and bay borders disappear and become open water. The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act will add another layer to these injuries by reinstating $190 million in bids from fossil fuel companies to drill in the Gulf.

At the recent COP27 climate conference one of the primary points of discussion was sourcing funding for ​“loss and damages” from climate change. Environmental leaders from across the world called on colonizing countries such as the United States and European countries to reinstate their extracted wealth to countries in the Global South who have contributed the least to climate change but are experiencing the worst impacts.

Likewise our conversations around loss and damages here in the United States must include accountability for the rich extractive polluting industry that has torn up the Louisiana coast while emphasizing a just transition. In a an essay calling for reparations from oil and gas corporations New Orleanian artist and researcher Imani Jacqueline Brown invoked the doctrine of ​“unjust enrichment:” If an entity profits by impoverishing another then these profits are unjust and must be reinstated.

In October Shell reported its second highest quarterly profit ever at $9.5 billion. Chevron made $11.2 billion and Exxon made $19.7 billion. Despite being an oil and gas state — which is supposed to mean jobs and prosperity according to fossil fuel corporations — Louisiana is the second poorest state in the United States with one of the highest racial wealth divides.

I can’t tell you in numbers the cost of a dying delta: It is invaluable and irreplaceable. I can tell you that since 1970 the oil and gas industry has raked in $52 trillion in profits or nearly $3 billion per day for the last 50 years.

The solution: It’s time for oil and gas to pay the costs. These companies owe reparations and need to forfeit their wealth.

It must be acknowledged that successful litigation and money gifts while necessary only slow or reframe the problem — they do not change the system that allowed the harm in the first place or guarantee protections from more legal extraction. Our impacted communities need financial reparations to recover from past abuse and brace for future loss and damages as we fight for systemic change. And we should treat those reparations as a means by which to end to the extractive industry once and for all. It’s too cheap for them to exploit us and even after major environmental victories they are set up to do it again.

We need true systemic change. We need Pachamama—inalienable rights of nature that safeguard our natural environments from living creatures to our water and air. And ultimately the government needs to give land back to Indigenous people so that Native communities like the Houma can protect their ancestral lands from companies that would plunder them for profit. Our future generations deserve to live on the lands of their elders and ancestors.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A través de sus redes sociales el Colorado dijo que Santos era un bruto y un desmemoriado por no respetar la trayectoria del Bicho y que el partido cambio cuando el futbolista ingresó al campo.

U.S. Snowboard Team rider Chris Corning found the podium finishing in second.

Canadian Jasmine Baird won in front of the home crowd for the women with Evy Poppe of Belgium in second and Reira Iwabuchi of Japan in third. Valentino Guseli of Australia took the win for the men and the first snowboard big air win for Australia in World Cup history. Canadian Nicolas Laframboise was third.

It was a chilly night but the men and women put on a show for the Canadian crowd. Corning who has two crystal globes in big air showed that he will be a threat again this season. He put down a backside triple cork 1800 melon for his first trick which earned him a high score of 93.50 but his last trick—a frontside 1440 truck driver—left him just a half point shy of Guseli’s total knocking him to second place.

Jake Canter finished 13th and Sean FitzSimons was 17th. Jack Coyne Fynn Bullock-Womble and Liam Johnson did not qualify for finals. Kaitlyn Adams was the only U.S. woman to compete and she did not qualify for finals.

The riders now head to Copper Mountain for their next big air at the Visa Big Air presented by Toyota as well as the first halfpipe World Cup of the season as part of the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix.

The company introduced Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on Wednesday the latest version of its durable glass for smartphones. Corning says the new glass should provide better drop resistance on rougher surfaces.

The announcement is significant because Corning's Gorilla Glass can be found on prominent phones from companies like Samsung and Google possibly providing a preview of what to expect from next year's new devices. The first products to feature the new glass should hit the market in the next few months although Corning couldn't share additional details. Corning's more durable smartphone glass arrives amid a renewed interest in extending the lifespan of mobile devices for both environmental and economic reasons.

Among the biggest differences between Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and the current version is that the new iteration should better withstand drops on tougher surfaces. The new glass was able to endure falls from up to one meter onto a surface replicating concrete in lab tests the company says. The current Gorilla Glass Victus by comparison was tested on surfaces meant to simulate asphalt.

""We had to find an even tougher test to interrogate the surface"" said John Bayne senior vice president and general manager of Corning's mobile consumer electronics division. ""And concrete is exactly that. It's actually more challenging than asphalt.""

The company uses materials that replicate concrete instead of actual concrete because real-world surfaces degrade after repetitive drops Corning said.

Gorilla Glass Victus 2 should also provide better cover glass protection for larger and heavier phones according to Corning. The test puck that the company uses to simulate the size and weight of a real phone during the testing process is now roughly 15% heavier to more accurately reflect today's larger size devices. That could be particularly useful for foldable phones like the Galaxy Z Fold 4 which weighs 263 grams making it noticeably heavier than even the 228-gram Galaxy S22 Ultra. The Galaxy Z Fold 4's cover screen and rear glass already use Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus Plus which is a version of the glass that's exclusive to Samsung's Galaxy devices.

Corning typically releases new versions of its glass every 18 to 24 months Bayne said. But the arrival of Gorilla Glass Vicus 2 comes as consumers have been holding onto their devices for longer periods of time underscoring the need for more durable products.

Data from Assurant an insurance provider that also helps companies develop device trade-in programs suggests that consumers are now waiting three and a half years before trading in their devices to upgrade to a new phone. Two smartphone screens are also cracked every second in the US according to a 2021 report from the electronics repair brand UBreakIFix.

Part of the reason why people may not be upgrading their phones as frequently as they used to is that annual upgrades aren't as compelling as they used to be. But Bayne thinks there's still plenty of room for smartphone durability to improve particularly when it comes to developing glass that's tough but also thin.

But your favorite warehouse store isn't just for deals; there are a surprising amount of big-budget luxury items being sold there as well.

In particular if you're a bit of a foodie and want to splurge there's no end to the gourmet goodies you can find. Just make sure your rewards credit card has a big limit -- some of these picks have four-figure price tags.

1. A (literal) pallet of Godiva chocolate: $2500

If you've ever wanted to put that ""you can't have too much of a good thing"" theory to the test here's a good way to do it. The pallet of chocolate consists of 60 Godiva Brown & Gold Holiday Gift Towers each stuffed with everything from chocolate truffles to Godvia coffee. Each tower comes in at 2.59 pounds giving you around 155 pounds of chocolate for your $2500.

2. A kilogram of caviar: $2000

Caviar is perhaps the most iconically ""fancy"" food you can find (even if it is just fish eggs). If you want to seriously impress your party of 30+ guests the Plaza Golden Osetra Caviar Kilo Pack may be the way to do it -- provided you have the $2000 to spend. If that's a bit out of your budget don't worry; Costco actually has a range of caviars at a variety of price points for any budget. For example you can get 2 ounces of Tsar Nicoulai Baerii Caviar in a gift set with blinis and creme fraiche for just $110.

3. Half a cow: $1300

Have you ever been wandering the meat department at the grocery store and thought ""Wow I'd really like to just take this whole section home!"" Well here's your chance -- or as close as you can get. The Raise American Half Cow Locker Pack is 65 pounds of organic grass fed beef. Of course you won't just get a giant box with half a cow inside. It's all pre-portioned into roasts steaks and even one-pound packs of ground beef.

4. A Wagyu ribeye roast: $1100

While you can get half a cow for $1300 that's not even the fanciest beef you'll find at Costco. That honor goes to the Japanese Wagyu ribeye roast. For the not-so-low price of $1100 -- or just $900 through 12/23/22 with extra manufacturer's savings! -- you can buy 12 pounds of A5 Grade imported ribeye. Looking for a different cut? Not to worry; Costco has a variety of wagyu beef including a bargain-priced 2-pack of Wagyu striploin roast for just $570.

5. A wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano: $950

Are you one of those people who always ask for fresh parmigiano cheese on your meal whenever you go to an Italian restaurant? Then this may be for you: an entire wheel of 24-month-old Parmigiano Reggiano fresh from Italy. That's 72 pounds of cheese uncut in its rind. At $950 -- shipping and handling included! -- you're paying a measly $13 a pound.

6. A three-year-old pig leg: $550

Spain is known for its magnificent ham but you don't need to hop on a 9-hour flight to try it. Instead you can get it from Costco (though for $550 you could probably fly to Spain!). The Covap Jamon Iberico Bellota Ham Leg is from acorn-fed free-ranging pigs raised in the Valle De Los Pedroches in Southern Spain. It's 15.4 pounds and it comes with a stand and carving knife.

7. An Alaskan seafood variety pack: $370

If you're more into the sea than the land check out this giant bundle of Alaskan seafood. This pack contains salmon crab halibut sablefish tanner and scallops all flash frozen and shipped from Juneau Alaska. All told you'll receive around 12 pounds of seafood for your $370 shipping and handling included.

8. Surf and turf: $350

Can't make up your mind between steak or crab? Try the surf and turf package! This $350 collection features 12 pieces each of Rastelli petite filet mignon and jumbo lump crab cakes. Everything ships frozen and shipping and handling is included in the price tag.

9. Turkey dinner with all the trimmings: $270

Sure you can labor for hours on turkey dinner for your family -- or you can just buy one from Costco. Rastelli’s Roast Turkey Dinner has it all from a five-pound turkey breast to green beans almondine to cranberry sauce plus pies for dessert. All told you'll feed eight to 10 people for $270 giving you a $27 to $34 cost per plate. Not your cheapest holiday option but certainly less time in the kitchen.

Not all bulk is a bargain

Although many of these items live up to the bulky ideals of shopping at Costco -- I mean a pallet of chocolate is certainly a bulk buy! -- you can see that they're not all bargains. But it's further proof that our favorite warehouse store really does have it all.

Here's How to Get Your Free COVID Booster,"It's the membership that keeps on giving this holiday season.

The winter holidays are a time for giving. That includes the passing of presents well wishes and infectious diseases like COVID-19 and the flu. With family gatherings looming now is the time to vaccinate.

Costco members can get boosted at their favorite store. It's as easy as scheduling an appointment online. Here's how the process works.

Check if you're eligible

Not everyone is eligible for the shot. If you're bringing kids they must be aged three years or older to receive a vaccination. You can check the CDC website for information on how long you should wait between booster shots.

Shoppers can also check the CDC booster tool to see if they're eligible for a booster.

Schedule an appointment

With that out of the way you can schedule an appointment at your local Costco. Enter your ZIP code in this Costco Pharmacy finder and select your preferred location. Once you click ""schedule an immunization"" you can choose the booster(s) you prefer.

To wrap up select a date and time. Make sure to fill out your medical information on the following page including allergies and booster status. After that you're all set.

Walk-in

Some Costco locations do accept walk-ins. Depending on how many people have already scheduled appointments at your location there may be a wait.

The Costco website recommends you schedule appointments online to save time.

Is getting a COVID-19 booster worth it?

There are a couple of perks to getting your COVID-19 booster at Costco. First you can do some holiday shopping after getting your booster. The pharmacists typically recommend you hang around for around 15 minutes to confirm that you have no side effects.

For another thing if your scheduled appointment gets messed up you may still be eligible for a shot since Costco accepts walk-in appointments. That's some added peace of mind.

Don't get a booster if you think you have COVID-19 already. The CDC recommends folks who feel unwell avoid getting boosted/vaccinated until their symptoms pass. The same goes for folks who have multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS).

Since scientists are a whole lot smarter than I am predicting a surge of COVID-19 cases this winter I'd rather be safe than risk a sorry Christmas season. I've got a White Elephant gift exchange to bomb and clean air to breathe -- I can't go getting sick now of all times.

If anything I'll want to do a little shopping at Costco before the new year. It's a great place to shop and be able to stick to your budget.

I'll snag a $5 rotisserie chicken one of Costco's most popular products. I'm in the market for a new phone -- there are significant perks to buying a smartphone at Costco. Last-minute Christmas shopping for my dad will see me browse the best men's gifts Costco offers.

Stay safe this holiday season. And if you decide to get boosted add Costco to your list of friendly pharmacies that offer free COVID-19 vaccinations -- if nothing else it's easy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzY4ODkwMTAvZGlzY29udGludWVkLWl0ZW1zLWNvc3Rjby_SAURodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS82ODg5MDEwL2Rpc2NvbnRpbnVlZC1pdGVtcy1jb3N0Y28vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fives discontinued items you’ll never find again at Costco – but some are still on store shelves...,"LAST CALL Fives discontinued items you’ll never find again at Costco – but some are still on store shelves

BROWSING Costco aisles may become an easier feat as these five items will no longer be on shelves.

Some discontinued products can be attributed to vendor agreements seasonality or low demand.

1 These five products have been given the dreaded death star Credit: Getty

There's even a name that employees and Costco shoppers use when discussing items that are scheduled to leave it's called the death star.

This refers to an asterisk that's placed on the price tag in the top right-hand corner.

This means that item will not be restocked once it's completely sold out.

On a trip to the warehouse seller Costco shopper and YouTuber Gina's Shopping Life recently revealed that it will stop selling a number of popular items.

She also noted that just because the asterisk is on the tag does not mean that the item will be given a clearance price.

Sometimes the death star just indicates that the product will be no longer available.

Below are five products that shoppers can goodbye to.

However just remember that all prices and items may vary based on state and store.

1. LG Cord Zero

Once all are sold the LG Cord Zero vacuum will be no longer available.

The vacuum comes with two batteries and some pretty useful accessories all for just $299.

This product will be on sale until December 25 and was originally $399.

2. Trendsetter Chair Mat

The 35 by 47-inch mat is being sold for $33 and comes in a charcoal color.

These mats are typically used to protect your floors from scuffs or spills.

Additionally the mats also make it easier to move within your workspace for those who have carpet.

3. The 20 jar spice rack

This rack is includes 20 premium spices and is being sold for $40.

Plus each spice comes with free refills for five years.

Each jar comes in a glass bottle with a shaker top and is crafted from bamboo.

4. Keurig Crafted Classics coffee pods

The limited-edition pack comes with 72 coffee pods for just $36.49.

This means that the price comes out to nearly 50cents per pod.

Shoppers get 12 pods of six classic flavors including Original Donut Shop Newman's Own Caribou Dark Magic Costa Rica and Hawaiian Extra Bold.

Gina said that the pack will likely return again next year.

5. Ninja Creami

This customizable frozen dessert maker can make nearly anything into ice cream sorbet or milkshakes.

To grab the Ninja for just $99 shoppers must head to their store before December 25.

""This is the lowest price I've seen it"" Gina said in the video.

Other Costco changes

In July 15 Costco gas stations in New Jersey will now only offer gas to those with memberships.

Before then New Jersey locations allowed non-members to purchase cheaper gas.

No public statement was made nor does it mention the policy change on its website.

However customers were notified by signs at the pumps last month according to a New Jersey news outlet.

Additionally two popular Costco food court items are being offered at a higher price.

The Chicken Bake is now $3.99 up $1 from its price in June.

While the 20-ounce soda now runs at 69 cents up from 59 cents.

The Sun reveals a Costco update as the retail giant announces some major store changes.

Plus two Costco must-buys for the Christmas party season starting at $5."

Princess Margaret had the royal biographer Christopher Warwick visit her home Apartment 1A in Kensington Palace in 1980 for the first time. He said at the time: ""The first time I had lunch with her we were just the two of us sitting in the dining room having lunch at Kensington Palace the house that William and Kate now live in.”

It would be the first of many such visits for the author. This is because Margaret had selected Mr Warwick to write her biography. Although a few pictures have been shared of Kate and William's London home it was quite different back when Princess Margaret used to live there. Mr Warwick added: ""I got to know Apartment 1A very well indeed. The best way to describe it it was like walking into an English country house. ""It was very elegant it had an 18th-century quality about it and it was furnished with lovely antiques.. READ MORE: Meghan is breathtaking in white for New York event - 'a vision'

Kensington Palace became Margaret's home three years after her marriage in 1960 to Antony Armstrong-Jones.

Sixty years ago a very determined man named Carroll Shelby established a company that bore his family name. As an automotive enthusiast racing driver designer and witty entrepreneur Shelby quickly figured out the best recipe for a car that could dethrone the well-known Corvettes. It was called the Cobra and it made Chevrolet wonder what was going on. It kept winning race after race!In the beginning the car wore the “Powered by Ford” stickers because the power unit was being supplied by the American manufacturer. The first units used small block engines but in the last two years of production (from 1965 to 1967) the Los Angeles-based company started using potent engines.The Shelby American AC Cobra powered by Ford was the vehicle that truly had it all six decades ago. It came with plenty of power but it also encompassed the agility of European sports cars. The entrepreneur managed to find a dream of a recipe for a cool roadster – have it go fast but trust it will follow your command when a corner is coming up.With the characteristics of a great machine that can offer thrilling times on the track and an open-top experience like no other the Cobra quickly turned into a legend. This has benefitted Ford as well even though the vehicle itself was a financial failure for both Shelby’s company and the Dearborn-based automaker. They weren’t able to find a working solution for the mass production process. But let’s not think about how Carroll Shelby witnessed his roadsters going up in value constantly until the 1990s when some other models were made after a brief break of around 30 years.Unlike the first Cobra that hid under its hood a Ford 260 cu-in (4.3-liter) engine the one that you’re about to learn more about down below sports a much bigger powerplant. And this meant some challenges had to be faced.The cast-iron V8 power unit used by this very suggestively named Shelby 427 Competition Cobra offered the vehicle just what it needed – 500 hp (507 ps). The 7.0-liter eight-cylinder was an unbelievable addition to such a small and fun roadster. But it gave the car a lot of character. However that wasn’t enough.So the big names behind the Cobra worked together and gave the Competition model a couple of useful upgrades. These were desperately needed since the racing driver that was also the mastermind behind the car wanted to race the Shelby 425 in the Group 3 GT class. The car received larger brake rotors durable calipers bronze suspension bushings a special fuel pump a bigger fuel tank an external fuel filler a roll bar and front and rear jacking points. The team also added a lot of parts made from various metals. For example the roadster used magnesium intake manifolds and aluminum cylinder heads.Unfortunately production didn’t go as planned. Only 51 Competition Cobras were done when the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) inspectors arrived to check if they met the 100-model quota.Out of the 51 just 23 models were completed to the necessary racing specification. They all found a home.The vehicle you’re seeing in the photo gallery is nonother than the car used by the brilliant designer and racing driver to complete the Shelby Cobra Caravan lineup. Painted in Guardsman Blue and with white stripes added on top the roadster joined a couple of cars like the GT 350 GT 350 R Cobra Daytona Coupe and the GT 40 on tour through a dozen of America’s most well-known cities.The CSX 3011 did not sell during the promotional event but it helped with the marketing efforts.A year after its production the vehicle was used by MGM Studios to film a movie in which Elvis Presley starred. The “King of Rock and Roll” can be seen driving the car while he plays the Mike McCoy character.After this small success was added on top of a racing legacy that brought a lot of enthusiasm to Ford the vehicle was sold to Formula 1 racing driver Solana Arciniega through Ford of Mexico. But the roadster did not become a garage queen. It was raced in both the U.S. and Mexico and went through a couple of modifications according to its owner’s desires. After Arciniega’s demise the car was owned by another racing enthusiast. He used it until it caught fire. The engine and the vehicle’s body were damaged.But a true Cobra fan learned about the car found it and brought it to Georgia-based technicians to give its shine back. They did not finish working on it because someone from Canada wanted it. The collector had someone else finish the job.A couple of years passed by and the CSX 3011 presented itself at Virginia International Raceway SAAC 36 event in 2011. It won the Gold Award.While the cars weren’t a financial success sixty years ago they’re definitely wanted today. Auctioneers bid their hearts out back in 2016 when the first-ever Shelby Cobra became available. In the end it found a new home for $13.7 million.Now let’s look at what this roadster can do in terms of breaking price barriers. It’s currently up for grabs at RM Sotheby’s . The vehicle is part of the Arizona Auction which will take place on the 26th of January 2023. The event is happening at the Arizona Biltmore on Missouri Avenue in Phoenix. The public will be able to attend free of charge to view the available lots.The vehicle is joined by relevant memorabilia many images from its past a thorough restoration process breakdown and the Cobra Caravan brochure. Just remember that you'll have to pay 12% of the final price to the auction house since it requires a premium for this unit.We’ll follow this car’s story and let you know about its fate."

Both the quicks missed the second Test against West Indies which Australia won by 419 runs at Adelaide Oval on Sunday to sweep the two-match series 2-0.

Selectors omitted Hazlewood from a 14-man squad named on Monday for the Gabba Test against the Proteas while adding uncapped Western Australia seamer Lance Morris as injury cover.

“Pat continues to improve bowled with freedom on Saturday and appears likely to play this match although Josh will need more time” selectors chairman George Bailey said.

In the absence of Hazlewood and Cummins Michael Neser and Scott Boland took eight wickets between them in Adelaide where Steve Smith captained the side.

“Michael bowled superbly in Adelaide as did Scott” said Bailey. “We were impressed as always with their performances that backed up what they have achieved in the past.”

Hazlewood is now in a race against the clock to play in the second Test on Boxing Day. Cummins said over the weekend that it was a one-to-two-week injury leaving Hazlewood in some doubt for that match at the MCG.

If he is to miss there is also no guarantee of him returning for the third and final Test in Sydney where Australia could play two spinners on a turning wicket. The injury caps a frustrating 12 months for the seamer in red-ball cricket after he played just one Test in Pakistan and none in Sri Lanka on spin-friendly pitches.

Boland will likely be the favourite to remain in Australia’s XI given his status as the country’s fourth quick. Alternatively Queenslander Neser has the advantage of the Gabba being his home ground if selectors were to take the pitch into consideration.

Cricket Australia on Monday confirmed a 14-man squad for the series opener at the Gabba following Sunday's 419-run rout of the West Indies in Adelaide.

Cummins has been named in that squad despite missing the Adelaide pink ball Test with a quad injury but Hazlewood is absent again with an ongoing side strain issue.

The return of the Australian skipper would mean one of Scott Boland or Michael Neser would likely miss out in Brisbane against the Proteas. Uncapped WA tearaway Lance Morris retains his place in the squad but appears unlikely to break into the XI.

""Pat continues to improve bowled with freedom on Saturday and appears likely to play this match although Josh will need more time"" selection chief George Bailey said. ""With that in mind we have retained Michael Neser and Lance Morris in the squad for this match.

""Michael bowled superbly in Adelaide as did Scott. We were impressed as always with their performances that backed up what they have achieved in the past. Lance is a very exciting prospect who will benefit from time with the squad.

""With so much cricket ahead we continue to seek opportunities to grow and maintain our fast-bowling experience and depth.""

Neser took five wickets for the match in the second Test against the West Indies while Boland only managed three but the latter's trio came in one devastating over in the second innings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLWFkZWxhaWRlLWJyaXNiYW5lLTMzNWYzOTFjODhiZjVmMDk4ZGQ5N2ZmN2VjZjU4Yzgw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia's Hazlewood to miss 1st test against South Africa,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLWFkZWxhaWRlLWJyaXNiYW5lLTMzNWYzOTFjODhiZjVmMDk4ZGQ5N2ZmN2VjZjU4Yzgw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E71C820>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The creative talents of artist Jeff Cummins have led his career to take a long and winding road to the doors of Paul McCartney Dr Who and others. Now the Holywell man's colourful life has been chronicled in a book called The Invisible Artist.

The 68-year-old commercial artist has drawn covers for albums books posters adverts and brochures but he seemed destined for such a colourful life. Jeff who returned to North Wales about seven years ago said: ""We found a Dalek I'd drawn on a wall at home in Greenfield when I was ten. It must have been prophetic.""

Jeff tells how he loved drawing from a young age. After attending St Winefrides RC Primary School and St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School he left North Wales to go to London in 1974 and worked with a marketing agency.

Jeff said: ""I always painted my heroes when I was a kid from Noddy to Dr Who to all the TV people."" He continued that hobby and painted legendary kung fu actor Bruce Lee before sending it to a magazine which decided to run it as a poster.

""That was my first commercial job if you like even though it was kind of through the back door"" he remembers. Jeff went freelance in 1976 and worked with Paul McCartney and many others.

On how he teamed up with the former Beatle he said: ""I doubt it would happen these days but I knew the name of his company. I found them in the Yellow Pages. I phoned them up and said: 'Can I talk to Paul McCartney's manager?' They actually put me through to this guy.

""I said: 'I'm interested in doing record covers. Can I come in with a porfolio?' They said yes I went in and they gave me a project there and then.

""It was for an orchestrated version of one of Paul's solo albums Thrillington (in 1977). They came up with this character called Percy Thrillington and didn't quite know what to do with the imagery and then I walked in.""

Some of his artwork was used and he also illustrated the inside sleeve for the Wings Over America triple live album. Jeff was to work with Paul and Linda McCartney for some 12 years but that first meeting was memorable.

""After Wings Over America I was supposed to be doing the poster for the film of that tour called Rock Show. I went to the office in the West End in London to watch it and Paul was upstairs on a mezzanine floor working with (The Beatles' producer) George Martin.

""My instructions were 'Don't interrupt them - wait till they've finished.' Then they came down the stairs and Paul introduced me to George Martin and this other guy who was an animator.

""I found out later they were working on the Rupert Bear thing (the film Rupert and the Frog Song which was released in 1984). I put the video of the tour on and I'm watching Wings live and really loving it. And Paul comes in with this storyboard trying to get my attention to show me this Rupert project.

""And I was 'OK yeah' and I kept looking up at the screen. It was a bit like he was interrupting me because Paul McCartney was on the telly!

""It was only when I was going home that I thought: 'This is mad!' He had become the client and was comfortable and casual. But when he was on the telly it was like 'THAT'S my hero!'""

During his career Jeff also illustrated Dr Who books. Actor Tom Baker was at a signing alongside Jeff and told him that his painting of the actor was his favourite book cover.

In February Jeff will be at a sci-fi convention called Gallifrey One in Los Angeles where another previous Doctor Who actor Jodie Whittaker is due to appear. More recently his work with Doctor Who Magazine has kept him busy.

Pat Cummins is on course to return as captain for the first Test against South Africa at the Gabba pushing Michael Neser out of the side. Cummins missed the Adelaide Test with a quad strain but has been bowling in the nets.

Scott Boland is likely to keep his place with Josh Hazlewood expected to be ruled out again with a side strain which forced him to miss the Adelaide Test."

According to ESPN Maria Blagovolina Griner’s lawyer for the trial in Russia said the basketball star had to cut her locs due to the low temperatures of the prison she stayed in.

Her hair started freezing due to the cold temperatures which caused pain. Instead of feeling tortured all winter she cut her hair off almost two weeks ago.

“It’s very cold in there and every time she washed her hair she got cold and would get a chill” Blagovolina said. “She should have waited until New Year’s Day.”

Fans have witnessed Griner’s hair transformation over the years since it takes time to grow locs. Cutting her hair off was likely a tough decision.

The 32-year-old left Russia elated on Thursday to finally head home after being detained for several months.

According to TMZ she told one person on the plane that she was “happy” and in good spirits.

U.S. official John Kirby said Friday that after Griner landed in San Antonio she seem to be in a healthy state.

Eric Thiel of the Roanoke Police Department’s criminal investigations unit about the magnitude of illegal drugs in Roanoke City Public Schools. Thiel said it would be naive to believe that drugs are not present in city schools but did not comment on the level to which drugs are present. This article has been updated.

Southwest Virginia is plagued by drug overdoses. The last two calendar years have exhibited dramatic increases in the number of fatal overdoses many including misuse of the painkiller opioid fentanyl.

During the third quarter of this year from July to September the Virginia Department of Health reported the region experienced increases in all drug opioid and heroin overdose rates. From Jan. 1 to June 30 this year the city of Roanoke experienced 43 fatal drug overdoses again according to VDH reports.

Thirty-five of those deaths were fentanyl-involved the VDH said.

Drug overdoses began to rise after 2019. In Roanoke that year there were 46 fatal drug overdoses. Twenty-five of those involved fentanyl.

In 2020 there were 96 fatal drug overdoses 71 of which were fentanyl-involved. The trend continued in 2021 when there were 97 fatal drug overdoses and again 71 of them involved fentanyl.

Andy Foley battalion chief of EMS health and safety for the Roanoke Fire-EMS Department said the city is on track to record similar numbers for 2022.

“Ever since COVID we’ve seen them almost double and that trend is staying stagnant but it’s still a high number” Foley said.

One fentanyl-involved criminal case in Botetourt County began in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic-related stresses were intensified.

Caleb Wesley Burch now 29 of Fincastle was arrested that August after robbing the CVS pharmacy in Daleville of 75 patches of prescription fentanyl.

Court records detail that Burch’s parents told law enforcement he came home sick on Aug. 21 exhibiting heroin withdrawal symptoms. The parents left the home without Burch on Saturday Aug. 22.

Around 2 p.m. that day Burch drove his parents’ truck to a parking lot adjacent to the CVS walked into the store and approached the pharmacy counter.

There Burch handed a note to a staff member demanded opiates and lifted his shirt to show a black handgun stuck in his waistband.

Pharmacy staffers retrieved boxes of fentanyl patches from a safe and put them into a small basket which they handed to Burch. He walked out of the store returned to the truck and drove away.

The Botetourt County Sheriff’s Office reviewed security footage at nearby businesses and developed a description of the suspect vehicle a burgundy Ram 1500 pickup.

On Sunday Aug. 23 a sheriff’s deputy saw a pickup that matched the description at the Sheetz station on the intersection of Catawba and Roanoke roads in Daleville.

The deputy called for backup and officers snared the truck as it emerged from the onsite car wash.

Officers found Burch inside along with a fentanyl patch in the pocket of his shorts. He was arrested and taken to the Botetourt-Craig Regional jail.

Investigators searched the truck and Burch’s home but could not locate the rest of the stolen fentanyl patches. Burch’s lawyer was asked to see what he could do about locating the missing drugs.

Botetourt County Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Gillian Deegan said if Burch cooperated prosecutors would not present the found fentanyl as evidence in court.

“We wanted it because it’s so deadly” Deegan said. “And so what I told his attorney was ‘You get the fentanyl we will never mention it in trial. It will not be used against him. It will just be as if we never found it.’ But I also said ‘If we don’t get the fentanyl and somebody dies as a result of it then all bets are off and we’re going after him as hard as we can.’”

About a week later Burch’s lawyer gave a sock full of fentanyl patches to the prosecutor’s office. Of the 75 patches that were stolen the sheriff’s office recovered 70 including the patch that was in Burch’s pocket when he was arrested.

Last month on Nov. 10 Burch pleaded guilty in Botetourt County Circuit Court to three charges: firearm use during a robbery fentanyl possession and using a firearm during a drug robbery.

In exchange for the plea Deegan said the commonwealth agreed to cap its sentencing recommendation at five years. Judge Joel Branscom found Burch guilty and scheduled his sentencing hearing for March 2023.

Deegan said that had the stolen not been found and someone had died she “would have probably charged [Burch] with a felony murder.”

“It seems like fentanyl is in everything” Deegan said. “That’s the scary thing. And I think that’s why the overdoses have started increasing yet again because people don’t know they’re getting it.”

The commonwealth’s attorney said that to save lives Branscom has recently started incarcerating offenders who are on probation and test positive for fentanyl or heroin during a drug screen.

“It’s very much especially with Judge Branscom treatment based” Deegan said. “It’s just saying ‘We’re not going to allow you on the street with easy access to the drug while we’re getting everything lined up for you.’”

Changes to probation violation incarceration legislation in Virginia that occurred in 2021 have made it harder to lock up people who produce a ‘dirty’ urine test. Offenders who violate the terms of their probation essentially get three strikes.

On strike one a probationer is not sentenced. On strike two a sentence up to 14 days may be imposed and on strike three a previously suspended sentence can be imposed. But there does appear to be one exception to the rule.

“The limitations on sentencing in this section shall not apply to the extent that an additional term of incarceration is necessary to allow a defendant to be evaluated for or to participate in a court-ordered drug alcohol or mental health treatment program” the state code section reads. “In such case the court shall order the shortest term of incarceration possible to achieve the required evaluation or participation.”

That exception allows judges like Branscom to incarcerate offenders caught with fentanyl in their system in order to save their lives.

“There have been several cases where probationers have overdosed on fentanyl and died” Deegan said. “People out on bond overdose on fentanyl and die.”

While in jail offenders can be evaluated for state rehabilitation programs like the Community Corrections Alternative Program or CCAP.

CCAP “is an alternative program to incarceration giving probationers and parolees the opportunity to engage in treatment education vocational training and employment in a structured setting in order to promote long lasting public safety” the Virginia Department of Corrections website explains.

“I think it can take up to 18 months to complete” Deegan said. “It’s intensive counseling job training educational behavior modification. As you progress through the program you can go on the outside and get a job and work.”

But Deegan said the program which Branscom often presents as an option to drug offenders in court is difficult for people who aren’t committed to changing their behavior.

“If you are getting sentenced to it because you have the choice of going to CCAP or going to the penitentiary for seven years and you decide ‘CCAP to get me out quicker’ you’re going to have a hard time because you have to be dedicated to change open to the counseling versus ‘I just want to get out as quick as possible.’”

Capt. David Dillow a law enforcement division commander in the Botetourt County Sheriff’s Office said every drug offender is different even demographically.

“It’s across the board on age especially from the patrol side” Dillow said. “When they’re making an arrest it can be an 18-year-old and the other day I think they arrested a 62-year-old. She had methamphetamine.”

Jeff Powell a deputy fire chief in the Botetourt County Fire and EMS Department said his crews are running overdose calls throughout the community.

“If you adjust due to population density because Botetourt has a lot more population density in the southern part of the county it is pretty widespread” Powell said.

As of Nov. 10 Powell’s department had responded to 33 drug overdose calls since Jan. 1. According to VDH reports at least two of those drug overdoses have been fatal. One of those fatalities involved fentanyl.

“We’ve seen overdoses in vehicles. We responded to a recent traffic crash that was the result of an overdose” Powell said adding that calls also take ambulances to “people in parked cars occasionally folks in commercial businesses. We had an overdose at a gas station. And then a lot of it unfortunately in homes and in motels.”

Foley said his Roanoke crews are also running overdose calls all over the city making trips to every quadrant for victims between the ages of 18 and 80.

“It’s everywhere. Everybody’s like ‘Oh well it’s over here. It’s over here.’ It’s not like it hits the homeless harder than anywhere else. It’s everywhere. That’s fundamentally the problem” Foley said. “We’ve run overdoses in every part.”

As of Nov. 10 the Roanoke department had responded to 179 opioid-involved overdoses since Jan. 1. That number only reflects the number of times paramedics administer naloxone to a patient on scene.

Overdoses that are treated with Narcan (one brand name for naloxone an emergency lifesaving drug) before paramedics arrive on scene or that are never called in to a 911 dispatch center aren’t counted or recorded by first responding agencies.

Lt. Dave Anderson a Botetourt County Sheriff’s Office investigator currently assigned to the Botetourt-Rockbridge Regional Drug Task Force said that where there are drug users there is Narcan.

“Everybody we deal with every house we go in there’s Narcan everywhere which is good” Anderson said adding that drug users often practice a buddy system. “One will use while one will watch and make sure and if need be they can administer Narcan.”

Anderson said law enforcement officers know who the offenders are in their localities. In Botetourt County officers interact with the same drug users repeatedly.

“Once you’re an addict you always are so people reoffend” Dillow said. Dillon has known Burch since Burch was in high school.

“You start to see the people you’re going to deal with in high school. Our school resource officers are very active in the schools. They’re a great source of information” Dillow said. “The schools have their own unique problems. Drug use is one of them. It’s a small community. We’re not immune. Our schools are not immune to it just like no school is.”

Lt. Eric Thiel of the Roanoke Police Department’s criminal investigations unit said drugs are present in city schools. “I’m sure there are drugs in schools” Thiel said. “I don’t think anybody’s naive enough to think that there’s absolutely no drugs whatsoever especially once you get into the middle of high school ages of children. That’s just not realistic.”

Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares recently launched a public awareness initiative called “One Pill Can Kill” to “help generate open honest conversations amongst families about the extreme threat that counterfeit drugs and opioids pose” a press release said.

“So many young people think they’re invulnerable. They think it can’t happen to them. It can happen to you” Miyares said recently in Roanoke. “We had a 15-year-old that died in Warren County from a Xanax. They thought they were taking Xanax. It was fentanyl. We had a 15- and a 14-year-old die at a party. They thought they were taking a Percocet. That was fentanyl.”

Anderson said some drugs laced with fentanyl can be bought on the “dark web” but neither Thiel nor Anderson believes any drugs are manufactured in the Roanoke region.

“We haven’t had any evidence or investigated any cases where they’re manufacturing the old school meth or any type of labs that are producing the fentanyl. I’d say it’s coming in by pounds and pounds” Anderson said. “Then they’re cutting it up from there and pushing it out.”

Thiel said drugs that are mailed to distributors or buyers often come through Roanoke. “Because we have the shipping hubs here in our jurisdiction it just happens to be that a lot of those search warrants for packages are filed within our jurisdiction” Thiel said.

Anderson said Southwest Virginia is a hot spot for drug activity because primary highways thread through the region

“You’ve got Route 220 that runs into Roanoke from North Carolina. You’ve got 81 that runs south into southwest Virginia into 77 and 77 takes you all the way down to Florida” Anderson said. “It’s a stopping point or a hub so to speak.”

But Foley said he thinks drug activity and drug overdoses are on the rise because people are desperate. The COVID-19 pandemic forced people into isolation. The battalion chief who has been with the Roanoke department for nearly 20 years witnessed the shift firsthand.

“An overdose you’d run it and be like ‘Oh man we ran an overdose.’ Now it’s a shame but it’s almost like a routine call that you just go on. It’s just muscle memory because you do it so much. And that’s sad. But that’s what it is” Foley said. “I’ve seen it yes drastically increase.”

Dillow and Thiel said law enforcement reforms that occurred in Virginia in 2020 may be contributing to the rise in overdoses. Police believe that tools have been pulled from their tool belts.

“We can’t stop a car with a bad tail light. We can’t stop a car unless registration is four months out” Dillow said. “These people are out here. They’re traveling back and forth. We could catch them quicker in the act. If we can stop more cars then we can make more arrests.”

“It definitely has made it harder in the drug interdiction realm to do our job” Thiel agreed.

When deputies do make arrests Dillow said the circulation of drugs doesn’t stop. Anderson said that “there’s always somebody who is going to step up and take charge and move product out on the streets.”

The continued calls for service from local fire and EMS departments puts a strain on those agencies too. Foley said a typical overdose call in the city requires an 8-person response.

“An unresponsive patient when you get on scene you have to remember somebody’s got to bag somebody’s got to start an IV somebody’s got to give meds somebody’s got to get history somebody’s got to move the patient” Foley said adding that the department sometimes runs more than one overdose call in one day.

“It’s a problem that hasn’t gone away and it won’t go away without deliberate action not only by the government and the instruments of the healthcare system and the criminal justice system and local public safety but it’s a community problem that really requires everybody’s effort” Powell said.

One nonprofit in Roanoke the Virginia Harm Reduction Coalition provides resources to drug users in the city out of a large black traveling van.

At noon the van makes its first stop and volunteers will set up a tent and tables where they lay out donated clothes. Many volunteers are former drug users who are focused on building trust with the people who stop by for supplies including Narcan non-prescription medications and hygiene products.

The van also functions as a portable syringe service allowing participants to turn in their used syringes and pick up sterile ones. A tub in the back is filled with receptacles holding used syringes.

“We’ve picked up about 67000 used needles in the last year” said Danny Clawson the coalition’s director. “That makes a big difference as far as making sure people aren’t reusing needles.”

The goal is to keep people who use drugs alive and to keep them as safe as possible. It’s an important first step toward battling addiction.

“At the coalition we like to say  ‘Sobriety is not the opposite of addiction. Connection is’” Clawson said. “We try to build trust and help people feel a connection to their community and to people around them.”

But Thiel said that as long as there’s money to be made drug use will continue in the city.

“It’s Economics 101. It’s supply and demand” he said. “There is a demand for illegal substances and so somebody is going to pay to supply it.”

“People gnash their teeth and wring their hands and wail and moan about the 15 to 20 homicides that we had this year” Roanoke Commonwealth’s Attorney Donald Caldwell said. “But the overdose deaths in the city are going to more than double that. In terms of people dying as a result of criminal activity homicides take a distant second place to drug abuse. But there just seems to be no deterring so many people so many members of our society from using it. It is a problem without a solution because if somebody had a solution they would have already implemented it and all of us would be copying it.”

“It’s a broken system” Deegan said “and until the powers that be decide to fund the resources that are needed we’re always going to be in that battle between the criminal justice system having to deal with mental health issues that we’re really not equipped to deal with.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtycWUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVzb3VyY2VzL3Jhbmtpbmcvd2hpY2gtY29sbGVnZXMtZGlkLXRoZS10b3AtMTAtd29tZW4tY2Vvcy1ncmFkdWF0ZS1mcm9tL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtycWUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVzb3VyY2VzL3Jhbmtpbmcvd2hpY2gtY29sbGVnZXMtZGlkLXRoZS10b3AtMTAtd29tZW4tY2Vvcy1ncmFkdWF0ZS1mcm9tL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which colleges did the top 10 women CEOs graduate from?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.krqe.com/news-resources/ranking/which-colleges-did-the-top-10-women-ceos-graduate-from/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtycWUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVzb3VyY2VzL3Jhbmtpbmcvd2hpY2gtY29sbGVnZXMtZGlkLXRoZS10b3AtMTAtd29tZW4tY2Vvcy1ncmFkdWF0ZS1mcm9tL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtycWUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVzb3VyY2VzL3Jhbmtpbmcvd2hpY2gtY29sbGVnZXMtZGlkLXRoZS10b3AtMTAtd29tZW4tY2Vvcy1ncmFkdWF0ZS1mcm9tL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Trade organisations and manufacturers are keen to stress that demand remains strong despite the cost of energy materials and component shortages driving prices up and keeping them high.

Signals from the US

This position appears plausible yet there are alternative views emerging and awkward facts such as the halving of steel prices from their peak in 2021 which question this general belief.

Further confirmation of this shift of mood comes from the US in the form of the latest barometer of agricultural sentiment published by Purdue University of Indiana. Farmers are fighting shy of large investments although sales of bigger tractors have held up in Ireland

In its review of November it clearly notes that a clear majority of the US farmers surveyed believe that now is a bad time to make large investments a major reason given being the cost of machinery.

Increasing interest rates and uncertainty of farm profitability were also concerns but neither matched the 47% that placed machinery cost at the top of their lists.

All boom in the boardrooms

However this brake on farm investment has not stopped the major manufacturers enjoying records sales figures if not volumes over the past year.

The big three tractor makers have happily indicated to their shareholders if not their customers that price increases have been implemented that go beyond increased production costs. New Holland is one company that has reported successful price increases to its shareholders

At one level this is nothing more than the standard supply and demand model operating in plain sight. Business is business and farmers too have enjoyed price increases for their produce that often exceed the extra input costs.

It might be hoped that the two sectors will invest the surplus cash in improving the efficiency of both farms and factories but the unfortunate fact remains for farmers that even if they were were to head off down to their local dealer wallet at the ready there may be nothing to buy.

Order now for 2024

We are well aware of the overall stock shortage here in Ireland yet there are reports from over the Atlantic of dealers with all their 2023 allocations being sold already.

John Deere has admitted that farmers ordering a new combine harvester now will have to wait until 2024 for delivery.

Yet the picture is a little more patchy nearer home. Smaller tractors appear to have a shorter lead time than larger units across the board and the same is true of smaller brands. Zetor is making a comeback in Ireland with up-to-date tractors

Both Tumosan and Zetor for instance have said that they have machines in stock at the factory any delay is purely a matter of delivery rather than waiting for a machine to come down the line.

Agri-Argo is another which does not quote an endless wait for a tractor although it will depend on the model and options selected.

Booking ahead

Closer coordination with the factory is the approach having to be taken by dealerships for the larger brands who are struggling to maintain tractor stocks for spot selling.

To shorten the lead time and help fulfil potential orders they are encouraged to book slots on the production line well in advance of any orders materialising.

It has certainly helped matters and has enabled farmers to plan their machinery investment with a little more certainty but it is still not ideal.

Other options

With such a variation over availability there may lie the opportunity for the eastern manufacturers to capitalise on the shortage.

One objection to an eastern tractor is that it will lack the digital sophistication of more expensive marques yet many of the digital functions that are most commonly used can be retrofitted by third-party suppliers. Vantage Ireland is able to supply Autosteer and other digital systems off the shelf

Vantage Ireland of Co. Cork has no supply issues at present and is able to install autosteer and other systems more or less on demand with screens being readily available. This is often the component which is blamed for tractor shortages.

Despite the much spoken of shortage there are still options available to farmers looking to replace a tractor ready for the spring season. It may take a shift in brand loyalty but it is not impossible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ3aS5jby51ay9tYWNoaW5lcnkvcmV3aW5kLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LW1hY2hpbmVyeS1sYXVuY2hlcy1vZi0yMDIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The biggest farm machinery launches of 2022,"There was no shortage of noteworthy new machines this year some of which will be making their debut at Lamma in 2023.

January

John Deere autonomous tractor

Several years of trials in the US came to a head when John Deere announced that its fully autonomous 8R tractor was ready for large-scale production.

The tractor is the first of its kind from the US manufacturer and functions without a driver thanks to its sophisticated monitoring system.

This comprises six pairs of stereo cameras that give a 360deg view to determine the distance to any obstacles.

According to Deere the driverless technology is an evolution of its well-established and widely used AutoTrac system.

The main difference is the addition of a neural network that processes the images analysing individual pixels in roughly 100 milliseconds.

The tractor can be monitored from a smartphone which will receive a live-feed of the tractor’s in-field position.

Kubota M6-001

A rebranding exercise saw Kubota’s long-standing MGX tractors replaced by the M6-001 Utility series which slots into the 104-143hp segment between the smaller M5-002 and higher-spec M6-002.

Improvements centre on the exhaust after-treatment system with particulate filter regeneration able to take place at lower engine revs – about 1200rpm – and at a temperature of 50C.

As before the 2.54m short-wheelbase options (the M6-101U and M6-111U) both come with Kubota’s four-cylinder 3.8-litre engine that develops 104hp/346Nm or 111hp/379Nm and have a hydraulic output of 71 litres/min.

For the 2.68m long-wheelbase models Kubota’s 6.1-litre engine pushes out 123hp/503Nm (M6-121U) 133hp/544Nm (M6-131U) or 143hp/586Nm (M6-141U) with the hydraulic pump rated to 77 litres/min.

February

Deutz-Fahr 6C

Deutz-Fahr ushered in a new three-strong range of tractors to replace its existing 6120 6130 and 6140 with the trio nestling between the firm’s 5 and 6 series machines.

The “C” designation reflects the new models’ more compact dimensions with the 6115C 6125C and 6135C spanning 126hp to 143hp all fitted with a four-cylinder 3.6-litre Deutz engine.

The shift to Stage 5 emissions compliance was the main driver behind the launch but the maker also took the opportunity to introduce its RV Shift transmission – a full-powershift gearbox with 20 forward and 16 reverse gears.

This has two modes work and transport that operate within a predetermined range of gears to streamline the transition from road to field.

Lift capacity is 7t the hydraulics can serve up either 90 litres/min or 120 litres/min and Stoll-made front loaders can be factory fitted in Deutz’s distinctive apple green livery.

April

Krone and Lemken Combined Powers

The self-proclaimed “Combined Powers” of Krone and Lemken came together to produce an autonomous tractor-like “process unit” powered by a diesel-electric engine.

The machine can produce up to 230hp and has no gearbox with electric motors instead powering the wheels and pto shaft.

It has so far passed trials in cultivating ploughing drilling mowing tedding and raking using both Lemken and Krone implements attached via a conventional three-point linkage.

Driverless operation is supported by a series of sensors that can detect objects and obstacles and also monitor the attached implement.

This is overseen by an operator who can transfer job reports and control the machine via a mobile device.

New Holland Pro-Belt variable-chamber baler

New Holland extended its line-up of variable-chamber balers with the addition of the premium Pro-Belt models.

Sitting above the existing Roll-Belt 150 and 180 they weigh 20% more than their predecessors despite carrying the same 2.35m-wide pick-up.

New Holland says stronger components and fewer moving parts – including larger rollers bearings and sprockets and a reduced number of chains – have made the new range more durable and reliable.

Output is a claimed 30t/hour and the Pro-Belts are said to produce more uniform denser bales.

The premium models also benefit from Isobus compatibility an automatic greasing system a moisture meter and the option of larger tyres.

Opico FarmDroid

April saw Lincolnshire-based importer Opico take on distribution of the Danish-made autonomous FarmDroid robot.

Powered by solar panels that feed a pair of lithium-ion batteries the FarmDroid sows seeds and records their exact placement so that it can weed around them.

It works at a sedate 900m/hour – roughly 6ha/day – and can operate continuously until its charge runs down.

The firm says the ability to remove competitive weeds at an early stage can improve yields by up to 40% which can equate to a return on investment of roughly two years.

There are currently more than 250 FarmDroids operating across the globe with a handful in the UK.

May

JCB Fastrac

JCB’s Fastrac was brought up to date with a suite of new cab controls.

Available on all five 4000- and 8000-series models the iCON update involves a newly designed armrest console joystick and 12in touchscreen with integrated Isobus and guidance.

Everything from spool settings and vehicle information to guidance and camera feeds can be accessed programmed and viewed from the screen and storage capacity for headland turn sequences has been increased.

Other creature comforts include automatic climate control more storage space and a heated and ventilated driver’s seat.

June

Kverneland mergers

ROC’s yellow mergers debuted on Kverneland’s stand at the Scotgrass show following its acquisition of the Italian firm last year.

This means six merger brands are now available in the UK providing an alternative to the four-rotor rake for grassland farmers looking to minimise stone contamination in the swath.

The largest of the three ROC machines at Scotgrass was the 8.85m-wide RT 880 with its six-bar pick-up although Kverneland expects demand in the UK will focus on the wider 12.2m RT 1220.

Valtra Q-series

Valtra’s new range of Q-series tractors entered a hotly contested sector with demand intensifying for machines around the 250hp mark.

Sitting between the existing T and S models the five tractors span 230hp to 305hp and come with Agco’s Vario ML270 CVT transmission.

They have the same cab and 7.4-litre Agco Power engine as the T series updated with the addition of an A-pillar display better lighting and improved controls.

July

Massey Ferguson Activa combines

Massey Ferguson added a trio of entry-level combines to its Activa range.

The new five-walker machines – the 7344 mid-size 7343 and smaller 7342 – develop 260hp 226hp and 185hp respectively with the larger two sharing the same 7.4-litre six-cylinder Agco Power engine.

The firm’s Powerflow header can be specced in sizes from 5.5m to 6.2m on the two biggest variants while the base model gets a simpler Freeflow table available in widths from 4.8m to 6m.

All three have the same drum dimensions – 600mm diameter and 1340mm width – while grain tank capacities range from 5200 litres to 6500 litres.

Volkswagen Amarok

Volkswagen finally released details of its long-awaited Amarok pickup which is being built in South Africa in the same factory as Ford’s new Ranger.

The range-topper comes with a 3-litre V6 diesel engine tuned to deliver 247hp and 600Nm although buyers keen to prioritise economy have the option of a 2-litre four-cylinder in either single or bi-turbo guise developing 168hp and 206hp respectively.

VW will kit out all models above 206hp with a 10-speed automatic gearbox while those below this power band come with the choice of a six-speed manual or automatic.

Other new features include a towing capacity increased to 3.5t a 96mm-longer chassis an improved 800mm wading depth and more legroom in the cab.

August

Claas Lexion updates

A clutch of models joined the flagship Claas Lexion combine range in August bringing with them a bigger better-equipped cab.

The first of these is the 8600 which becomes the smallest of the firm’s 8000-series hybrid machines.

It gets a 1700mm drum and 12500-litre grain tank while power is provided by a 12.4-litre six-cylinder MAN D26 engine developing 549hp.

The 8700 and 8800 models have also received a power hike up 41hp to 626hp and 47hp to 700hp respectively.

In the case of the 8800 this is provided by a 16.2-litre MAN D42 power plant as used in the range-topping 790hp 8900.

All get a new cab first seen on the Trion models which offers more space larger front and side windows a 12in terminal 30deg rotating seat and optional “dynamic steering” functions.

September

Fendt 700 Vario

Fendt welcomed a bigger more powerful 700-series to its line-up with an Agco Power engine replacing the old Deutz block to push them deeper into 800-series territory.

The five new Gen7 machines from the 203hp 720 through to the 300hp-plus 728 have had a chassis rejig to accommodate the 7.5-litre engine resulting in a 2.9m wheelbase that’s just 5cm shorter than the larger 800 models.

The cab – which was first unveiled for the current 700 series two years ago – remains the same with the updated multifunction joystick 10in digital dash and a 12in terminal on the armrest as standard.

Unique to the Gen7 700s the VisioPlus cab can be upgraded to give Category 4 protection against dust aerosols and vapours.

This is set to be available from the end of 2023 and will most likely appeal to those using mounted or trailed sprayers.

Krone Big X foragers

Growing demand for forage harvesters with outputs around the 1000hp mark saw Krone expand its range with a brace of new models.

The Big X 980 and Big X 1080 are powered by the same V12 Liebherr engine used in the 1156hp 1180 model.

They have a modified Power Split facility which gives operators the option of selecting “eco-power” mode for better fuel economy or “X Power” to engage the engine’s full output.

Also available on the new models is the firm’s “XtraPower” system which allows engine power to be temporarily boosted to overcome challenging harvesting conditions.

November

Case IH Puma 260 and New Holland T7.300

CNH brands Case IH and New Holland revealed new models at the top of their Puma and T7 ranges.

The Puma 260 and T7.300 have a maximum power of 280hp which boosts to 300hp for pto work and haulage plus stronger axles and bigger tyres than the rest of their respective line-ups.

But the highlights are their new cabs with 7.5% more internal space a wider door opening and a curvier front windscreen to let in more light – plus better sound deadening to keep noise to a serene 66dBa.

Digital Governance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis inaugurated the new Athens-3 data center on Thursday at the Athens Data Center Campus in Koropi.

In 2019 Greece was in the US Department of Commerce’s 301-Tariff Actions and Exclusion Process list noted Pierrakakis “a list you don’t want to be in.

”But together with Development amd Investments Minister Adonis Georgiadis said Pierrakakis and “with synchronized actions we got off that list but along the way we realized that we needed to bring investments into the cloud domain.

”Pierrakakis added that now Greece can claim to have one of the most innovative cloud strategies in the European Union “what we refer to as Cloud First Policy.”

He explained that the public sector was transformed into a cloud-services client “either on premise-cloud or public cloud.”

This digital transition was achieved in record-breaking time he said. Athens-3 has 6.8 megawatts of IT capacity the largest in Greece occupies a facility of 8600 square meters and is powered exclusively by green energy sources.It was built by Lamda Hellix a Digital Realty company.

Lamda Hellix was founded in 2002. Originally built as a cable landing station its first facility Athens-1 opened in 2003 and was the first data center to gain a LEED v4 Gold badge.

It opened Athens-2 in 2016 after weathering the Greek debt crisis. Its existing Athens campus comprises two carrier-neutral data centers totaling 22MW of capacity.

Earlier this year Telecom Italia/TIM subsidiary Sparkle opened 7.7MW facility in Athens its fourth in the country. Located in Athens close to Metamorfosis I the new Metamorfosis II facility comprises an area of about 6000 sq m with a maximum capacity of 700 racks in six modules

Rent Out Land in the Metaverse.,"Investors can now earn rent from parcels of digital land in the metaverse.

When most investors think about earning passive income with crypto they immediately think of staking. But there are a variety of other ways to generate passive income especially if you are active in virtual metaverse worlds such as Decentraland (MANA -1.01%). In early December Decentraland formally introduced a new passive-income option that might appeal to metaverse users: virtual-property renting for owners of digital land.

In other words if you already own digital land in the virtual world of Decentraland you can now rent it to others who might want to set up a short-term presence in the metaverse perhaps for festivals product launches or community events. It's an interesting concept because it works similarly to real-world property renting which has always been a popular source of passive income. So is this metaverse-inspired passive income opportunity right for you?

High risk

While buying virtual land in the metaverse sounds interesting it also comes with a high bar to entry. If you've never explored a metaverse world like Decentraland before you'll need to get up to speed on how these worlds work and how they differ from traditional role-playing video games. You'll also need to familiarize yourself with metaverse land prices which can range from a few thousand dollars to over $1 million and then become acquainted with a map of Decentraland which has over 90000 parcels of land.

Since all transactions in Decentraland take place using MANA the in-game governance token your rental income will be in the form of Decentraland tokens. This comes with some risk and volatility given the price swings possible in metaverse cryptos. Thus you will have two things to worry about: falling land prices and potential currency devaluation.

In late 2021 the metaverse was all the rage and Facebook even rebranded itself as Meta Platforms (META 0.16%). Celebrities and major brands were announcing their involvement in the metaverse and the future looked limitless. Paris Hilton headlined the first-ever Metaverse Festival which featured over 80 artists within Decentraland. But then came 2022 and things are looking a lot more dicey for the Decentraland token which has fallen in price by 88% this year.

High reward

However this high risk does come with potentially high reward. For example experts such as consulting giant McKinsey continue to predict that the metaverse will be a nearly $1 trillion market opportunity within a few years. And there is certainly a lot of interest about what the metaverse is and how to get involved in it. According to the latest study from Capgemini a multinational information-technology services and consulting company headquartered in Paris more than 90% of consumers are curious about the metaverse.

As I see it the Decentraland passive-income opportunity comes down to this: Get in early while people are still figuring out the metaverse buy land while it's relatively cheap and then transform your parcel of land into something that brands and creative influencers will want to use for one-time events. If you are lucky enough you might find some brands artists musicians or small businesses eager to rent Decentraland land parcels from you for brand launches festivals or conferences.

Is virtual-property renting worth it?

For now this new ""passive"" income opportunity sounds way too ""active"" to attract the attention of casual investors. And it certainly requires too much of an up-front investment to be viable for most people just getting involved in crypto for the first time. The average cost of a parcel of land in Decentraland today is $2380.

Unless you're already an active user within Decentraland and have a social network in place I don't see how this can be a recurring source of passive income. Virtual-property rentals are not like real-world rentals where you can lock in rent for 12 months at a time. Even if DJs fashion designers and streetwear brands are knocking down the digital door to rent from you in Decentraland it seems like you're going to have to hustle quite a bit to make recurring rental income a reality.

Why not just stake MANA?

It might be easier instead to just stake your Decentraland tokens in order to earn passive income. For example right now you can earn staking rewards of 3% on your Decentraland tokens via some popular cryptocurrency platforms. This might not sound like a lot but it's easy and it's passive.

Thus as of now I'm out on virtual-property rentals as a source of passive income. While Decentraland is certainly an interesting crypto to consider as a possible rebound candidate in 2023 I need to see more activity within the metaverse before I can recommend the Decentraland token as a buy or to consider virtual-property renting as a viable source of passive income.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9lY29ub215L2djYy9rc2Etc2Vlcy0xdHJsbi1pbnZlc3RlZC1pbi1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1hbmQtaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtczNmdTZhbGvSAW1odHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vZWNvbm9teS9nY2Mva3NhLXNlZXMtMXRybG4taW52ZXN0ZWQtaW4tcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtYW5kLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLXMzZnU2YWxrP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KSA sees '$1trln invested in real estate and infrastructure',"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) will see sustained property market growth fuelled by Vision 2030 and the Iskan programme with $1 trillion slated for real estate and infrastructure projects said top ratings agency S&P Global Ratings.

At least eight new cities are planned predominantly along the coast of the Red Sea with more than 1.3 million new homes by end-2030. Numerous projects are also slated for existing main cities. With the ambitious target for Riyadh to become one of the 10 largest cities in the world its population is projected to exceed 15 million by 2030 from around 8 million (2018 estimates).

Saudi Arabia's retail property market has a lot of long-term growth potential. Real estate will gain from various new programmes to provide local housing and invigorate the business and financial sectors via investments in commercial real estate S&P said.

Winning sectors

Looking at sectors that stand to win from Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 S&P said energy real estate transport tourism health care and digital infrastructure will see meteoric growth.

“It will fall to the debt-capital markets to support a large portion of these new opportunities as the government and the banking sector alone will not be able to meet all the required funding needs” said S&P.

“We do not anticipate taking any immediate rating actions on Saudi corporate entities even as they carve out significant capex budgets over the next two-to-five years because of their healthy balance sheets and strong liquidity.”

Energy sector

The energy sector is a substantial contributor to the government's revenues and its credit quality is currently benefiting from higher oil and gas prices. This windfall will help fund the government's share of investments despite its heavy capital expenditure (capex) burden.

The Saudi oil and gas sector will attract cautious but ongoing capex said S&P. “Even so we think exploration and production (E&P) will increase spending only modestly in 2022. Saudi Aramco (not rated) has publicly announced that its 2022 capex will be at the lower end of its guidance of SR150.0 billion-SR187.5 billion ($40 billion-$50 billion) compared to 2021 capex of SR119.6 billion ($31.9 billion).

Saudi Aramco is reportedly focusing on upstream and downstream investments including expanding its crude oil production capacity to 13 million barrels per day (mmbpd) by 2027 and boosting gas production by more than 50% by 2030 in addition to the long-term goal of up to 4 mmbpd liquids-to-chemicals all of which requires continuous capex.

Petrochemical industry

The petrochemical industry will be key to delivering Vision 2030. Despite the softer macroeconomic outlook feedstock availability and affordability should help Saudi chemical producers mitigate some of the challenges of the inflationary and volatile operating environment. Investment in the domestic petrochemical sector is expected to ramp up.

Tourism

Tourism has already received a substantial boost via aviation developments as well as projects intended to help attract 100 million visitors per year by 2030 such as the Red Sea Project which envisages luxury hotels marinas and an airport.

As it is one of the key focuses of Vision 2030 and a main non-oil growth driver tourism will provide investment opportunities for private local or international investors.

Saudi Arabia aims to attract 100 million visitors per year by 2030 of which about a half to Riyadh and including 30 million religious visitors (from eight million currently). The aim is for tourism to contribute 10% of GDP (about 3% currently) and create jobs for young Saudis. The country's modernisation efforts and investments in mega projects for tourism and entertainment--Neom Red Sea Project Qiddiya--should attract more international visitors.

The government aims to attract private investors to fund tourism developments. Saudi Arabia established a Tourism Development Fund in 2020 with $4 billion in capital with a mandate to facilitate private investors' access to investment opportunities by providing funding to projects.

Hospitality infrastructure will be mostly funded by local and foreign private investors with plans to add 500000 hotel rooms by 2030 (around 62000 branded hotels keys currently) the bulk of which will be in the mega projects. Material investments in the transport segment will create infrastructure to enhance travel with proceeds from both public and private funds.

Telecommunications

Digital infrastructure developed by telcos will be at the heart of investments including high speed broadband 5G and a strategic digital hub (the Mena Hub).

The Saudi telecommunications market is dominated by three players and is key to Vision 2030. The operators with Saudi Telecom Co. (stc) as market leader will help the country meet its Vision 2030 objectives and will also benefit from its expected economic growth.

For the economy to achieve a successful digital transformation advanced infrastructure and digital skills are required. To scale up the digital economy 5G network and broadband development will continue. This will boost Saudi Arabia's e-commerce digital banking and financial services online education and health care sectors as well as other online services such as e-government.

Food and agriculture

Investments in the food and agriculture sectors aim to increase local production and adopt modern farming techniques. Despite strong demand and price increases profitability in these sectors remains lower than before the pandemic with rising input costs obscuring the path to recovery.

Food security is a key area of diversification given that the population is 33 million and growing and about 80% of food is currently imported. Significant innovation and the adoption of new technology is under way.

Healthcare

The Ministry of Health will soon assume a regulatory role with the private sector expected to play a more important part in developing health care attracting more than $65 billion in investments.

Under Vision 2030 the government has committed to 88% of the population being covered by inclusive health services by 2025.

Vision 2030 and production localisation should support steady growth in other health care subsectors. The pharmaceuticals market is one of the largest in Mena and is expected to reach $10.7 billion by 2023 from $6.0 billion in 2018. Manufacturing localisation grew steadily to 40% in 2020 from 20% in 2016 and S&P expects government incentives will continue to attract investments.

Utilities

Utilities face the mammoth task of reducing Saudi Arabia's fossil fuel dependency and meeting 70% of energy needs from renewables by 2030. “We expect more public-private partnerships (PPPs) and significant investments in the country's grids” S&P said.

By 2030 Saudi Arabia targets to generate half its power via green assets and the other half from gas. To rapidly decrease its reliance on fossil fuels the government has initiated the early decommissioning of some oil-fired power and water plants.

Seawater reverse osmosis installed capacity is expected to increase by more than five million cubic metres per day by 2026. Saudi Arabia is also working on becoming a major supplier of hydrogen worldwide to diversify away from oil exports.

A consortium comprising ACWA Power Air Products and Neom (a PIF affiliate) expects to close the $5 billion NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Q4 2022. It will be the world's largest commercial hydrogen facility entirely powered by wind and solar energy and will aim to export green ammonia.

Work crews have been excavating the site since it was discovered last January during preparations for an Egyptian-funded housing project.

Hiyam al-Bitar a researcher from the Hamas-run Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism said a total of 63 graves have been identified and that a set of bones and artifacts from one tomb was dated back to the second century.

She said the ministry is working with a team of French experts to learn more about the site. On Sunday workers sifted through the soil and removed piles of dirt in wheelbarrows.

Although the ancient cemetery is now blocked off from the public construction on the housing project has continued and the site is surrounded by apartment buildings. Local media reported looting when the site was first discovered with people using donkey-drawn carts to haul away items like a covered casket and inscribed bricks.

Gaza a coastal enclave home to more than 2 million people is known for its rich history stemming from its location on ancient trade routes between Egypt and the Levant. But Israeli occupation a blockade conflicts and rapid urban growth in the crowded narrow territory are among the reasons most of Gaza’s archeological treasures have not been protected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNvZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTEvZGlzY292ZXJ5LWJhci1oYXMtYS1sb3QtdG8tZGlzY292ZXItaXRzLXlvdXItYnVzaW5lc3Mv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2hpY29lci5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xMS9kaXNjb3ZlcnktYmFyLWhhcy1hLWxvdC10by1kaXNjb3Zlci1pdHMteW91ci1idXNpbmVzcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discovery Bar has a lot to discover | It’s Your Business,"CHICO — When I first walked into the new Discovery Bar on Wednesday my first thought was how big it was.

From the parking lot it doesn’t look very sizeable but when I walked through the front door I was struck by how much space and light there is. It’s a wonderful space. Then I noticed the beautiful wood bar which looks like something out of the 1950s. I loved the grey leather bar stools too and I noticed what looked like a stackable serving tray thing made out of records placed on one of the small tables in the lounge.

I was greeted by a guy who was there with a group of guys and then I met the bartender Luke Haight and the owner Matt Hunter who were both very friendly and accommodating.

Hunter gave me a tour before we sat down for the interview. There’s a lounge-y type area right next to the bar with furniture and a television and a huge patio which Hunter plans to hold events in the dining area and a big room designated for private parties. He plans to place pinball and other fun games in the private area and wants to hold theme nights such as game night trivia and comedy. He also plans to have games playing on the televisions. The restaurant can seat around 100 people.

Hunter was a chef for many years and was the co-founder of Federation Brewing in Oakland. He was working on getting a business going in Chico for awhile. Both Hunter and his wife graduated from Chico State and Hunter lived in Chico for 10 years. Six years ago he and his wife moved back to Chico and started their family. They also have family in town which was one of the reasons they moved back.

Hunter’s signature dish is shrimp and grits and a disco chicken sandwich which is modeled after a Nashville hot chicken sandwich. Hunter has a bit of a southern and Caribbean theme going on with his food. He also serves Haitian slaw called pickliz and remoulade on a potato bun.

“I’ve invented the recipes and they include things I’ve made along the way” Hunter said. “I’ve always loved cooking with big bold flavors.”

The hamburger on the menu is a smash burger which is like a “kicked up” version of a Big Mac with Hunter’s own spread lettuce onions and pickles. His foggy noodles are “surprisingly popular.”

Hunter said his food is a melting pot of cuisine from the South and Caribbean influences along with South America and French influences. Hunter did some catering in the past and is the main chef at Discovery.

Hunter is currently hiring bartenders and cooks. If interested in applying visit the website at discoverybarchico.com. He currently has a staff of 12 but hopes to eventually have a large full staff.

Hunter chose the location for the bar and restaurant because he was “drawn to it over the years” and looked for a place with a patio and good parking.

Hunter’s signature drink is a coquito. It’s made with white rum sweetened condensed milk coconut cinnamon nutmeg and vanilla.

“The food is always good and you can meet up with friends and hang out in the lounge” he said. “It’s a family-friendly place. It’s a spot you can feel comfortable in and enjoy good affordable food and drinks that you can’t get other places.”

Hunter wants to keep things interesting by having special dinners and foray into beer pairings and whiskey tastings.

“I want exploration to to be theme” he said. “You can explore regions through cuisine such as Bavarian food and have cocktails which go along with the theme.”

The price point for the food is nothing over $20 except for the steak. Most of the entrees are around $14 or $15.

Hunter also wants to have the food prepped ahead of time so the food comes out quickly especially for people who pop in on a 30-minute lunch break. He plans to do some advertising in the future such as radio.

Discovery Bar is located at 250 Cohasset Road Suite 10. Currently the restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday but the hours will eventually change. The phone number is 399-0564. The bar can be found on Instagram under discoverybarchico and on Facebook under Discovery Bar.

Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains built with the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK). The focus of Cosmos is to streamline the building of custom blockchains by providing robust tooling via the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint consensus engine. A key feature of the Cosmos SDK is its native interoperability protocol. By prioritizing ease of building and interoperability the Cosmos ecosystem has observed massive growth over the past few years.

In 2019 the Cosmos Hub became the first blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK to launch and acted as the steward for the Cosmos ecosystem. By breaking down the barriers between blockchain economies allowing each blockchain to remain sovereign while trustlessly communicating with each other the Cosmos ecosystem becomes a so-called internet of blockchains.

There are three core pieces of Cosmos technology all of which are pioneered by the Cosmos Hub:

Tendermint consensus engine

Cosmos SDK

Interblockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)

The Cosmos design philosophy focuses on modularity and features are built in “modules” – one way to think about modules would be akin to blockchain lego pieces that can be tied together to create unique interactions.

A Cosmos blockchain is built of two layers: the consensus and application layers. The application layer is built with the Cosmos SDK which can plug into compatible consensus engines such as Tendermint. The IBC module is within the Cosmos SDK enabling blockchains to create connections for information transfer. These pieces together allow for unique blockchain applications to be built with granular control over lower level architecture as needed.

The Cosmos Hub plays an important role in bringing new features of the Cosmos SDK to market such as the launch of IBC in 2021 with the Cosmos Hub’s stargate upgrade.

To learn more about the Cosmos ecosystem check out our article on application-specific blockchains and the Cosmos ecosystem .

Tendermint

At the bottom of the tech stack sits the consensus layer which determines how nodes come to agreement on the actions occurring in a blockchain. Tendermint has been in development since 2014 and is one of the first Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms to be used in production. The Tendermint consensus engine is a package of consensus-related processes including the Tendermint Core consensus algorithm.

Tendermint Core is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) system allowing it to achieve consensus even when up to one-third of participating nodes go offline or act maliciously. Another powerful aspect is that it provides instant finality. In contrast to probabilistic finality observed in blockchains such as Ethereum once a transaction is included in a block on a Cosmos chain and added to the chain it is considered finalized and cannot be changed.

Tendermint Core supports applications written in any programming language and also supports either proof of stake or proof of authority protocols allowing for diverse blockchains to be built within Cosmos using Tendermint as their consensus layer.

For more information on the Cosmos tech stack see our article here .

Cosmos SDK

The Cosmos SDK framework allows developers to create customized blockchains using a series of modules. There are many modules pre-packaged in the Cosmos SDK but development teams are also able to customize provided modules to fit their use cases in the best way and even create their own modules. Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are often referred to as application-specific blockchains or appchains. By enabling developers to build blockchains with adjustable off-the-shelf solutions and the ability to create their own business logic more unique and granular protocol designs can be developed. With this modular design new features can be introduced more easily and adjusted while limiting dependencies on other pieces of the blockchain.

Application-specific blockchains ensure a higher level of sovereignty for the application’s stakeholders as the stakeholders of the application and those of the blockchain are the same. This streamlines the path toward application development as the app developers do not need to convince the stakeholders of the underlying chain to proceed.

Interblockchain Communication Protocol

The IBC Protocol allows for communication between blockchains with compatible consensus standards (e.g. Tendermint-based chains) without needing special permissions to do so.

IBC formalizes the light client mechanism allowing the blockchains to act as light clients on each others’ networks read each others’ states and interoperate without the need to function as full nodes or to store each others’ full states.

IBC is not just a token bridge it allows for arbitrary data to be transferred. Features can even be built into IBC such as interchain accounts and interchain security . By implementing IBC blockchains gain access not only to typical bridging actions between each other but also these more powerful tools for creating secure composable applications within the Cosmos ecosystem.",,,,,,

Although recent inflation has severely reduced its real-world purchasing power $1000 is still a lot of money for most people. And for investors looking to put that money to work the stock market offers reasonably priced equities now which can turn that money into significantly more over the long term.

Let's discuss two ideas: cigarette maker Altria Group (MO 0.43%) and discount retailer Dollar General (DG 0.06%). Both could make excellent buys today.



Altria Group

Up 5% in the trailing 12 months Altria's stock has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 which has dropped roughly 15% in the same period. The large-cap tobacco company can continue to hold its own because of its stable business model and the shedding of risks related to its investment in vaping start-up Juul Labs.

In 2018 Altria paid $12.8 billion to acquire a 35% stake in Juul which was valued at $38 billion at the time. Since then the investment has been a drag on Altria's performance as Juul was hit by a series of regulatory headwinds culminating in its products being banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (although that decision is currently suspended pending an appeal). The good news is that Juul-related headwinds are likely already baked into Altria's stock price and investors can finally move on.

As of June 30 Altria has written down its Juul stake by 96.5% to $450 million. And in September it ended its noncompete agreement with Juul amid plans to build its own portfolio of e-vapor products -- a market opportunity projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% to $42.9 billion by 2028 according to market research group Facts & Factors. In the meantime Altria's traditional tobacco business remains a stable and profitable foundation.

Management expects full-year earnings per share to grow by 4.5% to 6% (to between $4.81 and $4.89). And the company returns value to shareholders through a generous dividend yielding 8%. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 9.6 the shares are cheaper than the S&P 500 average of 21.

Dollar General

Up 12% over the last 12 months Dollar General stock is another excellent pick for investors who want to duck the bear market. The company's discount business model makes it recession resistant. And a reasonable valuation could position it for continued success.

According to an October poll of economists conducted by Bloomberg 60% expect the U.S. economy to enter a recession in the next 12 months. For most companies an economic slowdown would be bad news because it erodes consumer purchasing power. But Dollar General thrives in these situations because it presents people with lower-priced alternatives to pricier big-box retailers.

But Dollar General doesn't necessarily need a recession to grow. Third-quarter net sales jumped $11.1% to $9.5 billion as the company continues to enjoy healthy same-store-sales growth and location expansion -- adding 734 new stores to bring its total to 18818. Dollar General is also becoming increasingly popular with higher earners. According to CEO Todd Vasos it has started attracting more customers earning six-figure salaries looking to save money as inflation pushes up the cost of living.

With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19.8 Dollar General is only slightly cheaper than the S&P 500 average. But the company looks like a good deal considering how well-positioned it is to handle the current macroeconomic challenges.

Which company is best for you?

Dollar General and Altria are both excellent picks for value investors who want to protect their portfolios against challenges like recession and inflation but they serve slightly different investment strategies. With its lower valuation and massive dividend Altria is the more defensive option. Dollar General stock is more expensive but probably has more long-term growth potential.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjcmcuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTEvc3RvcmUtY2xvc3VyZS1sZWF2ZXMtb25seS0yLWJlbi1mcmFua2xpbnMtaW93YS_SAV5odHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3JnLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzExL3N0b3JlLWNsb3N1cmUtbGVhdmVzLW9ubHktMi1iZW4tZnJhbmtsaW5zLWlvd2EvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Store closure leaves only 2 Ben Franklins in Iowa,"WINTERSET Iowa (AP) — Life at the corner of John Wayne Drive and West Court Avenue will change for the first time in 83 years when the owners of Winterset’s Ben Franklin variety store retire five days before Christmas.

The store opened there in 1939. Winterset High School sweethearts Dave and Judy Trask both 76 bought the store in 1978 and have spent 44 of their 56 years of marriage tending to it.

Now they want to travel and most of all spend time with their four grandchildren. So their store will become one more casualty among a dying breed.

Ben Franklin stores used to dot town squares and main streets across the country. In their heyday in the 1970s there were 2500 stores nationwide and more than 100 in Iowa. Some were in cities but most were in small towns. When the Trasks close their store Dec. 20 just two of the venerable five-and-dime stores will be left in the Hawkeye State.

“There comes a time...” said Dave Trask standing behind a watch repair stand near the front of the store holding his wife’s hand recently.

“It’s kind of like when you graduate high school and go to college” Judy Trask told the Des Moines Register.

Ben Franklin stores claim to be the nation’s second-oldest franchise behind only Singer Sewing Machine retailers. Founded in 1877 they became America’s local place to get candy curtains and thousands of other items.

At the start of the year Ben Franklin stores were still open in Winterset Eagle Grove Nevada and Sheldon. Like the Trasks Nevada Owner Fred Samuelson retired when he closed his store Nov. 23.

“In the 1950s they were just growing” Dave Trask said. “Almost every county seat had a Ben Franklin.”

The watch repair bench behind Dave Trask used to sit a few feet to his left. His father owned a watch repair business that opened in 1956 on the town square next to the existing Ben Franklin store. When the Trasks later bought the Ben Franklin and a business that had moved into his father’s old space they knocked out a wall and put their craft department in the old watch repair shop.

“I got a picture of myself washing the window out there when I was 11” Dave Trask said. “Got another one last year.”

Judy Trask grew up on a farm near Winterset. Her husband grew up five blocks east of their store. When they were 14 years old Dave Trask played the drums in the Winterset High marching band. Judy played saxophone.

“We like to say we caught each other’s eyes across the room” Judy Trask said.

After attending the University of Iowa and working for a retailer in Iowa City Dave Trask was drafted into the Army. He served two years in the Army Signal Corps and repaired radio-relay equipment for a year in Vietnam. In 1978 they bought the Ben Franklin in Winterset and moved from Fairfield where they owned a store.

They had a son who now teaches in Milwaukee. Their daughter works at a website design business in Des Moines. Like countless other Ben Franklin store owners they raised their kids in the store.

“We’re business owners instead of managers” Dave Trask said. “We’ve spent most of our lives here.”

Today two other families own the remaining Ben Franklin stores in Iowa.

Phil Warnke 63 and his wife Lori own the Sheldon store. Warnke’s wife grew up in Hospers. He grew up in Sandborn. For a time they lived in Sioux City but 32 years ago they wanted to be closer to their families. So they bought the Ben Franklin that in some form has been in Sheldon since 1890 Warnke said.

“This is home. This is where we belong” Warnke said. “It’s like we’ve been on vacation for 32 years because we’re right where we need to be.”

Jason Gochanour grew up working in a Ben Franklin store his father Alan owned in Tama. Over the years the Gochanours owned Ben Franklin stores in Waterloo and a store at the Park Fair Mall in Des Moines.

Today the Gochanours own the Ben Franklin store in Eagle Grove. They also own Larson’s Mercantile variety store in Clear Lake a former Ben Franklin whose previous owner changed the store’s name.

Ben Franklins may be fading but the name still carries cache. Owners that stick with the name do it because they say people there are loyal to the brand.

“That’s what the town has identified us to be for all these years” Warnke said. “Even if we changed it to something else they would’ve always said ‘the old Ben Franklin store.’”

People from across the country traveling through Winterset will stop at the store just to see a Ben Franklin still in business said the Trasks and their employees.

“They come in and say it’s a step back in time” Dave Trask said.

On a recent Wednesday morning customers filed steadily into the Trasks’ Ben Franklin in Winterset. Neon blue and yellow signs in the windows advertised “RETIREMENT SALE” “LIQUIDATION” and ‘EVERYTHING MUST GO.”

Ben Franklin stores are not Walmart. Products cost owners more so prices are higher. The stores do not have every product larger retailers have but they do have a little bit of everything.

In one corner sits a copier where people can make photocopies. In another customers can cut curtain rods to size. Store employees will make keys and Dave Trask will fix watches using the same watch repair bench where his father once repaired watches.

“One of the lessons we learned early on was that you need to have a ‘power department’ or something that you’re better than anybody else at” Dave Trask said.

Ben Franklin separates itself from its competitors by bringing hard-to-find items into rural areas like toys said Warnke from Sheldon. Warnke’s store offers custom photo framing in its art gallery. Gochanour’s store in Eagle Grove sells Hallmark products.

“We’re able to provide products and services that wouldn’t normally be available in a town our size” Warnke said.

Winterset’s “power department” is its craft section. Hundreds of bundles of fabric in a rainbow of colors line the walls and aisles of the Winterset store from floor to ceiling. In one pile sits fabric covered in Easter Eggs. On another wall hangs fabric with an Apollo Astronaut bouncing on the moon’s surface.

Judy Trask loves helping customers make quilts from things they find after cleaning houses.

“That’s what I’m going to miss the most” Judy Trask said. “That was just so cool to work with them find the fabric that goes with it draw it on a piece of paper and sometimes give them cutting instructions.”

Walmart co-founders Sam and Bud Walton operated 15 Ben Franklin stores in Missouri and Arkansas in the 1940s 1950s and 1960s. The Waltons took their knowledge from the chain founded Walmart in 1962 and then went to the same rural areas that Ben Franklin served.

“Mr. Walton quite honestly had a pretty good marketing plan. He stayed away from the urban areas initially and went into the rural market” then Ben Franklin franchising director John Ptacek told the Des Moines Register in 2002. “That’s the single biggest factor that has done away with the downtown Ben Franklin stores.”

Today Dollar General is the biggest threat to the few remaining Ben Franklin stores Gochanour said. A building spree that started in 2014 began an expansion plan to rural areas similar to Walmart’s. But Dollar General goes into rural markets far too small to support Walmarts.

Because of that Dollar General got a reputation for driving local retailers and grocers out of business.

“It’s such a small footprint that they can put a store anywhere and they do” Gochanour said of Dollar General. “They’re such a large corporation. Their margins are a lot better than us.”

It’s not easy for remaining stores to stay in business. The original Ben Franklin chain went bankrupt in 1996. Wisconsin-based Promotions Unlimited licensed the name until it too went bankrupt in 2017 but it provided no corporate support Gochanour and Dave Trask said. Now a Hawaii entity licenses the name for $1800 per year but still provides no corporate support.

So the stores operate independently; cobbling together their merchandise selections from various distributors. Dave and Judy Trask source many of their products from Variety Distributors in Harlan.

“(Ben Franklin stores) just could not generate enough volume out of the smaller stores to make it worthwhile” Dave Trask said.

Shelves in the back of the Trasks’ store sit empty startling signs of their pending retirement. Already they sold about three-fourths of their remaining inventory. Now they are selling everything including the garland once used to decorate the store at Christmastime.

“We haven’t seen this since we moved in” Judy Trask said. “My urge to fill them back up is still there.”

“We wanted everything full. The walls were covered with merchandise all the way to the top. This is an unusual feeling” Dave Trask said.

For years the Trasks have been floating the idea of retiring said Juanita Fettkether who spent 36 years working at Ben Franklin and Terri Lenig 61 who is in her 10th year working there.

Dave and Judy Trask only arrived at their decision to retire when they recently got an offer to buy the building that they could not refuse.

“It wasn’t a surprise” Lenig said.

“He says it’s going to be a good fit” Fettkether said.

Another retail store will take the place of Ben Franklin. Lenig may continue working there. Fettkether is not sure what is next for her. At age 70 she still wants to work part-time to stay busy.

“It’s been my home away from home”Fettkether said.

Dave Trask will not say what store will take the place of Ben Franklin but his employees have faith it will be good for them and Winterset.

“He wouldn’t sell it to just anybody” Lenig said.

For the first time since they bought the store Judy and Dave Trask will not work on Christmas Eve. Usually they cook breakfast for their employees work until 3 p.m. and reminisce with them during the day.

With about two weeks left in business Judy Trask felt excited about retirement but said this Christmas will feel strange.

“That will be very hard” Judy Trask said. “It will be different.”

Representatives from RWE Design Build said the applicant — Gregory O’Brien of O’Brien Veterinary Group — plans to use the former Family Video at 369 136th Ave. as an Emergency Veterinary Care Center.

The clinic will save local residents from making the drive to Grand Rapids for emergency care. The company has had success converting former Family Videos into clinics in the past.

The new location will be the group's fourth in the region.

Deana Scheidt director of business development for Emergency Veterinary Care Center said local pet owners currently drive to Grand Rapids or Kalamazoo for all-hours care.

“In an emergency situation with your pet that could potentially mean the life of that pet” Scheidt said.

Scheidt said primary care veterinary offices have been overwhelmed and some no longer offer after-hours care.

Nicole Sharp sales representative at MWI Animal Health travels across the area visiting local clinics. She echoed the sentiment that a facility like this is needed in Holland.

“I see a huge need to have an emergency clinic here along the lakeshore” Sharp said. “As a pet owner I have to drive to Grand Rapids to clinics there and when you do that you're losing a lot of time with that pet and could have potentially saved their life if you could go to someplace local.”

The plan is the second proposal to fill a former Family Video in the Holland area in the past month. In mid-November the Holland Planning Commission heard a site plan request to turn the former Family Video at 536 W. 17th St. into a new Dollar General including a 1548-square-foot addition to the existing building.

The commission ultimately denied approval of the site plan and an additional waiver for decreased window space asking developers to address concerns and submit a new plan.

Three weeks ago the couple got married they’d bought a house and were settling into the married lifestyle as a pair excited about what God would bring in the future. For those who’ve been married for some time it’s hard to recall that excitement of the first thoughts of children a family and a lifetime of love together. It’s really hard to understand why God sometimes decides to test us with the hard times when we’re so young just getting off the starting line. Still tragedy is what has happened to Austin and Brantley as they now depend on faith in the Creator to bring them through the sickness when they’ve been married such a short time.





Austin works for a company named Pike. Pike subcontracts to companies like Dominion Energy that replaces or repairs worn out transmission lines that carry electricity to our communities and homes. Brantley is a 2nd grade schoolteacher who works for Lexington County School District 4 at Sandhills Primary School just outside of Swansea. Together the couple were financially stable enough to be looking forward to starting a family and supporting themselves without help from others. They certainly were not wealthy you might say that through their own hard work they were on their way to becoming a typical American middle-class family. That was until a week ago when a freak accident put Austin in ICU with a serious brain injury and Brantley worrying and praying that God would lead her as she contemplated living with a husband whose future was certainly not clear anymore.





One thing that Austin enjoyed was go cart racing. He had a cart of his own and it thrilled him to have Brantley his beautiful new wife in the stands cheering him on as he circled the track. It was a great way for the young newlyweds to enjoy a weekend evening before returning home together. This is just what Austin and Brantley were doing when he was struck down by an accident that was so strange that it really is hard to believe.





Austin was racing Saturday night at a race at the Hwy. 178 Speedway between Pelion and Poole’s Mill. He had competed in his class however a crash put him out of the running and the race. As the track was cleared and the race restarted Austin and some friends were standing off track watching the restarted race. At some point a 5-pound weight that was on one of the carts circling the track came loose and launched into the air crossing the track and entering the stands. In the process the weight hit Austin in the head striking him down where he stood. The piece finally struck a light pole leaving a large indention in it before coming to a stop.





It only took a few seconds for the friends who got to Austin first to realize how bad he was hurt. The onsite ambulance crew looked at him and they knew right away that Austin needed to get to a hospital with a trauma center and the staff to deal with a serious brain injury. He was quickly transported to the Level 1 Trauma Center at Prisma’s Palmetto Health Richland’s campus in Columbia. There the trauma team began to work on Austin realizing how critical his condition was.

Austin was quickly put on a ventilator to help him breath. Because bones that were broken in his head when he was hit were pressing on his brain an emergency craniotomy to relieve that pressure was done. As doctors looked further the found that the weight had broken almost every bone in his face. When they had done everything they could for Austin in the Trauma Bay of the Emergency Department he was moved to ICU where he remains to this day. Brantley family friends and co-workers all gathered to pray for Austin. Everyone is also praying for grace and strength as Brantley goes through this journey with her husband. As much as any current need they have people close to Austin have requested that the community join them in prayer for his healing and recovery.

As most will understand there are a great deal of expenses associated with what Austin and Brantley are going through. Doctors have said that Austin will have to undergo at least one more brain surgery. Once he’s stable and out of ICU he will be transferred to a head trauma rehab facility which means he’ll be moved out of the Midlands and maybe even out of state. The family is praying that they’ll be able to find a place for him at MUSC in Charleston the closest facility to their home.





Currently the family has gotten a P.O. box in Gaston where you can send Get Well cards and words of encouragement. That address is P.O. Box 84 - Gaston SC 29053. If God has blessed you in 2022 please consider blessing Austin and Brantley with any amount you can spare. Anyone can send cards or monitory donations to that box. They’ve also set up a GoFundMe account if you feel more comfortable donating that way. It can be found at https://www.gofundme.com/f/4fdhfh-cover-medical-bills-and-monthly-bills?qid=f17b1719e1fbfc74d0f6eefc69e52930.





Fish Hatchery Road Church of God has already put together a fundraiser for Austin and Brantley. It will be held on both December 17th and 18th. On Saturday December 17th there will be a BBQ with plates being sold at T’s Country Bar which is located at 4922 US Hwy 321 South Gaston SC 29053. This event starts at noon. The BBQ plates are $15.00 each and include the meat and fixings. There will be live music and a raffle as well. On Sunday December 18 2022 there will be a Gospel Singing and Bake Sale at the church. That’s located at 3249 Fish Hatchery Road Gaston SC 29053. This will begin at 1 p.m. but you could also come early for church. It would be a wonderful time to join others in corporate prayer for Austin.





If you can’t help in any way financially you can pray. Even if you aren’t in the habit of praying regularly try it now. You don’t have to get on your knees close your eyes or fold your hands. Just speak to God and ask that he help in Austin’s healing and ask for strength for Brantley and the family. You could be amazed how this may make you feel. No matter what you’d be doing something and something is always better than nothing.





This is my daughter Brantley Hill Lombr husband. They were just married 3 weeks ago. Austin Lombr was at 178 Speedway on Saturday night watching a go kart race when a 5lb weight from a cart flew off into the crowd and unfortunately he was struck in the head. Austin suffered a critical head injury. He is in Prisma trauma center in the ICU on a ventilator fighting for life. He had to have an emergency craniotomy ￼surgery due to a fractured skull that was pressing into his brain. The impact of the hit was so severe that it broke basically all the bones in his face as well. Austin has a very long road of recovery ahead of him. These next few days are very critical and we are asking for prayers.

East Lyme – The end of an era on Main Street is opening up new possibilities as a team of Ivy League planners and architects helps sharpen the focus on the future of the popular downtown-with-a-view.

The owners of Niantic Cinema this week announced the closure of the shoreline mainstay after 70 years. Across the street the former police station has been vacant since the force moved three miles down the road to a new public safety hub early this year.

The Yale Urban Design Workshop made up predominantly of graduate students supervised by faculty from the School of Architecture was hired several months ago for $30000 by the Niantic Main Street downtown revitalization group. The goal is to create a framework for development much like the group did in the late 1990s with a report that laid the foundation for a quarter century of growth.

A cornerstone of efforts back then was the recommended purchase by the town of a Mobil gas station and its subsequent transformation into a park that frames sweeping vistas of Niantic Bay.

The Yale academics now are familiarizing themselves with the current landscape where a mural over the marquee of the shuttered cinema commands the eye with a sad-faced silhouette of Charlie Chaplin evoking the mask of tragedy.

Andrei Harwell director of the Yale design group lamented the loss of the cinema but was philosophical about the timing.

“I wouldn't say it's fortuitous but it’s not bad timing I guess that there appear to be some new opportunities opening up” he said.

Harwell is also an architect urban designer and Senior Critic at the Yale School of Architecture.

The Yale urban design group spent the last four months on background research and talks with those who live and work in the area according to Harwell.

The collaboration with Niantic Main Street is funded through federal pandemic-relief dollars allocated to the town for purposes including economic development.

Harwell’s team will be meeting virtually with Niantic Main Street steering committee members later this month to gauge their thoughts on the best use for the old police station and the cinema building.

He said the next step is putting together designs to illustrate the different options.

“It’s not really up to us to make the decisions of course” Harwell said. “It’s up to folks in Niantic to do that. All we’re really doing is trying to show them what the alternatives might look like.”

For Niantic Cinema owner George Mitchell the future is wide open.

“We’re thinking about so many things” he said. “Everything from community theater to tearing the whole thing down and putting something completely different there. That’s the range.”

Mitchell owns about a half dozen other downtown properties with several buildings on each one. Included is the Niantic Village Shopping Center which has retail space offices and restaurants on the first floor and apartments on the upper level.

He said there are no decisions yet but a lot of ideas.

“People are calling and telling us what we should do” he said.

The businessman described himself as most interested in hearing what advisors from the Yale Urban Design Workshop recommend.

“That’s what we’re waiting for” Mitchell said.

Former police headquarters

Town officials also await the urban planners’ guidance when it comes to the police station leased for years from Millstone Power Station owner Dominion Energy. First Selectman Kevin Seery said the utility company is willing to part with the property for $1 but the Board of Selectman doesn’t want to move forward until they have a better idea what it could be used for and how much it might cost to remediate the site.

The police dumped their moldy old home in favor of the $7.4 million public safety building that also includes dispatch emergency operations a lockup area for prisoners and the fire marshal’s office. The vacant Main Street building now largely devoid of furnishings has been used for random purposes like narcotics training for the regional police canine unit and as a stop along Niantic Main Street’s Holiday Stroll.

The first selectman said Dominion agreed to put the sale on hold “for a few months” while the downtown revitalization group and the Yale experts investigate the options.

“Obviously the building has to go” Seery said. “It has asbestos it has mold it has lead paint. The cost of repurposing or renovating that building would be astronomical. So that’s not an option.”

Seery said he’s met with one unnamed company that uses virtual “portals” to unite different cities around the globe including two so far in Lithuania and Poland.

The website for a company matching that description said it’s seeking participation from cities and towns with public spaces such as parks that are suitable host sites for the real-time video images ensconced in looming circular sculptures where art meets technology. The feed provides a real-time glimpse of unedited video from rotating locations.

Harwell said other ideas for the site include a range of public and private uses from a visitor’s center with restrooms to a restaurant to shops below and apartments above.

Planning for the future of the property in a way that acknowledges possible contamination could also put the town in a better position to receive state Brownfield grants for remediation according to Harwell.

He anticipated being able to advise the downtown revitalization group and public officials on possibilities for the two key sites as early as next month even though work will be ongoing through the spring.

“The completion of the study means the production of the report but along the way we’ll be producing alternatives we’ll share over time” he said.

Niantic Main Street Vice President Sue Kumro said the collaboration between her group and the Yale experts is in its “early infancy stages” with more opportunities for public input to come over the next six months or so.

The most pressing needs in her view revolve around public restroom facilities and more parking with space for special events and farmers markets.

“I just think we need a welcoming center in Niantic” she said. “That’s what Niantic is about.”

When Brynne Flowers was hired to help with a couple’s stately Tudor in Salt Lake City’s Yalecrest neighborhood the top-to-bottom restoration had already wrapped up. The owner of design studio John Martine came on board for a different reason: to imagine the interiors of a brand-new modern addition.

Her clients—a stylist and real-estate investor with three children ages 11 8 and 6—had spent years returning the original structure to its former glory. “The wife actually grew up two houses down” says Flowers. “They were living in Los Angeles when this home came up for sale. It was not in great condition but she convinced her husband to buy it.” Ultimately though there were certain things the choppy 100-year-old floor plan simply could not provide—chiefly an open kitchen and indoor-outdoor space for hosting guests. “There was a tiny closed-off room of a kitchen at the back of the house and none of the rooms opened to the backyard” Flowers recalls. Enter the two-story extension a collaboration between Flowers and Lloyd Architects.

Its first floor now functions as a great room combining an informal dining nook sleek kitchen and TV room which connects to a pool. On the second floor they added two bedrooms and a shared bath the domain of the couple’s sons. Here Flowers breaks down how it all came together.

Dusk II Rug Beni.

The green- black- and brown-flecked terrazzo a jumping-off point for the whole design was the clients’ idea. Once sealed properly the material is practically indestructible (it’s water- and stain-resistant) aka perfect for indoor-outdoor living. “The kids are watching TV then they’re jumping in the pool then they’re on the trampoline” says Flowers. Now the homeowners can open the floor-to-ceiling accordion windows without stressing out about guests—or more likely their kids—tracking mud inside. Bonus: Sealants can also make the surface less slippery which is key when your floors are pool adjacent.

No One Can Ever Have Enough Closed Storage

With three kids the clients wanted to get control of the inevitable clutter. In the kitchen Flowers took their request for closed cabinetry one step further with cupboards all the way to the ceiling (yes that soffit above the white oak upper cabinets is actually more storage!) an integrated cooktop and flush panel fridge. As for the matte black fronts? “We loved how the color makes the cabinetry recede” Flowers explains. “It helps hide everything away.”

Avoid a Kiddie Kids’ Bathroom

It bears repeating: Your children are going to grow up one day. And unlike the purple paint you let them pick for their bedroom walls the tile in their bathroom is not a simple swap. In the boys’ bath on the second floor of the addition Flowers created a playful but still sophisticated stripe using two different sizes of cement tiles. “This doesn’t necessarily have to be a kid’s bathroom” she points out.

Capitalize on Cool Architecture

Montrose Dining Chairs Lawson-Fenning; Good Times Dining Table Blu Dot.

The architects lined most of the soaring addition’s perimeter with double-height windows to match. But there was a strip of wall next to the dining area that wasn’t encased in glass. Flowers and her clients seized the opportunity to turn the blank space into a two-story bookshelf complete with a library ladder. In other words a stylist’s dream spot. “She is eclectic and has a lot of tchotchkes which makes the shelf so much fun” the designer says. Below Flowers designed a hutch from the same white oak as the upper cabinets to store entertaining essentials that don’t have a home in the formal dining room.

Don’t Get Hung Up on Reinventing History

The Tudor before. Courtesy of John Martine

Instead of clinging to a classic Tudor sensibility the couple wanted the new addition to feel well new. “Their approach was not to make the addition fit with the rest of the house because they were like ‘It’s never gonna fit with the rest of the house!’” Flowers explains. This gave the designer room to play with modern rounded silhouettes for everything from the counter stools to the dining table and chairs.

The palette was another way to experiment. In the lounge area it’s all about tones from nature. Florals were incorporated via a mix of patterns from the stripy denim blue sofa to the speckled tan and navy wool rug. One trick the designer used to bring the home’s past and present together: choosing a unifying hue. The wife’s favorite color green was already sprinkled throughout the original house so it felt just right in a space next to the lush backyard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbXVzdHNoYXJlbmV3cy5jb20vZGlydHktY3V0dGVyLWRvbWlub3MtcGl6emEv0gE5aHR0cHM6Ly9tdXN0c2hhcmVuZXdzLmNvbS9kaXJ0eS1jdXR0ZXItZG9taW5vcy1waXp6YS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man Gets Dirty Cutter With Domino’s Pizza Order Eatery Apologises For Blunder,"Malaysian Man Finds Dirty Cutter With Domino’s Pizza Order

UPDATE (12 Dec): Domino’s Pizza in Malaysia has reposted their apology. You can find their full statement below.

–

Rainy days often compel us to stay home and order in so we can enjoy a cosy time at home instead of fumbling with our umbrellas.

Unfortunately a man in Malaysia received an unintended gift when he chose to do so.

When his food delivery from Domino’s Pizza arrived he was surprised to find a dirty pizza cutter in his order.

The eatery has since apologised for the incident offering to personally rectify the issue with the customer.

Man finds dirty cutter in Domino’s Pizza order

The man posted details of the incident to Twitter which occurred on 10 Dec.

While the order had arrived promptly despite the bad weather a surprise gift came in the form of a cutter.

Even more alarmingly it was unclean with a strand of hair sticking to its handle.

The post has since become viral with many expressing amusement at the sight. After all it’s not every day that customers receive a cutter with their pizza order.

Some noted that the OP should appreciate his gift since it was free.

One user even suggested that it could be part of a promotion saying “Promo code: SELFPOTONG”.

Others called out the eatery for its poor hygiene especially as the handle was visibly filthy.

In response multiple users came to the restaurant’s defence stating that the employees may have been overworked.

Eatery apologises for error

Fortunately for the OP the eatery soon acknowledged their mistake.

The Twitter account for Domino’s Pizza in Malaysia responded to the tweet apologising for sending the cutter along with the pizza.

While their initial tweet has since been deleted shortly after MS News read it they expressed that it was never their intention to deliver such an experience.

They also asked the OP to reach out to them so that they could handle the matter personally.

On 11 Dec Domino’s Pizza in Malaysia reposted their apology stating that they are looking into the matter.

“This is definitely not the standard that we uphold at our stores” the eatery said.

However now her impersonator is making headlines after her video is going viral on social media.

In the viral video a woman disguises herself as ‘Dilbar’ singer Kakkar and orders pizza from Domino’s but not in a way you would have thought. She ordered a pizza with ‘extra cheese’ while singing one of her songs but there’s a twist. Scroll down to know more.

When the Domino’s executive introduced himself and asked for her order the woman disguised as Neha Kakkar replies “Tumko orders pasand hai mjhko orders me pizza.” To this the executive says “Hello ma’am.” The woman then sings another parody song that goes like “Are bola maine baar baar baar baar baar baar mujhko pizza dede yaar yaar yaar yaar.”

The pizza executive then further inquires about what type of pizza she wants and she replies in a musical way “O pizza de de mujhko pizza… O wo pizza kaisa pizza jismein extra cheese na ho. Aisa pizza dede mjhko jismein thodi cheese toh ho.” Take a look at the hilarious video below:

Then on call: I’m a pizza” while another user wrote “And omg your notes hit exactly like Neha Kakkar’s.”

A third user then commented “We want more of these!”

The bank is among the top three European banks in this index.

Santander has featured in the index which assesses companies based on environmental social and governance criteria for the last 22 years.

Madrid 10 December 2022.

Santander has ranked among the world’s most sustainable banks in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 2022 and among the top three in Europe. The bank scored 83 points out of 100 placing it in the 98th percentile of all banks reviewed. Santander has featured on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past 22 years. This index an international corporate sustainability benchmark measures companies’ sustainable performance against economic environmental and social criteria.

The bank scored well in every category: economic (86) environmental (76) and social (83). It also highlighted areas where the bank has improved such as financial inclusion environmental and social reporting and climate strategy privacy protection and customer relationship management.

Santander has achieved good results in other similar benchmarks including MSCI Sustainalytics CDP ISS Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index FTSE4Good Index and Vigeo Eiris of Moodys.

The group ended the first half of the year as the world’s leader in renewable energy finance with over 2.4 billion euros in 33 funding transactions and a worldwide market share of 6.4% according to Infralogic’s ranking. In the past decade Santander has been a leading bank in renewable energy finance ranking among the top three in the world in number of transactions and the top five in funding volume.

In supporting the fight against climate change and the green transition Santander continues to make progress on its goal to reach net zero carbon emissions group-wide by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement. This year Santander outlined three new interim targets to decarbonize its portfolios by 2030: a 29% reduction in absolute emissions financed in the energy sector; a 33% reduction in emissions intensity in aviation sector; and a 32% reduction in emissions intensity in the steel sector. The targets add to those the Group had announced in February 2021 which include a 46% reduction in emissions financed in the in the power generation sector.

To achieve these targets Santander is focused on supporting customers in their green transition. Santander remains committed to earmarking €220 billion for green financing between 2019 and 2030 and has also set an intermediate target of €120 billion for 2025. As of September 2022 €78.7 billion had been mobilized.

Furthermore Santander has financially empowered more than nine million citizens by providing access to the banking system financial education and financing for individuals and SMEs with difficulties accessing credit. It has awarded more than 387000 scholarships and grantsand has helped more than six million people through its community investment programmes collaborating with NGOs and other social entities. The bank has been recently recognized as global Bank of the Year for Financial Inclusion by The Banker magazine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5uLWdyb3VwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLXdpdGgtb3ZlcnZpZXcvbm4tZ3JvdXAtcmVtYWlucy1pbmNsdWRlZC1pbi10aGUtZG93LWpvbmVzLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXdvcmxkLWluZGV4Lmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NN Group remains included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5uLWdyb3VwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLXdpdGgtb3ZlcnZpZXcvbm4tZ3JvdXAtcmVtYWlucy1pbmNsdWRlZC1pbi10aGUtZG93LWpvbmVzLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXdvcmxkLWluZGV4Lmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E4D44C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Company´s rating was higher than 99% of all the other companies evaluated from the Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets sector we being the only one of Latin American origin.

In this year´s evaluation we obtained outstanding results in aspects such as crisis and risk management business ethics environmental and social reporting attracting and retaining talent as well as corporate citizenship.

In addition to the aforementioned global ranking Grupo SURA has also been listed with the DJSI Emerging Markets and the MILA indices this year.

Grupo SURA is amongst the leading organizations included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Global Index (DJSI) for the last 12 consecutive years according to a report released this Friday by S&P. Previously this ratings agency reviewed the environmental social and economic performance of the SURA Business Group through the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).

Consequently this year Grupo SURA obtained a score of 76 points out of a total of 100 as a result of the individual scores obtained in the economic and governance (81) social (79) and environmental (55) dimensions. Thus the Company ranks in sixth place among the 16 best evaluated organizations listed with the DJSI this year from the Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets industry a sector from which 118 companies were invited to participate. Likewise Grupo SURA remains the only one of Latin American origin in the sector and continues to be listed with the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets and the MILA indices.

“The results of this evaluation allow us to identify opportunities and learnings in order to move ahead with our strategic objective of sustainable profitability through a well-balanced management of our financial social human and environmental capital. It also reflects the efforts made by our Suramericana and SURA Asset Management subsidiaries to incorporate best practices which at the end of the day allow us to build trust among the different stakeholders with whom we interact"" commented Gonzalo Pérez CEO of Grupo SURA.

Consequently this global evaluation evidences a responsible corporate performance and a coherent and comprehensive management of SURA's different lines of business which in turn has a favorable impact on society. On this occasion the implementation of international good practices in the following categories of the Corporate Sustainability Assessment received a particularly high rating:

Risk and crisis management

Business ethics.

Environmental and social reporting

Climate strategy.

Attracting and retaining talent.

Corporate Citizenship

Human rights

Learnings and opportunities

As for the social dimension our ability to attract and retain human talent was a favorable factor in the overall evaluation this backed by our efforts to protect jobs create opportunities for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 as well as provide first job training.

Also the Companies belonging to the SURA Business Group have directed their social investment efforts towards developing educational civic and cultural capabilities. Since our inception we in SURA have taken on a genuine and responsible commitment to building collective solutions to the challenges we face as a society. We constantly strive to strengthen human and institutional networks in order to build trust and work together towards common goals"" added María Mercedes Barrera Grupo SURA´s Head of Corporate Citizenship and the Director of the SURA Foundation in Colombia

As for the economic and governance dimension the Company excelled in business ethics thereby demonstrating our responsible corporate conduct as well as a coherent and comprehensive management of SURA's different lines of businesses which in turn has a favorable impact on society.

The main challenge for Grupo SURA in this dimension lies with two specific aspects of its corporate governance namely the seniority and the diversity of the members of its Board of Directors. This is due to the recent movements in this governing body in light of the change in the Company's shareholder structure. However the measures taken during this period evidence the application of principles rules and regulations as well as the governing bodies that make up the Company´s Ethics and Corporate Governance System.

As for the environmental dimension Grupo SURA was among the top 7% of the evaluated companies from our sector in this aspect with the best possible score in environmental reporting and a positive assessment of our climate strategy. The Company's greatest challenge with regard to this particular dimension is to move ahead with defining a path towards achieving carbon neutrality based on measuring our financed carbon footprint (currently underway) as well implementing investment restrictions and underwriting policies relating to coal oil and non-conventional gas.

A highly-rated investment portfolio with the DJSI

Finally it is worth noting that other companies that form part of Grupo SURA's strategic portfolio in its capacity as an investment manager were included in the 2022 global index. Grupo Nutresa is the best evaluated company and a leader in the food industry; Grupo Argos was ranked in second place in the Construction Materials industry where its cement subsidiary Cementos Argos obtained third place; and Bancolombia was ranked in 12th place out of a total of 25 banks included in this global index.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMTIxMTAwMDA4NNIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIxMjExMDAwMDg0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,24 Korean firms named to Dow Jones’ sustainability index,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.koreaherald.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /view.php?ud=20221211000084 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E4D7790>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMTIxMTAwMDA4NNIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIxMjExMDAwMDg0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJpZXMvT1VHQllFQTNaVkYzQkJUREUzTUdPQldDWEEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos from a boys varsity basketball game between Bridgeport and Midland Dow at SVSU during the Louis O'Neal ...,"11 / 28

A Riverview couple’s lawsuit against D.R. Horton filed December 6 is a typical case of discovered construction defects.

Gerardo and Koralys Rivera complain their home has an inadequately installed stucco system which was hard to detect and led to destruction. The lawsuit states “As a direct and proximate result of the construction defects and violations the Home has suffered damages not only to the exterior stucco but also to the underlying metal lath paper backing house wrap water-resistive barriers sheathing flashing paint interior walls interior floors and/or other property.”

The complaint files vicarious negligence counts against D.R. Horton due to faulty work of subcontractors 84 Lumber Bay Plastering Tradewinds Groups of Central Florida doing business as “GB Painting” and Central Florida Wrap.

In the past two years D.R. Horton has been the defendant in 41 construction defect cases in Hillsborough County alone.

Neal P. O’Brien an attorney with Florin Roebig P.A. in Palm Harbor spoke to The Free Press about the state of the homebuilding industry. He has filed suits against D.R. Horton KB Homes and other builders in recent years. He stated “I do not believe that D.R. Horton has a disproportionately high number of claims…We see the same issues through most of the large tract home builders across the State.”

O’Brien explained the construction problems are affiliated with too few “qualifying agents” to oversee Florida’s home construction volume leniency in Florida’s Building Codes and unsupervised subcontractors who home builders hire to construct the houses.

O’Brien said the “qualifying agents” are the license holders who pull permits to build houses and direct and supervise home construction compliant to Florida’s Building Codes.

In the news: Tennessee Man With Meth Arrested In Florida Eluding Cops For 50 Miles In Stolen U-Haul

He said there is only a handful of them available for all the builders to use and as a result it is impossible for them to oversee the construction of all the new homes properly.

Secondly he faulted the “Jim Walter” exemption in Florida statutes that allows home builders to hire certain sub-trades that are not licensed contractors – so long as they direct and supervise the construction performed by subcontractors.

Thirdly he faults the builders and subcontractors for not complying with the Florida Building Code when applying stucco over wood frame construction. He said homeowners should purchase a concrete block house instead of wood and pay for a home inspection before purchase.

O’Brien warned that once the damage is discovered the homeowner must hire a licensed engineer or contractor before they can file a claim against a home builder.

As it is the Rivera’s claim a loss in the value of their house.

The Free Press attempted to contact D.R. Horton’s Vice President of Investor and Media Relations Jessica Hansen but she could not be reached for comment.

The attorneys for the Rivera’s case are Joshua A. Burnett and Hannah E. Debella of Burnett Law Tampa.

This is a sad state of affairs as it is a pub of some historic interest and is grade II listed.

I looked at the title deeds some years ago now in the late 1980s when it was a Webster’s pub which involved a trip to a solicitor’s office in Hull with the bonus of enjoyable visits to the Ferens Art Gallery the Wilberforce House and Museum and Ye Olde Black Boy pub. The oldest document was from 1811 when the trustees under the will of Betty Thornton of Horton sold to one Elizabeth Bower of York for £567 the former cottage now occupied as a public house or inn known by the sign of the Hare and Hounds together with stables and outbuildings. The sixth on the list of names of occupiers was David Keighley who was granted a licence in 1773 as can be seen in the surviving records at Wakefield Archives followed by Charles Parker granted one in 1803.

It was located as pubs so often were on an old coaching and waggon road the one from Bradford through Horton and Queenshead as it was earlier known and on to Halifax. Several old inns punctuated the route.

The King’s Arms at Great Horton for example with a datestone of 1739 or the Crown a little lower down the hill from the Hare and Hounds which dates back to the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries. Or further along the road the Old Dolphin.

Local historian James Parker writing in 1904 in his book Illustrated Rambles from Hipperholme to Tong provides details of the next landlord of the Hare and Hounds after Parker William Tordoff. He was a collier who was pressed into the Third West Yorkshire militia in 1803 in which he became an officer’s servant to Colonel Pollard. At the close of his service Pollard awarded him with a ‘handsome present in cash’ which Tordoff used to take the Hare and Hounds then known according to Parker as the Cross Keys.

The property passed through several owners including Ann Fothergill of Knaresborough and Samuel Cordingley gentlemen of Horton Old Hall until it was bought in 1920 by William Boyes of the Granby Hotel Queensbury. Within three years he in turn sold it for £3200 to Bradford brewer J. Hey and Co and hence eventually to Webster’s.

It was not a pub I visited more than an odd occasion I have to say. Its interior didn’t show its historic origins but then most old pubs don’t any more than say shops do with a long central bar area open plan with separate drinking areas pool room at one end and raised seating area at the other.

Perhaps readers can supply more recent memories. But at the moment it presents a forlorn spectacle.

Pollstar Magazine named Pine Knob Music Theatre the top amphitheater in the entire world in its 2022 Year-End Rankings after reporting $36.9 million in overall gross ticket sales.

The honor caps off what was a big year for the venue which saw the iconic Pine Knob moniker return to use in the venue’s 50th anniversary year. The name returned after 20 years of being called DTE Energy Music Theatre.

The venue also earned the top honor in 2019 the last full concert season prior to this year which saw countless big names come through including Imagine Dragons Zac Brown Band Thomas Rhett Pitbull Backstreet Boys and more.

“It gives us immense pride to have Pine Knob Music Theatre recognized as the number one ranked amphitheater in the world” said Howard Handler President of 313 Presents per a press release. “From the moment we announced the return of Pine Knob Music Theatre… concertgoers and artists showed overwhelming enthusiasm for the return to our roots.”

Pine Knob wasn’t alone in getting recognition in Pollstar’s Year-End Rankings. Downtown Detroit’s Little Caesars Arena and the historic Fox Theatre were ranked in the top 15 in their respective categories.

LCA home to the Pistons Red Wings and top-tier concerts ranked No. 10 in the U.S. for Top 200 Arenas in gross ticket sales with $75.4 million.

The Fox meanwhile ranked No. 15 in the country for Top 200 Theatres with $24.8 million in gross ticket sales.

“This year marked our industry’s return to a full event schedule at our six venues since 2019 and it was great to see people gather and enjoy live entertainment once again” Handler said. “To have three ranked in the top 15 in their respective categories it shows Detroit truly is an entertainment mecca and we are extremely grateful for the continued patronage of our guests.”

Pollstar’s 2022 Year-End Rankings covered dates reported by tours and promoters from November 18 2021 through November 16 2022.

But lately the most significant attacks on electrical systems have demonstrated that hacking is hardly necessary when physical destruction and sabotage are an option: Just as Russia’s invasion force in Ukraine has systematically destroyed electrical infrastructure to cause vast blackouts across the country a mysterious and continuing series of physical attacks have hit power utilities in the American southeast—and in one case have caused an extended outage for tens of thousands of people.

We’ll get to that. In the meantime though the cyber news we’ve reported on hasn’t exactly let up this week: Apple added end-to-end encryption for its iCloud backups while also officially nixing its plan to hunt for child sexual abuse materials in iCloud and reopening a long-running rift with the FBI. Payroll and HR services provider Sequoia admitted to a data breach that included users’ Social Security numbers. A study of cybercrime forums revealed a trend of scammers scamming scammers. And we looked at how the Twitter Files will fuel conspiracy theorists how technology is contributing to UK authorities creating a “hostile environment” for immigrants and security and privacy concerns around the Lensa AI portrait app.

But there’s more. Each week we highlight the security news we didn’t cover in-depth ourselves. Click on the headlines below to read the full stories.

When shootings at two electrical substations in North Carolina left 40000 customers without power for days the incident seemed like an isolated—if bizarre and troubling—case. But this week the same utility Duke Energy reported gunfire at another facility a hydroelectric power plant in South Carolina. And combined with two more incidents of hands-on sabotage of US power facilities that occurred in Oregon and Washington in October and November the vulnerability of the US grid to old-fashioned physical harm has begun to seem like a serious threat.

No damage seems to have occurred in the South Carolina case and in the earlier incidents in Washington the utilities involved described the cases as “vandalism.” But the intruders in Oregon carried out a more deliberate attack cutting through a perimeter fence and damaging equipment according to the Oregon utility causing a “brief” power outage in one case. And in yet another separate collection of incidents Duke Energy saw half a dozen “intrusions” at substations in Florida according to documents seen by Newsnation. Federal law enforcement is investigating the cases.

The incidents are reminiscent of another strange isolated attack on the California power grid in 2015 when a sniper fired on an electrical substation and triggered a blackout to parts of Silicon Valley along with $15 million in damage. These newer cases while still relatively small in scale show just how disturbingly vulnerable the American power grid remains to relatively simple forms of sabotage.

The state-sponsored Chinese hacker group APT41 has long carried out a rare mix of cyberespionage and cybercrime. The group linked in a 2020 US indictment to a company called Chengdu 404 working as a contractor for China’s Ministry of State Security has been accused of moonlighting as for-profit thieves and even deploying ransomware. Now NBC News reports that the Secret Service believes APT41 went so far as to steal $20 million from US Covid relief funds—state-sponsored hackers stealing money from the US government itself. About half of the stolen funds were reportedly recovered. But a hacker group on the Chinese government payroll stealing from US federal coffers represents a far more brazen form red-line crossing than even APT41’s previous exploits.

The Met Opera announced earlier this week that it was hit with an ongoing cyberattack that took down its website and online ticketing system. Given that the Met Opera sells $200000 in tickets a day the losses from the disruption could do serious harm to one of New York’s major cultural institutions. As of Friday afternoon the website remained offline and its administrators had moved ticket sales to a new site. The New York Times in its reporting on the attack pointed out that the Met Opera had been critical of Russia’s war in Ukraine—going so far as to part ways with its Russian soprano singer—but there’s still no real explanation of the attack.

Cybersecurity firm ESET this week pinned responsibility for a campaign of data-destroying malware attacks targeting the diamond industry on a hacker group it calls Agrius which has been previously linked to the Iranian government. The attackers hijacked the software updates of an Israeli-made diamond industry software suite to deploy the wiper malware which ESET calls Fantasy in March of this year.

The memo reads in part:

Power companies in Oregon and Washington have reported physical attacks on substations using hand tools arson firearms and metal chains possibly in response to an online call for attacks on critical infrastructure. … In recent attacks criminal actors bypassed security by cutting the fence links lighting nearby fires shooting equipment from a distance or throwing objects over the fence and onto equipment. Federal Law Enforcement officials

Officials told NewsNation Tuesday it is too early to know a motive for the gunfire damage that caused widespread power outages in Moore County North Carolina but there have been similar cases of vandalism and plots in North Carolina and across the country in recent months.

On Nov. 11 for example sheriff’s deputies in Jones County North Carolina reported that criminal vandalism had caused 12000 people to lose power for days.

That investigation remains ongoing and authorities say no suspects have been identified or arrested.

In another instance back in February the Department of Justice secured guilty pleas from three men accused of plotting to shoot substations across the country with powerful rifles.

Federal officials said the defendants were white supremacists and planned to cause millions in damage and social unrest.

Federal authorities have warned of domestic terrorism-related threats to critical infrastructure for years. The Department of Homeland Security renewed that concern in a terrorism alert bulletin issued publicly on Nov. 30.

It reads in part:

Targets of potential violence include: public gatherings faith-based institutions the LGBTQI+ community schools racial and religious minorities government facilities and personnel U.S. critical infrastructure the media and perceived ideological opponents. The Department of Homeland Security

Officials called the North Carolina outages over the weekend a set of coordinated attacks on power substations.

“It appears to be an intentional willful and malicious act and the perpetrator will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law” said Sen. Tom Mcinnis R-N.C.

The outages — at their peak affecting around 45000 homes — caused residents to lose heat schools to close and some to turn to charities to cook them food.

“And I said I’m gonna stop out there and get me something to eat. Because eating out of the can all the time just don’t get it” one North Carolina resident said.

According to The News and Observer of Raleigh Duke Energy was the company that had its electrical substations damaged affecting tens of thousands of Moore County residents.

As of Tuesday about 73% of the more than 47000 Duke Energy customers served in the county were reportedly still without power.

The company said Tuesday evening it “anticipates having nearly all customers restored by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.”

Additionally Moore County Schools announced Tuesday afternoon that schools will be closed Wednesday and Thursday due to the outages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndjcG8uY29tL3dlYXRoZXIvYW5vdGhlci1jbG91ZHktZGF5LXdhdGNoaW5nLWZvci1zdG9ybXMtbGF0ZXItdGhpcy13ZWVr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clouds continue this evening with sunshine Monday,"Despite a few quick peeks of sunshine in some broken clouds the gloomy skies continued to dominate the forecast here across the Tri-State Sunday.

Overnight we’ll stay cloudy with temperatures falling down into the low 30s. Some spots may wake up just below freezing but winds should be calm meaning there wont be much of a wind chill.

Mostly cloudy skies will greet us out the door on Monday with the low 30s but we FINALLY have some sunshine in the forecast. Clouds will begin to clear out as we move into the afternoon on Monday and that will bring our first case of widespread sunshine since last Monday. That is 168 hours of dreariness. Temperatures won’t warm much with the mid 40s but sunshine will make it feel better overall.

Tuesday is nearly a carbon copy of Monday with partly cloudy skies and temperatures in the mid 40s. However by the evening on Tuesday clouds will move in which is the precursor for rain later in the week.

A strong low pressure system which will bring severe weather and blizzard conditions to the plains on Tuesday will bring our next best chance at rain as we move into the overnight hours Tuesday and into Wednesday. Rain looks heaviest during the morning hours Wednesday with some heavy downpours and gusty winds. Rain will be most of the day on Wednesday and could linger into early Thursday.

Behind the cold front that comes in on Thursday we will have a blast of cold air which will carry us into next weekend. Along with the cold air we may even have a few snow flurries Friday and Saturday. No accumulation is expected at this time. What are our chances of a White Christmas? History isn't on our side.

Dec. 11 (UPI) -- Authorities in Italy on Sunday arrested a 57-year old man accused of opening fire on an apartment block meeting at a bar in Rome killing three women including a friend of the European country's prime minister. The man identified as Claudio Campiti was arrested and charged after the shooting Sunday morning in Fidene on the outskirts of the Italian capital of Rome state-owned Rai News reported.

The three slain women have been identified as Sabine Sperandio 71; Elisabetta Silenzi 55; and Nicoletta Golisano 50. At least four others including one seriously were injured in the shooting.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni described Golisano as a protective mother a strong and fragile woman and a ""sincere and discrete friend.""

""But she was above all a professional with an uncommon sense of duty"" Meloni said in a statement. ""It was her sense of duty that brought her there on a Sunday morning where a man was waiting for her to shoot her and two other women to death.""

The shooting was reportedly over an apartment dispute.

The suspect had previously been turned down for a gun permit Meloni said adding the firearm used to kill her friend had been stolen from a shooting range and which has since been seized by police.

""The word 'justice' can never be compared to this story"" she said. ""Because it's not right to die like this.

""Nicoletta was happy and beautiful"" she said. ""For me she will always be beautiful and happy.""

The shooting was brought to an end by witnesses who tackled Campiti when his gun jammed according to Ria News.

Campiti has been charged with three counts of murder the Rome Public Prosecutor's Office said Ansa news agency reported.

Prosecutors said Campiti fired between seven and eight shots during the shooting but was in possession of more than 155 rounds.

The suspect also had his passport as well as additional sets of clothes and about $6300 it said."

A news release issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado on Friday said that the investigation was a 10-month long cooperative effort between the FBI the Drug Enforcement Administration the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and Colorado Springs police.

“The success of this joint investigation is truly based on the strong relationships we have with our federal state and local law enforcement counterparts throughout Colorado” DEA Rocky Mountain Division Special Agent in Charge Brian Besser said via the press release. “The DEA Rocky Mountain Division is committed to making this region a safer place to live and work and it is because of this strong collaboration with FBI CBI and CSPD that we are able to say we’ve done that today.”

The news release states that six of the seven defendants have been arrested and made their first appearance in federal court but that Gabriel Sanchez has yet to be arrested and ""is considered a fugitive.""

All six defendants who have been arrested have entered not guilty pleas according to court records.

Court records show a status conference is set for all defendants in federal court in Denver on Monday. Court records also show that their trial is estimated to last five to seven days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9mZnRoZWJhbGwuY29tL3J1Z2J5L2hheWVzLWZsaWVyLTEzNDQyMDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Josh van der Flier deserves European Player of the Year' - Fiona Hayes,"Josh van der Flier deserves to European Player of the Year according to Fiona Hayes.

The European Player of the Year five-man shortlist was announced this week.

Leinster players feature prominently on the list. It comprises of Josh van der Flier James Lowe Caelan Doris Gregory Alldritt and Antoine Dupont. Four of the five will feature in the Champions Cup Final between Leinster and La Rochelle. The other is Antoine Dupont so his inclusion is inevitable.

Dupont didn't play well enough in Toulouse' knockout games to be a serious contender. As such the four remaining candidates will compete individually in the final.

Former Munster and Ireland player Fiona Hayes believes there is one standout candidate this season.

""It has to be van der Flier"" Hayes said.

""From the minute it was released the first list. He's been outstanding and he's performed well in every game. His level of performance is even getting better with every game. He's improved his carries and people have talked a lot about his carries. Even his tackle technique he's staying injury free.

""For me he's been the absolute standout performer.""

Hayes notes that Dupont didn't do enough in Toulouse colours despite starring for France all season.

Van der Flier is a valuable player for Leinster but he wasn't considered a superstar before this season. He's a regular starter for Ireland and a nailed-on starter for Ireland but it wasn't until he improved his ball carrying that he became a star.

That individual improvement is consistent across the board in Leinster. Cian Treacy testified that van der Flier is a reflection of the work done by the coaching staff in Leinster.

""There are so many Leinster players who have seriously improved over the last few years"" Treacy said.

""And I think that's down to the coaching. The players are clearly unbelievably talented and unbelievably skilled but the quality of the coaching they're getting has taken a lot of players to new levels. You think of James Lowe Jamison Gibson-Park. Ross Molony is a perfect example.

""So much of that is down to the coaching.""

An account claiming to represent EVGA put a preproduction RTX 4090 prototype up for auction on eBay yesterday with the proceeds going to charity. It started a bidding war and shot up to five figures before the listing inexplicably disappeared after about 10 hours.

EVGA met with Gamers Nexus and JayzTwoCents quite a while ago to tell them that they were terminating their partnership with Nvidia. When the YouTubers shared the news afterward there was an outpouring of appreciation and support for the beleaguered AIB partner. About a month ago EVGA sent two working preproduction samples of their FTW3 RTX 4090 to GN and JayzTwoCents for them to tear down and show us what we missed out on.

We thought that would be the last we'd see of the GPU that wasn't meant to be. But yesterday it appeared in the background of an EVGA and Intel livestream that was raising money for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Shortly after the GPU was listed for auction on eBay with the proceeds also going to St. Jude. Before the listing disappeared this morning the price had risen to $13200 over 35 bids. With more than six days left to go it was well on its way to becoming the most expensive GPU ever sold.

The eBay listing was fairly light on details. It had four images of the GPU and five lines of text that described it as a ""next gen"" prototype that came without a warranty said it could only be shipped within the United States and affirmed that the auction was for charity. The spec sheet said the card had 24 GB of GDDR6 and a PCIe 4.0 x16 connector.

There were some users on Twitter that were immediately suspicious. EVGA hadn't advertised the auction anywhere and it didn't come from the eBay account that the company had used before. But the timing and the charity angle made sense and JayzTwoCents tweeted an endorsement of the auction that if he meant to be sarcastic didn't come across that way.

Yes this is totally legit EVGA is auctioning off one of their ""Not 4090"" Next Gen Video Cards for charity see it here https://t.co/oRaoneLsdH --- JayzTwoCents (@JayzTwoCents) December 10 2022

Most confusingly of all if the listing was a scam it wasn't one aimed at making money. It was part of eBay's charity program meaning that the money would go straight from the buyer to the verified charity. Maybe the listing was legitimate but EVGA took it down at the request of Nvidia or maybe eBay found it suspicious and wanted to investigate itself.

My hope is that the listing returns and that the GPU is traded for a hefty donation to a good cause. If there was the option of shipping it to Australia I would definitely have put down $13300 on it myself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ldmdhLWF1Y3Rpb25zLXVucmVsZWFzZWQtcnR4LTQwOTAtZ3B1LWZvci1jaGFyaXR5LWRvbGxhcjYyMDAtYW5kLXJpc2luZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA Auctions Unreleased RTX 4090 GPU For Charity $6200 And Rising,"After failed attempts to auction off the brand’s GeForce RTX 4090 on eBay EVGA has taken to its forums to carry out the auction. After the company’s abrupt exit from the GPU market the GeForce RTX 4090 FTW3 prototype or “Next Gen Graphics Card” as EVGA calls it due to licensing issues will make a fine collector’s item.

EVGA previously took to eBay to auction off the graphics card. It had fetched up to $13200 before eBay removed the listing. The company has restarted the auction on the EVGA forums where the current bid at the time of writing is $6200. However it still has a long way to go before it matches the last bid on eBay.

All the proceeds from EVGA’s auction will go to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The auction finalizes on December 16th at 11:59 AM PT so interested parties have more than enough time to submit a bid. However the brand is auctioning the graphics card as it is and will not provide a warranty or accept returns.

Although it’s a preproduction sample EVGA’s GeForce RTX 4090 FTW3 is a working graphics card. YouTuber JayzTwoCents has already taken one of the samples for a spin. Since EVGA ended its partnership with Nvidia the graphics card uses a qualification AD102 die and relies on EVGA’s home-brewed firmware. The prototype features a 2520 MHz boost clock the same as the Founders Edition. Therefore its performance should be in the same alley as the GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition.

EVGA was one of the most popular Nvidia partners and was very good at making graphics cards. So it’s a shame that the company departed from the graphics card market. Many enthusiasts would love to see EVGA hook up with another significant chipmaker like AMD or Intel. However the company has said it is concentrating on its other hardware products which we suspect potentially offer higher profit margins.

If you’re an EVGA fan it’s your chance to own what is likely the last graphics card that the company manufactured. It won’t come cheap but it’s for a good cause."

When electronic arts asked A$AP Rocky to be part of its latest racing game Need for Speed Unbound the answer came quickly. “I grew up on Need for Speed so I just felt like it was only right you know?” the rapper says. “That was one of those things that we all grew up on. I was interested off the bat.”

He ended up becoming the star of the new game released Dec. 2 providing his likeness and personality as a non-playable character. Need for Speed Unbound‘s first trailer shows A$AP Rocky stepping out of a custom Mercedes 190E (which he also has in real life) with the phrase “Always Strive And Prosper” emblazened on the driver’s-side door. His song “Shittin’ Me” which he recorded around 2019 and debuted through the game echoes over the trailer’s gorgeous graffiti-style visuals.

In the trailer and the actual game which is available on PC PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S Rocky appears stylized in Need for Speed‘s cel-shaded art direction. He shows up at certain challenges and events in the game and if you play long enough you can race against him. His presence is the finishing touch that makes the game drip with personality and charm.

Growing up in Harlem Rocky remembers playing games on consoles such as the Sega Saturn and Sega Dreamcast. “I was a Sega head — I loved the [Sega] Genesis” he says. Yet he also appreciated Sega’s chief competitor: “The Super Nintendo changed the game” he adds. “And then by the time [Nintendo] did the N64 it was over.”

Rocky was a fan of PaRappa the Rapper one of PlayStation’s earliest mascots. “I remember when PlayStation first came out it was like that one game that you get — the pack of samples demos and shit” he says. He begins to sing PaRappa’s theme song: “‘Kick punch. It’s all in the mind!’”

Rocky is more of a retro gaming fan though he he says that “This new Need for Speed is my shit.” His favorite title from the franchise growing up was 2002’s Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 which he played on the PlayStation 2. He also speaks highly of 2003’s Need for Speed: Underground which influenced Need for Speed: Unbound’s focus on street racing.

“Underground was considerably like everybody’s favorite” he says. “And I think Unbound is just an extension of that.”

Along with “Shittin’ Me” a few of A$AP Rocky’s other songs from his back catalog are also on the Need for Speed Unbound soundtrack including 2019’s “Babushka Boi” and 2011’s “Palace.” He says the song selection process was a collaborative process since Electronic Arts already had some of his songs in mind when the company approached him in 2020. “’Shittin’ Me’ wasn’t as old as it is now” he says. “And ‘Babushka Boi’ like just came out.” He mentions Chase Straight Need for Speed’s brand manager at Electronic Arts: “This guy Chase is amazing. He was really adamant about ‘Babushka Boi’ and he loved the song ‘Palace.’ It was really dope working with him.”

This wasn’t Rocky’s first rodeo with Electronic Arts. Back in 2012 he did a FIFA 13 commercial along with Snoop Dogg and other celebrities. But this took his involvement to a new level. “It was a crazy experience man” he says. “I dreamed of this kind of shit. Like growing up you watch different behind-the-scenes actors with the green-screen suits on. It’s crazy. I always wished and imagined that I would do that.”

All in all he says Electronic Arts was being pleasant to work with. “It was fun. Sign me up for that fun shit that shit that isn’t just your everyday notion you know? Sign me up!” he says. “That’s what I’m here for.”

So would he work on another video game if the opportunity came up? “Oh absolutely man” Rocky says. “Absolutely.”

After being officially revealed to the fandom at the Star Wars Celebration earlier this year the first gameplay trailer for the highly-anticipated Star Wars Jedi: Survivor — which officially changed the series’ name — was aired during The Game Awards. The trailer as seen below depicts Cal Kestis as a Jedi on the run and one facing the full might of an entire Empire.

As long as we fight hope survives. Experience the next chapter in Cal Kestis’ story. #StarWarsJediSurvivor is available March 17th.

The recently dropped gameplay trailer does a very good job of presenting what Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment have been doing behind closed doors for so long. The footage shows some of Cal’s new abilities including the news grappling hook for enhanced traversal methods as well as new fighting stances which incorporate the use of dual lightsabers for additional combat advantage. The Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer also features several established friends and foes including Bode Acuna Cere Junda and several other key figures.

The gameplay trailers are a good indicator of the development process in its late stages and make the fans feel relieved that their favorite upcoming title hasn’t sunk into the quicksand of shifty development especially today when so many companies are delaying or even outright canceling their previously announced titles. Besides all the shooting slicing dicing and force-flinging the new Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer also dropped another important news about the upcoming game — its release date. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will arrive on March 17 2023.

Admittedly EA has previously announced that the game is on track regarding its development cycle and that no delays were previously in sight. Electronic Arts who recently announced another The Sims project — hasn’t offered any official statements regarding a release date at the time of the announcement. However the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor release date was leaked on Steam just days before it was officially announced via the trailer but the company has changed the release date to “coming soon” rather quickly.

Unfortunately there’s still time for things to go south and for the game to be delayed but we sincerely hope it won’t come to that. So far the information regarding the upcoming Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has been limited and what we know so far is that the game picks up five years after the original game the Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Kestis continues being on the run from the Empire while also feeling the weight of being among the last Jedi in the galaxy so the times have become grim for the game’s protagonist.

Apart from Star Wars Jedi: Survivor that’s scheduled to release in some four months the entire Star Wars gaming franchise is undergoing an expansion following the expiration of its exclusive contract with Electronic Arts. Knights of the Old Republic dubbed the best Star Wars game ever is also getting a remake which shortly suffered development issues and we’re still waiting on any news regarding Star Wars Eclipse. The last we heard the title had no playable build indicating a rather rocky development but that was over a year ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdmlydHVhbC1hdXRvbW90aXZlLWFydGlzdC11c2VzLW5mcy11bmJvdW5kLXRvLWV4cHJlc3Mtc29tZS13aWxkLXRob3VnaHRzLTIwNTYxNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virtual Automotive Artist Uses NFS Unbound to Express Some Wild Thoughts,"Photo: dm_jon / Instagram

SUV

Developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts a little over a month ago Need for Speed Unbound is the twenty-fifth chapter of the NFS saga finally available worldwide since December 2nd on PCs and consoles. Naturally it has been pretty much hyped beyond belief complete with OEM collaborations with ritzy venues (Puma Versace etc.) or deluxe editions of the game.Of course the gaming society has quickly found ways to “git gud” leak the gameplay ahead of the official release and even play it for cheap in case the OEM pricing was too much. Then according to early reviews it all felt like a positive development – the game looks cool and plays nice leading to an overall enjoyable experience. But how about the neat features we have come to take for granted from other installments?Well as it turns out the ‘cops’ were not available at launch for the online multiplayer version and maybe the artsy world of virtual automotive artists needs to compensate for such shortcomings with their CGI skills. And while we still haven’t seen a new NFS cop car from him Jon Pumfrey the virtual artist behind the DomesticMango label (aka dm_jon on social media) is currently having an NFS Unbound blast with a series of cool vehicles and their artsy tuning potential.Everything started days before the official worldwide launch with a 2023 Nissan ‘400Z.’ The seventh generation of the iconic Z-car series is the retro-modern successor to the popular 370Z hence the unofficial moniker that also directly hints at the 400 ponies tucked under the hood inside the 3.0-liter VR30DDTT twin-turbo V6 engine. But real-world figures are not so important anymore.Instead what matters is that the 2023 Nissan Z is “finally in a game with insane customization! Need for Speed Unbound does this car justice with all the crazy customization you can do to it.” And there is no need to take his word for granted as the pixel master was keen to share a black-and-yellow contrasting option complete with the usual slammed widebody and aftermarket wheel suspects.Then the author quickly moved to yet another “amazing” car the S14 Nissan Silvia (aka 200SX or 240SX for export). That is the penultimate evolution of the series of small sports cars that debuted back in 1965 as the CSP311 Silvia before moving to simpler S10 through S15 codes in 1975. Seen here in dark and menacing attire this version sure looks ready to give even the R35 Nissan GT-R Nismo an NFS Unbound headache or two.An R32 Nissan GT-R with the Rocket Bunny widebody kit could not be left out even when dwelling at sunset but it quickly made way for crazier Euro-style projects. Do not think this CGI expert is only after JDM projects in general and Nissan builds in particular. Instead one of the most exotic vehicles on the planet the Lambo Urus super- has also been treated to some NFS Unbound slammed greatness complete with a crazy widebody signed by fellow virtual artist Hugo Silva Designs Last but not least – at the time of writing that is – and coming to fulfill the norm of vintage greatness was a Lamborghini Countach build. The idea marries both past and present with the unknown future so the author thought this kit was giving away some bonkers Cyberpunk 2077 vibes – both when standing still with ‘bare buttocks’ and while roaring down a CGI street!",,,

Twitter Blue will relaunch on 12 December with an $8 monthly subscription tier or $11 a month for iOS users the company announced on Sunday.

A previous verification system in place for the last several years used blue ticks for government officials high-profile individuals journalists and other notable figures and institutions to clearly identify real people and affirm the authenticity of the account.

Under the new system users who pay into the Blue subscription will receive a blue check mark as well as the ability to edit tweets upload 1080p video and use the platform in reader mode to make it easier to read longer threads.

The platform will also begin replacing “the ‘official’ label with a gold checkmark for businesses and later in the week a grey checkmark for government and multilateral accounts” according to the company announcement.

Last month impersonators were able to sign up for the newly launched paid blue tick service and fire off messages while posing as pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly writing that “we are excited to announce insulin is free now” – a nine-word post that likely cost Twitter millions of dollars in ad revenue while drawing Musk Twitter and Eli Lilly into a national political debate about the exploding costs of healthcare and prescription drugs.

“Chiquita” announced the fruit company had “just overthrown the government of Brazil.” An account impersonating a powerful pro-Israel lobbying group wrote that it “[heart emoji] apartheid.” An account posing as Musk’s Tesla bragged about using child labour and issued a breaking news tweet that a “second Tesla has hit the World Trade Center.”

Ad sales account for 90 percent of Twitter’s overall revenue and several advertisers have abandoned the platform in the aftermath of the free speech absolutist’s $44bn takeover and concerns about a decline in content moderation and tools to prevent offensive messages appearing alongside brands shelling for timeline space.

(AP) — Newcomer Davante Lewis a Democrat backed by an environmental political action committee easily won Saturday’s runoff for a seat on Louisiana’s Public Service Commission — an obscure regulatory body that has received national attention from media celebrities climate change activists and major public utility companies.

The 30-year-old progressive policy advocate received 59% of the vote to defeat incumbent Lambert Boissiere III who received 41% with all participating precincts reporting.

Boissiere held a seat for nearly 18 years on the five-member commission which regulates the state’s public utility companies and energy sector and sets electric rates among other oversight powers.

“Tonight we have begun a new chapter for Louisiana” Lewis said in a statement. “Tonight the people of Louisiana start taking our power back. Tonight Louisiana has a Public Service Commissioner who’s unafraid to hold Entergy accountable because I owe this victory to the people of Louisiana and their commitment to a brighter cleaner and 100% renewable future.”

The Associated Press could not immediately reach Boissiere or a campaign representative for comment.

The multiparish election covering an area stretching from Baton Rouge to New Orleans saw hundreds of thousands of dollars poured into the race by major utility companies and outside political action committees.

Environmentalists have become increasingly focused on the commission in a state with a front-row seat to the effects of climate change and where tens of thousands of jobs are tied to the oil and gas industry. Even Hollywood paid attention to the runoff between the two Democrats with “Avengers” star Mark Ruffalo chiming in on social media with his support for Lewis.

Lewis noted multiple priorities including expanding renewable energy strengthening Louisiana’s vulnerable power grid and tackling the state’s ballooning electricity bills that are largely a result of high prices for natural gas a key fuel for Louisiana utilities.

“We rose up and said Louisiana is ready for a new energy future. One in which every Louisianian can count on clean air and water a warm house in the winter a cool horse in the summer and utility bills that don’t break the bank” Lewis said.

Although Lewis and Boissiere are members of the same political party money poured into the race and certain contributors became major points of contention.

Keep the Lights On an affiliate of the Environmental Defense Fund released attack ads against Boissiere for accepting campaign contributions from utility companies regulated by the commission including Entergy Louisiana’s largest power company. While these types of contributions are legal in Louisiana they have been scrutinized over the years.

“The monopoly utility companies oil gas and petrochemical industries and political establishment who tried to sink our movement will not disappear because of this election” Lewis said following the election. “We must continue to root out corruption and unrig the system to hold me and my fellow commissioners accountable and to advocate for bold new solutions.”

The commission has for years resisted calls to mandate power companies get a certain share of their power from renewables but activists are hopeful their stance will change The Advocate reported.

The commission consists of three Republicans and two Democrats including Lewis in a reliably red state.

Louisiana has been riddled by destructive hurricanes making landfall more frequently while coastal areas have been eaten away by erosion subsidence and rising sea levels. The Mississippi River recently reached record low water levels.

The state also abuts the Gulf of Mexico and has tens of thousands of jobs tied to the oil and gas industry. In 2021 Louisiana ranked third among the top natural gas-producing states accounting for nearly 10% of the United States’ natural gas production that year behind only Texas and Pennsylvania.

Voters on Saturday also approved all three constitutional amendments on the ballot banning non-United States citizens from registering to vote or casting ballots in Louisiana — closing a possible loophole — and giving the state Senate the opportunity to weigh in on the governor’s appointments to two oversight panels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWZvcm1lci5jb20vbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9hLW5ldy1saWZ0LWluLXRvd24tc3VuZGFuY2UtZXhwcmVzcy1vcGVucy1hdC1tb3VudC1zbm93L2FydGljbGVfYmQ5OTVjZDgtNzk2Zi0xMWVkLTg3MTUtYTM5NzRhYzg3NmUyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'A new lift in town': Sundance Express opens at Mount Snow,You are the owner of this article.,,,,,,,,,

I’ve enjoyed every moment I’ve had in the new-gen Ford Ranger this year so I was really looking forward to getting behind the wheel of the new-gen Ford Everest. In its Platinum guise the Everest is more ‘luxury SUV’ than the rugged badge would leave you to believe there’s a leather-wrapped interior amongst all the creature comforts you could poke a stick at.

Of course I wanted to challenge just how far the 21-inch alloys would limit its ability off-road. My adventure for the weekend featured a mixture of very light offroading with some proper city miles giving the Everest the chance to prove that even in its luxurious guise it’s still an Everest under the skin.

What Powers the 2023 Ford Everest Platinum?

2023 Ford Everest Platinum Performance Figures Engine V6 turbo-diesel Power 184kW @ 3250 rpm Torque 600Nm @ 1750 rpm Acceleration 0-100 km/h in 8.4 seconds (as tested by Performance Drives)

As I mentioned in my round-up article detailing the full Ford Ranger lineup for this model year the new Ford Everest receives the turbo-diesel V6 just like the Ranger. Sadly there won’t be a Raptor variant of the Everest anytime soon with the Bronco Raptor representing the closest thing in the Ford stable albeit unavailable in Australia.

It’s a well-known secret that while the 400HP Raptor is a riot of a vehicle the V6 diesel is the sweet spot for adventure touring. The turbo-diesel is no slouch either with 184kW of peak power at 3250rpm and 600Nm of peak torque between 1750 and 2250rpm. Lower ends of the range receive the reliable and proven 2.0-litre Bi-Turbo diesel engine found in the previous Ranger and Everest it’s the choice for those looking for the most fuel-efficient model. In my time with the Everest I average just over 10 litres per 100km.

All engines are backed by a 10-speed automatic transmission a gearbox that’s had its issues in the past but one I’ve come to appreciate as Ford has refined it over the years.

How Does the New Ford Everest Platinum Drive?

The engine and gearbox combination works a treat. While there are 10 gears for the box to climb through it’s more than happy as you accelerate away from traffic lights and intersections. It never hunts for gears when you’re merging in traffic thanks to the wave of torque that’s achieved so low in the rev range. Plant your foot and there’s a small pause before it happily kicks down a few gears.

You’ll only manage to upset the gearbox when slowing down in traffic before quickly speeding up again. In my testing it would confuse the slowing down with stopping and the brisk acceleration would cause the box to jump around a few gears unnecessarily. It’s no deal breaker but it’s present and a fact of life when you’re dealing with 10 gears.

The good news for Platinum buyers who are also looking to take their car offroad is that Ford is willing to swap the giant 21-inch wheels for an 18-inch all-terrain tire and wheel combo for no cost. I’d recommend simply buying a second set of steelies for offroad driving with some aggressive rubber.

What’s the Ride Comfort Like?

I had the chance to jump out of the Everest and straight into a Ranger Wildtrak which meant I had a rare chance to see the difference in ride comfort between the two.

On paper the Everest has a coil-sprung rear-end setup whereas the Ranger adopts leaf springs in a typical ute fashion so you would assume the Everest is far comfier and compliant around town. While that’s true to an extent I found the difference to be hardly noticeable. In fact I’d say that unless you drove the cars back to back you wouldn’t notice the difference at all around town. Get out into the dirt and it’s a different story but the Platinum has a clear focus on street.

Factor some weight into the equation and the suspension on the Everest would soften up quicker than the leaf springs on the Ranger however very few owners will be driving around town with 400kg in the back of an Everest.

I drove the Everest on some light offroad trails and found the ride to be acceptable however the 21-inch wheels are something I’d swap out instantly if heading offroad. With little weight over the rear axle on my day trip the rear suspension didn’t perform particularly well and felt very light on loose surfaces as it would skip over bumps rather than absorb them. Add some weight a fridge camping gear etc. and you’ll find the coil springs soften up.

I’d say this is more a compliment for the Wildtrak than a complaint about the Everest as for all engineering reasons the latter should be far comfier on road and off. I don’t think the ride offers the comfort levels that the price bracket and ‘Platinum’ badge on the front ask for and of course the 21-inch wheels don’t help the equation.

In the future I’d love to see Ford introduce a softer spring even if that means a lower towing capacity. If you’re using the car to drop the kids off at school there’s a good chance you’ll never tow 3500kg of trailer behind it. Air suspension wouldn’t go astray on the top-of-the-range model either especially when you’re getting into the $80000 bracket.

What’s the Interior Like on the 2023 Ford Everest Platinum?

The biggest change in the new Ford Everest can be found inside. And once you jump into the cabin using the side step you’ll be welcomed by a well-laid-out cabin that features the latest technology and a nice combination of materials and soft-touch plastics. Touchpoints in the Platinum edition are mostly leather-wrapped including around the door area dashboard and steering wheel.

Front seats are both heated and ventilated while the new door pulls have been inbuilt into the door armrest area. I expect other manufacturers to replicate this feature as it’s a rather ingenious design. Comfort levels are good and I’d happily travel hundred of KMs touring around the country in them. The rear passenger legroom for my 6ft frame was plentiful and the doors open nice and wide for ease of access situations.

A large digital driver’s display is found behind the heated steering wheel with improved legibility over the outgoing model. Animations change every time you switch driving modes and the start-up sequence is one of the best in the industry however the car that drives onto the screen doesn’t match your car which is a little disappointing.

Information provided includes lane assist adaptive cruise control trip data navigation instructions speed limits and oil/water temperatures amongst a number of other features. Unfortunately you can’t customise these displays to the extent I’d like to see in a car at this price point.

Those looking to take advantage of the 7-seater setup will love the electronic folding third row however the headroom and access are only kid-friendly for longer trips. The sub-floor storage in the boot area is mighty useful for carrying camera gear and things you don’t want juggling around in the boot.

Here are the Ford Everest storage capacity figures.

Boot capacity (7 seats): 259 litres

Boot capacity (5 seats): 898 litres

Boot capacity (2 seats): 1818 litres

Is the Infotainment System Modern Does it Have Apple CarPlay?

The portrait-mounted 12-inch centre screen is the first thing you’ll notice when you jump into the Everest. It features wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in three-quarter screen layouts. This can be shrunk to give more space to the climate and quick access menus.

There’s almost too much functionality to mention but the most important include vehicle settings accessible via the Everest logo in the top corner while the various function menus can be found in the centre touch button in the top middle of the screen. All of this is rather difficult to navigate while you’re offroad however the climate controls are kept as physical buttons and you don’t find yourself jumping for different menus too often.

Those looking to take their Everest offroad will appreciate the 360 camera options that can be brought up to better view your surroundings. Seasoned offroaders might roll their eyes at the thought of spotting a line through a camera but I reckon this is a must-have for anything off-road moving forward. I loved it in the Defender RAM TRX and now the Everest.

The Platinum package also adds a 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen branded sound system which is a solid upgrade from the standard system. While a wireless charging pad is found underneath the screen and both USB-A and USB-C ports when a physical connection is necessary.

Should You Buy the New Ford Everest Platinum?

These are the things you should consider before purchasing the new Ford Everest.

How Much Does the Ford Everest Platinum Cost?

The 2023 Ford Everest Platinum is priced from $77530 before on-road costs.

This is nearly $20000 AUD more expensive than the $58290 Ambiente 4×4 base model (which I will be driving in January). That particular model is only available with the 2.0-litre engine however the Ford Everest Sport 4×4 is priced at $69590 AUD which has the V6 as an option. By the time you mess around with on-road costs the Platinum is about $10000 more expensive than the next cheapest option in the range.

In terms of wait times it’s best to contact your local dealer however I have a friend who placed an order on the day the order books opened and they’re not picking up their car until January 2023. This is the case for most new cars not built in China with Toyota Isuzu Mitsubishi etc. all dealing with stock issues.

Warranty and Servicing

The 2023 Ford Everest is backed by Ford Australia’s five-year unlimited-kilometre warranty that includes roadside assistance. Servicing is capped-price at 12-month or 15000km intervals and are priced as follows.

Basic service prices for Ford Everest correct at the time of writing:

12 months or 15000km – $329

24 months or 30000km – $329

36 months or 45000km – $329

48 months or 60000km – $329

60 months or 75000km – $350

More information about servicing your Ford Everest can be found through your nearest dealer.

Man of Many’s Verdict on the 2023 Ford Everest Platinum

My time in the Ford Everest was twofold. I spent time on a mixture of terrains; light offroad trails highways and city streets to really figure out where the Platinum was most comfortable.

To my surprise (with its 21-inch wheels) it was more than capable of light off-roading and would make for a great family camping rig however it’s clearly targeting those who will make use of all 7 seats on a day-to-day basis.

The engine and gearbox combination is great albeit a little thirsty and the technology inside the cabin is excellent and makes for a very comfortable place to sit for longer trips. I look at these technology-filled interiors as future-proofing for the long run asking “will this look modern in 10 years?” In the case of the Everest the answer is yes.

Trying Not to Compare the Everest to the Ranger

Ultimately I found myself constantly comparing it to the Ranger. Of course the number one buyer of an Everest is a family who wants to make use of the third row however if you’re simply buying the Everest because you “don’t want a ute” the Ranger makes such a great counter-argument I wouldn’t be so quick to jump in the Everest.

In the case of the new Ranger Ford spent a great deal of time and effort creating the best dual-cab ute we’ve ever seen on the Australian market but I’m not sure it’s fully translated to the platform-shared Everest. It doesn’t go above and beyond the Ranger Wildtrak in terms of ride comfort or technology as you would expect for something that’s targeting families with kids who will be spending most of their time on-road.

You have to look at this car as an $80000 luxury vehicle and if you remove the offroad and towing elements from the equation there are comfier places to sit on a daily basis. The interior is great but so it should be for that amount of money. The ride on the other hand is simply too stiff when you don’t have weight over the rear axle and you’ll kick yourself if you don’t make use of all 3500kg towing capacity.

The Everest buyer is a person who’s looking to tow a 3500kg trailer one day do some camping here and there and drop the kids off at school the next day. If you’re doing either of those things I can’t think of a better vehicle for the money. On the other hand if you’re looking to putt around the city and drive a few dirt roads the ride comfort may have you looking elsewhere.

Community Action Partnership of Strafford County recently completed a full weatherization and energy efficiency project at Abi's Place. Located on Charles Street in Rochester Abi's Place is a transitional home for women who have graduated from Hope on Haven Hill's substance use recovery programs.

Children are welcome at both Hope on Haven Hill and Abi's place living with their moms as they work to rebuild their lives

Gift of Warmth:Catherine 80 had no money left to repair furnace.

Kerry Norton is the executive director at Hope on Haven Hill. She said they are grateful for the work done by the Strafford CAP work they would otherwise have struggled to complete at Abi's Place located at 38 Charles St. Rochester in the former rectory of St. Mary's Church.

""It was amazing and beautiful what they did for us"" said Norton. ""They replaced windows doors and worked with Eversource to make our electric services more efficient. This is a big old house and this will help so much. We have eight women and their children living there currently all graduates of Hope on Haven Hill. They can live there up to two years as they go back to school look for permanent housing and employment. Most of the women end up staying for about one year.""

Norton said CEO Betsey Andrews Parker and the Strafford CAP teams helped years ago when Hope on Haven Hill opened on Rochester Hill Road doing some work on that home too.

""They did some weatherization there too so when we acquired the building for Abi's Place I reached out again to see if they could help"" she said. ""We would not have been able to accomplish what we have at these homes without the help of Community Action Partnership of Strafford County. We are very grateful.""

Norton said she cannot say enough about the work of the CAP.

""They help us with early HeadStart programs for the children of our mothers"" she said. ""I know they help so many families. Supporting them is a solid win for everyone. Everything is so hard right now for families for our clients even for our staffing needs. We all need a hand sometimes.""

Donations are gratefully accepted and will be distributed among the community action programs in Rockingham and Strafford counties for them to make a real difference in real lives.

How to donate

This year we ask that checks donated to Gift of Warmth be made out directly to either Rockingham Community Action or the Community Action Partnership of Strafford County. Please write “Gift of Warmth” in the check memo line to ensure the money goes for fuel assistance.

Just think of a place to go and you don't need to worry about finding the perfect accommodation. Besides avoiding the high rent that you would have to pay in big cities another perk that comes with owning and living in a van full-time is the reduced cost of living.

Kedar is a young software engineer who converted a 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 with a 170-inch wheelbase into his tiny home on wheels and parked it in one of the most famous cities in the world - New York City. It is mind-blowing what some people manage to create out of a vehicle that was not even supposed to be a motorhome Right at the front of the van called Mamba Kedar added a small turf on the step that gets you inside the van. The driver and passenger seats can be swiveled giving extra space for guests to come and spend some quality time together. The slotted wood ceiling makes this van feel homier while the LEDs give the interior a cozy atmosphere.There’s also a headliner shelf above those chairs for more storage. Since the space is so limited he could only add what seems to be a miniature closet right before the kitchen.While the windshield on the van has its designated purpose having too many windows can be quite annoying when you want some privacy. For this reason Kedar installed a blackout curtain that can be attached to the side. Actually all the windows have covers to ensure no one can see inside.The kitchen is minimal but Kedar managed to make it functional . It is equipped with a deep sink that can be covered with a cutting board a mini fridge and a two-burner propane-powered stovetop. Although it is quite compact there are plenty of countertops with a birch butcher block that impressively fit in this tight space. Right next to the kitchen he added a workspace with a standing desk a monitor and two wall Bluetooth speakers.The bathroom is hidden underneath one of those countertops which opens from the top and front to reveal an RV toilet a shower head and a shower curtain that can be attached to the hooks to keep the water inside. The water from both the sink and the shower is drained into a 20-gallon (75-liter) gray water tank below the van.At the rear is the dinette area with a large lagun table mount and two bench couches.

Site plans confirm that the upcoming Raising Cane’s Chicken Finger restaurant being proposed for Deptford NJ will mean the demolition of the Don Pablo’s building located on Deptford Center Road.

UPDATE: APPROVED! Raising Cane’s was approved at the January 11th Deptford Planning Meeting. I was on vacation that week and unable to attend… so this is my December 10th article that was published before the meeting. Nothing else to add.

42Freeway first broke the news of the Deptford location to readers back in August of this year. This was before any town meetings were scheduled. As of today no approval meetings are set but we expect it to happen in early 2023.

Well we have the full set of site plans after all which is a big sign they are close to presenting to the town Planning Board. More details on the site plan below.

If you aren’t familiar Raising Cane’s is a chicken finger restaurant with a cult-like following. They are to chicken fingers what In-And-Out is to burgers! Fans really love the chicken fingers and Cane’s Sauce… calling themselves “Caniacs”!

A Raising Cane’s Chicken Finger Restaurant is in the works for Deptford NJ at the site of a former Don Pablo’s

The location for the new Deptford Raising Cane’s will be along Deptford Center Road and sit in front of the Target Store. So again this is where Don Pablo’s was located. On the other side is an Applebee’s and across the street from the planned chicken finger restaurant is Mission BBQ.

Some had wondered if the Don Pablo’s building would remain and be utilized by Raising Cane’s but knowing that fast-food outlets like theirs have a distinctive building style (not to mention the old Don Pablo’s building is much too large) it was clear to 42Freeway that the old Tex-Mex eatery building was coming down.

Additionally in today’s post-pandemic world a fast and high-throughput drive-thru setup is the name of the fast food game… and Raising Cane’s needed the extra space to create a full two-lane drive through setup.

Raising Cane’s in Deptford will be located in a prime commercial district in front of Target and BJ’s Wholesale on Deptford Center Road.

A 2020 article at Forbes says the Average Raising Cane’s Unit Volumes are greater than McDonald’s!

Raising Cane’s is new to the Philadelphia area and currently operate locations in Philadelphia (which I’ve visited and tried the chicken fingers! Read on below)

Other locations are planned in Marlton NJ (as reported by A View From Evesham) as well as one being approved for in Cherry Hill first reported by our sister site MarltonPike.com.

I have information on another location in the works for another 42Freeway region town but need to further confirm it before sharing with readers.

The site plan for the new Raising Cane’s in Deptford NJ shows the new building will have dual drive-thru lanes.

Don Pablo’s and Miller’s Ale House: A Recap

Don Pablo’s was a popular Tex-Mex restaurant which in the 2010’s was on a slow decline in store locations.

Heading into 2019 Deptford was the last location remaining and in June of 2019 they abruptly closed.

Just 3 months after the closing of Don Pablo’s 42Freeway determined that Miller’s Ale House was taking over the property.

Miller’s plan was to gut the large and distinctive building effectively building a new restaurant inside the outer brick shell.

Eagerly awaited but fizzled out from pandemic economic pressures the previously planned Miller’s Ale House is not coming to Deptford.

It was clear that Miller’s was serious about the location in 2019 as they quickly got to work gutting the building and started working on the new HVAC duct work (some of which was stored outside ahead of construction).

Timing is everything and just a few short months later the US found itself in an crushing pandemic economic shutdown. This stopped construction and made every company rethink their future plans.

While at one time later on we were told the project was a go again Miller’s eventually walked away from it.

it’s important to note that with a fast-food restaurant replacing Don Pablo’s that means there is liquor license unused in Deptford. Due to the successful commercial area around the mall that makes the license a prized possession of the shopping center owner. We have no details on plans for the license.

Raising Cane’s Deptford Site Plan

The site plans obtained by 42Freeway show that the building will be developed in almost the exact same spot as the Don Pablo’s building but significantly smaller.. sized as a fast-food restaurant.

The building will be developed to face Deptford Center Road and the dual lane drive-thru will run counter-clockwise around the building with the drive-thru windows facing the Target parking lot.

The 2 acre property has plenty of room for parking which is listed as 42 spaces. The site plan calls out that only 19 are required

A colorized site plan by me overlaying a Google overhead view which gives an indication of how the new Raising Cane’s chicken finger restaurant will be set in the Deptford DJ property. The former Don Pablos building can be seen underneath.

The restaurant will also offer a small outdoor seating area in the front corner.

The existing entrance into the Don Pablo’s property from the Shopping Center access road near Applebee’s will still be utilized but it appears they will be making it significantly wider. This main access is for cars entering AND leaving.

A second “exit only” will be added on the right side at the road closest to Target.

The Raising Cane’s “Caniacs” Experience

Over the summer when I wrote about the Cherry Hill location at MarltonPike.com I visited the newly opened location in Center City Philadelphia to see what all of the fanaticism was all about!

Raising Cane’s is a premium chicken breast “finger” which is always made to order… and their chicken is hand-breaded and never frozen. Seriously they are only about chicken fingers. Deliciously tender chicken fingers.

And you won’t find a variety of sauces for your chicken fingers either as they carry their own special recipe sauce called Cane’s Sauce.

Trying out Raising Cane’s in Philadelphia PA. Fresh and tender chicken fingers and their amazing Cane’s sauce!

Based on internet lore and copy-cat recipes the sauce appears to be based on; mayonnaise ketchup garlic powder Worcestershire sauce and black pepper. The Cane’s sauce recipe really is a secret though. It’s made fresh in the store but that responsibility is left with the store General Managers!

They also offer sides; Crinkle-Cut fries Coleslaw and Texas Toast… and of course Cane’s Sauce.

If it’s your first time visiting consider trying the Box Combo that has all of these items in the basket. But be warned.. it’s a LOT of food!

Don’t get me wrong those sides are a very strong supporting cast loved by Raising Cane’s fans as much as the tenders are.

Distinctive Raising Cane’s branding as shown in a Philadelphia PA location.

And the freshness theme carries through to the sides.

The coleslaw is made daily in each store. The fries are Grade A potatoes. And the Texas Toast starts with a pull-apart sesame seed bread that they add butter and garlic blend too and toast on the flat-top griddle.

As mentioned at this time the project has not been presented to the Deptford Planning Board but I wouldn’t be surprised to see the meeting scheduled as early as January.

Amazon makes four Kindle models including the new base model Kindle launched late in 2022. There is also the Kindle Paperwhite refreshed in 2021 priced a bit higher. At the high end there are the expensive Kindle Oasis and the gigantic Kindle Scribe.

We find ourselves recommending the basic Kindle and the Paperwhite most often because for the cost they offer the best mix of features that you'll need. Differences in price don't always line up with better specs so if you're deciding between these two ereaders we can help break down the variations.

We'll even look at the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition as well as the Kids editions of every one of these ereaders. The differences there may be worth the price premium for some folks.

Kindle 2022 is better for just reading (Image credit: TechRadar)

All of Amazon's Kindle ereaders are excellent for reading and listening to books. This is because Amazon uses the same E Ink technology across the range. No matter which Kindle you're reading from the inexpensive basic Kindle through the massive new Kindle Scribe you'll have a gray scale screen with 300 ppi resolution. That's more sharp than even the best iPad tablet and Kindle screens specialize at fonts and text.

Because of the way e ink screens work the battery on a Kindle can last a terrifically long time. Expect weeks of use if you read for a half hour or so every day. Also books and text take up significantly less storage space than just about any other content. Even on a low-capacity Kindle you will be able to store thousands of books.

These are some of the best Kindles around and Amazon can be aggressive with sales and price cuts. We will keep our eyes open for great deals and when it's time to make a decision you can come here for our breakdown as we compare the newest ereaders in our Amazon Kindle vs. Kindle Paperwhite showdown.

Amazon Kindle vs Kindle Paperwhite: Design

The differences are subtle (Image credit: TechRadar)

The Kindle family is all about reading so both the Kindle 2022 and the Kindle Paperwhite give you a nice screen and nothing to distract you from it. The Paperwhite display is a bit larger and it sits flush with the surface of the device making it feel more like a piece of paper when hold it. The Kindle 2022 has a larger ridge around the display and the screen is nearly an inch smaller diagonally.

The biggest difference in design and perhaps the most important overall difference between the Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite is that the Paperwhite is water resistant. You can read with it in the bathtub. It can even handle a splash of salt water at the beach something water resistant phones would never allow.

The Paperwhite's bezels are flush with its screen. (Image credit: Future)

The two devices are the same thickness and the extra weight on the Paperwhite seems to come only from having the larger display. Neither has an advantage here and if you'd like a device that is thin and light you have to jump all the way up to the ultra-premium Kindle Oasis.

You can get the Kindle in black or denim blue while the Paperwhite is only available in black. There are tons of cases available for both devices but it's still a shame Amazon doesn't provide more options out of the box.

Both the Kindle and the Kindle Paperwhite charge via USB-C. There is no charger included in the box but you do get a USB-C cable.

Amazon Kindle vs Kindle Paperwhite: Display

The Kindle Paperwhite used to have a sharper screen than the basic Kindle but the latest Kindle 2022 update endowed the base model with an e ink display capable of 300 ppi resolution the same as every other Kindle. That means the text will look as crisp as paper even on the cheapest device.

The Paperwhite does have more LED backlights behind the screen. Amazon says the Kindle 2022 has 4 LEDs while the Kindle Paperwhite uses 17 LEDs for brightness. Presumably more LED means more light and that's the way the ereaders appear as well.

Kindle Paperwhite screen is brighter (Image credit: Future)

The Paperwhite is much more bright than the basic Kindle and it made a difference no matter when we were reading whether at night or in the daytime.

Speaking of night time reading the Paperwhite can also change the glow of the backlight making it warmer for better night reading. You can eliminate the blueish cast from the screen if you choose.

For an upgrade you can go for the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition which not only has the warm light option it can also automatically adjust and adapt as needed. The other Kindle and Paperwhite models cannot do this. Otherwise the Signature screen is the same.

Amazon Kindle vs Kindle Paperwhite: Specifications

The Kindle Paperwhite is the obvious spec winner over the Kindle 2022 except in storage capacity. Inexplicably when Amazon updated the Kindle in 2022 it gave the base model twice the storage as before which also placed it above the basic Paperwhite. The Kindle has 16GB of storage while the Paperwhite only has 8GB.

The Paperwhite Signature edition has a whopping 32GB of storage. All of these Kindles can carry thousands of ebook titles so why is storage important? Because of Audible and audiobooks.

Audiobook files are many times larger than a simple book. If you're only going to be reading with your Kindle and you don't plan on storing a lot of audio content on it the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite will be enough for you. If you use Audible for podcasts you'll want a Kindle that is larger on the inside.

Both Kindle and Paperwhite use USB-C for charging (Image credit: TechRadar)

Otherwise there are no surprises in the Paperwhite's advantages over the Kindle. It has a larger display which makes it a larger device. That means there is also a larger battery inside so you can expect more longevity. Amazon says the Paperwhite will last for 10 weeks of casual reading while the Kindle 2022 will last for 6 weeks. The difference is almost laughable when we're charging our phone headphones and watch on a daily basis.

If you spring for the Kindle Paperwhite Signature edition you can charge the ereader wirelessly using any Qi-enabled wireless charger. It may seem like a strange feature on a device that charges once every three months but the Signature seems aimed at Audible users who will also tax the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities more heavily thus draining more power.

Amazon Kindle vs Kindle Paperwhite: Price

The Amazon Kindle starts at £84.99 / $89.99 today at least. Amazon Kindle pricing can be volatile and Amazon loves to use its own devices as bait for its big sale days. As we prepared this story the price dropped $5 in the US. Kindle pricing is like the weather in Boston; if you don't like it just wait a moment and it will change.

The Kindle Paperwhite starts at £129.99 / $109.99. All of these prices are for ereaders that show ads on the lock screen when you are not reading. It's a weird and frankly tacky way for Amazon to shave $10 or so off the price but it doesn't change the ereader experience so we think it's worth accepting the eyesore.

Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (Image credit: Future)

In Australia you can only get a version of the Kindle without advertisements. Kindle pricing in Australia was unavailable at press time as all of the devices show up sold out at Amazon so we suspect Amazon is making some changes to pricing behind the scenes.

You can also upgrade the storage on the Kindle Paperwhite for £20 / $15 to 16GB. If you're only reading books that upgrade is not worth the extra cost as you'll have plenty to read with only 8GB and you can swap any time you have a Wi-Fi connection.

If you're an audio fan you should probably consider upgrading to the 32GB Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition instead of just upgrading to 16GB of storage on the Paperwhite. It's another £30 / $20 but you get quadruple the original 8GB storage and that's still much cheaper than the Kindle Oasis which costs £229.99 / $199.99.

Both of these Kindle devices come in a ""Kids"" flavor . The Kindle Kids and Paperwhite Kids cost a bit more but the device is exactly the same. What you get is a colorful cover that your kid may enjoy and a year's subscription to Amazon Kids+.

If you're starved for content Kids+ will help. On the other hand if you already have plenty of books you love and own Kids+ will feel limited so you're better off just buying your own cover and sticking with your own titles.

We think the Kindle Kids and Kindle Paperwhite Kids upgrade is worthwhile only if you have an idea what Amazon Kids+ content you like. You can find cheaper cases that your kids might like more and there are no other value additions.

Amazon Kindle vs Kindle Paperwhite: Verdict

(Image credit: TechRadar)

The recent update to the Kindle 2022 made the base model ereader a much easier choice than the more expensive Kindle Paperwhite but pay attention to Amazon sales and special deals because the Paperwhite is worth the upgrade.

If you want to read in a bathtub or by the sea you need a Kindle Paperwhite. The IPX8 water resistance is worth the extra cost if you like to luxuriate in bubbles while reading your favorite mysteries.

The upgrade options including the Kindle Kids and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition are hard to recommend except in special cases. If you listen to a lot of Audible content the extra space on the Paperwhite Signature will be appreciated. If your kids need a heap of books for long trips Kids+ will be fun to peruse.

Amazon is aggressive with deals and the Paperwhite is getting older so we'd follow along for price cuts and bundles as an update is imminent. Most folks will be happy reading with a Kindle 2022 but seafarers and bathers will need the Paperwhite. Either way you get the same sharp e ink long battery and complete Amazon library.

That is the question Duby Trevino of Parlier is asking herself after watching a FedEx delivery driver toss her deliveries outside her home.

Earlier this week Trevino received the first of three packages delivered by the same FedEx delivery person. After watching surveillance footage she noticed the package was placed in the corner of the house as opposed to the entrance of her home's doorway. That first package delivery was two 32"" television sets.

""I've received TVs before and mattresses and they've always delivered the packages to the door so it's more hidden"" said Trevino.

The following day Trevino heard a loud noise.



""I noticed there was a package by the tree by the driveway. I walked out and noticed it was by the tree. I was a little bit upset about it"" said Trevino.

That loud noise was the delivery of the second package containing a bed.

Following the second delivery Trevino decided to call FedEx Customer Service. She explained her confusion as to why the driver would leave the package at the corner of the home instead of her home's entryway.



During the third delivery Trevino was notified by her neighbor to come home from a holiday parade to check on the most recent delivery. She searched through her home surveillance footage and noticed the delivery person kicking the package out from the truck.

The third delivery was a memory foam mattress. The delivery driver left the third package in the previous location as the second delivery.

That evening Trevino called the same FedEx Customer Service number.

The following day Fresno's FedEx Customer Service contacted Trevino to follow-up with her and reassured her that FedEx would follow-up with the driver with a conversation.



""If anybody else is having issues with this particular driver maybe he shouldn't be driving maybe he should be working in a warehouse. Maybe he shouldn't be handling packages"" said Trevino.

She is worried if others share her same experience and decide to reorder any of their damaged goods will those items be in stock and if so will the item delivery arrive in time for Christmas?

Trevino does not currently have any outstanding delivery items she is waiting on.

""I'm not saying he should be fired. That's pretty disrespectful. You pay money for your stuff"" said Trevino.

FedEx wouldn't reveal to WFAA when Horner started driving for the company.

DALLAS Texas — A Dallas contracting company that hired capital murder suspect Tanner Horner to drive for FedEx has yet to provide details about the 31-year-old's employment history or any hiring protocols he had to pass to drive for the shipping giant.

Horner is charged with capital murder and aggravated kidnapping after telling investigators that he backed into 7-year-old Athena Strand while delivering a Christmas package to her home in Wise County last Wednesday.

Per his confession Horner panicked about the consequences of the accident and abducted little Athena only to strangle her and dump her body in a rural part of Boyd.

The contracting company that hired Horner 'Big Topspin Inc.' was named in his arrest warrant and aided in his arrest per investigators.

The address for the company was also listed in the documents and led WFAA to a four-bedroom home in North Dallas off River Hill Drive.

When WFAA arrived at the home a woman who lived there could not comment about Horner's employment history or Strand's death but confirmed her husband owned the company.

Contact information for WFAA was passed along and a representative has yet to reach out about the mentioned inquiries.

Across the country FedEx relies on its 6000 contractors that provide package pickup and delivery services using their employees.

Per a FedEx spokesperson ""The employees of these service provider companies are subject to criminal history background checks as part of the driver eligibility process. As is common across the industry and considered standard employment practice the background check process is administered by a third party.""

Horner has no known criminal history and FedEx didn't elaborate when asked questions about his employment.

This week WFAA reached out to the shipping giant and asked how long Horner had been contracted to work with FedEx when he began driving for the company how many drivers are contracted through Big Topspin and what FedEx's prescribed hiring protocols are for Big Topspin.

The spokesperson replied ""Service provider companies utilize their own employees vehicles and equipment. As such we are not at liberty to discuss details of personnel employed by service providers.""

These are all questions that attorneys for Strand's mother Maitlyn Gandy will likely start asking too.

Gandy announced Thursday at a press conference in Wise County that Varghese Summersett of Fort Worth was representing her.

Attorneys for the firm revealed they would be investigating the situation and were prepared to hold anyone accountable for Athena's death responsible.

That might very well end up being FedEx. But how could that play out litigiously?

Attorney Mike Lyons of Lyons & Simmons LLP in Dallas has been extensively speaking with WFAA on this topic.

He reached a hefty settlement with Charter Communications after a third-party cable installer raped a 72-year-old woman with Alzheimer's in Dallas in 2017.

Lyons has also been in court with FedEx before.

""Companies have really slick good-looking policies on paper and they're great theoretical constructs. The question is whether or not in practice they're actually doing what they say they should be doing"" Lyons said.

""If this guy is going to show up in your front yard he needs to be properly vetted trained and someone needs to make sure that this guy is not some type of threat. The big question is how does this guy end up driving for FedEx and what is his past?""

Lyons said most don't realize that people delivering packages for FedEx don't actually work for the company but still wear their logo as a third-party driver.

""The guy behind the wheel may not be an employee -- he may be some guy working for some other contractor"" Lyons said.

And even so FedEx may face liability for what happened to little Athena -- even if Horner had no criminal past and he belonged to a third-party contractor.

Lyons' most important question if he were on the case was whether Horner or Big Topspin was fit to be contractors for the company in the first place.

""There's law in Texas that says if you don't exercise reasonable diligence in hiring a contractor and you hire someone who's unfit then you may have liability"" Lyons said.

""FedEx requires guidelines procedures and protocols where they are exercising control over their contractor. Otherwise they can't have these guys driving around in their trucks. You either are or you aren't controlling the details of their work. And if it turns out that they are whether through their hiring practices or their supervision they may have liability.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvd2FyZWhvdXNlLXJvYm90cy1hbWF6b24tc3BhcnJvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The battle between robots and humans reaches a 'turning point',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvd2FyZWhvdXNlLXJvYm90cy1hbWF6b24tc3BhcnJvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B010596B60>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

#justiceforathena a new hashtag has gone viral on TikTok after 7-year-old Athena Strand was kidnapped and murdered by a FedEx driver after he delivered her Christmas presents. FedEx and other delivery drivers have been filming themselves with the caption ""Your children are safe on my route #justiceforathena.""





On November 30 2022 Texas girl Athena Strand was kidnapped and murdered by 31-year-old Tanner Horner. The police were called to investigate and FedEx helped in locating and identifying him. He was caught a few days later and confessed to his crimes.





On December 7 2022 TikTok user @knightzkikz filmed himself working in the back of his delivery truck using the hashtag #justiceforathena and the caption ""Your babys are safe on my route."" The video accumulated over 10 million views in just two days.





@knightzkikz Protect them at all cost she did not deserve that..As a father of a beautiful boy and girl your babys are safe in my route.#Athena #Fedexground #justiceforathena #kids #fyp ♬ Dancing in the Sky - Dani and Lizzy









Over the following days many other delivery drivers not just from FedEx made their own videos copying knightzkikz style all under the same hashtag. The support was overwhelming with every video getting millions of views and being shared throughout the internet.













Drivers want to ensure that families are safe during deliveries and that this was not a common occurrence at their jobs. Athena's kidnapping was a horrific event that should never have happened in the first place and puts a bad image of delivery drivers in the eyes of parents."

For her contributions to science Google has dedicated an animated Doodle to mark what would have been her 122nd birthday on Monday. The Doodle demonstrates just a few of the ways we can harness solar energy including her inventions of a solar oven solar heating system and a solar-powered desalination unit for making seawater potable.

Born in Budapest on Dec. 12 1900 Telkes earned a bachelor's degree and Ph.D in chemistry from the University of Budapest before moving to the US in 1924 to become a biophysicist at Westinghouse where she worked on metal alloys for helping convert heat into electricity. In 1939 she went to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where she joined the university's Solar Energy Conversion Project.

During World War II the US government recruited Telkes to develop a solar-powered water desalination machine -- a lifesaving invention that allowed soldiers to have safe drinking water in situations where access was difficult or non-existent. After the war she returned to MIT becoming an associate research professor in 1945.

While at MIT she designed a solar heating system for the Dover Sun House the first livable building ever heated entirely by the sun. She went on to work at New York University where she developed a solar-powered oven still in use today that allows people who lack access to electricity to prepare warm meals.

In 1952 she was the first recipient of the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award. In 2012 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

Telkes died in 1995 at the age of 94 while making her first visit to her hometown of Budapest since moving to the US seven decades earlier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmkyNG5ld3MudHYvZW4vbmV3cy9pc3JhZWwvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvMTY3MDY4ODc1Ny1iZWRvdWlucy10by1wbGF5LWltcG9ydGFudC1yb2xlLWluLWlzcmFlbC1zLWVuZXJneS1yZXZvbHV0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Israel: Bedouins Have Important Role In Energy Revolution - I24NEWS,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWF1dHlwYWNrYWdpbmcuY29tL2NvbnRlbnRzL3ZpZXdfYnJlYWtpbmctbmV3cy8yMDIyLTEwLTEyL2x1eGUtc2tpbmNhcmUtdG9vbC1sYXVuY2hlcy1hLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyZWQtMjRrLWdvbGQtcGxhdGVkLWZhY2lhbC1ndWEtc2hhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Luxe Skincare Tool Launches—a Solar-Powered 24K Gold-Plated Facial Gua Sha,"Omni Hiraya a Filipina-owned lifestyle brand has launched what it says is the world's first solar-powered 24-Karat gold-plated facial gua sha called the Ginto Facial Sculpting Tool.It is designed as ""a way to make a luxurious skincare routine accessible"" the brand states.The Ginto a compact way to deliver a microcurrent to the skin is Omni Hiraya's debut product.

partners bp Alternative Energy Trinidad and Tobago (bpATT) Shell Renewables Caribbean (Shell) and Lightsource bp have completed negotiations on the development of a 112MWac/148MWp solar project.

The project is a significant milestone for the future of Trinidad and Tobago’s energy transition as the first large-scale solar project.

Reaching agreement with the government enabled consortium partners to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) to commence construction on the project with bp and Shell initially having joint shareholdings (50/50).

bp and Shell have signed a binding heads of terms agreement with the National Energy Corporation of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (a state-owned agency committed to supporting the sustainable development of the Trinidad and Tobago energy industry) or its affiliate for the option to take up a shareholding in the project.

Global solar leader Lightsource bp has successfully brought the project from inception to FID and will provide the construction management services.

The project is located across two sites Brechin Castle (92MWac/122MWp) and Orange Grove (20MWac/26MWp).

Construction is set to commence on both sites in Q1 2023 and expected to be operational in Q3 and Q4 2024.

At the Orange Grove site bp and Shell will collaborate with the University of the West Indies (UWI).

The partners joined forces in response to the Trinidad and Tobago Government’s Request For Proposal (RFP) for projects to underpin the country’s commitment to the Paris Agreement to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 15% in the Power Generation sector by 2030.

The projects will produce 302500MWh of renewable electricity a year – that’s enough to power the equivalent of 42500 homes and save 165500 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually.

This is the first time the consortium of bp Shell and Lightsource bp has ever worked together on a joint project.

With the experience of bp and Shell as major operators in Trinidad and Tobago’s energy industry combined with Lightsource bp’s global solar expertise the group represents the huge potential to accelerate the energy transition through collaboration.

Kareen Boutonnat Lightsource bp’s CEO of EMEA and APAC added: “This consortium is a clear demonstration of how energy companies can combine experience and skill sets to support national decarbonization targets. We’re proud to apply our development engineering finance and new market entry experience to realise Trinidad and Tobago’s large-scale solar ambitions through this partnership and act as an enabler for the

country’s energy transition.”

David Campbell bp Trinidad and Tobago president said: ""We are proud to join our partners in the development of Trinidad and Tobago’s first commercial scale renewable energy project. We have been in T&T for over 50 years and are excited by the opportunity to support the country as it transitions to a lower carbon future. This is a significant milestone for the country as it has the potential to unlock future investments in renewable energy. In pursuing this activity through collaboration we are able to leverage the strengths of Lightsource bp bp and Shell for the benefit of T&T.”

“This project underscores Shell’s commitment to helping Trinidad and Tobago’s move towards a low-carbon energy future” said Eugene Okpere Shell’s Senior Vice President and Country Chair.

“This solar project will supply the first green electrons to the grid and is a significant step in the country’s Energy Transition journey.

Collectively Government private sector and academia brought new perspectives to help chart new territory for this country’s renewable energy future and we look forward to what will come.”

I use to see areas on Jamuna River and I couldn't believe people were actually living in these areas. How were they managing life stuck on those islands? What is the opportunity that they had in their life? What would happen to the children? There was not even a shop on these islands no electricity no doctor. I said this is the place to come because there was just no opportunity here. I decided to take up our work there.”

“I started using a lot of pro bono help for people. Companies gave us money friends gave us money to maintain the ship until it could be converted. Unilever finally gave the budget and then we had the ship converted and taken to these islands. Of course in the meanwhile I had to make an NGO. I realised it was extremely difficult to work with international NGOs (INGOs) and big organisations. Everybody came in with a certain mandate and way of doing things. Sometimes NGOs would come with relief programmes in one or two islands and then be gone. But I knew it wouldn’t work. You needed everything there in an atypical way.”

“There is no innovation in healthcare” Runa says “There is no innovation in education. So I started on the system innovation. International NGOs all have different mandates – they will do only education or only primary health care or only awareness or only issues of women and children. That will not work. You can’t leave half the population and give service to half. You can’t leave the children and only take care of the mothers. If an old man is sick you have to take him to hospital. I said I am going to do what is right and then I am going to see where I get the money from. I tried hard.”

She continues “I remember we had 700 cataract patients. There were children. Children get a lot of congenital cataract in these areas. There were old men. There were a lot of young men who were income earners. All of them were cataract blind. I went to an international organisation that deals with eye operations. They told me that they needed to do a baseline survey. I said we have the patients we have the hospital we have everything we just need money for a doctor to do the operations. The baseline survey was going to cost half our budget. I could give them the list. Our eye technician has passed out from Aurobindo in India. He could detect cataracts. And the doctor would check too. But they said no. I said this is not going to work. I decided that the donors needed to see where the real needs are. The operating modality has to be set by us to make it real.”"

“Protecting the energy grid and providing our customers with reliable power is a top priority for FirstEnergy” the company said in a statement. “A wide variety of surveillance deterrence physical and technology measures are in place and we continually invest to ensure our protective measures are robust.”

FirstEnergy says it also participates in drills throughout the year to make sure it can respond and restore power quickly in the wake of an incident.

Federal intelligence officials are watching for these types of events. A memo last year from the FBI Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center said a drone found crashed near a Pennsylvania power station in 2020 was likely an attempted attack.

Pennsylvania’s utility regulator says it requires companies to have security and emergency response plans.

“The physical security of critical infrastructure and systems is an important part of every utility’s planning and operation” said Gladys Brown Dutrieuille chair of the state Public Utility Commission. “As part of their planning PUC-regulated utilities regularly certify that they have physical security cybersecurity and emergency response plans in-place and that those plans are regularly reviewed updated and tested.”

Brown Dutrieuille said the PUC partners with utilities law enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor these types of incidents and use the information in future planning.

BRATENAHL Ohio — Seven cars were involved in three separate crashes early Sunday morning on I-90 East near East 105th Street in Bratenahl.

The incident happened at around 1:41 a.m. when Bratenahl Police Officers responded to an initial two-vehicle rollover crash.

Moments later a second crash happened after two vehicles attempted to avoid the initial crash.

As officers responded to the crash scene a vehicle went to the side of the road at high speed striking an unoccupied Bratenahl police car.

Body camera video shows Sgt. Ryan Durand spotting a car coming at officers at full speed. Durand runs to the side of the road escaping just in time as the car plowed into the cruiser. After hitting the police cruiser the vehicle struck a truck which rolled over.

Bratenahl Police told 3News that the driver who struck the police car 23-year-old Anita Locke of Euclid was arrested and is being charged with operating a vehicle under the influence (OVI) after having an alcohol level twice the legal limit. Officers say Locke blamed them for ""parking on the highway.""

According to Bratenahl Police Cleveland EMS took four adults with non-life-threatening conditions to University Hospital Cleveland Medical Center.

No officers were injured in the incident.

It was almost a tragic déjà vu for first responders including Cleveland firefighters at the scene. It was near the same spot where the Cleveland Division of Fire's Johnny Tetrick was fatally struck by an accused drunk driver last month.

The three-mile stretch of I-90 in Bratenahl is notoriously nicknamed ""The Bermuda Triangle"" by police. Drivers have hit officers seven times since 2019 at least five of those vehicle operators were impaired.

So far this year 46 first responders have been killed after being struck by a vehicle according to data from the Emergency Responder Safety Institute. It's a sobering statistic that doesn't include the near-misses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbGFycnlicm93bnNwb3J0cy5jb20vZm9vdGJhbGwvb2RlbGwtYmVja2hhbS1qci1leHBsYWlucy13aHktaGUtd291bGRudC1wbGF5LXRoaXMtcmVndWxhci1zZWFzb24vNjA4NDI00gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9sYXJyeWJyb3duc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9mb290YmFsbC9vZGVsbC1iZWNraGFtLWpyLWV4cGxhaW5zLXdoeS1oZS13b3VsZG50LXBsYXktdGhpcy1yZWd1bGFyLXNlYXNvbi82MDg0MjQ_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Odell Beckham Jr. explains why he wouldn’t play this regular season,"Odell Beckham Jr. explains why he wouldn’t play this regular season

Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. is back in Arizona after making several free agent visits in recent weeks. He’s said to be deciding between the New York Giants Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys but nothing has been finalized to date.

And it may not be for quite some time.

Beckham refused to work out for any of the three teams during his visits and concerns about his health have arisen. OBJ is just 10 months removed from an ACL tear and although cleared likely won’t be able to step onto the field until mid-January. That has given some of the teams pause.

But Beckham doesn’t quite understand it. In his mind there’s no point in returning during the regular season. Rather he has his sights set on the playoffs.

“I haven’t made the decision” Beckham said during a Thursday night appearance on ‘The Shop.’ “I would like to be in a stable environment. Get up at 6 a.m. leave at 6 p.m. for four weeks and then let’s talk about it. I’ve played football for a long time. I’m not saying I couldn’t step in and play [in the] regular season but I don’t see the point. I really don’t. I’d rather play when that pressure’s on.”

For the Cowboys Bills and Giants the pressure is already on. All three teams are fighting for their playoff lives in quality divisions and could use the help of a healthy Beckham.

Ultimately however this is a business decision for Beckham. He’s coming off a serious injury and doesn’t want to hurt future value by rushing back onto the field.",,,,,,

A new report found ""massive and expanding"" links between major car companies and China's Xinjiang region.

The Chinese government has been accused of committing human rights abuses in the region.

Similar accusations have been made in the past against Apple Amazon and Nike.

If you bought a car recently some of its parts may have been made through forced labor in China.

That was the key finding of a six-month investigation undertaken by researchers from Britain's Sheffield Hallam University. In a new report the researchers say their analysis of publicly available documents revealed ""massive and expanding links"" between major car companies and China's Xinjiang region where evidence has emerged of human-rights abuses committed by the Chinese government against Uyghur Muslims including forced labor government surveillance forced sterilization and re-education camps. Some have called it a ""genocide.""

The 78-page report says ""every major car brand"" — including the likes of Ford GM Tesla and Toyota — are at ""high risk"" of sourcing parts from companies linked to these human rights abuses.

""There was no part of the car we researched that was untainted by Uyghur forced labor"" the team's lead researcher Laura Murphy told The New York Times. ""It's an industry-wide problem.""

A year ago the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act was signed into law which banned US imports of products made wholly or partly in the Xinjiang region unless the company could prove they were not using forced labor. Since going into effect in June customs officials say they've stopped 2200 shipments — valued at over $728 million — from entering the US.

Car companies contacted by The Times ""did not contradict the report"" but said they were committed to ensuring their supply chains were free of human rights abuses. Insider reached out to Ford GM Tesla and Toyota for comment.

In a statement GM said ""We actively monitor our global supply chain and conduct extensive due diligence particularly where we identify or are made aware of potential violations of the law our agreements or our policies"" adding that its supplier code of conduct clearly prohibits any forced labor or abusive treatment of workers.

Ford Tesla and Toyota did not respond as of publication time.

""It is not impossible to audit one's supply chain to identify risks""

The auto industry's supply chains are ""closer to a ball of spaghetti than a linear chain"" Simon Croom professor of supply chain management at the University of San Diego told Insider. The average automaker may have links to as many as 18000 suppliers including their direct suppliers the suppliers of those suppliers and so on.

The Sheffield Hallam report lists roughly 200 companies in China and across the globe with potential links to Xinjiang where steel copper aluminum batteries and other components are produced.

Croom who previously worked for Jaguar and wrote his PhD dissertation on auto supply chains says he believes many supply chains — both in the car industry and elsewhere — have connections to forced labor in the region.

""I have been in no doubt that many supply chains incur forced and slave/sweat labor in their upstream tiers"" he said ""and it is very clear the auto industry is one such example.""







Per Croom while many companies claim to lack full insight into their supply chains ""it is not impossible to audit one's supply chain to identify risks.""

""There is no reason why auto manufacturers or other OEM companies cannot verify their supply lines"" he said ""and I firmly believe the lack of transparency is a thing of the past and thus OEMs are willfully ignoring such abusive suppliers.""

Susan Golicic however a supply chain professor at Colorado State University who previously worked at Chrysler says that while she can't speak to the report's claims specifically it can be challenging for companies to keep a full grasp on their extensive supply chains.

""When suppliers are beyond the third tier it is often tough for the OEMs to keep track of what they are doing as well as even who and where they are"" she told Insider. ""Some suppliers can be very small and may lack technology to easily communicate or provide transparency into the front end of the supply chain.""

In response to supply chain challenges during the pandemic many companies have taken steps to ""onshore"" ""friendshore"" or ""nearshore"" — parts of their supply chains moving them back to the US to countries that are political allies or to countries that are closer geographically.

But while these shifts could provide companies greater transparency into their supply chains many are likely to retain global exposure in the decades to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyaXZpbmdsaW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9idWlsdC10by1vcmRlci1leHBsb3Jlci1vdXItYmxhY2stb24tYmxhY2stdHdpbi10dXJiby1zdC1hcnJpdmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Built-To-Order Explorer: Our Black-On-Black Twin-Turbo ST Arrives,"Built-To-Order Explorer: Our Black-On-Black Twin-Turbo ST Arrives

December 10 2022

Story By Mike McGlothlin

After six months of waiting our built-to-order Ford Explorer ST is here. And just like that this family of five is much more inclined to go on a road trip find a reason (any reason) to cruise up town or run a “quick” errand. From weekend getaways to shuttling the kids to practice the twin turbo Ecoboost V-6 the 10-speed transmission the ergonomics and the sporty suspension make the Explorer ST more than just a run-of-the-mill sport utility—it’s a performance SUV in every sense of the word. At the same time it’s highly practical. Compact enough to fit in any standard garage ample space to accommodate adults in the second-row and technologically on pace (if not ahead of the curve) with every competitor in its class.

The final act in our built-to-order process began with Ford letting us know our Explorer had been built trekking over to our local dealer to take delivery making sure we got the exact SUV we ordered and driving off into the sunset. No surprise fees extra paperwork or gimmicks just a straightforward business transaction that ended with all parties satisfied. This time we’re detailing the conclusion of our car-buying process: taking delivery the new-car smell exterior and interior walk-arounds features and first impressions. If you’re considering the built-to-order approach hopefully our experience will be enough to convince you to pull the trigger. We have zero regrets and you likely won’t either.

The Final Letter From Ford

As an automotive enthusiast with Blue Oval leanings there is nothing quite like seeing an email from Ford Motor Company in your inbox. At the time this note was received we were well-beyond the 45-day updates we’d been getting as Ford had already scheduled our Explorer’s production date. The words YOUR VEHICLE HAS BEEN BUILT said it all and an almost-unbearable waiting game of taking ownership began. Our Explorer ST rolled off of the line at the Chicago Assembly Plant on October 14th nearly six months to the day after ordering it through our local dealership.

Exterior Walk-Through

Our first meeting with the Agate Black Metallic Explorer ST entailed a walk-around of the exterior. We quickly spotted the 21x9-inch aluminum wheels with 275/45R21 all season tires the vented brake rotors and the red painted calipers that are part of the ST Street Pack as well as the Class IV receiver hitch LED tail and fog lamps and quad tip dual exhaust that come standard. We then verified that the remote start system worked and configured the SecuriCode keyless entry keypad with our preferred numbers. Immediately we noticed the projection LED lights positioned within the sideview mirrors that illuminate the “ST” logo on the ground which we were pleasantly surprised to learn is standard equipment.

A Look Inside

Entering the cockpit we were greeted by the sport bucket heated leather front seats with Miko perforated inserts the 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster the leather-wrapped and heated steering wheel and the 8-inch infotainment touchscreen. Because we opted for Equipment Group 400A rather than 401A to save a few bucks ($4995 to be exact) our built-to-order Explorer is about as budget-friendly as it gets. But despite being conservative with our options we still got Ford’s Co-Pilot 360 technology and all the benefits that go along with it such as automatic high beams lane-keeping assist blind spot information system and hill descent control. The power lift gate and integrated second-row sun visors were more or less icing on the cake.

Brand-Spanking New

Road trip time. Our first impression from behind the wheel—other than the fact that the little EcoBoost could easily hurt some feelings—was that the brakes were exceptionally powerful. This portion of the Street Pack which includes rear rotors that measure 1.25-inches larger in diameter and front rotors measuring ¾-inches larger than standard Explorer equipment was well worth the money. As it pertains to the digital gauge cluster pictured above we immediately put the ST’s mpg coach function to use on the drive home. We also put the heated steering wheel to use right away which has been extremely convenient with the onset of a Midwest winter.

EcoBoosted

We won’t lie. Twin turbos 400 hp and 415 lb-ft of torque in an SUV in the $50000 range is what got us to this point. No other vehicle in this segment offers you this much fun-factor for that kind of price. The 3.0L aluminum DOHC EcoBoost V-6 produces its 400 ponies at 5500 rpm but its torque curve is equally impressive if not more so. Torque peaks quickly at 3500 rpm but holds fairly flat making at least 350 lb-ft or more until 4500 rpm. The EcoBoost’s pairing with the 10R60 10-speed automatic transmission is silky smooth and always seems to be in the right gear. Without a doubt the Explorer ST feels like the high 13-second SUV many claim it is—but we’ll find out for sure with a visit to the local drag strip once spring arrives.

3 Rows

All performance aspects aside the driving force behind the purchase of our Explorer ST is on full display here: three row seating. Opting for second-row captain’s chairs lowered overall occupancy to six (as opposed to seven with the 35/30/35 bench option) but it definitely helps open up the floor plan in the back. For a young family the Explorer accommodates three little ones sufficiently although a growing teenager might not appreciate long rides in the third row. Cargo space beyond the 50/50 third row is tight for luggage but folding one seat forward (manually in our case) opens up another 24 cubic feet of room.

Built-To-Order Was The Right Choice

As we’ve said before if you can tolerate waiting the built-to-order car buying experience is the way to go. In the current automotive landscape it may also be the only way to get all the options you want in a vehicle. Working with an honorable dealership is part of the deal too and it would feel criminal not to call out Morrow Brothers Ford for their work in making our Explorer ST possible. Through them our price was locked in at the time we ordered and we avoided any dealership market adjustments or chasing down an ST at a faraway location. From wire to wire the small-town Ford dealership—which has been in business since the Model T was in production—treated us like family.

Wheel & Tire Plans

Now for a little after-the-sale love. While we like the factory 21-inch wheels their oddball-ish diameter makes running our favorite tread impossible. We’ve got our eyes on a set of Vossen Wheels’ gloss black Hybrid Forged HF-5’s measuring 22x10-inches which we’ll wrap in Nitto NT420V all seasons. A wider tire will aid cornering—and a broader footprint will only work to improve our four-wheel drive launches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mb3JkLWZ1c2lvbi1hY3RpdmUtbWF5LW5vdC1oYXBwZW4tYWZ0ZXItYWxsL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mb3JkLWZ1c2lvbi1hY3RpdmUtbWF5LW5vdC1oYXBwZW4tYWZ0ZXItYWxsL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Fusion Active May Not Happen After All,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://fordauthority.com/2022/12/ford-fusion-active-may-not-happen-after-all/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mb3JkLWZ1c2lvbi1hY3RpdmUtbWF5LW5vdC1oYXBwZW4tYWZ0ZXItYWxsL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mb3JkLWZ1c2lvbi1hY3RpdmUtbWF5LW5vdC1oYXBwZW4tYWZ0ZXItYWxsL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvbmV3cy9saXZlcnBvb2wtbmV3cy9oZXJlcy13aGF0LWdvZXMtZ2lhbnQtZm9yZC0yNTcxNzMxONIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvbmV3cy9saXZlcnBvb2wtbmV3cy9oZXJlcy13aGF0LWdvZXMtZ2lhbnQtZm9yZC0yNTcxNzMxOC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here’s what goes on at the giant Ford factory in Halewood,"Ford has announced it is investing £125m in its Halewood factory - so after that massive vote of confidence we thought we’d look at what goes on inside.

Earlier this month Ford said it was investing more money in Halewood to secure 500 jobs and get it ready for the company’s transformation into an electric vehicle manufacturer. The move will increase the production of electric power units by 70% as Ford looks to ramp up electric vehicle sales across Europe over the next decade. says the plant is “integral” to its European electrification plans.

When it’s at capacity the new assembly site will make 420000 units every year - equivalent to more than one a minute. We’ve taken a look at the plant’s history what workers are doing now - and what the new investment will mean.

Ford sign still up at Halewood after 50 years

The Ford plant is part of a huge complex at factories at Halewood between Speke Boulevard and the railway line. The biggest and most prominent factory at the Halewood complex is the Jaguar Land Rover plant which today builds vehicles like the Range Rover Evoque.

But when you look at a satellite view of the area you can see the JLR plant is ringed by other factories. The whole complex was built in the early 1960s for Ford which started producing the Ford Anglia at Halewood. The site later became famous for producing Ford Escorts and Capris.

(Image: Andrew Teebay Liverpool Echo)

The plants around the main factory - including the transmission plant - could feed their products directly onto Ford’s production lines. In 2001 the factory at the heart of the Halewood complex began making the X-Type for Jaguar then part of Ford. In 2008 Jaguar Land Rover was sold to Indian giant Tata and it’s JLR branding that dominates Halewood now as you dive past on Speke Boulevard.

But the transmission plant was not part of that deal. At first Ford operated the site in a joint venture with German company Getrag - but in 2021 Ford took back full ownership of the plant securing its future and ensuring the famous blue and white Ford logo would rise over Halewood once again.

Work on existing products still goes on

Visitors to this month’s electric vehicle launch event gathered in a large empty space in the middle of the plant in an area that’s already being readied for the arrival of new equipment. But across the aisles and beyond the draped-off areas work at Ford Halewood is going on as normal while the plant waits for the new equipment to arrive so work on the new e-drives can begin.

The site currently makes transmission systems and gearboxes for Ford’s current range of petrol and diesel vehicles from Fiestas to Transit vans. Those systems are shipped to Ford’s other plants across Europe to be built into finished vehicles.

(Image: Andrew Teebay Liverpool Echo)

The existing line has the capacity to build some 450000 units a year. There will still be demand for those units for years to come especially for van units and so work on the lines will continue - though volumes are falling as the move to electric continues. The plant makes drives for Ford and also can make drives for other manufacturers including for Volvo.

On the ECHO’s visit we saw finished drives being moved around the plant on roller conveyor lines for testing. Each unit is tested by operating it as it would be in a vehicle.

New products will be made alongside the old

Building work has already begun on the sites where the new EV lines will sit as the factory adapts to new technology alongside the old.

Plant manager Lee Meyers who’s leading the move to EVs at Halewood said: “What we’re doing is creating space because we have to operate alongside the ICE (internal combustion engine) business because we still have a very successful ICE business and very good products.

(Image: Andrew Teebay Liverpool Echo)

“As ICE volumes have declined we’re then moving parts of the equipment to make sure that we've got enough room. We've managed to repurpose and move and retool stuff to enable us to make use of the space that we require for EVs.”

EVs may be the plant’s long-term future but those products for petrol and diesel engines will continue to be made - especially for vans. Mr Meyers said: “You've got to bear in mind that particularly your commercial vehicle element of ICE is still going to be around for some time.”

Electric vehicle news will secure the plant’s future

On launch day staff and apprentices excitedly gathered around a concept Ford Transit electric vehicle and listened intently to the announcements about what the electric vehicle push might mean for Halewood. Mr Meyers agreed the news had put a spring in the step of all the plant’s workers.

He said: “It’s a massive boost for the plant. It's investment and it goes further to secure our long term future.

(Image: Andrew Teebay Liverpool Echo)

“For the workers it's kind of the culmination of years of being quite forward thinking and quite entrepreneurial really in trying to win business - both when it was part of a joint venture looking to win business with any OEM but also when this business is with Ford to secure the future for the people that work here.""

The move puts Halewood at the heart of Ford’s electric vehicle strategy. Mr Meyers said: “We want to be able to put ourselves in a position where we can pivot and react to any change in consumer demands that Ford see - so we’re readying ourselves for that.”

Dominion Voting Systems is suing the cable news station and its Murdoch-owned parent company Fox Corp for $1.6bn (£1.3bn) over repeated claims that it rigged its voting machines as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 presidential election from Donald Trump.

The suit shines a spotlight on Fox News’ part in promoting Trump’s “stop the steal” campaign and its hand in driving the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. But legal experts say that Dominion which supplied voting machines to 28 states appears to be building a wider case that Fox News has a long history of misinformation and steamrolling facts that do not fit its editorial line.

Over the past few months Dominion’s lawyers have been working their way up the tree of Fox News producers executives and presenters with interrogations under oath about the network’s work culture and its weeks of conspiratorial and at times outlandish claims about Trump’s defeat. On Monday lawyers deposed Murdoch’s eldest son presumed successor and Fox Corp CEO Lachlan.

Now Dominion has reached the top of the tree. Months of accumulated testimony are expected to put Murdoch the chair of Fox Corp in the difficult position of either having to deny he has control over what happens at his most influential US news operation or defend its campaign to promote the biggest lie in US electoral history.

Murdoch is already grappling with the costly legacy of phone hacking by British newspapers the News of the World and the Sun. His UK company has paid more than £1bn ($1.2bn) over the past decade to keep the gruesome details from being heard in open court with no end in sight after a high court judge earlier this year refused to prevent the filing of new claims.

When Murdoch was called to give evidence to a UK parliamentary hearing in 2011 about News of the World hacking the phones of a murdered schoolgirl as well as hundreds of politicians celebrities and other public figures he said that it was the most humble day of his life. He also claimed to have known nothing about the wrongdoing and said that he had been misled.

“I feel that people I trusted … I’m not saying who … let me down and I think they behaved disgracefully” he told parliament. “And it’s time for them to pay.”

But he can make no such claim about Fox News where its misrepresentations were on full display. So far the only people to pay at the network are the ones who got it right.

The trouble started on election night after Fox called the key swing state of Arizona for Joe Biden. The call drew Trump’s ire and unleashed a backlash against the network from his supporters.

At that point Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott warned against bowing to pressure to embrace an alternate reality and reverse the Arizona call.

“We can’t give the crazies an inch” she said according to court records.

As it turned out “the crazies” took a mile as Fox News put a parade of Trump lawyers advisers and apologists front and centre over the following weeks to promote a myriad of conspiracy theories about how the election was stolen from Trump including by rigging the voting machines.

Alongside them some of Fox’s biggest names took up the cry of fraud. NPR revealed that during the discovery process Dominion acquired an email written by a Fox News producer begging colleagues not to allow one of those presenters Jeanine Pirro on the air because she was spreading conspiracy theories about the vote. Pirro a former district attorney and judge who is close to Trump continued broadcasting.

Lawyers have also obtained rafts of internal messages that are “evidence that Fox knew the lies it was broadcasting about Dominion were false” and part of a culture of politically loaded reporting and broadcasts far from the network’s claim to be “fair and balanced”.

Dominion claims that without Fox “these fictions” about electoral fraud would never have gained the same traction among large number of Americans.

“Fox took a small flame and turned it into a forest fire” the company claims in its lawsuit.

In August lawyers questioned another presenter Sean Hannity who has been described as “part of Trump’s campaign apparatus”. He was grilled for more than seven hours including about a broadcast two weeks after the presidential election in which Trump lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell was a guest.

Powell claimed that Dominion “ran an algorithm that shaved off votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden”. She said the company “used the machines to inject and add massive quantities of votes for Mr Biden”. Powell has also claimed that Dominion used software developed to help the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez steal elections.

Dominion has said that it warned Fox News that such claims were false but that it continued to air them in an attempt to assuage Trump supporters out of concern they would move to other right-wing broadcasters.

“It’s an orchestrated effort” Dominion’s lawyer told a court hearing. “It’s not just on the part of each host individually but it’s across Fox News as a company.”

In a statement to the Guardian a Fox News spokesperson said their position was based on defending freedom of the press. “We are confident we will prevail” they said.

So far the only Fox employees to pay a price for the debacle are those who got it right. Weeks after the election the network fired its political editor Chris Stirewalt who had infuriated Trump and other Republicans by refusing to back down from calling Arizona for Biden. The Washington managing editor Bill Sammon who supported Stirewalt’s decision took retirement.

Fox argues that Hannity and the other presenters are protected by journalistic privilege but that position has been complicated by the Fox host’s own description of his role.

In defending his overt bias in favour of Trump and Republicans Hannity has more than once said he is not a journalist but a talk show host and so does not have to adhere to the profession’s ethical standards. He took the same position earlier this year after the January 6 congressional committee exposed dozens of his messages to Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows offering advice and seeking direction as the White House challenged the presidential election result.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9odW50ZXItYmlkZW4tY291bGQtc3VlLWZveC1uZXdzLWVyaWMtdHJ1bXAtcnVkeS1naXVsaWFuaS1yZXBvcnQtMTc2NjE1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hunter Biden could sue Fox News Eric Trump and Rudy Giuliani: Report,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9odW50ZXItYmlkZW4tY291bGQtc3VlLWZveC1uZXdzLWVyaWMtdHJ1bXAtcnVkeS1naXVsaWFuaS1yZXBvcnQtMTc2NjE1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00FC701F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Unlike the previous version however Garmin's new top-of-the-line running watch now also features a touchscreen - and an enormously complex as well as thoroughly understandable user interface. What I liked: Easy to use user interface.

Can also be operated via buttons only. What I disliked: Display is not very impressive. The Garmin Forerunner 955 comes in just a single size and two different colors: black and white. While the black model is kept completely black Garmin colors the top of the bezel black on the white model. The sports watch is compatible with all 22 mm Quickfit straps opening the doors to a world of customization for you. Compared to modern AMOLED panels the display of the Garmin Forerunner 955 is no beauty - but it is functional. / © NextPit In front is the 1.3-inch touchscreen display with 260 x 260 pixels resolution protected by Corning Gorilla Glass DX. When you compare it to modern smartwatches that have double or even quadruple the resolution the display already looks rather pixelated especially when it comes to looking out for finer detail. Furthermore the transflective MIP panel with 64 colors is not exactly an explosion of colors even though it is partly responsible for the sensational battery life and remains perfectly legible under all light conditions. There are the usual five buttons around the display with the Forerunner 955. On the right you'll find the Start/Stop button at the top and the Back/New Lap button below it. On the left you will find three buttons for light/quick menu up/main menu and down/music control. You can freely configure up to a total of seven shortcuts in the app for example for the Start+Down button or for holding down the Start button. Like most current Garmin sports watches the Forerunner 955 comes with five buttons around the display. / © NextPit What is it that I generally like about Garmin smartwatches? For starters the interface can also be wholly operated via the buttons. You can therefore access all functions even while wearing thick gloves although the touchscreen is of course much more convenient in some cases. This applies to navigation via maps for example but more on that later. What is also nice is this: You can specify for each individual workout whether the touchscreen should be deactivated or not in order to avoid incorrect entries such as when you are swimming. By the way you can also specify each individual workout on which data fields should be displayed here. For example heart rate time endurance running power distance and so on. You can also plaster the watch's face with different data fields accordingly and thus will always have the most important metrics in view. In addition to the standard dials you can find countless other watch faces in the Garmin Connect IQ Store. The Garmin Forerunner 955 offers numerous customization options. / © NextPit The operation of the Forerunner 955 is clearly structured. Starting from the home screen you swipe vertically through a configurable list of widgets that inform you of various details such as the training load VO2Max value sleep quality notifications weather forecast or sun exposure. Alternatively you can also use it for music playback controls. You can always access additional details by tapping the widgets. Behind your VO2Max value for example you'll also find an estimate of your lactate threshold as well as a forecast for current 5K 10K half-marathon and marathon times. You can easily replace the included wristband thanks to a standard quick-release buckle. / © NextPit A long press on the light button on the top left of the Forerunner 955 launches a configurable quick menu with functions like Garmin Pay DND mode find smartphone timer key lock or turn off watch. A long press on the up button opens the main menu with numerous settings for the smartwatch from the alarm clock to the language to the energy-saving profile. Most of these settings can also be found in the Garmin Connect app which is a far more convenient way of managing such operational details. Even though the extremely complex interface seems a bit overwhelming at first due to the extensive range of functions everything is logically structured and easy to find. After a few weeks operating the Forerunner 955 becomes second nature. Systematic problems such as frequent accidental key presses during push-ups or incorrect inputs via the touchscreen did not occur during the review duration which I found to be amazing.

Smartwatch features If there is one aspect where Garmin still has to catch up it is the smartwatch features. While the ConnectIQ store now offers a decent selection of apps the smart features of the Forerunner 955 are not comparable with those of an Apple Watch or Pixel Watch. Garmin Pay is also unfortunately not yet widely supported worldwide. What I liked: ConnectIQ store with many apps and watch faces. What I disliked: Limited bank support on Garmin Pay.

No hands-free function on the smartwatch.

No LTE version available in 2022. The Garmin Forerunner 955 offers most of the industry-standard smartwatch features. At this point I would like to explicitly exclude the Apple Watch as well as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and the Pixel Watch which are miles ahead of all other competitors I know due to their deep integration with iOS and Android respectively. Of course you do receive notifications from the smartphone on the Forerunner 955 and can at least read snippets of WhatsApp or Slack messages. However replying to messages is not possible on the timepiece. However if you delete the notifications on the smartwatch they also disappear on the smartphone (I tested this out on the iPhone). Unlike the Venu 2 Plus (review) the Forerunner 955 neither offers a hands-free function on the wrist nor support for voice assistants. On the Forerunner 955 you have access to Garmin's app store called Connect IQ Store. The best way to do that is via the corresponding app on the smartphone. You will find a really impressive selection of apps here from countless watchfaces to Komoot Spotif and the like. The apps we tested all worked flawlessly. In the store called Garmin Connect IQ you can find numerous apps watchfaces and data fields for the Forerunner 955. / © NextPit You don't need an app for mobile payments because Garmin has its own payment system known as Garmin Pay. Depending on where you live the list of supported banks varies. You will be able to check out whether your bank is supported by Garmin Pay via this list on the Garmin website. Lastly one particular feature in the smartwatch market that plagues many models would be the lack of LTE. While its predecessor the Forerunner 945 from 2019 was available with an optional 4G modem Garmin does without an LTE version for the Forerunner 955. Sure LTE connectivity requires other chipsets LTE comes at the expense of battery life LTE needs another antenna in the case which adds weight and so on. But LTE also has major advantages: from the emergency call function during ultramarathons to paying for your Sunday rolls at the bakery after a pleasant run.

Sensors and tracking The Garmin Forerunner 955 offers more tracking options than almost any other sports watch on the planet - not least thanks to Garmin's large portfolio of accessories. What I liked: Incredible number of sports modes with real added value.

Great metrics for endurance athletes.

Extremely accurate multi-band GPS. What I disliked: Overwhelming number of options.

Many overlapping metrics. The Garmin Forerunner 955 like Garmin's other top-tier watches has such an incredible number of features that even if you're a diverse amateur athlete you won't come close to taking advantage of them. Armed with so many features we can't come close to capturing them all in this review but we will still give it a try. GPS & Navigation One of the highlight features of the Garmin Forerunner 955 is the new multi-band GPS and as a result it has more ways to receive signals from positioning satellites which ultimately increases accuracy. We tested the Garmin Forerunner 955 in direct comparison with the Apple Watch Ultra and the Amazfit GTR 4 which also enables multi-band GPS. In a direct comparison with the Amazfit GTR 4 the GPS tracking on the Forerunner 955 is a tad more accurate. For example the Garmin watch showed better coverage consistency for routes that have been run several times in the forest. By the way Garmin enables multi-band GPS on the Forerunner 955 right out of the box whereas you have to manually activate the feature on the compatible Fenix models. Do take note that multi-band GPS consumes a lot of battery power. According to Garmin the workout runtimes with multi-band GPS and normal GPS are 20 and 31 hours respectively. The Garmin Forerunner 955 performs quite similarly to the Apple Watch Ultra in terms of GPS accuracy which can be seen on the right in the picture during the same section of the run. Sometimes Garmin seems a bit more accurate and sometimes Apple. / © NextPit Another feature of the Forerunner 955 that is worth highlighting: You have 32 GB of space for maps here and only the Sapphire Solar models of the Fenix 7 series offer that much for at least $899.99. You will have access to Garmin's worldwide TopoActive Maps on the top Forerunner but not everything fits on the watch at once. Europe and North America alone take up about 10 GB each. You can then use the maps for turn-by-turn navigation for instance to specific coordinates along imported routes or to POIs in the vicinity. How about having you tell the sports watch: I'd like to run a circuit from here to the north with a total length of 8 kilometers - and the Forerunner 955 generates a suitable running route including turn-by-turn navigation. In addition to TopoActive there are also SkiView and CourseView maps for ski slopes and golf courses. Outdoor sports: from pulse to training readiness You've just seen it in the GPS and Navigation section: The Forerunner 955 is the ultimate sports watch for runners and triathletes respectively. It reflects this not only in its navigational capability but also in terms of body tracking. With Garmin's new Elevate V4 PPT sensor the running watch measures your heart rate and the oxygen saturation in your blood. It also records your breathing rate and heart rate variability. From this measurement data the Garmin Forerunner calculates a huge bunch of other metrics. The most important of these are: Body Battery: Your body's battery so to speak - everyday life discharges it and sleep recharges it. If you have a lot of stress or train hard then the body battery is drained faster. Sufficient and quality sleep ensures that the body battery is full in the morning.

Your body's battery so to speak - everyday life discharges it and sleep recharges it. If you have a lot of stress or train hard then the body battery is drained faster. Sufficient and quality sleep ensures that the body battery is full in the morning. Workout Readiness: How much should you work out today - or rather: Should you exercise at all today? Unlike Body Battery this value focuses more on the physical condition rather than the general condition of the body.

How much should you work out today - or rather: Should you exercise at all today? Unlike Body Battery this value focuses more on the physical condition rather than the general condition of the body. HRV Condition: Heart Rate Variability is a reliable indicator of your current cardiovascular fitness. Intense cardio sessions bring the value down just as much as a party weekend or as in my case right now a cold.

Heart Rate Variability is a reliable indicator of your current cardiovascular fitness. Intense cardio sessions bring the value down just as much as a party weekend or as in my case right now a cold. Training Effect: What is the focus of your training right now: endurance speed or power? You can receive feedback on whether your training is mainly aerobic or anaerobic allowing you to balance your training regime.

What is the focus of your training right now: endurance speed or power? You can receive feedback on whether your training is mainly aerobic or anaerobic allowing you to balance your training regime. Acute Load: You can view a time history of the last workouts and how hard your workouts were over the past few days.

You can view a time history of the last workouts and how hard your workouts were over the past few days. Training Condition: How hard did you train in the last seven days and how well did you recover? This value combines Acute Load HRV Condition Training Effect and VO2Max Trend into one metric and spits out a current diagnosis for you. Among them include Recovery Unproductive or Loaded. The biggest challenge now is: What do I do with all these values? Unfortunately you will have to figure that out for yourself. The body battery and the training readiness are similar and are an indicator of how much strain you should put on yourself in general or physically at the moment. The other four values on the other hand look more into the past and tell you in different ways how you have challenged yourself lately. The Garmin Forerunner 955 offers detailed analyses of your runs. / © NextPit Another exciting feature for endurance athletes is the stamina value. Here the Forerunner 955 calculates how much energy you still have in the tank during the workouts and dares to venture a guess on how long you can still hold out at the current load. During a long-distance run for example you can estimate relatively accurately whether you'll make it to the finish line at your current pace or not. There's also a calendar in which you can enter your planned races in the near future. It is here where you will also receive a time forecast based on your current VO2Max value. If desired the Garmin app can also display the data in a visually arresting format. / © NextPit Of course the Garmin Forerunner 955 mainly relies on the heart rate to record the current load. It is here where the PPT sensor does very well as expected. It is especially pronounced during endurance sports as the wrists are usually not bent and strained too much and hence no major differences are visible in a direct comparison with a chest strap system. Only during interval training can you see that the increase or decrease in heart rate is registered a bit faster using the chest strap system. However this does not have a big impact on the workout's overall balance. In combination with a chest strap you get additional values for running efficiency. / © NextPit You can of course further improve the heart rate measurement with one of the many Garmin chest straps and then also receive additional measurement results to your running efficiency values such as the ground contact time or the vertical movement while running. Indoor sports & fitness Apart from the typical outdoor sports modes for running and cycling the Garmin Forerunner 955 offers countless other sports modes to choose from. In total there are a whopping 51 of them. Unlike many smartwatches ""Strength Training"" does not just change the name stored in the app for the respective strength unit. Instead you get unique evaluations of the muscle load during dumbbell training because the watch recognizes which exercises you perform during the workout and counts the repetitions. You only have to mark the sets and can even enter the weights used if desired. In my smartwatch reviews fitness training is always the acid test for the integrated pulse sensors in smartwatches. Wrists that are bent during push-ups or forearms that are tense during pull-ups hinder the blood flow at the wrist which significantly reduces the measurement quality. The Garmin Forerunner 955 still performs quite well in these tests compared to a chest strap system but it delivers significantly lower values during push-ups for example. On the positive side: The current Garmin watches perform better than all smartwatches that I have reviewed so far - with the exception of the Apple Watch Ultra which actually has slightly more precise measurements and a faster reaction. During strength training (chest training here) the Forerunner 955 automatically recognizes the exercises and visualizes the training load according to muscle groups. / © NextPit When playing golf there are not only maps and details of 42000 golf courses on the globe but also swing tracking. Those are just two of many examples. There are other various hidden features among the sports modes such as turn-by-turn navigation or a feature called Health Snapshot which outlines your current state of health within two minutes based on stress level heart rate and heart rate variability. Sleep tracking Last but not least the Garmin Forerunner 955 offers sleep tracking which records various sleep phases in addition to the times you fall asleep and get up. Due to the lack of a sleep lab we cannot track the sleep phases as we would have liked. At least the fall asleep and wake-up times precisely match my actual bedtime and my alarm clock. This is also where the SpO2 sensor comes into play which is supposed to detect two main things in smartwatches: Sleep apnea and altitude sickness. The Garmin Forerunner 955 can tell if you're having breathing problems at night based on your blood oxygen saturation. And if you're in a high altitude situation a drop in blood oxygen saturation is an indicator that your body can't handle the altitude. Restful sleep or rest breaks will recharge your body's battery - stress and physical activity on the other hand will drain your body battery. / © NextPit",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzYWlsZGllLmNvbS9ueXljLWFtZXJpY2FuLW1hZ2ljLXdlbGNvbWVzLWdhcm1pbi1hcy1vZmZpY2lhbC10ZWFtLXN1cHBsaWVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NYYC American Magic Welcomes Garmin as Official Team Supplier,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzYWlsZGllLmNvbS9ueXljLWFtZXJpY2FuLW1hZ2ljLXdlbGNvbWVzLWdhcm1pbi1hcy1vZmZpY2lhbC10ZWFtLXN1cHBsaWVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00E3F7040>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Especially for endurance athletes these measurements can aid in maintaining proper pace and cadence throughout training and competition. Unfortunately though the tech used to track these stats isn’t conducive to maintaining a proper form — i.e. you need to pause or alter your focus in order to read your outputs across your smartphone cycling computer or running watch.

To help keep your eyes on the road and your focus locked into your activity there are some wearables that utilize heads-up display modules within sunglass frames keeping all your precious data within your field of view. These sunglasses have taken a major leap when it comes to combining tech and fitness but one that’s really caught our eye as of late has been the all-new Engo 2 from Engo Eyewear.

Released earlier this week to the general public and taking full advantage of the lightweight ActiveLook HUD display unit these sunnies promise to provide athletes with a more natural data tracking experience without unwanted distractions like weight stops and cadence alterations.

Engo Eyewear

But is this impressive tech a breakthrough for your training needs? How convenient is the in-eye display when compared to other data tracking services? To find out I wore the Engo 2s throughout multiple running sessions in varying light conditions highlighting their effectiveness and accuracy throughout my workouts. I also wore these sunnies through a recent 8k race to see how effective the data metrics could be in the throws of competition. In all testing scenarios I made note of the frame’s durability charging capabilities and (of course) fit because after all you want your running gear to be somewhat stylish right?

The Forerunner model in particular is designed for specifically runners and exercise as one can imagine from its product name. It is a direct successor to Garmin's Forerunner 945 which we tried previously and liked.We took the new Forerunner for an extensive test during the three-month testing period using it around the clock. We used the watch to measure exercise sleep stress and general well-being.After a long and arduous testing period it is time to see what Garmin Forerunner 955 is about and how it handled our tests.Garmin Forerunner 955 follows looks-wise a very traditional and conservative sports watch aesthetics. The watch looks undoubtedly like a sports watch and is seemingly the direct continuation of the 1980s classic sports watch design is a conscious choice.Therefore the design is outspoken about the fact that the wearer does sports or exercises and perhaps wants to show it off too. It is of course up to each consumer whether this is preferred.Forerunner 955 is also very traditional in the sense that it has physical buttons. A lot of physical buttons. There are in fact five different buttons for different actions. On the left side of the watch face there are three buttons and on the right side two.Although Garmin Forerunner 955 has also a touchscreen that functions perfectly fine the manufacturer relies that the core audience athletes among others still want physical buttons in their devices.There's a logical reason for the number of buttons: physical ways of interacting with the device are easier to use and more predictable which is important when doing things like saving lap times or other exercise data.Forerunner 955 is also large: the chassis is 46.5 mm and it's not the thinnest of the watches. It is almost identical in size to Garmin Fenix 7.In practice the size of the watch meant that it didn't fit through the closed sleeves of a collared shirt.However the watch is fairly light considering its size. This is due to the fact that the frame is not made of metal but polycarbonate - plastic in laymen's terms. Thanks to the 50-gram weight it doesn't bother during everyday use and one can quickly forget that they are wearing it.https://cdn.afterdawn.fi/storage/pictures/800/garmin-forerunner-955-naytto.jpgIn terms of the display Forerunner 955 offers a matrix display typical for Garmin's smartwatches. The resolution is fairly meager which is a conscious choice to conserve energy and keep it readable in even bright daylight.However it is clear that the display technology does look compared to devices like Garmin Epix 2 or Garmin Venu 2 which have bright and sharp OLED displays.1.3"" resolution 260x260Normal version: 52 grams 1.83 ozSolar version: 53 grams 1.87 ozWaterproof to 50 meters or 164 feet465 x 465 x 144 mmPolycarbonate15 daysWiFi BluetoothAltitude compass gyroscope thermometer blood oxygen acceleratorIntegrated GPS menstrual cycle monitoring training programsRegular version: approx. $500Solar version: approx. $600As I've already mentioned Forerunner 955 is a very large smartwatch. It is almost two inches wide and over half an inch thick. This might make the watch a little intimidating for a smaller person like the reviewer in question.However the rather light weight of the watch and densely perforated wristband help with the size quite a bit. The wristband can be easily adjusted exactly to the size of your wrist so it doesn't squeeze but is firm. In this respect many other manufacturers have a lot to learn from Garmin.What also makes the fit better is the fact that Garmin Forerunner 955 can read data with the sensors even when it is still fairly loose. Unfortunately many cheap smartwatches require close contact and even pressure with the skin to get proper measurements.Even with this the fact remains that it's not the best fit for a small wrist. While smaller men might still get away with it even in everyday use for smaller women it is likely not a good fit.Garmin Forerunner 955's biggest problem is that it is so versatile. There is a massive amount of different functions and almost everything one can find out about the body can be measured monitored and examined.The combination of the touchscreen and five different buttons is something one has to get used to too.However while is it a little confusing at the start Garmin Forerunner 955 turned out to be easy to use. While the learning curve might be a little steep so it might take a few weeks to get to know it thoroughly. Some of the features are hidden in the corners of the menu jungle which might take time to find.After months of use we noticed that we ended up using particularly the features that are available through the physical buttons the most. At the end of the test period we didn't need to use the touchscreen much at all.The fact that navigating with buttons is easy is a testament to how well Garmin has designed the user interface whether the user wants to use the touchscreen or the buttons. This isn't the case with all smartwatches even Garmin's. When using Garmin Epix Gen 2 we used the UI with primarily the touchscreen.Perhaps there is rime and reason for having five separate physical buttons.While it is possible to monitor most of the data straight from the smartwatch the Garmin Connect app is still the best way to examine the data. The app is likely the most important piece of the whole product ecosystem. Garmin has managed to make the app both easy to use and comprehensive.The main view offers an easy and clear view of health information from the current day. This includes data about exercise status fitness development last night's sleep and other things.The menu offers links to more information about what type of exercise Garmin would recommend next how one can improve sleep and when should one change to a workout outfit and on it again.The app is one of the best sports apps thanks to its ease of use. Garmin has also done excellent work on translations although mileage may vary depending on the language.Smartwatches that are meant for sports and exercise need a comprehensive look at how they perform in those tasks - after all that is what they are meant to excel at. We took the Garmin Forerunner 955 through as much of a ringer as we managed throughout the test period.As one would hope from a $500 smartwatch that is designed for exercise and sports Garmin Forerunner 955 truly comes to life as a sports watch. It naturally collects basic data like distance route time spent and heart rate.However Forerunner 955 also offers a vast selection of additional features that many of the competitors don't. One of the more interesting ones is an estimate of remaining endurance: Forerunner 955 can make an estimate when the user is about to run out of juice.When the user is rested and recovered before an exercise the charge is at 100%. As one exercises or does sports the percentage slowly decreases. This helps the user to keep on going if for example after five miles the percentage is still at 75%.Each workout also is categorized automatically to tell the user whether it mainly improved endurance improved basic conditioning was it perhaps more of a recovery workout etc.The integrated GPS is also amazingly precise and fast to react. Both in the woods and in an urban environment it was way more precise than a smartphone. It also reacted fast to stoppages like traffic lights during a run.As almost all Garmin sports watches the Forerunner 955 also includes all sorts of exercise programs and modes especially for those into running or biking. This means that the watch can build your own training regimen based on goals.In addition to being an exercise companion Garmin Forerunner 955 offers health monitoring features. The automatically monitored measurements include sleep heart rate stress level step counts and others.An important addition to Garmin products came with a software update early in 2022. Now the watches also inform about training readiness. This is also available in Forerunner 955.Training readiness basically monitors stress levels sleep quality and recently performed exercise and lets the user know if it is smart at that point to go for an exercise or it rest and recovery is more appropriate.However our experience with sleep monitoring was still one of Garmin's biggest weaknesses. Garmin's algorithms didn't recognize naps at all. Also doomscrolling in bed before sleeping was often measured in sleep time which doesn't make for a good measurement.On the other hand the Body Battery measurement from Garmin is amazingly good and is an excellent measurement for overall energy.We also appreciated clear and concise descriptions of all the measurements which makes it easier to process the information.The battery life of the Garmin Forerunner 955 is largely what we're used to in Garmin devices. The manufacturer promises 15 days of battery life for the Forerunner 955. However in real life the battery life is roughly half of that.Using the device with maximum display brightness keeping always on display enabled and using the constant heart rate monitoring drops the battery life to around a week.It's worth noting though that seven-day battery life is still excellent if you compare it to non-sports watch competitors like Apple Watch which needs a charge every day or so.Also it's worth mentioning that we had the Solar version which charges the watch with a solar panel that is integrated into the display. However this feature didn't come to effect much since we tested this in the north and even during the summer months with plenty of daylight it didn't tip the battery life scale much.Considering this paying $100 extra for the Solar model might not be worth it depending on the location and where the watch is used.One of the more annoying features of Garmin watches is that they still have their proprietary charging cable. One cannot charge Forerunner 955 with a USB-C cable from a smartphone or wireless Qi charger. This is unfortunate especially when traveling. One has to remember to pack another set of cables or try to find one in the location.The charging from empty to full takes around two hours. In our tests charging while showering was enough to keep it in charge.Garmin Forerunner 955 is not a full-fledged smartwatch like those from Apple or using Wear OS and it's built on Garmin's own platform.This more limited operating system means not only that there aren't as many features but it also provides a much better battery life. There is only a very limited set of third-party apps and even those are mostly additional monitoring features.The watch itself supports the core features which include smartphone notifications quick replies for text messages and offline listening for Spotify. In addition smartphone music playback can be controlled via Forerunner 955.There's also support for contactless payments although only via Garmin Pay which might limit options.The $500 Garmin Forerunner 955 is shameless about the fact that it is designed for sports and exercise. It has massive amounts of features that are useful for both athletes and regular hobbyists. It also looks like a sports watch and costs enough that a regular smartwatch customer wouldn't be interested if it wasn't for the exercise features.The other smart features and availability of third-party apps are not comparable to Wear OS or watchOS either. It's as clear as it can be that smartwatch users not interested in exercise should not read further.However if sports-related features are important and one can appreciate the impressive battery life it might be just the watch for you. Garmin Forerunner 955 is excellent exactly for the one demographic it aims to please.Garmin Forerunner 955 is positioned interestingly in Garmin's own collection of smartwatches. While it isn't cheap with a price tag of $500 it's not as expensive as Garmin Fenix 7. In terms of features the two are nearly identical but the Forerunner 955 is around $200 cheaper and is built from polycarbonate. This is why we'd choose Forerunner 955 over Fenix 7.However if you are a small person and you are looking for the best possible sports watch for running the best option is the Fenix 7S which has a markedly smaller footprint than Forerunner 955 while offering the same feature set in metal construction.If you are looking for a really good Garmin smartwatch but don't want to announce that you are an athlete we recommend looking at Garmin Venu 2 smartwatches. Venu 2 fits more appropriately in everyday life both at home and at the office. It also has a sharp OLED display and most of the core features of Forerunners with a smaller price tag.For those that specifically want a smartwatch that they can use to browse Facebook Tweet from their wrists and so on the better choices are found in Wear OS devices and Apple Watches."

(WFSB/Gray News) - Connecticut authorities say a man is facing charges after a child brought two handguns to an elementary school.

WFSB reports state troopers and East Granby officers responded to Carl Allgrove Elementary School on Friday for a report regarding a student in possession of weapons.

Authorities said school staff found two handguns in the student’s belongings. Nobody was hurt and state police said there was no threat to the public.

According to police 32-year-old Kenneth Pariaug was found to be the owner of the handguns. He was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and risk of injury to a minor.

However state police did not immediately specify the relation between the child and Pariaug.

Parents said they were thankful that everybody was OK but weren’t notified about the situation until hours later and still don’t have many details.

“We weren’t notified right away. They [the school] never went into a lockdown and we have procedures for this” said parent Danielle Lawrence.

Lawrence has a first-grader at the school.

“I was told the child never talked about the guns never showed them to anyone but how would the school have known to check the backpack” Lawrence said. “Why weren’t we notified right away? This is sort of a big deal.”

Lawrence said she is not sure if she wants to send her daughter back to school.

“They’re 6 to 7 years old; they’re not packing their own backpacks in the morning” she said. “So the fact he [the child] was able to get out of the house with two guns in his bag is really alarming.”

Pariaug is scheduled to appear in Hartford Superior Court on Dec. 22.

And yet his firm Digital Currency Group is currently hunkered down with a key unit on the brink of bankruptcy. Why it matters: The crypto winter is laying bare the degree to which the ""whales"" in the space including billionaires like Silbert willingly took on ludicrous risks even as they painted themselves in public as sober entrepreneurs who would embrace regulatory constraints.

The big picture: Silbert became dynastically wealthy by getting two big things right. The first was to make a huge bet on bitcoin very early on in 2013. The second was to create a box known as GBTC that would do nothing but own bitcoin and that would be listed on the over-the-counter markets.

GBTC was an early way for individual and institutional investors to own bitcoin without having to worry about being hacked or even having to move money out of their stock-market brokerage accounts.

It was also a license to print money for Silbert who charged a 2% management fee to his company Grayscale for overseeing the box. That fee amounted to $615 million in 2021 alone.

Between the lines: GBTC threw off so much cash because other crypto players including the doomed 3 Arrows Capital (3AC) invested billions of dollars into its shares when they were trading at a premium to the underlying bitcoin.

All that money ended up flooding the market with GBTC which is currently trading at a 45% discount to the bitcoin in the box.

Grayscale is now in a legal fight with a hedge fund called Fir Tree which complains that GBTC acts as a roach motel: Bitcoin can go in but it can't ever come out. If Grayscale allowed investors to redeem GBTC shares for bitcoin the share price would surge — but Grayscale would lose substantially all of its management fee.

Zoom out: Silbert looks as though he gambled away the cash being thrown off by GBTC. Another one of his subsidiaries Genesis lent billions of dollars not only to 3AC but also to Alameda Research the crypto trading vehicle now in bankruptcy alongside FTX. The Alameda loans per Reuters were secured by FTX's in-house currency FTT.

Silbert's Digital Currency Group also took equity stakes in an astonishing number of other companies — over 200 according to the WSJ.

DCG was valued at $10 billion in a late 2021 funding round led by SoftBank but none of the $700 million raised went to shore up DCG's balance sheet; all of it went to employees selling stock.

Genesis barred customer withdrawals last month.

The bottom line: For most of us investing in cryptocurrency at all is ridiculously risky. I like to think that if I'd bet massively on bitcoin in 2013 that would suffice for one lifetime in terms of generating outsize wealth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9sZW5vdm8tdGhpbmtwYWQteDEtZXh0cmVtZS1nZW4tNS12cy1kZWxsLXhwcy0xNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9jb21wdXRpbmcvbGVub3ZvLXRoaW5rcGFkLXgxLWV4dHJlbWUtZ2VuLTUtdnMtZGVsbC14cHMtMTUvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 5 vs. Dell XPS 15,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9sZW5vdm8tdGhpbmtwYWQteDEtZXh0cmVtZS1nZW4tNS12cy1kZWxsLXhwcy0xNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9jb21wdXRpbmcvbGVub3ZvLXRoaW5rcGFkLXgxLWV4dHJlbWUtZ2VuLTUtdnMtZGVsbC14cHMtMTUvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B011415FF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Monique Mi Song Chung successfully defended her Ph.D. dissertation on November 21 2022. Monique is originally from São Paulo Brazil. She obtained her Bachelor's of Food Engineering and Masters in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of São Paulo Brazil.

Monique's dissertation was entitled ""Development of Novel Cleaning-In-Place Operations for Food Processing Equipment Using Microbubbles."" On manufacturing lines in the food industry cleaning is often performed by cleaning-in-place (CIP) operations. Although CIP can ensure uniform cleaning of equipment lower costs associated with labor and plant downtime it consumes large amounts of energy chemicals and water and thus affects the environmental sustainability. Microbubbles (MBs) are very small gas bubbles that feature hydrophobic liquid-gas interface allowing hydrophobic and amphipathic substances to attach to and spread on bubble surfaces. The objective of Monique's research was to develop a novel CIP operation with the incorporation of MBs for cleaning of food processing equipment. Rinsing with MB-incorporated water noticeably enhanced milk deposit removal; adding MBs into alkaline wash increased the membrane flux recovery from microfiltration of oil emulsion; and MB-assisted CIP showed an increased cleaning efficiency from conventional CIP on pilot scale milk ultrafiltration.

Overall Monique's research demonstrates the effectiveness of MBs in cleaning of different types of food deposits and provides groundwork knowledge of MB incorporation into CIP operations for different food processing equipment. The results are expected to guide the scale-up of MB-assisted CIP processes that can reduce the water and chemical usage in food manufacturing sectors ultimately improving both economic and environmental sustainability of the food industry.

Monique's mentor was Dr. Jen-Yi Huang. Other members of her graduate committee included Dr. Dharmendra Mishra Dr. Carlos Corvalan and Dr. Osvaldo Campanella.

There are a couple of reasons why Monique chose Purdue Food Science as the institution where she would continue her education. ""I chose Purdue University for my Ph.D. degree because it has an established and well recognized Food Science program and a campus that features state of the art analytical capabilities. I also appreciate Purdue's innovative and welcoming environment."" Monique also recommends Purdue Food Science to prospective graduate students stating ""The Purdue Food Science graduate program is very welcoming and you will feel as part of a community. Your activities outside of your research and friendships will build your family and experiences during your time at Purdue.""

Outside of the classroom and laboratory Monique was a member of the IFTSA College Bowl team (2019 2020) and she served as the secretary of the Food Science Graduate Student Association (2021).

After graduation Monique plans to work as a Food Safety and Quality Associate for General Mills in Wellson Ohio. Congratulations Monique! We wish you all the best!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZWxlYmRpcnR5bGF1bmRyeS5jb20vMjAyMi9nZW5lcmFsLWhvc3BpdGFsLXNwb2lsZXJzLXBoeWxsaXMtcmV0dXJucy1mb3ItbmluYXMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItd2lsbG93LXJldmVhbC1uZXcteW9yay1oYXJtb255LWxpbmstZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2VyL9IBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZWxlYmRpcnR5bGF1bmRyeS5jb20vMjAyMi9nZW5lcmFsLWhvc3BpdGFsLXNwb2lsZXJzLXBoeWxsaXMtcmV0dXJucy1mb3ItbmluYXMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItd2lsbG93LXJldmVhbC1uZXcteW9yay1oYXJtb255LWxpbmstZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2VyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Hospital Spoilers: Phyllis Returns for Nina’s Daughter Willow Reveal – New York Harmony Link Ga...,"General Hospital (GH) spoilers tease that Phyllis Caulfield (Joyce Guy) will return for Nina Reeves’ (Cynthia Watros) Willow Tait (Katelyn MacMullen) daughter reveal. Phyllis’ New York Harmony Miller (Inga Cadranel) link is a game-changer and will inevitably play a major role in the revelation to come.

It feels like forever since Phyllis has been seen on canvas but she’ll pop back up during the week of December 19-23.

Phyllis has perhaps been busy around town – or maybe they’ll write in an excuse about how she was visiting old friends in Nixon Falls.

Regardless Phyllis will return to fans’ screens for a catch-up session with Nina.

There’ll be a lot to talk about including Nina’s relationship with Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and all the drama that continues to cause.

Nina may wonder if she’s doomed to be a constant source of conflict in Sonny’s life.

It could leave Nina questioning her long-term future with Sonny but he’ll work to reassure her – and Phyllis will likely do the same.

Even so Nina may open up about Sonny’s feud with Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell) and her own endless hostility with Willow.

Although Nina decided to stay away from Willow following the fainting incident she may wish there was a way to end the war – especially since she still misses Wiley Quartermaine-Corinthos (Viron Weaver).

Of course the real significance of Phyllis’ popping up again will come in the form of her knowledge.

We can’t forget that Phyllis knew Lorraine aka Harmony who worked in the same New York building where Phyllis cared for comatose Nina.

Phyllis also witnessed just how chummy Harmony was with Nina’s mother Madeline Reeves (Donna Mills).

If Drew Cain (Cameron Mathison) gets updates on any of this it could shift his investigation in a huge way.

Bottom line there has to be a reason why Phyllis is suddenly becoming part of the story again.

The writers never really capitalized on Phyllis’ Harmony link so that should eventually come into play and contribute to the looming big reveal.

General Hospital spoilers say Phyllis could connect some crucial dots for Drew down the road so stay tuned.

They never got to raise their daughter Esme on GH. So they may soon pull another evil stunt on the ABC sudser.

General Hospital: Ryan Chamberlain’s past with Heather Webber Explained

Recently we learned about Heather Webber’s (Alley Mills) connection to Ryan Chamberlain (Jon Lindstrom) on GH. Legacy baddie Heather met Ryan decades ago.

She stumbled across him in the woods. Of course they both used fake names. Ryan Chamberlain went by Richard and Heather Webber called herself Hazel.

They fell for each other hard and fast. And that was how the duo of “Heathan” (Heather + Ryan) emerged. And they believed themselves to be soulmates recall General Hospital recaps.

But Heather Webber broke her mountain man’s heart when she took off and left him. To make matters worse he found out she was pregnant when she left back in the day on General Hospital.

Now it makes perfect sense why he told his daughter Esme Prince (Avery Kristen Pohl) they would find her mother together. Ryan had no idea where she was. But then she recently popped up in Spring Ridge.

Last we saw them Ryan told Heather he knew she was pregnant. Soon he’ll likely tell her he has a close relationship with their daughter. And he may attempt to reunite his family soon on General Hospital.

One Happy Psycho Family on GH

Now that Ryan Chamberlain is reunited with Heather he can introduce her to Esme — once he finds her. The villain knows she’s pregnant with Nikolas Cassadine’s (Marcus Coloma) child.

But he’s unaware that Nik is holding her captive at Wyndemere. The teen she-villain has a plot in motion to escape Nik’s clutches and eventually she’ll break free.

When she reunites with her demented daddy she’ll be ecstatic to learn he’s found her mother. Esme will finally have the family she so desperately wants.

From Ryan and Heather to Earwax. A family of psychopaths. Heather says they'd have a lot to discuss if he could talk. #GH pic.twitter.com/oOTNCqOYtM — Alli – Let Trina Know She Was Drugged (@Here4Sprina) December 6 2022

However her parents are anything but warm and fuzzy. Heather might be happy to connect with the daughter she gave up years ago finally. But she could be hard to please like her father.

And Esme’s hopes of getting a kind and loving mother could be crushed. In fact she and psycho Ryan may be more interested in their unborn child rather than her…

Esme’s Twisted Parents Steal Her Baby on General Hospital?

Ryan and nutty Heather couldn’t bring up their child together so they might see their grandbaby as a second chance. Fans will recall that the villainess has a track record of messing with babies.

She was there when her cousin Susan Moore (Gail Ramsey) gave birth to her twin boys many years ago on General Hospital. Susan kept Jason Morgan (Steve Burton).

But Susan asked her cousin to keep Jason’s twin brother Andrew “Drew” Cain (now Cameron Mathison). Instead she gave him to a nurse Betsy Frank (Deborah Strang).

Also she switched Sam McCall’s (Kelly Monaco) newborn son with a stillborn that belonged to Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano). Later Heather kidnapped Sam’s son after he was revealed to be alive.

Here is what Heather Webber is capable of throwing herself off the side of a building with a baby in her arms. Why would anyone trust her? #gh pic.twitter.com/Alk4ABP6Tc — ""Jay"" SamFF Be kind (@Sam_PI_Mother) November 11 2022

So it’s not a stretch for her to kidnap her own grandchild. And she could likely get Ryan on board. Plus raising a Cassadine baby as their own would be the icing on the cake.

And that would be a fitting punishment for Nik for being such a jerk. GH is getting wild. Watch daily to see if Heather Webber and evil Ryan Chamberlain snatch Esme’s baby away from her on the ABC soap.

RIYADH Saudi Arabia Dec. 11 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- PayTabs Middle East Africa and South Asia's (MEASA's) award-winning payments powerhouse in a power play announced that it had acquired a 100% stake in Paymes Turkey's largest social commerce platform. The news of the acquisition comes just weeks after PayTabs acquired Saudi Arabia's Digital Pay in November 2022.

The aim of the acquisition is to launch spin-offs on specific social commerce verticals and improve merchant cash flows with buy now pay later schemes and even a special Paymes Card

Under the terms of the acquisition Paymes will serve as PayTabs social commerce platform empowering millions of freelancers artisans consultants home based business owners personal trainers and micro vendors across the Middle East and Africa to receive instant payments. For PayTabs the acquisition is in sync with their passionate pursuit of following merchants across their lifecycle to elevate their payment habits. Micro merchants have been an underserved segment in the ecosystem and Paymes with its simplex social commerce platform provides the key for webpreneurs to enter the main-stream payment market by enabling them to create web stores and sell online with minimum effort. After collaborating for over a year to launch social commerce tools in KSA UAE and Egypt the founders decided that PayTabs acquiring Paymes was the next logical step in line with PayTabs mission to power the global ecommerce economy with the ultimate super payment's platform.

Having championed digital payments in the MENA region for a decade the synergy with Paymes will open new social media platforms such as Messenger Facebook and Instagram for millions of merchants that trade and sell over social media but have no legitimate way of collecting their funds. The acquisition provides an opportunity for PayTabs to grow and expand their payment footprint in the Eurasian markets with futuristic market differentiators offered by the Paymes platform such as live cashier inventory management and Paymes Reels.

In Turkish region this acquisition allows Paymes to elevate itself as a ""social commerce processor."" Paymes that currently serves over 850000 users across Turkey and Azerbaijan will capitalize on the market presence of PayTabs to advance digital and social payments in the MENA region. One of the key benefits of Paymes is that it allows users to set up a mini ecommerce webstore – known as the 'Paymes shop'. The web store can be customized and branded saving additional costs for merchants who would otherwise pay to have their websites designed and developed via professional agencies. This ease of this feature alone will give weight to empowering a new segment of women entrepreneurs who run micro home-based businesses selling over WhatsApp for example to participate in the economy thus contributing to growing household incomes via social commerce.

Speaking in Istanbul Paymes Co-founder and PayTabs Regional Head/Operating Partner Hasan Jabbrov said ""Under the acquisition agreement the Paymes team will expand our responsibilities to cover the many markets that PayTabs operates in throughout MENA. We will also be supporting PayTabs with our range of new social commerce products a sector in which we have considerable experience. Exciting times ahead for webpreneurs in the region.""

At the PayTabs Headquarters in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia founder and CEO of the PayTabs Group Abdulaziz Al Jouf said ""Payments are a commodity and our mission at PayTabs is to ensure that payments are easily made available to every customer segment from the super merchant or bank to a nano merchant. By acquiring Paymes we are consolidating our position as the only payment solutions powerhouse that has a payment orchestration platform to offer payments solutions for any business size – micro or macro across the globe.""

In Istanbul Sabrican Zaim the co-founder and CEO of Paymes said ""By the number of merchants and know how that we gained from social commerce we are preparing to launch various spin-offs on specific verticals. In addition to these spin-offs we are developing payment mechanisms through live broadcasts with reels in social commerce which is our strongest muscle. We believe Paymes is an enabler with an accelerator effect for payment platforms and e-commerce startups. Our co-operation as a Facebook commerce partner strengthens us. We are targeting to improve the cash flows of our merchants by providing them buy now pay later consumer finance and even a special Paymes Card. As the most preferred social commerce platform of the region under PayTabs global vision we are targeting to serve more merchants in all continents.""

Uzbekistan Jordan and Georgia are new markets on the horizon for the launch of Paymes in 2023.

Although the valuation of the acquisition deal remains undisclosed the global social commerce market is expected to grow to more than $2 trillion by 2025 driven by the buying habits of millennials and Gen Z.

The CBN circular has far reaching implications for the loan recovery services sector in Nigeria the most notable being that loans no longer have to be marked or written off as bad debts.

It also means that loan recovery services have now gone digital through the introduction of automatic debits recovery options across bank accounts unified under a Bank Verification Number by virtue of the binding nature of Global Standing Instructions.

Long before filming began for The English the absorbing Western drama now available on Prime Video the producers went above and beyond to verify their fiction was supported by fact.

The limited-run series written and directed by Hugo Blick pivots on the improvised partnership forged between an Englishwoman (Emily Blunt) seeking revenge and a Pawnee ex-Cavalry scout (Chaske Spencer) seeking justice in the 1890s American West.

That’s why the call went out to Crystal Echo Hawk the president and CEO of IllumiNative a racial and social justice organization dedicated to increasing the visibility of and challenging preconceived ideas about Native peoples.

Crystal Echo Hawk

Echo Hawk and IllumiNative were involved with The English from initial script readings to on-location production. And as an enrolled member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma she was uniquely qualified to provide guidance on Pawnee tribal costumes dialect song and props and to share her authentic lived experiences with cast and crew.

“My great-great-grandfather from where our name Hawk came from was a Pawnee scout” she told Sandra Hale Schulman of ICT. “On so many levels it was deeply personal. It just was very emotional to help ensure that this story was told in a really authentic way.

“We've oftentimes dealt with production companies and writers or directors who just don't want script notes. They want you just to come in and rubber stamp the production” Echo Hawk added.

That definitely was not the case with The English.

“I think it's changing times” Echo Hawk told ICT. “That was so important that through IllumiNative’s advocacy research the work we've done in the industry that we were able to create space within this production to have our Pawnee people have agency and partnership with the writer-director and the production team and Amazon.”

Crystal Echo Hawk recently visited the C&I Studio to talk about The English and the ongoing work of IllumiNative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhvYnNlcnZhdG9yeS5uYXNhLmdvdi9pbWFnZXMvMTUwNjk3L2xpdmluZy10aGUtbGF2YS1saWZlLW9uLW1hdW5hLWxvYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Living the Lava Life on Mauna Loa,"When Hawaii’s massive Mauna Loa volcano began erupting for the first time in nearly four decades late on November 27 2022 lava initially spilled from the Moku’āweoweo crater at the mountain’s summit. But by the next morning activity had migrated to a cluster of four fissures northeast of the summit. One of these—fissure 3—quickly became dominant producing a long lava flow that spanned more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) after just a few days.

On December 2 2022 the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on Landsat 9 acquired this natural-color image of the erupting volcano. At the time lava from fissure 3 was moving north toward Saddle Road a key artery that connects the eastern and western sides of the island and provides access to the slope of Mauna Loa and Mauna Loa Observatory. The image is overlaid with infrared data from OLI-2 showing the location of warm areas associated with lava. A cloud of volcanic gas is visible wafting around the fissure.

More subtle but also visible in the Landsat image are warm areas associated with cooling lava from fissure 4. That flow is about two kilometers west of fissure 3. During the first few days of the eruption fissure 4 was on a path that posed a potential threat to a small analog space research station that is part of the NASA-funded Hawai’i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) project.

Though the station’s dome-shaped habitat wasn’t occupied when Mauna Loa erupted multiple crews have lived and worked in it for missions lasting up to a year to help mission planners understand what astronauts exploring the surface of Mars or the Moon and living for long periods in cramped quarters would need to thrive. The most recent mission concluded in May 2022.

“The flow from fissure 4 looked threatening initially but it has stalled out for now and it looks like the flow from fissure 3 has settled into its path about half a mile to the west of the hab” said former HI-SEAS principal investigator Kim Binstead. The photo above taken by a drone operated by biologist Jordan Lerma shows the habitat with the fissure 3 lava flow and a plume of volcanic emissions in the background on December 3 2022. “Now we’re hoping that neither the Saddle Road nor the Mauna Loa Observatory access road get cut off by lava flows” Binstead said.

The habitat’s location on an active volcano and geologically young lava flows was intentional. The site was chosen based on its relative remoteness and its similarities to terrain on Mars. The red planet has large gently sloping shield volcanoes with exposed lava flows that are geologic cousins to Mauna Loa. The image below captured by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 on December 12 2017 shows the habitat nestled amid fields of contrasting lava flows. The youngest flows are dark black; older more weathered flows are shades of gray brown and red.

The habitat sits directly on the Pu‘ukā hilikū flow which erupted about 1800 years ago. That makes it significantly older than the nearby ‘Āinahou flow which formed 450 years ago. The youngest flow near the habitat—one of the darkest in the image—erupted in 1899.

If lava does make its way toward the HI-SEAS site again the local terrain might provide some buffer. “The station is built on the side of a ridge which could offer some protection depending on the direction and speed of the flow” explained recent HI-SEAS director Michaela Musilova. “But the facility would likely be destroyed if a lava flow were to come in direct contact with it.” The photograph below taken in 2016 from a drone operated by HI-SEAS participant Andrzej Stewart shows the spatter rampart ridge which formed during an earlier eruption along an eruptive fissure as blobs of lava flew out piled up and cooled.

There is no failsafe way of forecasting how the eruption might progress but former HI-SEAS geology director and current U.S. Geological Survey scientist Brian Shiro said there are hints that the Mauna Loa eruption may be winding down. “The effusion rate has slowed and fountaining from fissure 3 has become irregular over the past few days” he said. “Anything is possible but I doubt that lava will reach Saddle Road. It’s also quite unlikely that fissure 4 will become reactivated during this eruption so the HI-SEAS habitat seems to be safe for now.”

Now Goldman Sachs is betting big on Dallas with the announcement of a massive new office expanding its presence in the city.

The 900000-square-foot $500 million project is the largest in Dallas in decades. While Goldman Sachs maintains offices in Atlanta Salt Lake City Chicago and other locations the Dallas expansion will further cement the city as one of the bank’s most critical bases of operations.

Speaking to members of the Dallas Citizens Council on December 5 Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said “Dallas has become our second most significant hub.”

The investment bank is already familiar with the city employing over 4000 people in Dallas. The new campus however will allow Goldman to further tap into the talent network that exists in DFW.

“Obviously all of us at Goldman Sachs are very excited about what we have going on in Dallas and what the future holds for us in this great city” Solomon told the council.

Roughly 10000 or about 38% of Goldman Sachs’ 26000 employees work out of the bank’s New York City head office. New York however like California is experiencing an exodus of young people.

In particular Dallas has become a popular destination for motivated young Americans the exact demographic Goldman Sachs wants.

In fact half of Goldman Sachs’ current workforce is in their twenties according to the CEO. As a result Dallas is an ideal location for the investment bank’s expansion.

“One of the things that makes Texas so incredible is you have an incredible secondary education system here both public and private” says Solomon. “It creates an enormous pipeline of talented young individuals. People come down here to go to school and they actually want to stay” he said.

Currently Dallas-based employees of the bank operate out of the Trammell Crow Center skyscraper in downtown Dallas and the Galatyn Commons office campus in Richardson.

“It’s primarily about organic growth” and “hiring young people” stressed Solomon. “It’s about hiring engineers here—about hiring all sorts of people across all of our businesses” he said.

Solomon is encouraged by the warm Dallas welcome he has received so far. Support from the local business community has given the bank “confidence” in investing in the city said the CEO.

As part of the incentive to expand operations in Dallas the city provided the firm with $18 million in economic incentives.

The new skyscraper will replace an apartment community by Dallas Hunt Realty on Field Street north of Woodall Rogers Freeway.

The investment bank’s announcement contrasts other firms that have reduced metro area footprints over the course of the pandemic. Costly underused office real estate was dropped as workers increasingly operated from home.

Goldman Sachs however is an old-school institution and prefers to avoid remote collaboration.

Solomon does not “believe that people should be working for Goldman Sachs and living in Jackson Hole.”

“Our strategy has always been to find places where we can build the culture of the firm and bring people together” said Solomon. “That’s why we continue to expand our footprint.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mbGV4aWJsZS13b3JrLWlzLWhlcmUtdG8tc3RheS1vbi13YWxsLXN0cmVldC13aGV0aGVyLWJvc3Nlcy1saWtlLWl0LW9yLW5vdC0xMzE1MzE5MzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flexible work is here to stay on Wall Street whether bosses like it or not,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mbGV4aWJsZS13b3JrLWlzLWhlcmUtdG8tc3RheS1vbi13YWxsLXN0cmVldC13aGV0aGVyLWJvc3Nlcy1saWtlLWl0LW9yLW5vdC0xMzE1MzE5MzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00FC720E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

[Updated]

By Ronni Newton

The West Hartford Town Council will be considering a long-discussed project this week – a proposal that has been the subject of multiple study sessions with the town’s Design Review and Advisory Committee (DRAC) since the beginning of 2022 – and will hold a public hearing on the application on Tuesday Dec. 13 beginning at 6 p.m. at West Hartford Town Hall. A vote on the project is scheduled for the Town Council meeting that will follow the public hearing.

Arapahoe Group LLC’s current proposal is for combinations of multiple parcels into a Special Development District and the construction of two new buildings with a total of 83 residential units to include high-end condominiums rentals units and workforce housing as well as commercial space and garage parking in West Hartford Center.

The current design for the project which would be infill development in two areas that are currently underutilized asphalt surface parking includes Center Park Place – a six-story U-shaped building with 58 condominiums a mix of one- and two-bedroom units in a building to be constructed in what is currently an asphalt parking lot behind 27-43 and 53-65 LaSalle Road and 1001 Farmington Avenue. Four levels of the building will be residential and three levels – some of which will be below-grade – will be parking. Amenities would include a pool and other outdoor and indoor amenities including pollinator gardens.

The second building 75 LaSalle Road is proposed to be built on what is currently the asphalt surface parking lot for the Webster Bank building at the corner of LaSalle Road and Arapahoe Road. Plans call for a five-story structure with four stories comprising 25 rental units above ground floor commercial space. Four of the rental units will be designated as 40-year deed-restricted workforce housing a level of affordable housing open to those who earn 80% or less than the area mean income (AMI).

The buildings would replace roughly 200 existing surface parking spaces and garage parking would replace those lost spaces as well as provide parking for occupants of the new buildings as well as for the public. The proposal calls for existing residential style office buildings at 8 Arapahoe and 12 Arapahoe to be demolished. Vehicle access to the two new buildings and parking areas will be from Arapahoe Road.

The proposal also calls for pocket parks and a “woonerf” – a “living street” that provides pedestrian and bicycle access to LaSalle Road.

A website created for the overall project contains additional details as well as FAQs.

Arapahoe Group LLC which is submitting the proposal is a partnership between Marc Lewis principal of Lexham LaSalle Development LLC; Manafort WHC LLC; and West Hartford Arapahoe LLC (the Simons family which owns the Town Center Building residential buildings in Bishops Corner and other West Hartford properties). The partners as well as Beinfield Architecture of South Norwalk have had multiple informal meetings with DRAC since January 2022. The application was formally reviewed by DRAC in early September but after DRAC unanimously voted against recommending it the application was withdrawn before consideration by the Town Plan & Zoning Commission (TPZ).

Some of the suggestions made by DRAC were reflected in a revised and re-submitted application and on Dec. 1 DRAC considered it again and voted 4-1 not to recommend the project with those voting against it stating that the revised plan did not reflect enough of their previous recommendations. This time the application was reviewed by TPZ which on Dec.. 5 recommended it by a vote of 4-1. TPZ Chair Kevin Ahearn cast the lone vote agains the project noting the lack of endorsement by DRAC.

As of Friday evening the town had received multiple emails from the public providing comment about the proposal. Those letters are posted under the heading of “Public Comment” on the agenda for the public hearing on the town’s website. Six of those letters were in support of the application while 20 were in opposition. We-Ha.com has also published several letters to the editor regarding the proposal and those opposed to the project have created the website “A Better West Hartford” and launched a petition.

Many letters – from residents as well as area business owners – were also submitted earlier in the process. In total there are 41 letters submitted in support of the project as of 10 a.m. Monday Dec. 12. All letters of support submitted to date are contained in the outreach report prepared by McDowell Communication Group which is representing the applicant.

The scale and the height of the buildings as well as the potential for increased traffic are among the primary issues of concern raised by those opposing the project. Some members of the community are also requesting that the Town Council delay consideration of this application until the West Hartford Center Infrastructure Master Plan has been completed. The town has hired Stantec as a consultant for developing the plan which will be a holistic approach focused on four key elements: the Center’s “sense of place” sidewalks transportation and parking. Concept designs should be ready for consideration before the spring of 2023.

While current iteration of the Arapahoe Group LLC proposal has been under discussion since January 2022 infill development for the area is something that Lewis has envisioned for more than six years. He has been working within the parameters of an incentive zoning ordinance that the Town Council passed in 2017.

“Encourage infill development on vacant and underutilized lots” is one of the stated goals of West Hartford’s 2020-2030 Plan of Conservation and Development.

Lewis also the managing principal of Lexham Private Investors LLC is already an owner of a significant number of commercial properties in town and owns all of the property where he will propose to build Center Park Place and 75 LaSalle with the exception of 12 Arapahoe which is under contract. His other investments include 65 LaSalle Rd. (Webster Bank Becker’s Jewelers); 25-55 LaSalle (Union Kitchen Wurst Haus Ávert Central Optica); the Central Building 1001 Farmington Ave. 1253 New Britain Ave. (DORO Marketplace) and other buildings on Farmington Avenue North Main Street and South Main Street.

Other projects underway

Over the past year the Town Council has already approved several other residential developments in the West Hartford Center area including The Byline at 920-924 Farmington Avenue which is currently under construction and the Continental Properties proposal for the former Children’s Museum site at 950 Trout Brook Drive.

Another significant proposal by Stone Point Properties for the development of the 1003-1007 Farmington Avenue property – currently occupied by Fleet Feet Sports and formerly also the longtime location of S.K. Lavery – will soon be considered by the Town Council.

“Their application for the Lavery project is anticipated in the first quarter of 2023” said Chuck Coursey spokesperson for Stone Point Properties. He said the developer has been engaging with neighbors and discussing and addressing their concerns which included the initial siting of the building at the rear of the parcel in close proximity to Arapahoe Road. Based on feedback from area residents and DRAC the current plans under discussion “have been revised to move the building to Farmington Avenue” Coursey said.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- A 24-year-old man is accused of firing a gun that killed a woman in a vehicle in north Houston according to police.

The video above is ABC13's 24/7 Livestream.

Jalen Edwards 24 was charged on Saturday with the death of Ashley Archer 26 who was shot and killed on Oct. 25.

Houston police officers found the driver applying pressure to Archer while still inside the vehicle.

A witness told police that Archer and others were inside the Nissan at a gas station on 110 West Rankin Road when five to six Black men approached them.

Investigators said that's when Edwards and the five other suspects allegedly pulled out guns and fired multiple shots at the vehicle.

The victims fled the scene but realized Archer had been shot in the stomach and stopped at a different gas station at 1127 West Rankin Road.

That's when pressure was applied to her.

Archer was taken to HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest where she was pronounced dead.

The other people inside the vehicle were not injured.

At Edward's court appearance on Saturday. a judge set his bond at $250000.

Lots of eyebrows and questions were raised in November when Disney surprisingly rehired Bob Iger as its CEO just 11 months after he turned the reins over to Bob Chapek who in June had signed a three-year contract extension. Yet shoulders mostly shrugged regarding Iger's age 71 an indication that at the Magic Kingdom and beyond there is no magic number when it comes to retirement — or unretirement — and that succession planning for key executives is increasingly crucial.

Target made headlines in September when the big-box behemoth announced that 63-year-old CEO Brian Cornell agreed to stay on the job for another three years and the company's mandatory retirement age of 65 was being well retired. A month later Caterpillar 's board waived its policy requiring chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby 64 to retire when his next birthday rolled around. That followed previous expirations of preset CEO expiration dates by MetLife (in 2016) 3M (2017) and Merck (2018).

Last year Boeing actually raised its compulsory aging-out age to 70 from 65 as a way to keep CEO David Calhoun then 64 in the pilot's seat.

Although the average age of Fortune 500 CEOs is 57 a number of bosses on the well-known leaderboard range from 71 — Henry Schein's Stanley Bergman — to 92 — Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway whose board's vice chairman Charlie Munger is 98.

Retiring at 65 is out average chief executive age is up

Among S&P 500 companies (all publicly held vs. the Fortune 500's public and private businesses) the average age of a CEO at the end of his or her tenure was 64.2 in 2021 and 62.8 year to date in 2022 whereas in 2019 it was 59.7 said Cathy Anterasian who leads CEO succession services in North America for leadership consulting firm Spencer Stuart citing updated research from its 2021 CEO Transitions report.

The average tenure for departing CEOs during that same time period was about 11 years up from nine years in 2020. ""So they're staying longer and therefore leaving at an older age. That's not surprising because of the impact of the pandemic and [other] crises where boards put CEO succession on hold"" Anterasian said.

Once upon a time in America chief executives and most other workers retired by 65 the age designated in 1935 for receiving benefits from the newly formed Social Security ­Administration — along with perhaps a gold watch and brochures for condo communities in Florida. Back then however life expectancy at birth was 58 for men and 62 for women.

Of course in the 1930s people generally performed more exhausting physical labor than today's workers who are also benefitting from exponential advances in health care and medical technology that have occurred over the ensuing decades.

By 2021 according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at birth men were expected to live 73.2 years women to 79.1 years. Yet those numbers were lower due to the pandemic too by a full year for men and 0.8 years for women.

Congress the C-Suite and age discrimination

In 1978 when Congress extended the protection under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to private-sector employees up to the age of 70 it made an exception for CEOs and other senior executives who could be asked to retire as soon as they turned 65. That allowed companies to legally sunset CEOs at 65 giving boards and shareholders a governance tool for getting rid of leaders who were underperforming behaving badly or showing signs of mental and/or physical incompetence.

CEO turnover has always been a fact of corporate life but during the last few topsy-turvy years succession planning has been disrupted. ""In our research boards put CEO succession on hold during crises"" Anterasian said. Indeed over the past three global recessions successions declined by as much as 30% she said. ""The reason is that in turbulent times boards seek stability. Why change the captain of the ship when the waves are getting rougher and rougher?""

At Disney Iger has said he will only stay on for two years before a successor takes over.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hershey Bears won their league-leading 17th game on Saturday against the Cleveland Monsters. Buoyed by 25 saves by Clay Stevenson in his AHL debut the Bears got goals from Mike Sgarbossa Aaron Ness and Sam Anas for the victory.

But the game was not all good news for the Bears. The team lost defenseman Bobby Nardella in the first period due to an injury.

Nardella did not return to the game. Afterward Bears head coach Todd Nelson said it was an upper-body injury and he would not play in the team’s next game.

If Nardella is out for any significant amount of time he would join several big-name defensemen in the organization already on the injured list including Dmitry Orlov and Martin Fehervary. Bears defenseman Lucas Johansen recently returned from his own injury but did not play against Cleveland.

Nardella did manage to get on the scoreboard before leaving the game. He tallied his 100th career point with a secondary assist on Mike Sgarbossa’s first-period goal.

The two have joined the team in Winnipeg.

The Washington Capitals have recalled defensemen Lucas Johansen and Dylan McIlrath from the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL) senior vice president and general manager Brian MacLellan announced today.

Johansen 25 recorded two points (1g 1a) in 12 games with Hershey this season. The Vancouver British Columbia native also appeared in one game for Washington this season recording 11:47 of ice time on Nov. 7 against the Edmonton Oilers. Johansen made his NHL debut and recorded his first career point on Dec. 31 2021 against the Detroit Red Wings. The 6’2″ 180-pound defenseman recorded 28 points (8g 20a) in 62 games with Hershey during the 2021-22 season establishing AHL career highs in goals points and plus/minus (20). Johansen finished the season ranked first among Hershey defensemen in plus/minus and second in goals assists and points. In 207 career AHL career games with Hershey Johansen has recorded 75 points (18g 57a). The Capitals selected Johansen with their first-round pick 28th overall in the 2016 NHL Draft.

McIlrath 30 recorded five assists in 22 games with Hershey this season. The 6’5″ 232-pound defenseman ranks second on Hershey with 36 penalty minutes and his five points are tied for the third-most among Hershey defensemen. The Winnipeg Manitoba native has played 66 career NHL games with the New York Rangers Florida Panthers and Detroit Red Wings recording five points (3g 2a) and 121 penalty minutes. In 522 career AHL games with Hershey Grand Rapids Hartford Springfield and Connecticut McIlrath has recorded 105 points (27g 78a) and 1038 penalty minutes. Additionally McIlrath won the 2017 Calder Cup with the Grand Rapid Griffins. McIlrath was selected by the Rangers in the first round 10th overall in the 2010 NHL Draft.

Both Johansen and McIlrath were made unavailable for last night’s Hershey Bears game signaling they were likely en-route to Winnipeg.

All of the recent recalls are in response to injuries sustained by Capitals defensemen Martin Fehervary and Alex Alexeyev.

The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation announced Foxconn created 768 eligible jobs and made a capital investment of $77.4 million in 2021. That means the company is eligible to receive $3.5 million in job creation-related tax credits and $5.1 million in capital investment credits.

In April 2021 the state revised its $2.85 billion contract with Foxconn to create more realistic goals including the creation of 1454 jobs — about 11% of the original plan — by Dec. 31 2025.

Also under the revised agreement Foxconn is expected to invest up to $672 million by the end of 2025 compared to the $10 billion in the original deal.

Last year was the first year Foxconn qualified for state tax credits since breaking ground in Mount Pleasant in 2018. In 2021 the company received $28.8 million in credits after investing $266 million at the site and creating 579 jobs during 2020 according to WEDC.

The company now employs 768 workers according to documents released Friday.

Foxconn has four buildings on its property a nearly 1-million-square-foot ""advanced manufacturing"" facility; a 300000-square-foot ""smart manufacturing center;"" a 120000-square-foot ""multipurpose building;"" and a 100-foot tall ""high-performance computing data center globe.""

Local tax dollars also spent on Foxconn

In addition to the state tax credits local governments have spent millions of dollars on the project.

From mid-2017 through June 2022 the village of Mount Pleasant spent $166.8 million on vendors and contractors related to Foxconn according to the village and records obtained by the Journal Sentinel.

This included costs related to purchasing homes through eminent domain from more than 100 homeowners but not the actual cost of the properties. The sum also includes about $68 million for sewer and about $70 million for water work.

The village paid more than $152 million for 132 properties to make way for Foxconn plus another $7.9 million in relocation costs.

A $911 million special taxing district was created by the village of Mount Pleasant and Racine County to pay for the local portion of the Foxconn project including land acquisition and infrastructure upgrades. Village and county officials have continued to defend their decisions saying the money spent will bring significant economic development and costs will be recouped.

“Stick to your knitting.”

That’s what some companies are hearing as part of an “ESG backlash” that says they should stay out of social and environmental issues according to Conference Board ESG Center Executive Director Paul Washington.

Luckily when it comes to supporting the rule of law companies can do more than argue it is good for the world he said. They can demonstrate it’s good for their business.

“And that business case has to be made within a boardroom and it has to be made in the public forum as well” Washington told corporate leaders gathered for a recent private sector briefing on the WJP Rule of Law Index 2022.

“The WJP data helps us make that case.”

Indeed that’s been the experience at LexisNexis said Ian McDougall the company’s executive vice president and general counsel. He told the gathering how his company uses Index data to show the strong correlation between rule of law and a variety of positive socioeconomic outcomes.

“For example you see very clearly that the stronger the rule of law the higher the per capita GDP is on average in a country” he said “and all kinds of other amazing things: lower mortality rates lower corruption rates.”

“This is not just us telling you we think this is a great idea” McDougall said. “This is us telling you that the evidence shows that you benefit as a result of supporting an advance in the rule of law.”

At the same briefing for WJP’s private sector partners and other corporate leaders WJP Chief Research Officer Alejandro Ponce dug into the 2022 Index data including the indicators most relevant to the business environment.

Between 2021 and 2022 regulatory enforcement weakened in 58% of countries he said while the effectiveness and timeliness of civil justice systems declined in 61% of countries. Corruption also got worse in 58% of countries Ponce said but noted that this indicator has remained relatively stagnant because the changes were often very small.

Participants in the briefing agreed that monitoring rule of law is critical for a variety of business reasons and that using Index to help manage risk can and has saved companies as much as billions of dollars when deciding where to invest or grow their business.

“As a business going into any environment we want to determine some kind of predictability” said Joseph Kilian Bongsiysi Fonlon associate general counsel of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. “You want to be able to understand what the regulatory framework is.”

Bongsiysi Fonlon encouraged other businesses and partners to participate in generating more rule of law data.

“Long term we will have a robust database we all can rely on” he said. “And that will make our ability to invest around the world more predictable [and help us] manage economic risk as well as achieve our core missions.”

We take a look

HE SHOOTS HE SCORES Who has Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo dated?

CRISTIANO RONALDO has dated some of the most beautiful and famous women in the world on his journey from dodgy-fringed Manchester United kid to global superstar.

The Portuguese hero has been linked to brief encounters with sex-tape hotel heiress Paris Hilton as well as Mrs Kanye West; Kim Kardashian and ex-Hollyoaks star Gemma Atkinson.

Somewhere along the way he fathered a child Cristiano Jnr but the identity of the young boy’s mother has always remained a mystery and his most serious relationship appears to have been with Irina Shayk who he was seen out with between 2010-15 with his son.

Gemma Atkinson

The Hollyoaks star was a bombshell when she dated the Man United winger back in 2007 but their dates were far from glamorous.

The high-profile pair spent evenings tucked away watching British sitcom Only Fools and Horses.

The actress revealed: “We just went to my house and drank cups of tea and watched Only Fools and Horses . Genuinely. With Cristiano it was mad because everywhere he went he was followed by photographers.

Paris Hilton

The hotel heiress was at the peak of her fame following the release of a notorious sex tape so was hardly wife material for the family man.

But in 2008 Hilton used the footballer to ensure a few more column inches in the tabloids with some over-zealous affection in celeb hangouts.

The pair were filmed at Hollywood nightspot MyHouse before driving to her sister Nicky Hilton's nearby home in West Hollywood at 3am but Ronaldo reportedly grew tired of Hilton’s hunger for fame.

Kim Kardashian

The Euro 2016 winner jumped from one fame-famished reality TV star to another when he snuggled up to the professional celebrity in 2010.

The pair were spotted kissing when the socialite made a three-day trip to Madrid.

A source told the Sun: “She and Ronaldo were kissing and very affectionate. They looked to be getting on really well laughing the whole time.”

Irina Shayk

2010 was a busy year for the budding actress and it was then she caught the attention of the Real Madrid man.

The beauty landed the cover of Elle Spain for their November 2010 issue and Glamour Spain awarded her Best International Model of 2010.

At the end of the year she was pictured nude in the GQ Spain December issue and around that time she hooked up with the footballer but it ended in January 2015 after she had grown close to Ron and his son.

Georgina Rodriguez

With another Ballon D’or in the bag and Ronaldo’s professional life looking sweet he has settled down in his love life again with Spanish beauty Georegina Rodriguez.

The loved-up pair enjoyed a covert trip to Disneyland Paris – the city of love - back in November with the super-famous star wearing a disguise to fool fellow thrill seekers.

Judging by Rodriguez’s Instagram account she has already enjoyed trips to the Bernabeu to watch the No9 play and things are getting serious."

Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow hit Ja’Marr Chase for a touchdown in the first half of the team’s Week 14 game against the Cleveland Browns.

And that is dramatically underselling it.

Burrow otherwise off to a slow stat in a grimy AFC North bout threaded the proverbial needle through two defenders in the endzone so much so Chase didn’t even see the ball until it was in his lap.

And while Chase gets a ton of credit for catching a pass on sheer instinct that he didn’t even see coming there are very very few quarterbacks in the NFL who can make this throw:

However the company’s take on the all-in 2-in-1 convertible laptop is certainly worth a second look. The new ENVY x360 covers all the essential bases–relatively lightweight slim with adequate processing power and it doubles up as a drawing tablet.

The slim (16.1mm thick) ENVY x360 is made to look and feel even slimmer with the help of curves on the edges while the weight of 1.34kg isn’t bad either; it’s slightly lighter than the average slim laptop. However it feels unwieldy as a tablet and is more suited to be a table-bound drawing tablet. To accommodate the USB-A ports HP uses a hinge to create a semi-closing flap that maintains the shape of the body when the port is not in use.

In addition to the two USB-A v3.1 Gen 2 ports the ENVY x360 features two Thunderbolt 4 ports one microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The Thunderbolt ports are also used for charging and for connecting to an external display (via an external adapter).

While this is somewhat of a personal preference I found myself particularly fond of the typing experience. The keyboard has a short key travel but the feedback is pretty satisfying. They’ve added a few interesting Function keys-namely an emoji menu a quick app launcher and a soft switch for the camera.

The 5MP webcam isn’t the best in resolution and image quality but the baseline is pretty decent and HP adds a host of features to further boost its usability in most call situations–backlight adjustment filter enhanced lighting (use backlight of your laptop display to brighten face). Auto Frame is probably the most eye-catching of the lot as it shifts the camera view to keep you centred in the video.

The software is generally decent. Bloatware isn’t as big of a problem these days and HP’s add-ons aren’t too bad either. Stuff like QuickDrop lets you transfer files from your mobile phone and gives you a Universal Clipboard-like feature as well.

Our unit packed a low-power Intel Core i7-1250U CPU Iris Xe graphics 16GB of RAM and 1TB storage. Performance-wise so long as you’re not doing heavy video editing work and the like you’ll be fine. The trade-off for performance comes in the form of battery life. I can easily last a day on the laptop doing productivity work; unless you’re constantly spamming 4K videos and the like which understandably drains the battery relatively quickly.

While the OLED model is not available in Singapore the IPS display with 100per cent sRGB coverage is not too bad at al. It’s touchscreen-enabled and supports the use of a stylus which is included in the package.

Paired with the Bang & Olufsen speakers the laptop makes a pretty nice movie machine especially in tented mode. The dynamic range of the visuals isn’t killer but at least the colours are pretty on point. Note that while the brightness is adequate visibility isn’t that good outdoors because of the rather glossy screen.

HP also includes a stylus that you can attach to the side magnetically–which is great–however it doesn’t charge wirelessly and you need to slide open the shroud to access the USB-C port for that. I’m not an artist so I can’t comment on the finer aspects of the stylus but for note-taking taking at least it feels pretty natural and is responsive enough.

On the whole the ENVY x360 is a pretty good package for someone who spends a lot of time on the road. The regular price of $2299 is on the steeper side (but somewhat understandable) even with its excellent features but the sale price of $1999 (not sure if or when they will reduce it again) is actually a pretty good sweet spot to hit and one I can get behind.

Sukhu did his LLB from Himachal Pradesh University Shimla. He married Kamlesh Thakur on June 11 1998 and they have two daughters.After taking admission in a college at Sanjauli he joined NSUI and became a class representative and later was elected as the general secretary and president of HPU’s Student’s Central Association. For 10 years he remained the state president of Youth Congress from 1999 to 2008. He also remained a councillor of Shimla municipal corporation for two terms. He became an MLA in 2003 2007 2017 and 2022. In 2012 he lost the election. Sukhu created his mass following in the Congress when he was appointed as the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee president on January 8 2013 when late Virbhadra Singh was the chief minister. At a time when most Congress leaders were toeing lines dictated by Virbhadra it was Sukhu who stood against him. Many a time there was a bitter war of words of between the two. When Virbhadra was the chief minister and Sukhu was the state PCC president they used to confront each other on many issues. Their rivalry and factional feud had reached a point where then chief minister Virbhadra Singh had even demanded from the high command to remove Sukhu as PCC president before 2017 assembly elections but high command had made clear to him that state leadership would remain unchanged.Sukhu has a strong presence of his followers in every assembly constituency and many admire him for standing against Virbhadra when no other Congress leader dared to do so. He remained state president for a period of six years till January 10 2019. In the absence of its former chief minister late Virbhadra Singh Congress had launched its election in Himachal Pradesh by appointing its sitting MLA from Nadaun and former state president Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu as chairman of campaign committee in April this year. In 2017 assembly elections too Congress high command had appointed Sukhu as the campaign committee head but later replaced him with Virbhadra Singh.After Congress won 40 seats there was a stiff competition between state president Pratibha Singh and Sukhu for the chief minister’s post. Pratibha and her supporters opposed it till the last moment but could not succeed as Sukhu on the basis of the support from MLAs managed to get himself elected as the leader of Congress legislature party to become the chief minister.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdXRvL2Jpa2VzLzIwMjMtYm13LXMtMTAwMC1yci1sYXVuY2hlZC1pbi1pbmRpYS1hdC1ycy0yMC0yNS1sYWtoLTIxMC1ocC1taXNzaWxlLXdlaWdoaW5nLWp1c3QtMTk0LWtnL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MTI5MzI3LmNtc9IBpQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdXRvL2Jpa2VzLzIwMjMtYm13LXMtMTAwMC1yci1sYXVuY2hlZC1pbi1pbmRpYS1hdC1ycy0yMC0yNS1sYWtoLTIxMC1ocC1taXNzaWxlLXdlaWdoaW5nLWp1c3QtMTk0LWtnL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjEyOTMyNy5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2023 BMW S 1000 RR launched in India at Rs 20.25 lakh: 210 hp missile weighing just 194 kg!,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdXRvL2Jpa2VzLzIwMjMtYm13LXMtMTAwMC1yci1sYXVuY2hlZC1pbi1pbmRpYS1hdC1ycy0yMC0yNS1sYWtoLTIxMC1ocC1taXNzaWxlLXdlaWdoaW5nLWp1c3QtMTk0LWtnL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MTI5MzI3LmNtc9IBpQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdXRvL2Jpa2VzLzIwMjMtYm13LXMtMTAwMC1yci1sYXVuY2hlZC1pbi1pbmRpYS1hdC1ycy0yMC0yNS1sYWtoLTIxMC1ocC1taXNzaWxlLXdlaWdoaW5nLWp1c3QtMTk0LWtnL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjEyOTMyNy5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00FC0D630>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Several artists will paint live on site and compete for three top prizes and the public can choose a people’s choice award at Mother’s Holiday Market which opens at 11 a.m.

Ted Vander Roest speculated about a town the size of Springfield not having an art league when several nearby smaller ones did. He spoke with Springfield Museum of Art executive officials several years ago on the prospect but it was stalled somewhat by circumstances including the pandemic.

Last year he teamed with local artist Robine Wright to start the league with monthly meetings at the Museum of Art.

“There are a lot of artists in the area. We worked with Jessimi Jones at the Museum of Art helped with the Members’ Show and started to build traction. It’s going to be like a community” Vander Roest said.

The MRAL is open to painters sculptors potters and artists of any skill level to get together to share with others to critique and get advice do workshops and learn from each other and help with marketing their work.

It is not limited to just Clark County as the Mad River name reflects.

“It’s been so beautiful to watch this form with so many artists” said Wright whose work has been displayed in the area for several years.

Businesses partnering with MRAL for the Art Prowl are Auto Zone; Champion City; COHatch; Courtyard by Marriott; Duo Home; Edward Jones; Firefly Boutique; Frame Haven; Huntington Bank; Key Bank; Le Torte Dolci; Mercy Health; Park National Bank; Pretzelmaker; Salato Deli; Sip & Dipity; Stella Bleu; Un Mundo Café.

Any works sold will share 20 percent of the profits with the business it was sold at to donate to their preferred charity. Vander Roest said the goal is to make the Art Prowl an annual event.

“All of the businesses have been so excited to work on this” Wright said. “We are glad to be connecting businesses.”

The Plein Air Society is a group of artists who do their art outdoors. Some attending the event at Mother Stewart’s may work outside weather depending and the works will be available 12:30-3 p.m.

This is just the beginning. Vander Roest said future plans include workshops working with live models and having a presence at local events such as possibly the Summer Arts Festival.

Más precisamente se trata del buque USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-123). Así pudo reportar a finales del mes de noviembre el astillero constructor Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII).

En base a lo reportado la entrega del buque a la Marina de los Estados Unidos tuvo lugar el 30 de noviembre. Esta se da luego de que el destructor USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee completará sus respectivas pruebas de mar y de aceptación. La realización de estas fue indicada por el propio astillero Huntington Ingalls Industries a mediados del mes de octubre.

“Entregar un barco terminado increíblemente capaz a la Marina siempre es un evento importante para nuestro equipo de Ingalls” dijo Kari Wilkinson presidente de Ingalls Shipbuilding. “Estamos absolutamente comprometidos con el trabajo que hacemos para nuestros clientes comunidades y país”.

El nuevo destructor de los Estados Unidos ha sido nombrado en honor a Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee la primera mujer en recibir la Cruz de la Marina. Sirvió con la Marina durante 14 años incluidos 11 como Superintendente del Cuerpo de Enfermeras de la Marina de los EE. UU. Se unió al Cuerpo de Enfermeras de la Armada en octubre de 1908 y fue ascendida a enfermera jefe menos de un año después.

A su vez desde el astillero han indicado que este es el destructor clase Arleigh Burke número 34 construido para la Marina de los Estados Unidos. Mientras que han reportado que prosigue la construcción de más unidades. Más precisamente de los buques denominados Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125) Ted Stevens (DDG 128) Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129) and George M. Neal (DDG 131). Estos pertenecientes a la versión Flight III de la clase.

Sobre los destructores Arleigh Burke:

Los buques de la clase Arleigh Burke son destructores de misiles guiados de múltiples misiones diseñados para operar ofensiva y defensivamente de forma independiente o como unidades de Carrier Strike Groups Expeditionary Strike Groups y Surface Action Groups en entornos de múltiples amenazas que incluyen amenazas aéreas de superficie y submarinas. Estos buques responderán a escenarios de conflicto de baja intensidad/guerra costera y litoral en alta mar así como a conflictos en mar abierto proporcionando o aumentando la proyección de potencia los requisitos de presencia avanzada y las operaciones de escolta en el mar.

Although researchers can presently sequence the genome of many organisms within days at moderate to low costs (van Nimwegen et al. 2016) the scale and complexity of the produced data raise significant challenges for de novo genome assembly read mapping variant calling and genotyping as well as for the interpretation of the obtained results (see Pfeifer 2017 for a discussion of the challenges and guidelines in short-read sequencing).

In concert with the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology many software tools have been developed for the computational processing of genomic sequencing data each with their own distinct errors and biases. In fact systematic comparisons of computational pipelines across multiple high-throughput sequencing platforms indicated high divergence and low concordance among the identified variants (O’Rawe et al. 2013; Pirooznia et al. 2014; Hwang et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2019; Kumaran et al. 2019; Krishnan et al. 2021; Barbitoff et al. 2022). Such differences in performance are particularly problematic for the identification of spontaneous (de novo) mutations as well as rare variants with differences in pipeline design leading to several-fold variation in estimated mutation rates (Pfeifer 2021; Bergeron et al. 2022) as well as high rates of missed variants (Peng et al. 2013).

Given the crucial impact of computational analysis pipelines on the reliability and robustness of results careful benchmarking is required both to assess the performance of existing and newly designed computational genomic pipelines as well as to quantify their sensitivity and specificity for any given study. In humans a handful of high-quality empirical datasets exist for this purpose (such as the “gold-standard” Genome In A Bottle dataset maintained by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology; Zook et al. 2014) but similar datasets remain absent for most non-model organisms. For these species synthetic (i.e. simulated) sequence data provide an alternative means to guide the development and validation of computational pipelines in silico. In contrast to empirical data simulations allow for the implementation of controlled scenarios with parameters of arbitrary complexity for which the “ground truth” is known a priori. Importantly knowledge of this “ground truth” does not only enable benchmarking and performance comparisons it also allows researchers to distinguish between distinct (often hypothetical) biological scenarios and to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of particular study design choices (for a discussion on the topic see the recommendations for improving statistical inference in population genomics by Johri et al. 2022). In addition simulations can guide future experimental designs and aid parameter optimization by studying the potential impact of technological factors (such as sample size sequencing coverage as well as quality continuity and completeness of available reference assemblies) on downstream analyses (Stephens et al. 2016).

Although synthetic data is clearly highly valuable it is important that it faithfully resembles both platform-specific features of the sequencing data (such as read type and length fragment size distribution rates and patterns of sequencing error quality score distribution and if applicable PCR amplification bias due to differential efficiencies of primers) as well as the biological/genomic characteristics of the organism studied (such as rates of substitution insertion and deletion GC-content etc.). Over the past years several software packages have been developed to simulate realistic high-throughput genomic datasets with and without the ability to spike in known variants (e.g. Ewing et al. 2015) the majority of which focused on emulating data generated by Illumina sequencing—one (if not currently the most) widely-used sequencing technology in research applications (see reviews by Escalona et al. 2016 Zhao et al. 2017 and Alosaimi et al. 2020). In general these methods use either pre-defined “basic” models or “advanced” parameterized custom models designed to mimic the genomic characteristics of the empirical sequence dataset at hand—however as previously noted by Escalona et al. (2016) these tools “have largely not been benchmarked or validated” independently.

Here we compare six short-read simulators—ART (Huang et al. 2012) DWGSIM (Homer 2022) InSilicoSeq (Gourlé et al. 2019) Mason (Holtgrewe 2010) NEAT (Stephens et al. 2016) and wgsim (Li et al. 2009) (Table 1) selected based on their popularity within our scientific community—to assess their ability to accurately mimic characteristic features (namely genomic coverage distribution of fragment lengths quality scores and systematic errors as well as GC-coverage bias) of real data obtained from Illumina sequencing for which error models have been well-characterized.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-clinical data indicate that INCA033989 can alter disease course by reducing mutant CALR allele burden and thus may be an efficacious and safe treatment in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). This research was featured in the Plenary Scientific Session (Abstract #6. Session: Hematology Disease Topics & Pathways: Research Diseases Therapies Myeloid Malignancies) at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting held December 10-13 2022 in New Orleans and virtually1.

“As a pioneer in the field of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) having brought the first FDA-approved treatment to patients we are excited to have the opportunity to share details of our latest research” said Dash Dhanak Ph.D. Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer Incyte. “We continue to apply our deep understanding of the complex biology of MPNs to expand treatment options for patients and the work on INCA033989 presented today reflects our progress toward this goal. We look forward to continuing to advance the development of this potential new treatment and to initiating clinical trials for INCA033989 next year.”

CALR mutations are responsible for disease development in approximately 25-35%23 of patients with MF and ET – two common types of MPNs. INCA033989 binds with high affinity to mutant CALR and inhibits oncogenesis the process of cells becoming cancerous in cells expressing this oncoprotein. As described in our presentation INCA033989 potently antagonizes CALR oncogenic function resulting in selective inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling only in CALR-mutated cells with no effect on normal non-oncogenic cells. This selectivity of action with INCA033989 results in the specific killing of tumor cells harboring the mutation and is suggestive of the potential to alter the course of disease in patients with CALR-mutant MF and ET.

“Diseases like myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia are often difficult to understand and treat and unique approaches are necessary to develop effective and safe therapies” said Srdan Verstovsek M.D. Ph.D. Professor of Medicine Department of Leukemia University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “As a leader in the field Incyte is uniquely positioned to develop novel medicines for these rare blood cancers and this research provides strong rationale for the continued investigation and clinical advancement of INCA033989 – a novel treatment approach that targets CALR mutations.”

About Myeloproliferative Neoplasms

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a closely related group of blood cancers in which the bone marrow functions abnormally. The bone marrow is where the body’s blood cells are made. MPNs are progressive blood cancers that can strike anyone at any age but they are more common in older adults. Estimates of the prevalence of MPNs vary but analysis of claims data suggests there may be as many as 200000 people in the U.S. living with the most prevalent MPNs: myelofibrosis polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia4.

Progressive disease

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a closely related group of blood cancers in which the bone marrow where the body’s blood cells are made functions abnormally. MPNs are progressive blood cancers that can strike anyone at any age but they are more common in older adults. Estimates of the prevalence of MPNs vary but analysis of claims data suggests there may be as many as 200000 people in the U.S. living with the most prevalent MPNs: myelofibrosis polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.

While the current treatment options for MPNs offer effective symptom management they also result in high rates of discontinuation which is caused by the emergence of resistance and inadequate drug tolerability. Hence the development of new therapeutics selective for cells expressing calreticulin (CALR)-mutations (mutCALR) would allow targeting neoplastic cells without compromising normal hematopoiesis.

“As a pioneer in the field of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) having brought the first FDA-approved treatment to patients we are excited to have the opportunity to share details of our latest research” noted Dash Dhanak Ph.D. Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer Incyte.

“We continue to apply our deep understanding of the complex biology of MPNs to expand treatment options for patients and the work on INCA033989 presented today reflects our progress toward this goal. We look forward to continuing to advance the development of this potential new treatment and to initiating clinical trials for INCA033989 next year” Dhanak added.

Calreticulin (CALR-) mutations

Calreticulin (CALR) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein involved in a spectrum of cellular processes. In healthy cells CALR operates as a chaperone and Ca2+ buffer to assist correct protein folding within the ER. Besides favoring the maintenance of cellular proteostasis these cell-intrinsic CALR functions support Ca2+-dependent processes such as adhesion and integrin signaling and ensure normal antigen presentation on MHC Class I molecules.[2]

CALR- mutations are responsible for disease development in approximately 25-35% of patients with MF and ET – two common types of MPNs. These mutations can include insertions or deletions in exon 9 of CALR resulting (in both cases) in a frameshift that leads to the expression of a novel positively charged C-terminus as well as the loss of the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–retention signal.a The CALR- mutation (mutCALR) protein has a novel function that involves stable interaction with the thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R). This interaction originates in the ER and is followed by the transit of the mutCALR/TPO-R complex to the cell surface resulting in constitutive activation of JAK2/STAT signaling.

Inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling

INCA033989 binds with high affinity to mutant CALR and inhibits oncogenesis the process of cells becoming cancerous in cells expressing this oncoprotein.[3][4]

The investigational agent potently antagonizes CALR oncogenic function resulting in selective inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling only in CALR-mutated cells with no effect on normal non-oncogenic cells. This selectivity of action with INCA033989 results in the specific killing of tumor cells harboring the mutation and is suggestive of the potential to alter the course of disease in patients with CALR-mutant MF and ET.

“Diseases like myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia are often difficult to understand and treat and unique approaches are necessary to develop effective and safe therapies” said Srdan Verstovsek M.D. Ph.D. Professor of Medicine Department of Leukemia University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

“[..] this research provides strong rationale for the continued investigation and clinical advancement of INCA033989 – a novel treatment approach that targets CALR mutations” Verstovsek concluded.

Note: a KDEL is a target peptide sequence in mammals and plants located on the C-terminal end of the amino acid structure of a protein. The KDEL sequence prevents a protein from being secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and facilitates its return if it is accidentally exported.

Meanwhile Jawara Media has demonstrated some early performance numbers of the product which appears to deliver noticeable performance improvements over its direct predecessor the Core i5-12400 since it has more cores and higher clocks. Moreover the new part is outstanding in multi-threaded workloads. But there is a catch.

Intel's Core i5-13400 is a 6+4 core unit (six high-performance cores and four energy-efficient cores) with a 2.50 GHz base clock a 4.60 GHz boost clock and a 20MB L3 cache. Compared to its predecessor — the Core i5-12400 — this new processor has four 'extra' cores a 200 MHz higher boost clock and carries an extra 2MB of L3 cache. The CPU costs 4.071.000 Indonesian rupiah roughly equal to $226 with VAT excluded. $226 is in a ballpark of Intel's recommended customer price of $211 - $221 for the Core i5-12400.

Why Intel's Core i5-13400 is necessary whatsoever besides the part that has four 'extra' energy-efficient cores and has not been released by the company officially? This product is the only one in Intel's 13th Generation Core that uses Raptor Lake B0 and Alder Lake C0 silicon. The CPU is formally a 65W part which comes with a locked multiplier; therefore it is not a part that can be easily overclocked. There may still be the BCLK overclocking option but since nobody has tried it on this particular CPU model and with different dies this part is uncertain at this point.

Regarding performance the Core i5-13400 — at least in its C0 die version (CPU-Z still recognizes it as a Raptor Lake for obvious reasons) — seems to deliver visible performance gains over its predecessor mainly due to additional 'efficiency' cores.

Even though the Core i5-13400 — likely to be announced at CES next month — is listed in Indonesia and has even been tested in select applications. Remember that we are dealing with preliminary information so take it with a grain of salt.

In Cinebench R23 the new Core i5-13400 is about 5.5% faster in single-thread performance (evident given the clocks and the cache). Still its multi-thread score is a whopping 29% higher than its ancestor according to results obtained by Jawara Media. Likewise when it comes to Blender which is another workload that heavily uses multi-threading it is 22% faster than its predecessor. As for H.264 1080p export video in Adobe Premier the new one delivers a 23% better result because this workload explicitly uses multi-threading.

While performance gains are significant additional cores and clocks add more power consumption at least based on data from Jawara Media. For example the upcoming Intel Core i5-13400 has its maximum processor power boosted to 86W which is 20W higher than the i5-12400 part. Meanwhile CPU temperature increased as Jawara Media used a fairly advanced NZXT T120 HF air cooler.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNrZWVkYS5jb20vZ2FtaW5nLXRlY2gvaW50ZWwtY29yZS1pOS0xMzkwMGtzLW1pZ2h0LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWNoYW1waW9uLWFtZC1zdGlsbC13aW5uaW5nLXRlcm1zLXByaWNlLXRvLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9 13900KS might be the performance champion but AMD is still winning in terms of price-to-performance,"Intel is yet to officially reveal the Core i9 13900KS processor. However its benchmarks have already been leaked online suggesting a slight performance boost over the 13900K.

Geekbench 5 test results related to the CPU were recently offered by Twitter leaker Benchleaks. The results indicate a massive performance gain compared to the last-gen Core i9 12900KS. But when pegged against the AMD Ryzen 7000 series flagship the 13900KS' value proposition falls apart.

Intel declared that the chip would be the first to pioneer 6 GHz clock frequencies right out of the box. While the current flagship the Core i9 13900K packs a turbo clock of up to 5.8 GHz the new processor will hit 6 GHz since it will be based on binned dies. This will give the i9 13900KS a performance advantage over the best-in-class offerings today. However is the card worth getting for everyone?

Core i9 13900KS is an impressive processor but not built for gamers

A quick look at both the Core i9 13900K and the i9 13900KS suggests that these processors are not built for gaming. The chips pack 24 cores — eight performance and 16 efficient — as well as 32 threads. The 13900K is rated for a maximum turbo power of 253W and the 13900KS is expected to beat that number and draw more power.

The Core i9 13900K was introduced for a hefty premium of $599. A listing of the Core i9 13900KS was spotted on a Canadian retailer's website. The chip was allegedly priced at CA$971.99 which according to today's dollar conversion rate is $708.06.

Intel will not increase the number of cores or the amount of cache for the new KS offering. The upcoming processor will solely rely on the slightly higher clock speed to offer more performance.

Based on the recent leaks the 13900KS is not much faster than the Core i9 13900K. The difference is as little as that between the Core i9 12900K and the i9 12900KS.

Chip Single-core score (Geekbench 5) Multi-core score (Geekbench 5) Core i9 13900KS 2319 26774 Core i9 13900K 2227 24311 Ryzen 9 7950X 2192 22963 Core i9 12900KS 2081 19075 Core i9 12900K 1988 17324

Thus for such a small difference paying almost over $100 is not worth it. Instead the Ryzen 7000 chips offer far higher value for the money a user pays for them.

The upcoming Core i9 13900KS is only about 5% faster than the Ryzen 9 7950X. The latter was initially launched for $699. However following low demand and poor sales figures AMD revised the prices and the chip can now be picked for just $573 on Newegg. It's worth noting that the processor's cost dropped to just $549 a few days ago.

This makes the product even cheaper than the Core i9 13900K which is barely 1% faster in single-core performance than the Ryzen 9 7950X. Users should note that most games rely on a processor's single-core performance numbers to deliver high framerates. Multi-core scores reflect the chip's performance when it comes to productivity tasks.

Although these flagship chips are way overkill for gaming in 2022 those looking to build a high-end PC rig solely for playing video games should consider the Ryzen 9 7950X over the Core i9 13900K and the 13900KS. With DDR5 RAM getting cheaper by the day and more AM5 motherboards hitting the market going for the Ryzen offering comes across as a no-brainer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbHMtcmFqYS1rb2R1cmktc2F5cy0yMDB3LXRvLTIyNXctaXMtYS1zd2VldC1zcG90LWZvci1ncHVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's Raja Koduri says 200W to 225W is a sweet spot for GPUs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbHMtcmFqYS1rb2R1cmktc2F5cy0yMDB3LXRvLTIyNXctaXMtYS1zd2VldC1zcG90LWZvci1ncHVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00DD71A20>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

• Because Americans were relatively flush from receiving government pandemic stimulus payments they could pay the higher prices removing an incentive for companies to lower them.

• Prices rose during the COVID-19 pandemic because of supply chain disruptions and later because of Russia’s war in Ukraine but wages didn’t rise as quickly. For companies higher prices combined with steady labor costs has yielded higher profits.

• Some lawmakers have suggested that high corporate profits have been driving inflation which is at a 40-year high. But economists say the opposite is true with inflation boosting company profits which are at historical highs.

The disconnect between 40-year high inflation and historically high corporate profits has led some Democratic lawmakers to propose cracking down on companies.

Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon are sponsoring a bill that would authorize the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to ban ""unconscionably excessive price increases."" The senators argue that ""opportunistic corporations are using inflation to conceal their abuse of pricing power exponentially increasing prices for American consumers.""

A separate bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt. would impose a 95% tax on ""excess profits"" for certain companies with average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million.

However a range of economists mostly agreed that corporate profits aren’t necessarily driving inflation. Rather they are almost certainly benefiting from it.

How high are today’s corporate profits historically speaking?

There’s little doubt that today’s corporate profits are high. Very high.

One measure economists use is profit per unit of real gross value added which is basically a way to compare profits to business productivity. From 2011 to 2020 this metric remained fairly steady. But after the coronavirus pandemic’s onset the metric began rising sharply. During 2022’s second and third quarters the metric set a record increasing nearly 50% over the typical level from 2011 to 2020.

Another metric corporate profits as a percentage of gross domestic product tells a similar story. In 2021 this measurement was higher than any year going back to the Great Depression.

Although profitability varies by sector most industries are reaping significantly more profit than they were just a few years ago.

Since the recession year of 2009 corporate profits measured in raw dollars have doubled for the economy as a whole. But certain sectors have outpaced that: Profits are now 3.6 times higher than 2009 for retail; 4.8 times higher for transportation and for food and lodging; 5.3 times higher for manufacturing; and 7 times higher for construction.

The sharpest increases have typically occurred since the pandemic started and there’s evidence suggesting that the pandemic changed how companies think about expenditures and profits with workers taking a smaller share of the pie and stockholders taking a larger share.

A study by the liberal Economic Policy Institute found that between 1979 and 2019 labor costs accounted for about 62% of cost increases capital expenditures accounted for about 27% of cost increases and profits accounted for about 11%.

But during the pandemic’s first seven quarters the study found labor and capital costs accounted for 8% and 38% respectively while profits accounted for 54%.

In the traditional way of thinking ""businesses could use the extra revenue to expand production"" through increased investment in capital and production said Aaron Sojourner a senior researcher at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.

Instead he said corporations have focused on sharing profits with shareholders and buying back stock practices that have hit record highs in recent years.

What has sent profits skyrocketing?

A company that hasn’t seen its costs rise could theoretically join the price-raising bandwagon out of sheer opportunism. But it’s more common economists say for inflation to directly produce higher profits.

""The rising market power and corporations' desire to maximize profits are not the root cause of inflation which comes instead from the excess of aggregate demand over aggregate supply"" said Kimberly Clausing a professor of tax law and policy at UCLA School of Law.

On the supply side the pandemic wreaked havoc on production and distribution. Some materials became harder to obtain and thus more expensive; transportation system bottlenecks kept products from their destinations which also raised prices.

Meanwhile on the demand side the U.S. government under Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden spent heavily to keep the economy and especially consumer purchasing from cratering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the pandemic’s throttle on travel and hospitality spending eased consumers’ spending surged.

So although prices were already high government stimulus payments enabled Americans to buy the more expensive goods and services removing the incentive for companies to lower their prices when supply conditions changed.

The portion of the price increases that wasn’t t strictly dictated by companies’ higher costs ""resulted in higher profits for producers proprietors and corporations"" said Gary Burtless an economist with the Brookings Institution a Washington. D.C.-based think tank.

Also wages have not kept pace with rising prices for consumer goods and services partly because salaries for the workforce’s middle tier tend not to be adjusted for sudden changes. That means for companies revenue has risen but labor costs have increased by less or not at all — and companies have captured that differential as profit said Michael Faulkender a University of Maryland finance professor who was the Treasury Department’s assistant secretary for economic policy from 2019 to 2021.

Eventually the market might force corporate profit rates back down ""but that would not happen overnight"" Baker said.

What is the explanation for what’s happening in the oil and gas industry?

Many Americans chafed when after shelling out for months of record-high gasoline prices ExxonMobil announced a record quarterly profit of $19.7 billion.

Some questioned why oil companies didn’t produce more oil to meet the rise in demand after COVID-19 health restrictions were lifted.

Expanding production would require large up-front expenditures for facilities and infrastructure. But because of concerns about climate change the momentum has moved away from fossil fuels and toward greener energy. This means that if oil companies made big investments they’d be on the hook to pay for them without much certainty they would eventually recoup what they’d spent.

""Unless you have an environment where the politics and the economics encourage reinvestment with a long-term payoff you’re not going to see reinvestment"" Faulkender said. ""So they return that money to investors.""

Will high corporate profits be a permanent shift?

If a recession occurs — a possibility as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to tackle inflation — it would likely send corporate profits sharply downward Burtless said. And even without a recession there likely will be upward pressure on wages over time which would force companies to redirect more revenue toward labor costs at the expense of profits Clausing said.

Some long-term trends — including the accelerating retirement of baby boomers and a decline in legal immigration since Trump’s presidency — point to continuing labor shortages. Long-term labor shortages likely would push wages higher potentially reducing profitability to more traditional levels.

Personal savings spiked during the pandemic when the government was distributing stimulus aid but restaurant dining travel and other leisure activities were restricted. But personal savings in recent months have fallen below recent historical norms. That means Americans may no longer be able to afford high prices for goods and services. This could force companies to lower prices and slim their profit margins.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmNoYXJ0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzEyNDA1MzE3L2NvY29hLWEtYnVsbGlzaC1sb25nLXRlcm0tdHJlbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cocoa A Bullish Long-Term Trend,"Switch the Market flag

Pier Guidi and fellow Ferrari factory drivers James Calado and Antonio Fuoco claimed victory in the Intercontinental GT Challenge season finale at Yas Marina Circuit coming in the Ferrari 488’s final outing in a factory capacity.

The No. 71 Ferrari 488 GT3 Evo 2020 held command of the around-the-clock enduro although the race saw the Audi R8 LMS GT3 Evos from Sainteloc Junior Team and Team Tressor Attempto as well as the No. 77 Al Manar Racing by GetSpeed Mercedes-AMG GT3 Evo exchange the lead at times.

This was because teams were on split strategies due to the nature of the race’s ten ‘Imposed Pit Stops’ that saw some cars pit as early as the race’s second lap to get a jump start on the series of mandated 1-minute and 40-second stops.

“We followed our strategy” Pier Guidi told Sportscar365. “[We found] that it was better to pit early than later because you cannot pit during a Full Course Yellow.

“If you pitted early and had a safety car you could close the gap for the people that didn’t pit. This is why our last pit stop was with 1 hour and 15 minutes [to go] exactly the time of the fuel [stint].

“Even for us it was not super easy to understand which car did the imposed pit stop or the quick pit stop as on the screen you just see the number of pit stops.

“Some of them were not. For example if you run out of fuel and had to pit under Full Course Yellow it didn’t count.

“It was difficult to follow but after five six seven hours we saw we were in good shape. The pace was strong.”

Fuoco echoed Pier Guidi’s comments about the rhythm of the race which didn’t become fully apparent until past halfway.

“It was a bit difficult with the strategy to understand where we were until the end but I think overall it was quite positive” he told Sportscar365.

“I think in the beginning of the race they were a bit quicker than us. Then through the race even with the Audi we were very close. I think it would have been a tough battle if they stayed on track.

“Unfortunately they didn’t finish the race. We were able to manage the pace a bit more at the end so we’re really happy.”

Calado: Ferrari 488 Was “Dominant Car in it’s Succession”

Calado who along with Pier Guidi only arrived at Yas Marina Circuit on Saturday after collecting their FIA World Endurance GT drivers’ championship trophies at the FIA Gala in Bologna paid tribute to the Ferrari 488 in its last factory outing.

“It’s been amazing” he told Sportscar365. “We started the first year in 2016. From when it first left the garage we knew it was a really nice car to drive.

“There’s been ups and downs especially with BoP things but in general we’ve always been there or theres abouts not necessarily the fastest in quali probably hardly ever.

“But I think it’s just an amazing race car with such a good balance; it’s good on tires.

“The team pushed hard over these years to keep improving it because obviously now it’s an old car. They’ve done everything they could to try and maximize every little bit of time that there was available.

“I think it’s down to the team for designing what was such an amazing car. That’s the reason why we’ve had so much success.

“We’ve had a successful year in general and it was obviously the last race for this amazing car. It was truly a dominant car in its succession.”

Pier Guidi added: “It means a lot it means that it was a winning car. We won so much with this car with both spec GTE and GT3.

“It’s always nice to close the circle with a victory. It’s been difficult but we really wanted to win.

“That’s why we flew at the last moment. We wanted to win this race. It was important for us and the 488 which was our car.”

It produced short briefs intended to spur out-of-the-box thinking on flawed assumptions and misperceptions about the world encouraging alternative policy thinking. At another pivotal time of increasing uncertainty this project is intended as an open-source version using a similar format to question outmoded mental maps and “strategic empathy” to discern the motives and constraints of other global actors enhancing the possibility of more effective strategies.

A Widening Chasm

The Ukraine War could be a turning point not just for relations between the West and Russia and China but also for the West’s relationship with the majority of the world’s population in the Global South. Assuming that the countries comprising the Global South would react the same way Western publics did to the Russian invasion was a huge miscalculation.

Unfortunately the split between the West and the Global South is widening. For many developing countries the alienation toward the West did not begin with Ukraine; rather it can be traced to the West’s disregard for their struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic if not further back. Westerners need to acknowledge the negative impacts of some of their policies toward developing countries which have too often created or aggravated turmoil such as in Iraq and Haiti. Nevertheless which side is right in their response to the Ukraine war matters less than the growing negative perception by the Global South of the “self-centered” West intent on increasing its power by squeezing China and Russia economically and politically. Partly in response to Western pressure on them Beijing and Moscow have upped their game in the Global South.

If the West wants to remain relevant as population and economic growth shift over time to developing countries then it must pay more attention to the Global South. The health of planet Earth requires a united fight against climate change; otherwise all are losers. Similarly as with Middle East insurgencies and terrorism in the early 2000s instability in one region can pose a threat elsewhere. By supporting stability and prosperity outside their borders Western countries also protect their interests. Contrary to what some may think the West relies on the Global South through longstanding economic and trade security and diplomatic exchanges and partnerships. Developing countries also contribute to science advancement and greatly influence global culture from the food to the entertainment industry that in turn also enable more economic opportunities for Western economies.

Ambivalence over Ukraine

In the Spring 2022 Ipsos poll of 27 Western and developing countries publics in the selected Global South nations opposed the Russian invasion. On average across all countries there was a consensus that “doing nothing in Ukraine will encourage Russia to take further military action.” However for Hungary India Malaysia and Saudi Arabia the opinion that “the problems of Ukraine are none of our business and we should not interfere” prevailed. This view is also shared by half of those surveyed in Argentina Israel and Mexico. In contrast except for Hungary between 65% and 80% of those living in all eight other European Union member countries surveyed as well as in Great Britain the United States Canada Australia Japan and South Korea disagree.

There are sharper divisions on providing military support or sending troops to Ukraine. Publics in developing countries oppose sending military aid including troops. On sanctions “while more than 75% in South Korea and Poland agree fewer than 40% in Argentina Brazil Hungary Mexico and Peru do so.” Moreover publics in developing countries included in the polling oppose banning Russian energy because they fear price increases.

Western Incomprehension of the Global South and Vice Versa

The Global South’s ambivalence on Ukraine is also reflected in the UN General Assembly resolution against Russia’s recent annexation of four provinces. Overall a vast majority condemned Russia’s actions but 52 countries from the Global South with most in Africa and Asia opposed or abstained in voting on the resolution showing little change since a similar vote in March despite extensive Russian atrocities. Eurasian countries including India as well as China Mongolia Pakistan and all five Central Asian states plus Iran did not vote for the resolution. As the Quincy Institute’s Sarang Shidore notes “almost all these states also belong to the [China-created] Shanghai Cooperation Organization — a rising if still early-stage — international organization representing one of the core geographies of the global order.” Twenty-four African states also abstained opposed or did not vote for the resolution. Latin America and Caribbean governments — except for Bolivia Cuba El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua and Venezuela — largely voted for it. “By population a majority of the Global South and governments representing nations with close to half of the world’s population did not agree with Washington’s position when put to a public vote” Shidore continues.

For the West the fact that so many countries in the Global South are not seized by the Ukraine crisis appears incomprehensible if not morally wrong. French President Emmanuel Macron accused neutrals in the Global South “…who remain silent today despite themselves or secretly with a certain complicity are serving the cause of a new imperialism a contemporary cynicism that is destroying the world order…”

Nevertheless Western pressure on Global South countries to ensure they support the West’s policy against Russia has been received coldly by several developing countries. For instance South Africa’s foreign affairs minister Naledi Pandor decried during a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in August 2022 in Pretoria that in their “interaction with some of our partners in Europe and elsewhere there has been a sense of patronizing bullying toward ‘you choose this or else.’” Pandor also criticized the United States’ Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act which passed the U.S. House of Representatives in April 2022 calling it an “offensive legislation” that did not respect Africa’s freedom.

At least 107 developing countries — home to 1.7 billion people — are now being threatened by at least one of three crises: food energy and/or finance.

For South Africa and other Global South neutrals the international community needs to push for a negotiated peace and should be finding off-ramps for conflict including compromises on both sides. Many also see the failure of the UN Security Council to find a solution as partially resulting from a skewed Security Council membership that needs to be overhauled to better reflect the world’s population. The Global South wants to become an equal partner with the West rather than meekly following Western dictates.

Structural Forces Pulling the West and Global South Apart

The developing world has lost many of the benefits of globalization because of the pandemic. A significant portion of the once-rising global middle class slid back into poverty as a result of COVID-19 and its economic ramifications reversing perhaps humanity’s biggest economic achievement in recent decades. The World Bank has projected that emerging markets and developing countries will see their growth cut in half “from 6.6 percent in 2021 to 3.4 percent in 2022 — well below its annual average of 4.8 percent over 2011-19.” The slowdown reflects the spillovers from the Ukraine war particularly increasing energy prices.

In an October 11 2022 report the UN Development Program estimated that 54 countries accounting for more than half of the world’s poorest people needed immediate debt relief to avoid even more extreme poverty and give them a chance to mitigate the effects of climate change. At least 107 developing countries — home to 1.7 billion people — are now being threatened by at least one of three crises: food energy and/or finance according to UN Secretary General António Guterres.

The threat of food crises has increased for nations suffering endemic conflict plus the added strain of slowing growth and rising debt coming out of the pandemic. The latest UN report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition published in mid-2022 states that “the number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021 an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.” The report vividly shows that the “world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030.”

Another hurdle to economic growth is climate change. Africa’s gross domestic product for example could decline by 15% by 2030 as a result of climate-related disasters and spending on efforts to adapt to a warming world according to the Economic Commission for Africa. African leaders aiming to overcome these challenges are seeking trade and economic reform opportunities. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) officially started trading on January 1 2021 and estimates suggest that trade liberalization could increase Africa’s real income by $450 billion by 2035. Such a development could blunt the damage inflicted by COVID-19 diversion of Western funding to Ukraine and other drags on the economic recovery of developing countries.

However thus far Western powers have not deployed an effective strategy to support the implementation of the AfCTFA. The U.S. Congressional Research Service notes that the United States organized several activities in partnership with officials from the AfCFTA and the African Union from 2019 to 2021 but the report also underlines the lack of data on U.S. funding for activities supporting the agreement’s development and implementation. For its part the EU Team Europe Initiative’s proposal is generally vague and London School of Economics and other academic researchers assess that “the European Union’s insistence on Economic Partnership Agreements with individual countries as its principal trade policy instrument for relations with Africa undermines its support for the AfCFTA.”

In parallel as Western states stream exceptionally high levels of funding toward Ukraine actors from the humanitarian and developing sectors have raised alarm about the repercussions of diversion of funds away from other countries across the world such as Ethiopia and Yemen. The COVID-19 pandemic had already taken a toll on the financing targets to achieve sustainable development goals and the gap has continued to widen. According to the New Humanitarian “the UN’s appeal for Ukraine is more than 80 percent funded for this year. In comparison the UN response plan for Afghanistan is around 38 percent funded Yemen’s is around 27 percent funded and Sudan’s is around 20 percent funded.” As the UN 2022 Financing for Sustainable Development Report underlines “additional support for Ukraine and refugees must not come at the expense of cross-border ODA (Official Development Assistance) flows to other countries in need.”

The case of the war in Tigray Ethiopia which started in 2020 is particularly illustrative of the West’s blind eye to the Global South’s catastrophes. The crisis has received very little coverage even though the director general of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus a native of the region called it as “the worst disaster on Earth as we speak.” Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report crimes against humanity such as ethnic cleansing and in March 2022 The Globe and Mail reported that as many as 500000 people have died from war and famine in Tigray. In comparison the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has officially estimated that 6430 have died as a result of the war in Ukraine although the actual death toll may not be known for some time.

Although little attention is being given to some of the worst humanitarian and security crises in the world and to the diversion of funding away from the developing world to Ukraine the repercussions are likely to be felt by the Global South for decades to come.

Climate Change: A Crisis Unlike Others

The current crisis affecting the developing world resembles those that occurred in the 1970s. But there is a key difference. The effects of catastrophic climate change are hitting developing countries particularly hard. A third of Pakistan was submerged under water in August with 1350 dead and some 33-to-50 million people displaced three-to-five times the estimated number in Ukraine. With two million acres of farmland flooded and 90% of crops damaged Pakistan is now facing a severe food crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is releasing $1.17 billion that was allocated for a government bailout in 2019 and has asked for $160 million from member states hardly enough to fund all the needed rescue and reconstruction efforts.

Similarly although Western countries affirmed that they would finance $25 billion by 2025 to help African states facing climate insecurity they committed to only spend $55 million during the September 2022 high-level Africa Adaptation Summit in Rotterdam The Netherlands organized by the Global Center on Adaptation. African climate activists have also been vocal following U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry’s attendance at the September 2022 African Ministerial Conference on Environment in Dakar Senegal calling it a “public relations gimmick” and his comments “semantics” as the United States fails to “honor its historical commitments and pay its climate debt.”

Scientists believe that climate change was a major factor in abnormal monsoon rainfall in South Asia in combination with the glacial melt from a warming planet that produced the massive floods. As a poor developing country the New York Times’ David Wallace-Wells noted Pakistan is “only very fractionally responsible for global warming” even if it is one of its biggest victims so far this year. Western media attention has been relatively sparse with Ukraine’s recent military success raging inflation and the death of Queen Elizabeth II swamping media coverage.

China’s Irreplaceable Help for the Global South

While the West has been inattentive to the Global South China has for better or worse been filling the void. Besides being the world’s top trader China is the world’s largest official creditor surpassing the loan books of the IMF World Bank and all other 22 Paris Club governments combined. In recent years for the 50 most-exposed countries the Germany-based Kiel Institute estimates that debt owed to China has increased from less than 1% of debtor-country gross domestic product in 2005 to more than 15% in 2017.

Many in the West have criticized Chinese lending as an effort to entice developing states to take on more debt than they can handle and thereby become dependent on China. But not all agree. London-based Chatham House for example undertook a comprehensive study of Chinese lending and concluded that “China’s development financing system is too fragmented and poorly coordinated to pursue detailed strategic objectives; and developing-country governments and their associated political and economic interests determine the nature of BRI [Belt-and-Road Initiative] projects on their territory.”

A bipolar world in which all countries line up behind the West or a combination of China and Russia is the opposite of the global order that countries in the Global South want.

There is no doubt that China has a strong economic interest in expanding its influence across the world and uses its development assistance to that end. It should be more transparent about its lending and cooperate more with the Paris Club on solving the emerging debt crisis but at the same time the West should show better appreciation for China’s outsized role in answering cooperation calls from the Global South.

Dependency on Russia’s Arms Grain and Energy

India and African countries rely heavily on arms purchases from Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has effectively courted leaders in Latin America and the Russian vaccine played an important role there too. Even though Ukraine is also a large grain supplier Russia is the world’s biggest exporter of wheat accounting for almost one fifth of global shipments. Russia is also the world’s largest oil exporter; even if developing countries do not buy from Russia they are the biggest victim of higher energy prices which they largely blame on Western sanctions. In addition Western commentators admit that Russia has been more effective than the West in selling its narrative to the developing world casting its actions as defensive against Western efforts to “divide and destroy” Russia. Finally both China and Russia have tried to court the developing world through inclusion in non-Western multilateral institutions such as the BRICS (Brazil Russia India China and South Africa) the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Eurasian Economic Union at a time when enlargement efforts of the UN Security Council have been stymied reducing Africa and Latin America to just nonpermanent representation.

Do not Expect to Recreate the Free World

While the West increasingly embraces the idea of a new Cold War the countries of the Global South are seized with the desire for a multipolar world in which they are not in the pocket of any great power including Russia and China. A bipolar world in which all countries line up behind the West or a combination of China and Russia is the opposite of the global order that countries in the Global South want. Seeing the world from their standpoint is a necessary first step to renewing and strengthening Western ties with them.

The West risks losing the Global South altogether if it does not try to understand these countries’ interests needs and demands and does not stop seeking to impose Western values on them. If the West does not alter its course vis-à-vis the Global South it will most likely be at odds with a multipolar global order which is continuing to evolve and reflects the rise of emerging powers such as Brazil India and South Africa. These countries will strengthen their efforts to reform existing multilateral institutions or create new ones that will better enable them to exert influence on the international scene. More generally they will continue to develop parallel networks of diplomatic economic cultural and security partnerships and alliances in which the West will gradually lose influence and predominance. The West has much to lose by being indifferent to the needs of the Global South. Simply put it cannot afford such a scenario. The United States and other Western nations can no longer rely on an outdated post-Cold War security framework that does not apply to a multipolar world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMucG9zdGFuZGNvdXJpZXIuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvY2hhcmxlc3Rvbi9uYW1lL3JpY2hhcmQtcmVldmVzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4MzE1ODQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richard Reeves Obituary (2022) - Charleston SC - Charleston Post & Courier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.postandcourier.com/us/obituaries/charleston/name/richard-reeves-obituary?id=38315840 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMucG9zdGFuZGNvdXJpZXIuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvY2hhcmxlc3Rvbi9uYW1lL3JpY2hhcmQtcmVldmVzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4MzE1ODQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2RhdmlkLXNjaGFmZm5lci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODM2Njk0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Schaffner Obituary (2022) - Lancaster OH - Johnson-Smith Funeral Home - Baltimore,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/david-schaffner-obituary?id=38366941 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2RhdmlkLXNjaGFmZm5lci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODM2Njk0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

After three decades of success it seems inconceivable that TNT and the NBA could split but a closer look at other high profile sports rights negotiations makes me wonder if it’s more of a possibility than we realize. Let’s talk about it on Twitter: @MMcCarthyREV. Will TNT Walk Away From The NBA? Inside The NBA The setting was an industry conference. On stage the cost-cutting president of a legacy media company warned that he wouldn’t overpay for the NBA in upcoming rights negotiations. If the “numbers are going to choke us we are going to walk away.” Was the speaker David Zaslav president and chief executive officer of Warner Bros. Discovery at RBC’s 2022 Global TIMT Conference last month? Nope. It was actually former NBC president Andy Lack way back in 2001 — right before the network lost the NBA to ESPN. Twenty years later it could be deja vu all over again for the NBA. Ever since Zaslav surprised the sports world by claiming “We don’t have to have the NBA” at an investor conference on Nov. 15 the industry has been buzzing about the implications for upcoming rights talks. The NBA will be seeking a combined $50 billion to $75 billion or more from incumbents Warner Bros. Discovery’s TNT and Disney’s ESPN starting with the 2025-2026 season. With a young tech-savvy fan base and global appeal in markets like China and India don’t be surprised if the NBA gets it.

That would double or triple the payout from its current 9-year deals that pay a combined $24 billion or $2.6 billion a year from the 2016-2017 season through 2024-2025. If the NBA doesn’t get the offers it wants from TNT and ESPN during their exclusive negotiating period the league could open the bidding to tech giants such as Amazon Apple or Google. The Zaslav Doctrine Was Zaslav saying TNT could walk away from the NBA after 33 years? Or was he talking tough to impress a Wall Street crowd that has downgraded legacy media stocks? And how will NBA commissioner Adam Silver react to Zaslav’s vow to stay “disciplined” until he gets an NBA deal that reflects the “future” not the past? Commissioners aren’t sympathetic when their media partners cry poverty. They want to be courted and ultimately overpaid for the valuable live sports rights holding up the TV ecosystem. Now the NBA has to decide if it wants to re-up with cable networks like TNT and ESPN — which are losing subscribers every year to cord-cutting — and embrace the brave new world of streaming. Or even return to broadcast TV. One executive said Zaslav’s comments went over like a lead balloon at the league. “Zaslav was posturing — but very poorly. He doesn’t understand how to balance Wall Street and his sports brand.” But media consultant Patrick Crakes noted it doesn’t matter what network executives say at conferences; it’s what they do in the boardroom that counts. “If the NBA can negotiate in public why can’t [Warner Bros. Discovery]? I would be cautious drawing too much out of these comments” Crakes said. “That said the marketplace is evolving rapidly and there is a great deal of uncertainty around nearly every renewal.” That said an NBA-TNT divorce still seems unlikely considering their successful history: From the top down TNT executives and talent love the NBA and want to renew the relationship said sources.

TNT and Bleacher Report are also deeply embedded with the league’s multimedia properties including NBA TV NBA.com and the NBA app.

Only TNT can offer the long-running “Inside the NBA” the gold standard for studio shows. The network recently gave Charles Barkley a 10-year contract extension and Shaquille O’Neal Kenny “The Jet” Smith and host Ernie Johnson Jr. extensions of their own. Why would TNT extend the “Inside the NBA” cast if it was getting out of the basketball business? As Ben Thompson of Stratechery wrote “I would assume those deals include some sort of out clause in case Warner Bros. Discovery doesn’t retain the NBA but it is a pretty explicit signal of intent as far as the next NBA contract is concerned.” Broken TV Relationships On the other hand nothing lasts forever in sports TV. Just ask ESPN which is losing Big Ten Conference football games after 40 years. Or CBS Sports which will wave bye-bye to the SEC Conference after nearly 20 years. Warning signs have been blinking for the TNT-NBA partnership: Zaslav wants to cut $3 billion in costs after WarnerMedia’s merger with Discovery Inc. Dumping expensive sports rights are a quick way to reduce costs — and Zaslav noted he has other sports besides the NBA including MLB the NHL and the NCAA’s “March Madness” men’s basketball tournament.

after WarnerMedia’s merger with Discovery Inc. Dumping expensive sports rights are a quick way to reduce costs — and Zaslav noted he has other sports besides the NBA including MLB the NHL and the NCAA’s “March Madness” men’s basketball tournament. Sports TV is a relationship business. TNT has lost several long-term top executives instrumental to the NBA relationship including Lenny Daniels (27 years) and respected Turner Sports president David Levy (33 years).

With the ad market hitting a wall Warner Bros Discovery is not the only media company cutting back. Disney CNN Gannett Vice and BuzzFeed have all announced layoffs or hiring freezes.

Previously bulletproof tech giants are downsizing too. Amazon is launching what could be the largest layoffs in its 28-year history — as many as 10000 employees could lose their jobs. The NBA and TNT declined to comment on this story — but sources still say the deep-pocketed tech behemoths like Amazon could be the solution not the problem. Like the NFL the NBA could create a balanced roster of media partners that includes both linear television networks like TNT and ESPN as well as all-digital partners such as Amazon. Under this scenario the NBA would not have to squeeze TNT and ESPN for every last nickel. Instead it could make its desired number by splitting off a separate streaming-only package to a tech company that can afford it. Think Amazon’s deal for the NFL’s “Thursday Night Football” which pays $1 billion a year through 2033. With “TNF” on Prime Video for the next decade Amazon has signaled its strong interest in the NBA said sources. A partnership with a technology company such as Amazon or Apple could also give the NBA the freedom to possibly unwind some of the digital duties handled by TNT in the next contract. A Dynasty in Danger? Driven by Michael Jordan’s dynastic Chicago Bulls Bob Costas and John Tesh’s driving “Roundball Rock” score the 12-year run of the “NBA on NBC” that ended in 2002 is still remembered fondly by many hoops fans. Could history repeat itself 20 years later with TNT and the NBA? The iconic Turner Sports name has already been rebranded “Warner Bros. Discovery Sports.” The nightmare scenario for sports TV executives is for penny-pinching corporate higher-ups to overrule them come deal time. Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson knows the feeling all too well. Back in 1993 CBS had controlled the NFL’s marquee NFC package for nearly 40 years. But CBS’ bottom-line-focused chief executive officer Larry Tisch wasn’t satisfied with the deal that paid the NFL $265 million annually. Tisch told a reluctant Pilson to offer the NFL $250 million a year — or a $15 million pay cut. Bad decision.

Rupert Murdoch’s upstart Fox Sports swooped in with a four-year $1.6 billion bid that offered to pay the NFL $400 million a year. The late Tisch declined to match. The rest is history.

Fox has controlled the NFC package for the past 30 years. Murdoch’s network will broadcast Super Bowl LIVII — its 10th Big Game — on Feb. 12 2023. Five years after losing the NFC package and under new boss Sean McManus CBS Sports agreed to pay $500 million a year for the weaker AFC package — $100 million more than Tisch was willing to pay to keep the NFC. But that too proved a bargain with quarterbacks John Elway Peyton Manning and Tom Brady driving AFC TV ratings to new heights. Sometimes negotiating in public can help. Other times it can lead to disaster. Pilson interpreted Zaslav’s comments as part “invitation” to start negotiations; part “warning” there’ll be limits on how much he’s willing to bid. “I wouldn’t even define what was said as hardball. To throw out something like that in a public forum isn’t the [equivalent] of telling a league to get lost in a private meeting behind closed doors. That’s hardball” said Pilson who’s now a media consultant. “This is still way in the definition of a softball statement that I doubt will make its way into the negotiating room.” Step Up or Step Away Ultimately the marketplace will set the price for NBA rights. Like CBS and the NFL in 1993 and NBC and the NBA in 2001 it will be up to the incumbents to “either step up or step away” according to Pilson. But if they walk they better be prepared for the fallout from viewers affiliates and advertisers. “The marquee value sports are unique. They’re not creating any new ones. I always refer to them as beachfront property” said Pilson. “What’s happening is there are now more competitors for these rights than 10-15 years ago with Apple Google and Amazon stepping into the arena.” The NBA appears to be holding the cards as it heads into its next cycle of media rights talks in 2023. As Silver said at an industry conference last month: “We’re in the enviable position right now of letting the marketplace work its magic a little bit you know to see where the best ideas are going to come from what’s going to drive the best value.” More From FOS Renowned American soccer journalist Grant Wahl has died while covering the World Cup in Qatar.

Atmadaya the British representative for the controversial guru known as Nithyananda was invited to the function by the MP Bob Blackman and the peer Rami Ranger. Nithyananda’s organisation also took out a full-page advertisement in an accompanying brochure which was handed out to attendees.

Some attendees were upset at the profile given to the organisation given that Nithyananda fled India in 2019 while facing multiple charges of abducting children and one of raping a follower. He has since claimed to have set up his own sovereign island state known as the “Republic of Kailaasa”.

Poonam Joshi a freelance journalist who has investigated the organisation and also attended the event told the Observer: “It is shocking to see the Hindu Forum of Britain [which helped organise the event] found it appropriate to invite representatives of a man accused of such heinous crimes to parliament.

“It lends legitimacy to an organisation that craves it because of the actions of the fake ‘godman’ at its helm who remains a fugitive from Indian justice.”

Nithyananda has built up a huge following in India where he ran more than a dozen temples and ashrams. He made extravagant claims about his supernatural abilities including being able to delay the sunrise see through walls cure children of blindness and make cows talk.

But former followers have also made serious allegations about sexual exploitation and coercive behaviour.

One of his former disciples told the Observer she had been pressurised into having a sexual relationship with Nithyananda and that followers were threatened with forced labour if they did not comply with his wishes.

She said: “We knew that we would be shunned by the whole community if we didn’t do what he wanted or that worse we would be made to do hard labour in the hot desert outside Bangalore.”

Nithyananda was charged in 2010 with raping a devotee. But when his case finally came to trial eight years later he failed to attend. A year later police in the Indian state of Gujarat raided one of his ashrams and arrested two people having alleged that children were being kidnapped and locked up there.

The former disciple said she had also been told by children that they were being beaten in the organisation’s homes.

Nithyananda has denied the accusations against him. Richard Rogers Nithyananda’s UK-based lawyer told the Observer: “The available evidence suggests that the (known) pending criminal allegations against the applicant in India are part of a broader campaign of religious persecution targeting the applicant which is rooted in religious intolerance and based (in whole or large part) on falsified evidence.”

Rogers would not comment on the specific allegations made by Landry. But he added: “The allegations of alleged misconduct that I have looked into (in any depth) turned out to be based on evidence that is unreliable at best and in some cases clearly manipulated or falsified.”

This is not the first time Blackman whose constituency includes a large Hindu community has come under fire for the people he has invited into parliament. In 2017 he was criticised for inviting Tapan Ghosh a Hindu nationalist who defended the genocide of Muslims in Burma to a parliamentary event called “Tolerating the Intolerant”.

Blackman did not respond to requests for comment.

Asked about Atmadaya’s attendance at the Diwali event Lord Ranger said he had no knowledge of Nithyananda or his organisation. “I do not know Kailaasa or this person” he said. “If I had known I would never have attended an event where such unsavoury characters were being promoted.”

The Hindu Forum of Britain however stood by the invitation. Trupti Patel the group’s president said: “We do not discriminate; each entity has their own following. Social media/internet hype and unsubstantiated allegations against UK-registered charities cannot stop any two organisations working together.”

Atmadaya issued a statement in which she said the allegations against Nithyananda “are false and part of a campaign of religious persecution by anti-Hindu extremist elements of the government in India”.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He had driven down there that day to hand out free bicycles to kids displaced by Hurricane Ian in September. And so his last gesture encapsulated his life’s purpose.

The story in the Free Press which was published Nov. 6 followed him on a two-day spree of impulses and random generosity that ended with the police being called on him for riding a horse through downtown Iron Mountain.

He was born and raised in Marquette enlisted in the Army served in Lebanon in the ‘80s came home to Michigan became a car salesman and eventually had his own auto dealership.

But he fell on hard times and lost everything. A few years ago while down on his luck and living in an old camper he had an epiphany one night that led him to start a bike repair business with the sole purpose of giving troubled veterans something to take their minds off their problems for a while. “Bicycle therapy” he called it. Somehow it evolved into a real bike shop. And even though he kept giving away bikes for free despite everyone’s advice to quit doing so the shop inexplicably kept growing more successful.

“He went through a lot of things in his life and he had seen a lot of things and I think at some point he really found God and really felt like God was with him in everything he did and he really wanted to do as much good as he could” his 39-year-old daughter Torri Pringle of Peoria Illinois said. “I think it really just made him happy.”

According to his family Steven Pringle was driving a truck with a trailer full of new bicycles behind it when he passed through an intersection where the stop sign had been blown down by the hurricane. He was struck by a driver with such force that his truck reportedly hit a pole and rolled over killing him instantly.

He leaves behind six children five grandchildren his girlfriend Lindsey his horse Andy his dog Lacey and countless customers friends and people who knew him only as the friendly stranger who gave them a bike for free.

“I’ve got people reaching out to me saying ‘Your father changed my son’s life for the better' ” said his son 38-year-old Jason Pringle who traveled to Florida to deal with the aftermath of his father’s death. “One lady said ‘We couldn’t afford a bicycle and your father gave my son a bicycle.’ I was really blown away at the impact that he had.”

The family has set up a GoFundMe account to pay for the funeral and to carry on his charity work with bikes possibly with annual giveaways to kids in need. “It was something that meant so much to him that it’s a way to let his name live on” Torri Pringle said.

Someone erected a memorial at the intersection where he died: It’s an old bike painted white with debris from the accident fashioned as a cross and the phrase ""May the legend live on"" written in marker on the frame. The family has no idea who put it there but they say it demonstrates the reach of Steven Pringle's work.

“It’s a beautiful thing that these guys are still recognizing my father for the work that he did” Jason Pringle said. “He was working with children going down the bad paths in life and showing them there’s a better way to life; that there’s ways to find adventures with bikes rather than taking these dark roads. So to see that he impacted the community in these good ways and these people are recognizing that with this small monument is really great.”

BNSF Railway is making a $1.5 billion bet that the answer is yes.

The railroad announced on Oct. 1 that it will build a massive new intermodal facility in Barstow Calif. to expedite the handling of freight imported and exported through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

The stakes are high for the San Pedro Bay ports which have seen their share of imported cargo fall over the past decade a trend that was accelerated by pandemic-related congestion that made national headlines. The stakes are high for BNSF too because its intermodal fortunes are intertwined with how competitive the ports are.

Here’s why.

Many of the containers that land at the ports are bound for destinations outside of the L.A. Basin mostly in the Midwest and Texas. The lion’s share of that freight rides BNSF stack trains to inland points.

These containers don’t have to enter the U.S. through L.A. and Long Beach. They could just as easily be routed to ports on the East Coast Gulf Coast or British Columbia. And that’s exactly what’s been happening.

The San Pedro Bay port complex has been losing market share to up-and-coming ports that have proven to be more fluid and less costly. BNSF’s new sorting hub — the Barstow International Gateway or BIG for short — is designed to halt this trend and protect the railroad’s intermodal business.

BNSF has a knack for understatement. BIG is too small a word for a one-of-a-kind 4500-acre facility that will be built on land BNSF owns on the dusty outskirts of Barstow an important junction town with a long railroad history.

BIG will include an intermodal terminal support yard and warehouses where freight will be transloaded from international containers into domestic boxes before being put back on trains. At full buildout BIG will be more than twice the size of BNSF’s sprawling logistics parks in Chicago and at Alliance Texas. The facility will handle two million containers annually a figure equal to 36% of BNSF’s 2021 intermodal volume.

The idea behind BIG is that it will reduce the amount of time containers spend waiting on the docks and eliminate the 80-mile dray moves for freight that’s currently trucked from the ports to the Inland Empire for transloading before being trucked to one of BNSF’s intermodal terminals for the trip east.

Currently containers are taken off ships stacked on the docks and eventually loaded on well cars. Intermodal veteran Ted Prince notes that the largest ships can carry enough containers to fill seven trains. So some boxes have to wait for six trains to get loaded and depart before they get their chance to move inland. The process is so slow he says that freight transloaded into domestic container can arrive in Memphis before those long-lingering international boxes even leave the dock.

BIG promises to change this. Containers will be loaded directly from ship to rail. Existing BNSF trains will haul them through the Alameda Corridor and up the BNSF main to Barstow. Once there the containers will take one of two paths. They’ll either be sorted by destination and loaded on eastbound trains or their cargo will be transloaded into domestic containers at on-site warehouses then catch eastbound trains.

This will reduce congestion at the San Pedro Bay ports effectively increasing their capacity and efficiency while nearly eliminating drayage costs for transload cargo. The ports say all this will make them more competitive with East Coast and Gulf Coast ports. And what’s good for the ports is good for BNSF.

Also in the railroad’s favor: BIG’s advantages may attract even more international container lines to BNSF’s rails. BIG will be a magnet for transload centers for big retailers like Walmart. And that in turn will feed the transload pipeline of BNSF intermodal partner J.B. Hunt.

BNSF will get an operational boost from BIG too. BIG will assemble westbounds to match track lengths of BNSF’s terminals at Hobart and San Bernardino which will reduce switching moves on the main.

There’s no timeline yet for construction and BNSF says permitting may take a few years. But it’s clear that once BIG is up and running it could be a game-changer for BNSF the only railroad you can imagine investing $1.5 billion in a single project.

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L3RoZS1pbmZlcm5hbC1tYWNoaW5lLXN0ZXBoZW4tam9obnNvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Book Review: ‘The Infernal Machine’ by Steven Johnson,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L3RoZS1pbmZlcm5hbC1tYWNoaW5lLXN0ZXBoZW4tam9obnNvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00EC49F30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement. ""The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look in his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.""

The 49ers organization also expressed its condolences in a social media post.

And the team released a statement marking his passing.

""The 49ers family is deeply saddened by the passing of one of the NFL's all-time greats Jimmy Johnson. Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team statement said. ""He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor. We send our condolences to his wife Gisela and his entire family at this difficult time.""

While Johnson displayed prowess on both sides of the ball boasting - 47 career interceptions in 213 games with 615 return yards he also hauled in 40 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns in two seasons as a wide receiver.

One of the greatest players in 49ers' history especially on the defensive side of the ball Johnson was among the original ""shutdown"" cornerbacks in football. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie once said that veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.

""Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible"" Brodie said back when they were teammates via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. ""Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call a few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.

""The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.""

When Johnson retired following his 1976 campaign no NFL player had turned in more seasons at defensive back than he had. At that time Johnson's 201 games and 198 starts were each the most for a DB in league history.

His interceptions and INT return yards remain second in 49ers history behind only fellow Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott (51 interceptions 643 yards) the Hall of Fame said.

Jimmy Johnson born James Earl played his college football at UCLA but was also a great track athlete away from the football field but his brother was even better. Radar won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

""Jimmy"" Johnson played college ball at UCLA. But Johnson wasn't just a football standout for the Bruins -- he was also exceptional on the track though not quite as good as his brother. Jimmy Johnson won All-American honors and an NCAA 100-meter championship while his brother Rafer garnered a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Jimmy Johnson was the 6th overall pick in the 1961 NFL Draft and made his presence felt right away in his rookie year with 5 catches in his first dozen games. He achieved Pro Bowl status from 1969 to 1972.

Johnson died Wednesday evening the Hall of Fame and 49ers announced.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement. ""The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished.

""The 49ers family is deeply saddened by the passing of one of the NFL's all-time greats Jimmy Johnson. Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team statement said. ""He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor. We send our condolences to his wife Gisela and his entire family at this difficult time.""

While Johnson displayed prowess on both sides of the ball boasting - 47 career interceptions in 213 games with 615 return yards he also hauled in 40 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns in two seasons as a wide receiver.

One of the greatest players in 49ers' history especially on the defensive side of the ball Johnson was among the original ""shutdown"" cornerbacks in football. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie once said that veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.

""Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible"" Brodie said back when they were teammates via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. ""Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call a few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.

""The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.""

When Johnson retired following his 1976 campaign no NFL player had turned in more seasons at defensive back than he had. At that time Johnson's 201 games and 198 starts were each the most for a DB in league history.

His interceptions and INT return yards remain second in 49ers history behind only fellow Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott (51 interceptions 643 yards) the Hall of Fame said.

Jimmy Johnson born James Earl played his college football at UCLA but was also a great track athlete away from the football field but his brother was even better. Radar won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

""Jimmy"" Johnson played college ball at UCLA. But Johnson wasn't just a football standout for the Bruins -- he was also exceptional on the track though not quite as good as his brother. Jimmy Johnson won All-American honors and an NCAA 100-meter championship while his brother Rafer garnered a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics."

Given the boldness of our aspiration it is only obvious that our plan of action to ensure that all the benefits of this growth trickle down to all segments of society must also be bold. Keeping this vision in mind the government has consistently championed and proposed schemes that focus on taking advantage of our indigenous abilities and strengths. India remains a critical market for a wide range of goods and services given the diversity of purchasing power and the needs of customers. However not having been able to sync it with indigenous production abilities meant that the benefit of our depth and breadth as a market was being enjoyed by other players. A focused approach through interconnected campaigns like ‘Make in India’ and ‘Skill India’ as well as plans such as the PLI scheme are making a push to boost homegrown brands.

The disruption in global supply chains caused by the pandemic was a stark reminder of our over-dependence on external inputs and imports. The moment cross-border movement was restricted and travel was limited several industries were unable to deliver on their deadlines and promises. Thus despite the huge market potential not enough companies could reap the same benefits until the impetus for manufacturing in India came through various government schemes.

According to several estimates the renewed push towards the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan mission helped reduce dependence on imports of air conditioners. Between October and November 2020 the country is said to have reported a 65% reduction in imports of split ACs or air conditioners. With policies that support the localization of component manufacturing which incentivize using locally produced materials can create wonders for all stakeholders. When indigenous parts are used the costs to customers will come down eventually. In the beginning years the costs might go up to a certain extent but as I said eventually they will come down. This should lead to an increase in their spending and consumption thereby boosting industrial production which would ensure that some of the financial benefits trickle down to the workers too. Relying on materials produced in the homeland not only has strong economic benefits for all the stakeholders but also helps ensure that supply chain issues are strengthened and not left to stop-gap arrangements.

If one were to look at India as an air-conditioning market we see that while there is huge potential for the market to grow it remains under-penetrated for a range of reasons. The most significant factors are the cost of products as well as the time taken for the product to reach the markets. Both have a common connection – the reliance on external products. Others have been the Cost of Power along with the availability of steady power in many parts of the country. Now with electricity availability easing up even in small towns AC buying and usage will also go up. On the other hand with the Energy Efficiency of ACs going up the cost of using the same will come down.

As for localization having a strong system in place for procuring and producing materials locally will bring down both the element of cost and time. Further it also insulates the industry and the economy from any shocks that may occur externally. For instance it remains difficult to be unscathed in the face of any global recession or pandemic if all our processes are dependent on external elements. Bringing in place a robust locally sound system will ensure that the damage of any global crisis is minimized or arrested immediately.

India has a huge potential to export Air Conditioners. Many countries are seeking to import from a source in addition to China. Thailand has stepped up and become a major supplier. However India has an opportunity. Government policy coupled with the manufacturer’s ambition can make India a major export hub. Major multinationals that are manufacturing in India can make it an alternate sourcing hub. Indian brands need to take the brand and make it popular worldwide. For this the cost needs to be aligned with the best cost available across the world. The ‘Make in India’ for components and hence the final product will ensure that India is competitive in pricing when it goes out to sell.

While the policies have a production-oriented focus the indigenous push is also necessary to empower human resources. Historically brain drain has been a challenge on the one hand while employers complain about not having an adequate skilled workforce on the other hand. A strong production chain creates avenues for employment as well as opportunities for upskilling and reselling. Not only problems related to human resource development can be solved by government schemes alone. Creating building and sustaining the demographic dividend is a project that must be led by the industry and government collaboratively. An increase in opportunities to employ a greater number of people is also the means through which industry contributes to nation-building and strengthening society. Given the popularity of Indians across the globe in various job roles it is clear that they do not lack the acumen but may need some on-the-job training which need not be difficult for employers if they have solid skilling initiatives in place.

A strong and locally bound supply chain has many advantages ranging from cost-effectiveness for producers to value for money and a more diverse inventory for customers. Most importantly it sets the stage for an easy and wide expansion of the industry players as well as an improvement in the quality of life and purchasing parity of the citizens. Import substitution is the biggest obstacle in this process and the government’s stringent push for indigenous resources is a necessary and laudatory step in this direction. Given how the electronics industry bounced back in the face of the pandemic-induced disruption it is clear that it is time to write a new history that is led by home-grown leaders. Our ambitions are bold but so are our actions.

The case in question is Kirschner v. JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. which is before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In this case the Court will consider an appeal of a 2020 decision by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which held that the syndicated term loan in question was not a security. Significantly this ruling indicated that because syndicated term loans are not securities they are therefore not subject to securities laws and regulations.

The consequence of a determination that syndicated loans are securities would be significant. It would mean among other things that the syndicated loan market would have to comply with various state and federal securities laws. This would significantly change the cost of these transactions as well as the means by which syndication and loan trading take place. The Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) filed an amicus brief in this case in May of this year which we covered here. The LSTA argued in its brief among other things that beyond the increased cost regulating syndicated loans as securities would fundamentally change other aspects of the syndicated loan market. Specifically the LSTA pointed to the importance of a borrower’s ability to have veto rights and other control in determining which entities will hold its debt. The LSTA also noted the importance of quick access to funding on flexible terms specific to the borrower in question – something we know is at the heart of so many fund finance transactions – which would be greatly compromised within a securities regulatory regime. The LSTA brief also discusses potential negative impacts on the CLO market.

Those in favor of a change in regulation point to features such as nonbank lender participation in the market the fact that the test to determine whether a loan is a security may be outdated and the overall size of the syndicated loan market – at $1.4 trillion – which could be a risk to the larger global financial system potentially warranting more stringent regulation.

Most experts believe that the Second Circuit will not overturn the decision issued in the lower court but the issue in question is significant enough that market players should keep an eye on this one. Oral arguments will take place early next year. We will continue to watch as this case develops and update you here.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JPMorgan Chase supports local groups to create jobs and small business opportunities,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Dimon made the comments during an interview on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" while saying he was hopeful that a split Congress could still be productive.

""There are a lot of examples in history under George W. Bush Obama Clinton where when he had divided Congress actually got a lot of good things done"" Dimon said.

But when it comes to government funding the veteran CEO said ""it’s not the way to run a railroad.""

""I mean basically you end up spending much more money too because the American public may not know you pay people and you pay them more to come back to work"" Dimon said. ""It costs us much more money. So even if you want to be fiscally responsible it's not a good idea.""

Dimon was also asked about Democrats’ hopes to address the debt ceiling before Republicans take over the House of Representatives in January as the federal government nears the congressionally mandated limit on how much money it can borrow.

The CEO said it would be better for the parties to address the debt ceiling and ""get it done now"" rather risking a showdown later.

DEMOCRATS COULD ADD $500B IN NEW DEBT DURING FINAL WEEKS OF CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL

""They should because the catastrophic effects of an actual default not the debates I understand both sides why we want it how they want to use it that's catastrophic or potentially catastrophic. I would never take that risk. So for me yes I'd get it done now"" Dimon said of addressing the debt ceiling. ""Take it off the table.""

Under federal law passed in late 2021 the most the federal government can borrow is $31.381 trillion. Total national debt has already ventured slightly above that level but a small portion of the debt is exempt from the debt ceiling – technically the unamortized discount on Treasury bills. As of last week total debt subject to the debt limit got as close as $31.345 trillion.

Batey

Special to the AFRO

JPMorgan Chase has launched a new community branch experience in Baltimore the Mondawmin Community Center Branch with a $600000 commitment to empower local small businesses.

This commitment by JPMorgan Chase is crucial to an area that experienced major setbacks with the sudden closing of the Target store at Mondawmin Mall in 2018 and a slow recovery from the 2015 Freddie Gray uprising.

The branch utilizes an innovative community-inspired model to help local consumers and businesses realize a better financial future through cutting-edge tools resources and programming. Everything about what is being called the Community Center is designed to create a positive financial footprint in West Baltimore bringing with it the hope of long term gains for area residents small businesses and community partners.

The location is the first of its kind in the area and looks and feels different from a typical bank combining modern design spacious layout and state-of-the art banking technology to reflect how customers will newly engage with JPMorgan Chase.

At the grand opening held Dec. 7 JPMorgan Chase’s Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon pointed out that the branch was impressively built in six months by a woman-led construction company and the art was done by local artists.

“Baltimore is a vibrant community with enormous opportunity” said Dimon. “As JPMorgan Chase grows in Baltimore our firm will do its part to provide greater opportunity—especially for underrepresented and underserved populations. It’s important for our customers employees communities and our company to drive inclusive economic growth.”

Others in attendance at the branch’s grand opening were: Maryland Gov.-elect Wes Moore Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott Maryland State Sen. Antonio Hayes; City Councilman James Torrence and President and CEO of the Parks and People Foundation Dr. Franklin Lance.

“What we have seen in so many of our communities is a fundamental breakdown and the only way you are going to address a fundamental breakdown is with a fundamental build up. That means knowing that everybody—philanthropy the private sector the public sector government organizations the people—needs to have a role in terms of what that build up looks like” Moore said. “Every single place in our state needs to have pathways to work wages and wealth. The beauty of what we’re seeing right now and right here is this place symbolizes all of that.”

In addition to offering traditional banking services the Community Center will offer free services for customers and non-customers that include:

Specialty financial health workshops on topics such as budgeting credit and homeownership hosted by experts for both individuals and groups

One-on-one mentorship support to help local entrepreneurs grow start or expand their small business

A community “living room” area to serve as event space for partnering non-profits

Free Wi-Fi for community groups and residents to utilize for remote learning and work.

In their ongoing commitment to West Baltimore the Community Center also features a strong team of native Baltimoreans that includes Community Manager Joel Gamble who was raised in West Baltimore—who will provide ongoing support to residents with financial literacy and economic wellness.

JPMorgan Chase is also giving $600000 to the Harbor Bank of Maryland Community Development Corporation as part of its $20 million five-year philanthropic commitment to expand the bank’s Entrepreneurs of Color initiative. The funding will allow Harbor Bank to provide strategic technical assistance access to capital and financial services to small and diverse-owned businesses.

“JPMorgan Chase has been an incredible partner in our collective mission to promote equitable growth close the wealth gap and promote access to financial services across our city” Mayor Scott said. “I want to thank them for their belief in Baltimore and their continued commitment to economic mobility in historically redlined and underserved communities. This is a great example of the role private institutions play in Baltimore’s renaissance.”

JPMorgan Chase has been doing business in Greater Baltimore since 2012 and currently has 16 branches in the region with 36 expected by 2025. The firm employs more than 1300 people in Maryland D.C. and Virginia.

Emergency crews responded to the fire in the Hillcrest Mobile Home Park on Mercer Road located in North Sewickley in Beaver County just before noon.

Robert Baker who lives in the mobile home said his 10-year-old son woke him up and told him about the fire.

“My son came in and said ‘Daddy I see smoke.’ I got up right away seen smoke in the hallway opened up the side door and flames shot out of the ground” said Baker.

Baker said he tried to put the fire out but it began to grow quickly.

“I tried to go to the sink to get some water to put the fire out but by the time I turned around it was pitch-black” said Baker.

Baker and his son were with a third resident when the fire began. All of them were able to escape safely. A fourth person who lived in the mobile home was not there at the time of the fire.

Two birds died during the fire.

The North Sewickley Fire Department was located near Hillcrest Mobile Home Park and was able to respond quickly. They were able to contain the fire in the rear of the trailer but the rest of the home suffered water damage.

The fire chief of the North Sewickley Volunteer Fire Department said the fire began in the laundry room where most of the damage occurred. He said the cause of the fire was a power connection.

The Red Cross and some friendly neighbors are helping Baker and his family.

That discussion led to Camacho’s participation in the program where after graduation she had a one-year internship with Keysight Technologies and continued her studies at Santa Rosa Junior College focusing on computer science.

Her interest has continued to grow and she wants to attend Sacramento State University next year and major in engineering. Camacho credits the program for putting her on the current path.

“In high school you're living in a bubble. When you're out of high school you're not in that bubble anymore. So you want to know what else is out there?” said Camacho. She is now interning at the Career Technical Educational (CTE) Foundation which spearheaded creation of Sonoma Corps with local educators and business leaders.

Camacho’s heartwarming story is being repeated by others in the program. Sonoma Corps also is providing a lifeline to local manufacturers in Sonoma County as the effort is tailored specifically for them. Ten students went through the pilot program as of the summer 2021 and the initiative has ramped up to handle more applicants.

The manufacturing industry was chosen because it crosses many key categories such as agriculture food and beverage production health care and tech. It is also one of the most difficult segments to recruit and retain employees in Sonoma County said Amber Figueroa a senior fellow for the CTE Foundation.

“This is definitely a pipeline opportunity for employers. This is an opportunity for them to promote the careers that they have at their organization and encourage the interns to consider them for long term careers” Figueroa said.

The initiative follows an earlier one that was focused on construction jobs.

The manufacturing industry plays a key role in diversifying the Sonoma County economy beyond such stalwarts as hospitality retail agriculture and food production. Manufacturing companies employed 23608 workers in 2021 with a gross regional product of $5.8 billion according to the Sonoma County Economic Development Board.

A key benefit is that the jobs typically pay higher than those in other fields as the median advertised salary in Sonoma County was almost $47000 according to the development board. Many jobs do not require the applicant to have a college degree reducing the barrier to entry.

“From the perspective of being able to live and thrive here in Sonoma County manufacturers are an excellent entry into that” said Ethan Brown interim executive director of the development board.

The list of employer participants in the program is extensive. They include such companies as Amy's Kitchen E. & J. Gallo Winery Traditional Medicinals PCD Audio & Video System Alluxa Hog Island Oyster Co. and Hansel Auto Group.

The group also includes smaller employers such as Max Machinery Inc. in Healdsburg which makes meters that track the amount of liquid gas or vapor moving through a pipe for automobiles airplanes and hydraulic testing.

The company which employs slightly more than 20 people has had two interns in the program. The most recent one has been able to learn within its engineering department and is now working with its quality control team that conducts inspection of products said Mara Palmer human resources manager for Max Machinery.

“The idea is to allow all areas of interest to be explored within a manufacturing environment. It’s also just darn rewarding to be the first employer for this eager young adult teaching him not just the needed technical skills but nurturing his confidence enabling him to trust his findings properly voice his opinions” Palmer wrote in an email.

For over a year Max Machinery has been trying to hire a senior design engineer at the family-owned company where turnover is rare. The program helps the company get noticed by the next generation of workers.

“As far as getting the word out and getting the company known among young people who are just starting their careers it's been amazing” Palmer said.

Will Seppi president and CEO of Costeaux French Bakery in Healdsburg agreed with the success of the program which is on track to have 50 high school graduates in full-time paid internships with local companies next summer. One student has been with Costeaux for three years he said.

“She has been a rock star in our organization learning not only about certain areas of our manufacturing processes but food safety and compliance as well” Seppi said.

He also noted the demand for workers beyond production. “We need people technically competent to operate the equipment and machinery do procurement marketing. It’s the whole gamut of business skills necessary to operate a business” Seppi said.

Camacho said she appreciated the program was a low-stakes opportunity to discover if manufacturing suited her passion and personality before committing to major in engineering in college.

“I wanted to get my hands dirty and see what could actually come about this” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Chips are imperative to the defence industry and technologies of the future. By targeting this critical input the Biden administration aims to freeze China’s semiconductor suite at 2022 levels and impede its military development.

China will probably struggle to maintain its rapid advances in artificial intelligence quantum and cloud computing without access to US technology and expertise. Chipmakers like the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — China’s largest logic chip producer — will lose access to machine maintenance and equipment replacement under the new controls.

US chip equipment suppliers like Lam Research Applied Materials and KLA Corporation have suspended sales and services to Chinese chipmakers while ASML Holding a Netherlands-based supplier told its US staff to stop servicing Chinese customers until further notice.

The new controls exploit China’s weaknesses in developing talent and research. They require all US citizens residents and green card holders — including hundreds of ethnic Chinese educated and trained in the United States — to seek permission from the US Department of Commerce to work in Chinese fabrication plants. Since such permission is unlikely US citizens working at Chinese semiconductor companies will be forced to sacrifice their citizenship or their job. Most will have to give up their current jobs. Indeed Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp has already asked core US staff to leave the company.

Despite the bleak short-term outlook it is wrong to assume that US controls will hobble China for years. In the case of nuclear weapons significant resources were poured into acquiring bomb technology once political leaders decided that they were essential for national defence. That effort inevitably starved other sectors but more often than not successfully delivered nuclear weapons programs.

Now that advanced semiconductors are seen as essential to national defence Beijing is adopting the ‘whole of the nation’ approach and investing national resources into the industry. Many engineers and computer scientists are likely to be assigned to semiconductor design and manufacture assisted by espionage against US South Korean Taiwanese Japanese and European chip firms.

The export controls won’t cripple the Chinese military. According to a 2022 RAND Corporation report China’s military systems rely on older less sophisticated chips made in China on which US export controls will have no affect. If China needs more advanced chips for AI-driven weapons systems it can likely produce them albeit at a very high cost. Many semiconductor industry experts agree that China has the technical capability to produce cutting-edge chips yet lacks the commercial capability to scale up production. This means that the US ban will have less effect on weapons systems instead delaying the rollout of civilian applications such as autonomous vehicles.

Nor will US semiconductor firms emerge from the sanctions unscathed given many have China as their largest market. China comprises 27 per cent of sales at Intel 31 per cent at Lam Research and 33 per cent at Applied Materials. Both Applied Materials and Nvidia expect the new export controls to cut US$400 million (6 per cent and 7 per cent respectively) from next quarter’s sales. Lam Research — one of Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp’s largest suppliers — expects the controls to cut a whopping US$2.5 billion (15 per cent) from 2023 sales.

These dramatic cuts come at a particularly difficult time for the US semiconductor industry which is experiencing falling revenue and increased input costs. By one estimate the damage US sanctions inflict on research and development and capital investment in the Western semiconductor industry ‘will exceed Washington’s modest subsidies for the chip industry by a factor of five or more’.

Tit-for-tat retaliation against Washington is not an option for China given its heavy reliance on foreign technology. Any reciprocal measure would inflict more damage on China itself. Punishing US companies with big exposure in China — like Nike or Apple — would harm the Chinese labour market since those firms employ many Chinese citizens. Other foreign supply chains and Chinese businesses supplying Nike and Apple would also suffer.

Imposing export controls on products China dominates like rare earths or pharmaceutical ingredients would accelerate the US movement to ‘reshore’ onshore and ‘friend-shore’ manufacturing those products as was the case with Japan in 2012.

Instead of overt retaliation China will probably seek alternatives to US chip technology. But since alternatives are decades away intellectual property theft and the nationalisation of foreign semiconductor firms could spike.

Whether US chip controls represent a stand-alone policy or foreshadow sanctions across a wider range of high technology sectors is unclear. In the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election many Republicans will call for harsher controls. At his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit Biden sought to tamp down US–China hostilities. But unless he resists calls from the US ‘China hawks’ Biden could find himself dragged into a Second Cold War.

These measures significantly expand the ability of BIS to curtail technology transfer by end-use to China.

Markets responded in kind with billions of dollars wiped from equities in integrated circuits (IC) and wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) — a segment dominated by US companies like Applied Materials KLA and Lam Research. BIS scrambled to clarify various legal ambiguities and it is increasingly clear that the fabs manufacturing less sophisticated ‘legacy nodes’ are relatively unaffected. US Korean and Taiwanese firms with chip manufacturing facilities in China have also secured temporary one-year licenses to use US technologies at these sites.

But the respite may be temporary. In mid-November US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dispatched her undersecretary to the Netherlands and Japan to urge them to take further action. It is unknown whether these countries — specialists in the lithography process a crucial step in IC production — will agree to US requests.

It is difficult to ascertain what more the Biden administration can demand from its allies. Their dual-use lists already include relevant lithography equipment. Export controls are already subject to treaty commitments and close coordination between the United States Japan and European Union (EU) member states. The Netherlands also denies export licences on any Extreme UV (EUV) that is used for scale production of very miniaturised chipsets.

While market valuations have stabilised October’s developments should not be underestimated. These measures are a departure from the ‘sliding scale’ approach that had kept the United States and its allies one or two generations ahead in key technologies. As US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan declared – the latest export controls are designed to foster ’as large of a lead as possible’.

It is striking how the US government has mirrored China’s state-run regime by wrestling control of the free market. Under the foreign direct product rule BIS’s controls apply extraterritorially due to a global reliance on US patents and talent. The US Department of Commerce can issue export licenses to whichever entities it wants and block sales deemed contrary to US commercial or strategic interests.

Such power naturally causes unease among US allies. Even Japanese trade officials — known for their measured demeanour — were ’bemused by how Japan’s sovereignty could be so disregarded’. However US diplomats and lobbyists are keen to ensure that Dutch and Japanese firms are equally unable to serve the world’s largest chip market.

This focus on ‘Burden Sharing’ is conveniently timed. Prior to October US export controls targeted lithography equipment but remained laissez-faire on half a dozen critical production steps where US companies happened to dominate. China broke the 7 nanometre-chip barrier not by using Dutch EUV equipment but ‘deposition and etching’ — an alternative process that relied on US tools. Some analysts suggest that the world’s three largest WFEs — which are all American — have increased their Chinese sales by US$5.4 billion since 2019 significantly displacing foreign competition.

The two largest national economies now impose similar state controls over an industry that once epitomised free trade and most-favoured nation principles and there is little scope for future moderation. While Chinese firms have been removed from the BIS’ Entity List before the odds of October’s controls being relaxed are as unlikely as Beijing abandoning its pursuit of military–civil fusion. Escalation looks more probable as both US Republican and Democratic parties continue to frame technological rivalry as existential. Further US restrictions have already been mooted on related investments.

Market intervention comes at a price — production silos are rarely economically efficient. US industry losses are measured in billions. Firms in Taiwan Japan South Korea and Europe must also restructure their organisations to stay onside. Even when BIS issues export licenses the procedural opacity stokes hysteria about favouritism or US protectionism. For the EU the disproportionate focus on lithography was just another example of successive US administrations using China as a pretext to neutralise Europe’s lead. Similar suspicions were also raised over US attempts to enter the 5G race.

Public funding through various ‘Chip Acts’ is hardly an adequate substitute to drive innovation — not least in China’s quest for semiconductor autonomy. Beijing has thrown US$50 billion at its own ‘Big Fund’ with mixed results. Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp a top recipient has become a competitive force in producing NAND flash memory chips but state aid has been overly focused on fabrication and has neglected semiconductor design and manufacturing equipment.

Yet China has been reluctant to respond to US export controls. Beijing could have retaliated by imposing restrictions on access to critical raw materials or on US companies operating within its jurisdiction. But in reality exacerbation of this problem goes against its short-term instincts and interests. Beijing still thinks and acts like a rule-taker — and state control is an amendment to the rulebook it will accept.

Export controls are not insurmountable in the medium term. In the past much less resourceful nations than China have circumvented stricter embargoes and non-proliferation treaties for weapons of mass destruction. Elsewhere the first Chinese 7-nanometre chip was manufactured by the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — a state-owned enterprise that BIS has sanctioned since December 2020.

Beijing — the ultimate savant of power-based statecraft — can simply bide its time. And time as always is on China’s side.

New Jersey has a lot of tasty things to eat and drink. If you're looking to cook at home and are searching specifically for Kroger groceries the Garden State does not have you covered; there are no Kroger stores in New Jersey.

Kroger originated just two states west in Ohio circa 1883 per Encyclopedia Britannica. Bernard ""Barney"" H. Kroger and B.A. Branagan founded what was then known as the Great Western Tea Company (Barney was a tea salesman) which became a chain almost immediately. Branagan left shortly into the beginning of the company's run but Barney continued to expand it both in terms of locations and offerings. Right before the business reached its zenith in store numbers Barney retired and the chain consolidated its many locations into supermarkets over the following decades. Nowadays Kroger is one of the largest retailers in the world.

Kroger attributes its success to a handful of innovations. Since the beginning Kroger has strived to be a one-stop shop and offer delivery to its customers. The business has also long sold private brands. In the 1930s Kroger became the first grocery chain to test food scientifically and regularly monitor its groceries' quality. Later in 1972 the company became the first American grocery retailer to try out electronic scanners according to the company's website. Through these strategies Kroger grew to make hundreds of billions of dollars annually and spread across 35 states merging with various companies. So why hasn't it penetrated the New Jersey market yet?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xMC9qdWRnZS1hbGJlcnRzb25zLWRpdmlkZW5kLWhvbGQtY2VyYmVydXMta3JvZ2VyLW1lcmdlci1hbnRpdHJ1c3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge orders Albertsons to keep dividend on hold as Cerberus Capital waits states resist ahead of $24.6 billion Kroger ...,"Albertsons Cos. was ordered by a Seattle-area judge to keep its $4 billion special dividend on hold until Dec. 19 while Washington’s attorney general asks the state supreme court to halt the payment during a regulatory review of the grocery chain’s pending merger with Kroger Co.

The last-ditch appeal to block the dividend in Washington comes as other states are pursuing a parallel effort in federal court in Washington DC.

Since early November court orders have held up the plan by Albertsons to reward shareholders including Cerberus Capital Management before the $24.6 billion tie-up with Kroger closes. The US Federal Trade Commission asked Kroger this week for more information on the transaction signaling an in-depth antitrust review for a deal that isn’t expected to be completed until 2024 – if it closes at all.

The Seattle-area judge ruled Friday during a hearing that there was no legal justification to block the payment but Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson immediately filed an appeal with the state’s highest court.

Albertsons has argued it should be allowed to go ahead with the special dividend because it had already been planning to disburse at least $4 billion in cash to shareholders before it began merger talks with Kroger.

Still the grocery chains disclosed the payout “as part of the transaction” when they announced their agreement Oct. 14 and Washington state officials said the dividend would hurt consumers by depleting the company’s reserves and should be blocked until the deal was completed.

King County Superior Court Judge Ken Schubert said the state had failed to show that the dividend involved an agreement between Albertsons and Kroger which would violate federal antitrust laws.

He said Albertsons decided to issue the dividend on its own and that Kroger’s only input was to insist that the dividend didn’t exceed $4 billion which it feared would weaken the financial condition of the company it was buying. “Frankly Kroger didn’t care if there was a special dividend one way or the other” the judge said.

Ted Hassi a lawyer for Albertsons told the judge that delaying the dividend would make it difficult for the company to get the money out to shareholders before Jan. 1 the start of a new tax year.

Kroger said it was pleased with the court’s decision and reiterated that it was committed to working with regulators to get the deal done. The tie-up will “provide compelling benefits to customers associates and communities” Kroger said in a statement.

Albertsons continues to believe the claim by the Washington attorney general “is meritless and provides no legal basis for preventing the payment of a dividend that has been duly and unanimously approved by Albertsons Cos.’ fully informed Board of Directors” the company said in a statement.

Several other states also have argued the payments would weaken the company’s ability to compete if its takeover by Kroger is blocked.

A federal judge in the nation’s capital on Nov. 8 denied an initial request by California Illinois and the District of Columbia to temporarily block the dividend. But the attorneys general from those states are now asking US District Judge Carl Nichols to issue a preliminary injunction — exactly what the Seattle judge rejected.

The AGs told Nichols in a Saturday court filing that “new evidence” and “new arguments” support their position that if the dividend is paid out now it “will likely render Albertsons unable to compete as strongly as it can today in violation of federal and state antitrust laws.”

Albertsons has said it would pay for the dividend by using $2.5 billion in cash on hand with the rest of the money coming from loans. The payment to investors was originally scheduled for Nov. 7 but it was temporarily halted by a Seattle judge.

Cerberus initially bought into the grocer in 2006 and currently owns a stake of about 28%.

Kroger and Albertsons are the two biggest traditional supermarket chains in the US with significant overlap in major markets in states such as California Washington Colorado Texas and Illinois.

At the same time the companies face tough competition from mass-market retailers and warehouse clubs that sell food as well as general merchandise. Kroger ranks second in market share for groceries after Walmart Inc. according to Numerator a market researcher. Albertsons is fourth after Costco Wholesale Corp.

The US Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel held a hearing on the Kroger-Albertsons deal Nov. 29 at which multiple senators questioned whether the combination should be allowed to close.

While senators don’t have the ability to derail the merger their opposition adds to the controversy swirling around the deal which also faces resistance from consumer groups and a labor union representing employees of both grocers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYm9pc2VkZXYuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8xMi8xMC9hbGJlcnRzb25zLWFnLXBheW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge sides with Albertsons on $4 billion dividend payment but keeps it halted pending appeal,"Acquiring Albertsons

BoiseDev complete coverage

A restraining order blocking Albertsons from paying out a $4 billion dividend payment to shareholders is still in place – but the Boise-based grocery giant did get good news in court late Friday.

King County Superior Court Judge Ken Schubert sided with Albertsons and its potential acquirer Kroger over the Washington Attorney General’s office which had sued to stop the dividend payment.

But the judge said a temporary restraining order should stay in place for another ten days until December 19th to give the AG’s office time to appeal. Schubert said lifting the restraining order would mean Albertsons would immediately push the cash from its books to shareholders giving the state no room to appeal.

The Washington AG immediately filed a notice of appeal to the Washington Superior Court.

Latest hurdle

Albertsons and Kroger said the dividend payment was connected to the merger. But after two groups of attorneys general filed suit the companies quickly backtracked and said the dividend was part of a capital return strategy.

“Albertsons Cos. continues to believe that the claim brought by the Attorney General of the State of Washington and the similar lawsuit brought by the Attorneys General of California Illinois and the District of Columbia is (sic) meritless and provides no legal basis for preventing the payment of a dividend that has been duly and unanimously approved by Albertsons Cos.’ fully informed Board of Directors” Albertsons said in a statement issued Friday.

Washington AG Bob Ferguson said the dividend payment would hobble Albertsons’ ability to compete and weaken the company if the merger doesn’t go through.

Cincinnati-based Kroger announced in October it hoped to purchase Albertsons in a $24.6 billion acquisition that could close in 2024. The deal brought quick blowback including the two states’ AG lawsuits a bipartisan grilling by congress and complaints from unions. The agreement came after another company initially said it would pay more for Albertsons but changed its mind and backed out.

The company will need sign-off from the Federal Trade Commission which has taken an increasingly aggressive posture towards larger mergers. Friday the FTC announced it would sue to stop Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of game maker Activision-Blizard. A deal for Penguin Random House to buy Simon & Schuster from Paramount Global fell apart after government scrutiny last month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvc2NpZW5jZS90aGUtZmlnaHQtdG8tcmVkdWNlLWZvb2Qtd2FzdGUtaXMtZ2V0dGluZy1hLWJvb3N0LWZyb20tc2NpZW5jZdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvYW1wL3NjaWVuY2UvdGhlLWZpZ2h0LXRvLXJlZHVjZS1mb29kLXdhc3RlLWlzLWdldHRpbmctYS1ib29zdC1mcm9tLXNjaWVuY2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The fight to reduce food waste is getting a boost from science,"Hate mealy apples and soggy french fries? Science can help.

Restaurants grocers farmers and food companies are increasingly turning to chemistry and physics to tackle the problem of food waste.

Some are testing spray-on peels or chemically enhanced sachets that can slow the ripening process in fruit. Others are developing digital sensors that can tell — more precisely than a label — when meat is safe to consume. And packets affixed to the top of a takeout box use thermodynamics to keep fries crispy.

Experts say growing awareness of food waste and its incredible cost — both in dollars and in environmental impact — has led to an uptick in efforts to mitigate it. U.S. food waste startups raised $4.8 billion in 2021 30% more than they raised in 2020 according to ReFed a group that studies food waste.

“This has suddenly become a big interest” said Elizabeth Mitchum director of the Postharvest Technology Center at the University of California Davis who has worked in the field for three decades. “Even companies that have been around for a while are now talking about what they do through that lens.”

In 2019 around 35% of the 229 million tons of food available in the U.S. — worth around $418 billion — went unsold or uneaten according to ReFed. Food waste is the largest category of material placed in municipal landfills according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which notes that rotting food releases methane a problematic greenhouse gas.

WATCH: Food waste is contributing to climate change. What’s being done about it?

ReFed estimates 500000 pounds (225000 kilograms) of food could be diverted from landfills annually with high-tech packaging.

Among the products in development are a sensor by Stockholm-based Innoscentia that can determine whether meat is safe depending on the buildup of microbes in its packaging. And Ryp Labs based in the U.S. and Belgium is working on a produce sticker that would release a vapor to slow ripening.

SavrPak was founded in 2020 by Bill Birgen an aerospace engineer who was tired of the soggy food in his lunchbox. He developed a plant-based packet — made with food-safe materials approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — that can fit inside a takeout container and absorb condensation helping keep the food inside hotter and crispier.

Nashville Tennessee-based hot-chicken chain Hattie B’s was skeptical. But after testing SavrPaks using humidity sensors it now uses the packs when it’s catering fried foods and is working with SavrPak to integrate the packs into regular takeout containers.

Brian Morris Hattie B’s vice president of culinary learning and development said each SavrPak costs the company less than $1 but ensures a better meal.

“When it comes to fried chicken we kind of lose control from the point when it leaves our place” Morris said. “We don’t want the experience to go down the drain.”

But cost can still be a barrier for some companies and consumers. Kroger the nation’s largest grocery chain ended its multiyear partnership with Goleta California-based Apeel Sciences this year because it found consumers weren’t willing to pay more for produce brushed or sprayed with Apeel’s edible coating to keep moisture in and oxygen out thus extending the time that produce stays fresh.

Apeel says treated avocados can last a few extra days while citrus fruit lasts for several weeks. The coating is made of purified mono- and diglycerides emulsifiers that are common food additives.

Kroger wouldn’t say how much more Apeel products cost. Apeel also wouldn’t reveal the average price premium for produce treated with its coating since it varies by food distributor and grocer. But Apeel says its research shows customers are willing to pay more for produce that lasts longer. Apeel also says it continues to talk to Kroger about other future technology.

There is another big hurdle to coming up with innovations to preserve food: Every food product has its own biological makeup and handling requirements.

“There is no one major change that can improve the situation” said Randy Beaudry a professor in the horticulture department at Michigan State University’s school of agriculture.

Beaudry said the complexity has caused some projects to fail. He remembers working with one large packaging company on a container designed to prevent fungus in tomatoes. For the science to work the tomatoes had to be screened for size and then oriented stem-up in each container. Eventually the project was scrapped.

Beaudry said it’s also hard to sort out which technology works best since startups don’t always share data or formulations with outside researchers.

Some companies find it better to rely on proven technology — but in new ways. Chicago-based Hazel Technologies which was founded in 2015 sells 1-methylcyclopropene or 1-MCP a gas that has been used for decades to delay the ripening process in fruit. The compound — considered non-toxic by the EPA — is typically pumped into sealed storage rooms to inhibit the production of ethylene a plant hormone.

But Hazel’s real breakthrough is a sachet the size of a sugar packet that can slowly release 1-MCP into a box of produce.

Mike Mazie the facilities and storage manager at BelleHarvest a large apple packing facility in Belding Michigan ordered around 3000 sachets this year. He used them for surplus bins that couldn’t fit into the sealed rooms required for gas.

“If you can get another week out of a bushel of apples why wouldn’t you?” he said. “It absolutely makes a difference.”

The science is promising but it’s only part of the solution said Yvette Cabrera the director of food waste for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Most food waste happens at the residential level she said; lowering portion sizes buying smaller quantities of food at a time or improving the accuracy of date labels could have even more impact than technology.

“Overall as a society we don’t value food as it should be valued” Cabrera said.

Secretary of the US Air Force Frank Kendall decided on December 9 that the MC-12 Liberty ISR platform at the base will be replaced and the MC-12 Formal Training Unit will be converted to the AT-802U Total Force Integration FTU.

The 310th Special Operations Squadron currently based at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico will relocate to Will Rogers ANGB and will be joined by about 80 personnel to support the mission.

A site survey is scheduled for spring 2023 to assess operational requirements potential impacts on existing missions housing infrastructure and manpower. An environmental impact analysis will be conducted by the Department of the Air Force after the site survey is complete with a final decision on the basing expected in fall 2023.

USSOCOM will receive the new AT-802U Sky Warden aircraft from L3Harris Technologies and Air Tractor under a contract from August this year worth up to $3 billion. The contract will see the two companies deliver up to 75 manned fixed wing aircraft with an initial program contract award of $170 million.

The Armed Overwatch program is aimed at providing special operations forces with close air support precision strike and special operations forces intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in austere and permissive environments.

At the time of the contract award L3Harris said it anticipated modifying last summer’s Armed Overwatch prototype demonstrator into the production configuration and providing for customer weapon system testing in approximately six months.

Built on the Air Tractor AT-802U platform Sky Warden is designed and built for austere operations. It has a 6-hour loiter capability at a 200 nautical mile combat radius with a 6000 lb combat load-out.

L3Harris says the Sky Warden has communications and sensor suites on par with larger aircraft like the King Air and the AC-130. The aircraft is also said to feature the largest payload capacity of any single turbine engine aircraft allowing it to host communications sensors and airborne ISR solutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Chips are imperative to the defence industry and technologies of the future. By targeting this critical input the Biden administration aims to freeze China’s semiconductor suite at 2022 levels and impede its military development.

China will probably struggle to maintain its rapid advances in artificial intelligence quantum and cloud computing without access to US technology and expertise. Chipmakers like the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — China’s largest logic chip producer — will lose access to machine maintenance and equipment replacement under the new controls.

US chip equipment suppliers like Lam Research Applied Materials and KLA Corporation have suspended sales and services to Chinese chipmakers while ASML Holding a Netherlands-based supplier told its US staff to stop servicing Chinese customers until further notice.

The new controls exploit China’s weaknesses in developing talent and research. They require all US citizens residents and green card holders — including hundreds of ethnic Chinese educated and trained in the United States — to seek permission from the US Department of Commerce to work in Chinese fabrication plants. Since such permission is unlikely US citizens working at Chinese semiconductor companies will be forced to sacrifice their citizenship or their job. Most will have to give up their current jobs. Indeed Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp has already asked core US staff to leave the company.

Despite the bleak short-term outlook it is wrong to assume that US controls will hobble China for years. In the case of nuclear weapons significant resources were poured into acquiring bomb technology once political leaders decided that they were essential for national defence. That effort inevitably starved other sectors but more often than not successfully delivered nuclear weapons programs.

Now that advanced semiconductors are seen as essential to national defence Beijing is adopting the ‘whole of the nation’ approach and investing national resources into the industry. Many engineers and computer scientists are likely to be assigned to semiconductor design and manufacture assisted by espionage against US South Korean Taiwanese Japanese and European chip firms.

The export controls won’t cripple the Chinese military. According to a 2022 RAND Corporation report China’s military systems rely on older less sophisticated chips made in China on which US export controls will have no affect. If China needs more advanced chips for AI-driven weapons systems it can likely produce them albeit at a very high cost. Many semiconductor industry experts agree that China has the technical capability to produce cutting-edge chips yet lacks the commercial capability to scale up production. This means that the US ban will have less effect on weapons systems instead delaying the rollout of civilian applications such as autonomous vehicles.

Nor will US semiconductor firms emerge from the sanctions unscathed given many have China as their largest market. China comprises 27 per cent of sales at Intel 31 per cent at Lam Research and 33 per cent at Applied Materials. Both Applied Materials and Nvidia expect the new export controls to cut US$400 million (6 per cent and 7 per cent respectively) from next quarter’s sales. Lam Research — one of Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp’s largest suppliers — expects the controls to cut a whopping US$2.5 billion (15 per cent) from 2023 sales.

These dramatic cuts come at a particularly difficult time for the US semiconductor industry which is experiencing falling revenue and increased input costs. By one estimate the damage US sanctions inflict on research and development and capital investment in the Western semiconductor industry ‘will exceed Washington’s modest subsidies for the chip industry by a factor of five or more’.

Tit-for-tat retaliation against Washington is not an option for China given its heavy reliance on foreign technology. Any reciprocal measure would inflict more damage on China itself. Punishing US companies with big exposure in China — like Nike or Apple — would harm the Chinese labour market since those firms employ many Chinese citizens. Other foreign supply chains and Chinese businesses supplying Nike and Apple would also suffer.

Imposing export controls on products China dominates like rare earths or pharmaceutical ingredients would accelerate the US movement to ‘reshore’ onshore and ‘friend-shore’ manufacturing those products as was the case with Japan in 2012.

Instead of overt retaliation China will probably seek alternatives to US chip technology. But since alternatives are decades away intellectual property theft and the nationalisation of foreign semiconductor firms could spike.

Whether US chip controls represent a stand-alone policy or foreshadow sanctions across a wider range of high technology sectors is unclear. In the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election many Republicans will call for harsher controls. At his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit Biden sought to tamp down US–China hostilities. But unless he resists calls from the US ‘China hawks’ Biden could find himself dragged into a Second Cold War.

Any tech product requires a chip inside to run it – starting with home appliances like washing machines refrigerators and vacuum cleaners to smartphones computers and modern cars to satellites fighter jets hypersonic missiles and artificial intelligence.

Microchips – also known as silicon chips microprocessors or just chips – are tiny thin and rectangular tiles made of a crystalline semiconductor typically silicon that have been heavily packed with tiny transistors and other electronic components.

One single semiconductor chip contains the same number of transistors as all of the stones that make up the Great Pyramid of Giza and more than 100 billion integrated circuits are in use daily across the globe. This figure is equal to the number of stars that make up our local region of the Milky Way galaxy.

These chips are a fundamental component of electronic devices. They have enabled advancements in a wide variety of fields including communications computers healthcare military systems transportation and renewable energy to name just a few.

In today's world they have truly become the brains of modern technology. The last half-century has seen significant advancements in semiconductor technology resulting in smaller quicker and more dependable electronic gadgets.

The little yet powerful semiconductor chip is also vital for the world economy. And chipmaking has lately become the new flashpoint in relations between the US and China.

The global semiconductor business is undergoing a seismic upheaval because of the US' accelerated process of decoupling from Chinese technology. The two biggest economies seem to have engaged in a 'tech war' over microchips and other advanced technologies.

The United States traditionally held the lion's share of the worldwide semiconductor industry (37 % in 1990). However its dominance has been steadily eroded by East Asian economies over the previous three decades. When compared to the US' 12% share of the global semiconductor manufacturing market in 2020 Taiwan (22%) South Korea (21%) Japan (15%) and China (15%) accounted for 73% of the market.

Even though the US does not have the greatest part of the worldwide semiconductor manufacturing market it is home to a number of the most important semiconductor processing providers such as Applied Materials KLA Corporation and Lam Research. Moreover while the US companies don't manufacture most chips they are the ones who have almost all the patents.

In a move that may significantly escalate tensions between the two countries the US Department of Commerce published its updated policy on artificial intelligence and semiconductor technology exports to China in October.

The 139 pages of new export control rules established a de facto restriction on the exportation to China of the modern computer chips necessary for the operation of AI algorithms.

Because more than 95% of these chips used in China are designed and patented by American semiconductor firms and are thus subject to export regulations by the US China's whole future as an AI giant is in peril if it loses access to chips made in the US.

Since artificial intelligence was the top technology aim outlined in the Chinese government's five-year economic plan for 2021-2026 this move makes it abundantly plain that the US intended to prevent China from accomplishing its top technical goal.

Over the years China has been playing catch-up with the US in advanced technologies. Beijing has developed an ambitious initiative called 'Made in China 2025' to reorient its sectors and compete in areas like robotics microchips and self-driving automobiles.

As China's semiconductor market expands quickly America is concerned about the implications for its national security of relying on Chinese processors and being exposed to Chinese cyberattacks. As long as America can deliberately stifle its companies China's claims to be a superpower will appear false. China will eventually try their best to overtake its opponent but America is determined to retain its lead.

As a preventative action The Biden administration revealed a comprehensive set of export rules in recent months that prohibit Chinese firms from acquiring advanced semiconductors and chip-making machinery without a licence. The law also places restrictions on assistance that US people such as Green card holders or US citizens may contribute towards the ""development or production"" of chips at specific Chinese industrial facilities.

In a recent study Mark Williams and Zichun Huang both analysts at Capital Economics stated: ""Chinese firms will lose access not only to advanced chips but to technology and inputs that might over time have allowed domestic chipmakers to climb the ladder and compete at the cutting edge.""

To address this China may reduce exports of different electronic components which would raise the price of a wide range of goods.

The US stance may also be detrimental to the global supply chain for all IT products. The Chinese government may impose export restrictions on lower-end chips according to Christopher Gopal a seasoned supply chain specialist who works at the University of Southern California.

Even with the fastest timeline it might take the US a minimum of two years to develop or buy in large quantities from allies. This would mean that ""cars would go up in price and down in functionality"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcHN1d2F0Y2guY29tL2NzcndhdGNoL2Nzci13YXRjaC1vaWwtaW5kaWEtYmFncy1jc3ItdGltZXMtYXdhcmQtMjAyMtIBVWh0dHBzOi8vcHN1d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9jc3J3YXRjaC9jc3Itd2F0Y2gtb2lsLWluZGlhLWJhZ3MtY3NyLXRpbWVzLWF3YXJkLTIwMjI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CSR Watch: Oil India bags ‘CSR Times Award 2022’,New Delhi: Oil India Limited (OIL) India's second largest national exploration and production company has been conferred with the CSR Times Award 2022 in the Gold category for its corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects in the area of skill development viz.

The casino operator which claims to be one of the leading gambling and hospitality services providers in the entire world also revealed that it started searching for Long Island sites after its Senior Vice President (SVP) David A. Paterson a former governor of New York State made suggestion for the same.

Paterson suggested that the company should look for a site in the Long Island area for its future gambling-friendly facility because the Manhattan area is already congested. According to the former governor Long Island’s proximity to LaGuardia Airport and Kennedy Airport could make it an attractive casino destination.

When asked for a comment a company representative said “The most important thing about the location of a casino is proximity to the airports because a very high percentage of gamblers fly around the world and go to these casinos.”

High rollers would be able to get from Long Island and particularly Queens to the nearby airport within 15 minutes.

The casino giant is also considering some other potential sites for its envisioned gambling-friendly property including the Nassau Hub and Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.

However Las Vegas Sands will have to secure a state license to operate a casino in the area. According to a Las Vegas Sands’ representative the New York State Gaming Commission will open the application window sometime next month but no licenses are expected to be issued before late next year. Ron Reese a senior Ls Vegas Sands executive went on to revel that the company could invest $3 billion to $4 billion in new casino construction.

The envisioned casino would likely include large conference rooms in addition to massive gaming space eateries and other amenities. Kristen Reynolds CEO of tourism promotion agency Discover Long Island welcomed the idea of a new building a new casino resort in the area. He revealed that the area had to turn away approximately $35 million in conventions in the last few years due to lack of such facilities. Moreover the new facility would give a big boost to local economy by generating new jobs for people and a new stream of tax revenue for the government.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Realidades,"Enfermos y Debilidad

¿Juventud o madurez? Realidades

Desde aquellos tiempos de estudiante lo hemos oído muchas veces: cuanto mayor es una persona más le cuesta hacerse a la idea de que ha de abandonar este mundo. Los jóvenes suelen manifestar menor apego a la vida. ¿Será verdad? No lo sé. Tal vez no se pueda generalizar. Hoy me limito a transcribir lo que oí de un hombre ya mayor guiado sin duda por su gran fe:

- ”En mi juventud no podía hacerme a la idea de la muerte a pesar de que en aquellos tiempos nos insistían tanto. Cuando oía hablar de esta realidad me parecía que era asunto de otros de los viejos de los enfermos crónicos. Ahora ya me faltan los padres algunos amigos y gran parte de las personas que intervinieron en mi formación humana. Veo la idea de partir como más familiar.

Leí en San Pablo: “Todas las cosas las tengo por basura con tal de ganar a Cristo y encontrarme con Él… configurándome con su muerte para alcanzar la resurrección de los muertos” (Fil. 3 8-11)

Me puse a meditar. Quise contemplar a Jesús en el sepulcro. Me quedé en espíritu junto a Él. Mi oración resultó muy íntima y nada macabra: todo lo contrario llena de afecto y amor. Brotaban en mi interior con insistencia y gran paz estos deseos leídos en el Apóstol: Lo creado es como basura en comparación del amor a Jesucristo. Configurarme con su muerte y alcanzar la resurrección. No puede pretender el discípulo privilegios si el Maestro no los tuvo. No rehúso la muerte. Si me dieran a elegir marchar al cielo en un carro de fuego como Elías o someterme a la ley general mi opción sería como la de Jesús a quien amo por encima de todo. Quiero morir con Cristo para resucitar con El. Será duro sí mas para El también resultó duro. Seguirle hasta el calvario para obtener la resurrección eterna.”

Ojalá querido amigo enfermo admires aquella resolución del hombre maduro en la fe. Que comiences por no asustarte ante la realidad de la muerte. Se trata de un primer paso a conseguir. No te va dañará en el espíritu; todo lo contrario. Y el paso siguiente puede ser profundizar más y más en tu fe: hasta que te des cuenta de la gran realidad de ser cristiano de enamorarte de Cristo.

¡Con cuanta paz me decía el Director espiritual de mis años mozos hombre ya que había doblado la década de los ochenta!: “El Señor está cerca”. Pensé entonces que la ancianidad es el Adviento de la vida.

Espero que estas reflexiones de personas maduras en la fe nos puedan servir a todos de orientación y estímulo en nuestra vida cristiana.

Most of the homes are in the Southwest and Southeast with landlords having the opportunity in some cases to buy entire subdivisions the outlet reports.

A Lennar representative told the outlet that the effort was part of its standard marketing efforts.

Big landlords have entered the homebuilding market to meet the tightening demand for housing CNBC reported in June. At that time homes-built-for-rent represented about 5 percent of the homebuilding market nearly double the historical average the outlet reported.

But with the recent sharp market downturn due to soaring interest rates Lennar and other builders have ramped up their efforts to sell single-family homes to landlords Bloomberg said.

Jeff Cline executive director of the single-family rental advisory division of SVN told Bloomberg that builders have sought bids on about 40000 homes in recent months.

Lennar’s average home sale price in the third quarter was close to $500000 which translates to a $2.5 billion valuation on the 5000 homes offered to big landlords Bloomberg reported. However the outlet noted that buyers usually seek steep discounts for buying in bulk which would drive that valuation down significantly.

The company is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter numbers after the market closes on Wednesday.

If a homebuilder cannot sell their ballooning inventory of unsold new houses to households at current prices and mortgage rates amid plunging sales and soaring cancellation rates of signed contracts – topping out at 45% in the Southwest and at 38% in Texas – despite aggressive incentives such as mortgage-rate buydowns to stimulate sales and prevent cancellations well whom are homebuilders supposed to sell those houses to?

Rental operations? That may be hard too because many have pulled back for all the same reasons as households: Prices are too high and financing is too costly. Sales to single-family rental investors have plunged by 32% in Q3 from a year ago. So here we go with a good-luck nod…

Lennar the second-biggest homebuilder by market capitalization has been approaching big rental landlords with an inventory list of about 5000 houses that it wants to offload according to sources cited by Bloomberg. Many of the houses are in the Southwest and Southeast. They include entire subdivisions.

Lennar has sold about 1000 single-family houses to rental operators in its third quarter – and some of those houses it sold to its own rental operation. Last year Lennar obtained $1.25 billion in equity commitments from Allianz Real Estate and Centerbridge Partners for its rental division to buy rental houses.

“Our program has taken a very disciplined approach to stepping back and waiting for the market to kind of reconcile itself” Lennar Executive Chairman Stuart Miller told analysts in September. “Contrary to what you might have thought we’re probably selling less to our own program and more to other SFR programs outside of Lennar.”

It’s across the industry: Homebuilders have pitched at least 40000 new houses to rental operators in recent months Jeff Cline an executive director at commercial real-estate advisory SVN told Bloomberg. He said that many of these houses had originally been sold to individual buyers who then canceled the purchase contract.

Cancellations of signed contracts with individual buyers have spiked. According to a survey by John Burns Real Estate Consulting of homebuilders that account for roughly 20% of all new home sales the cancellation rate spiked to 26% in October up from a rate of 8% a year ago and up from 11% in October 2019.

The cancellation rates topped out in the Southwest at 45% up from a cancellation rate of 9% a year ago. In Texas the cancellation rate spiked to 39% up from 12% a year ago (chart via Rick Palacios Jr. Director of Research at John Burns click to enlarge):

With the median sold price of a new house currently at around $450000 those 40000 houses that builders are trying to offload to single-family rental operators would run around $18 billion.

But rental operators are in no mood to pay peak prices. They might bite after massive discounts – discounts that homebuilders are not nearly desperate enough yet to offer.

But they will eventually be desperate enough to offer those discounts – that’s the bet by some big investors in the process of raising funds in preparation for that moment.

Increasingly homebuilders are trying to sell one or more subdivisions at a time SVN’s Cline told Bloomberg.

Incentives especially mortgage-rate buydowns for individual buyers. Trying to sell houses one at a time to individual buyers is tough at those sky-high prices and current mortgage rates. The obvious solution would be to cut prices but that’s like the last option for homebuilders for a variety of reasons including financial metrics that Wall Street looks at. Incentives come first.

The big incentive: mortgage rate buydowns: In December 75% of the home builders in a national survey by John Burns Real Estate Consulting said that they’re buying down mortgage rates to lower the payments for buyers. They fall into three categories of rate buydowns:

32% are buying down the full 30-year term. To lower the mortgage rate by 1-2 percentage points the up-front costs for the builder amount to about 5%-6% of the sales price of the home.

30% are buying down the rate for only the first two years of the mortgage. To lower the rate for the first year by 2 percentage points and for the second year by 1 percentage point the up-front costs for the builder amount to about 2% of the sales price of the home.

13% are using less common buydowns.

Builders are using these incentives not only to make sales but also to prevent or stop cancellations of sales that had already been made.

In the Southwest 87% of the builders in the survey are buying down mortgage rates; in Texas 81%; in Southern California 79%; in Florida 61% (chart via John Burns Real Estate Consulting):

What builders are up against: Inventory of new houses for sale in all states of construction in the US has ballooned to 470000 houses up by 21% from the already high levels a year ago and the highest since March 2008 and about where inventory had been during the ramp-up of Housing Bust 1 in September 2005 before it all came apart. Which destroys the theory that home prices are high because the industry isn’t building enough houses:

His success as an event promoter is not by chance but the result of hard work planning foresight and executing a well-thought-out marketing strategy.

“I just love live music. I wanna see live music presented in a certain way. You know when you go to a rock concert and see them have good sound great lighting good stage and a great presentation. I have always wanted to see reggae presented this way” he shared.

In 1987 Crooks established Jammins Events an arts and cultural promotions event-management company that has evolved into a premier enterprise in the NY tri-state area. To kickstart the company Crooks leveraged his international connections and pulled off the first-ever St Mary Reggae Music Festival in Jamaica. Crown Prince of Reggae Dennis Brown Cocoa Tea Freddie McGregor and two-time Grammy Award winner Shabba Ranks were showcased on that line-up. He has since produced and organised some of the biggest events in the US and Jamaica including hosting the very first dancehall-reggae concert at the world-famous Brooklyn Barclays Center. His company has produced the annual New York Reggae Festival the Brooklyn Music Festival the Soul and Reggae Legends Series at the landmark Brooklyn Academy of Music The Singers in Action concert series The Reggae Jazz Festival several Jamaican and American stage plays Regina Belle up close and personal; Jazz great Chuck Mangione performing for the prime minister of Jamaica; amateur boxing matches and other music festivals which have brought increased economic activities and generated publicity locally and internationally.

In 2019 when dancehall superstar Buju Banton performed at the historic Long Walk To Freedom concert at the National Stadium in Kingston Crooks was tapped to produce the official after party that was held at the Liguanea Club in St Andrew. He recently pulled off another major coup this time teaming with Live Nation the world’s leading live entertainment and eCommerce company to produce Beres Hammond’s fourth consecutive sold-out tri-state area concert in Long Island NY.

“The partnership with Live Nation began about 10 years ago” Crooks told The Sunday Gleaner of the company which has assets in the billions. “A good friend of mine Toby Ludwig introduced me to Jason Miller who is the executive vice-president for Live Nation in this area. They have been to a lot of my concerts.”

The Beres & Friends presentation at the 2700-seat NYCB Theatre at Westbury in October was curated by Crooks who came up with the concept of presenting Beres in concert alongside icons Monty Alexander Stephen ‘Cat’ Coore and Dean Fraser.

“Me and Beres have been talking for a while about doing an event like this. We kept talking about doing a Storyteller Tour where Beres gets to talk about his songs and have musicians express the music the way he sees it. We spoke about which musicians would make sense. The first one we came up with was Monty Alexander a jazz great and legend. Then we spoke to Cat Coore and he was available and then we spoke with Brooke Alford. After that we added Dean Fraser Desi Jones and Derrick Barnett” Crooks explained.

He lauded the relationship he has developed with the Love From A Distance singer.

“I understand Beres. As a promoter you have to understand what the artiste’s goal is and you have to promote him accordingly. I am the first person that put Beres on a show by himself ... . One man one band one show. We did it at Madison Square Gardens and it sold out. We started with a concert with Beres at Tramps (a live music venue) in the early ‘90s. This was the first successful Beres show in New York” he recalled.

“Success” he stressed “comes from proper planning and effective execution. If I have been lucky in the process I am extremely thankful.”

CHALLENGES

Crooks migrated to the US from Jamaica as a youngster and attended school in New York before he moved to Florida and later Hawaii. However the transition from living a modest life in a Third World country to the bright lights of New York City had its challenges. He got exposure when he enlisted in the US Army Forces and shared that it gave him discipline and that ‘never say die’ attitude that he needed for the path of a successful event promoter. After an honourable discharge from the US Army in 1980 Crooks earned a bachelor’s degree in marketing from the University of North Florida. Speaking about business Crooks said “As you may already know entertainment continues to be one of the fastest growing businesses globally. It had an estimated value of approximately US$800 billion in the USA alone” he said adding that there is always growing demand for entertainment products.

Besides being a successful businessman Crooks is a philanthropist whose footprints can be found in his advocacy for the arts and entertainment which he said can be used to positively influence the youths of today. His organisation has consistently provided financial aid to students in need. His passion has inspired the New York Cultural All-Star Music Academy his non-profit entity which exposes kids to the music and entertainment industry. He has donated part of the proceeds for events he has hosted to the American Foundation for The University of The West Indies (AFUWI) a charitable organisation in the United States whose mission is to raise funds to aid University of the West Indies students. This year the AFUWI received approximately US$12000 from Jammins Events.

Crooks who volunteers on the board of several community organisations is also a founding member of Brooklyn’s Urban NightLife Association.

Here’s what the Fleetwood Mac singer said about working with Swift and how her prediction came true.

Stevie Nicks and Taylor Swift performed together at the 2010 Grammys

Taylor Swift and Stevie Nicks performed two of their biggest songs together at the 2010 Grammy Awards. The award-winning musicians sang Swift’s 2008 hit “You Belong With Me” and the 1975 Fleetwood Mac classic “Rhiannon.”

Critics slammed Swift’s performance at the awards show. Music industry analyst and critic Bob Lefsetz gave a blistering review in his Lefsetz Letter in which he wrote “In one fell swoop Taylor Swift consigned herself to the dustbin of teen phenoms… Taylor’s too young and dumb to understand the mistake she made. And those surrounding her are addicted to cash and are afraid to tell her no. But last night Taylor Swift SHOULD have auto-tuned. To save her career.”

Swift wrote the song “Mean” about the criticism she received after the 2010 Grammys in which she condemned a critic who was “grumbling on about how [she] can’t sing.”

The singer also shared what she thought about the criticism on her website. “No matter how old you are no matter what your job is no matter what your place is in life. There’s always going to be someone who’s just mean to you” Swift wrote (via Songfacts). “Dealing with that is all you can control about that situation how you handle it. ‘Mean’ is about how I handle it and sort of my mind set about this whole situation.”

Stevie Nicks said Taylor Swift was going to ‘save the music business’

Critics may not have liked Taylor Swift singing with Stevie Nicks at the 2010 Grammys but the Fleetwood Mac star gave her fellow artist a glowing review.

“This girl writes the songs that make the whole world sing like Neil Diamond or Elton John” Nick wrote for Time in April 2010. “She sings she writes she performs she plays great guitar. Taylor can do ballads that could be considered pop or rock and then switch back into country. When I turned 20 years old I had just made the serious decision to never be a dental assistant. Taylor just turned 20 and she’s won four Grammys.”

Nicks concluded by saying that Swift would save the music industry. “Taylor is writing for the universal woman and for the man who wants to know her” the “Gypsy” singer wrote. “The female rock-’n’-roll-country-pop songwriter is back and her name is Taylor Swift. And it’s women like her who are going to save the music business.”

Demand For Taylor Swift Tickets ‘Historically Unprecedented’ Ticketmaster Says https://t.co/mxrJQKFUyL pic.twitter.com/q6SbDBBkq6 — Forbes (@Forbes) November 15 2022

How the pop star has changed the music industry

Stevie Nicks’ comments about Taylor Swift saving the music business were almost prophetic considering how the pop star has arguably changed the entertainment industry.

For example Swift is currently re-recording her first six albums after feuding with Scooter Braun who purchased her master recordings in 2019. The singer shared her feelings about the talent manager and his acquisition of her music in a scathing Tumblr post. She accused Braun of “incessant manipulative bullying” and claimed she was never given the opportunity to buy her recordings. Re-recording those albums gives Swift full control over her music making a statement in an industry where so few artists thrive.

Then there was the Ticketmaster fiasco. After the release of Swift’s Midnights album Ticketmaster failed to sell tickets to the general public. The platform had a limited presale but the demand was so high that fans had to wait in an online queue for hours only to be told tickets were sold out. After the presale the general public sale was canceled.

Dozens of fans filed a complaint against Ticketmaster and Live Nation in L.A. County Superior Court asserting claims including breach of contract intentional misrepresentation fraud antitrust violations and unfair competition. The case could change how Ticketmaster operates and affect concert ticket sales in the future."

The incoming capsule hit the atmosphere at Mach 32 or 32 times the speed of sound and endured reentry temperatures of 5000 degrees Fahrenheit before splashing down near Guadalupe Island. A Navy ship quickly moved in to recover the spacecraft and its silent occupants — three test dummies rigged with vibration sensors and radiation monitors.

NASA hailed the descent and splashdown as close to perfect. The space agency needed a successful splashdown to stay on track for the next Orion flight around the moon which is currently targeted for 2024. Four astronauts will make the trip which will be followed by a two-person lunar landing as early as 2025.

The Orion capsule that landed Sunday was the first flight of NASA’s new Artemis moon program named after Apollo’s mythological twin sister.

Tonya Ladwig Lockheed Martin’s Orion program manager watched the splashdown from a Highlands Ranch school gymnasium with hundreds of coworkers and family members who worked on the capsule.

Paolo Zialcita/CPR News A crowd of Lockheed Martin employees and their families gathered in a school gymnasium in Highlands Ranch to watch the splashdown of NASA's Orion capsule.

The crowd watched intently as mission control updated every step of Orion’s descent. When the capsule splashed down into the Pacific the crowd erupted into cheers and applause.

“It's a great victory for Lockheed Martin and for NASA and for a ton of employees in Colorado” Ladwig said. “We [have] about 560 that currently work on the Orion Mission out of Colorado but there are many more that have supported it over the last decade or so in the design and engineering of this spacecraft.”

The next Artemis mission will be the first lunar mission in over 50 years. The data collected from this unmanned mission is vital for the success of the next Orion flight. Denver’s Lockheed Martin staff will once again play a major role in bringing Americans back to the moon.

While no one was on the $4 billion test flight NASA managers were thrilled to pull off the dress rehearsal especially after so many years of flight delays and busted budgets. Fuel leaks and hurricanes conspired for additional postponements in late summer and fall.

Getting Orion back intact after the 25-day 1.4 million-mile flight was NASA’s top objective. With a return speed of 25000 mph — considerably faster than coming in from low-Earth orbit — the capsule used a new advanced heat shield never tested before in spaceflight. To reduce the gravity or G loads it dipped into the atmosphere and briefly skipped out also helping to pinpoint the splashdown area.

“All of the post-flight analysis we demonstrated the heat shield protected us in the lunar return velocities. So all of that helps us get on the path for our crewed flight and Artemis II in the next couple of years” Ladwig said.

Courtesy of NASA NASA’s uncrewed Orion spacecraft snapped this black and white photo of Earth on Nov. 17 2022 the second day of the 25.5-day Artemis I mission.

Orion beamed back stunning photos of not only the gray pitted moon but also the home planet. As a parting shot the capsule revealed a crescent Earth — Earthrise — that left the mission team speechless.

Nottingham Trent University astronomer Daniel Brown said the flight’s many accomplishments illustrate NASA’s capability to put astronauts on the next Artemis moonshot. The space agency expects to announce the crew within the next six months. Orion meanwhile should be back at Kennedy by the end of this December for further inspections.

“This was the nail-biting end of an amazing and important journey for NASA’s Orion spacecraft” Brown said in a statement from England.

Artemis I mission coverage presented with the support of





December 10 2022 — It can now be revealed that NASA's Orion spacecraft which is just a day away from returning to Earth carried secret messages to the moon.



What's more the hidden notes were in plain sight the entire time.



""We do have some Easter eggs in the view of the cockpit. So when you do get that view happy hunting folks!"" said Mike Sarafin NASA's Artemis mission manager on Dec. 18 the third day of the 25.5-day mission. By ""Easter eggs"" he was using the term generally associated with software or films to describe a hidden feature.



NASA then went quiet on the topic. That is until today (Dec. 10) when the agency revealed the locations and meanings behind the stealthy missives.



Spoiler warning: If you want more time to find the ""eggs"" yourself pause reading here until you are ready to check what you found.



""We have five Easter eggs"" Kelly Humphries news chief at the Johnson Space Center in Houston confirmed in an email to collectSPACE. ""The black and white bars between the windows the red cardinal on the right side the yellow sticker to the right of the hatch with 'CBAGF' the black and white bars next to the NASA worm on the mass simulator (bottom right) and the numbers seen on the forward bulkhead to the right of the docking tunnel.""



The NASA and Lockheed Martin team that designed and built the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis I mission came up with each of the coded notes. The Exploration Ground Systems team which prepared the ship for its launch was the first to see the Easter eggs while installing them.



""They deciphered all the puzzles and were sworn to secrecy"" Humphries wrote.



Based on social media posts the first of the ""eggs"" to be deciphered by the public was the first in Humphries' list the black and white bars located between Orion's windows. The bars are Morse code — a method of encoding letters as signals that was used with the telegraph and with ham radio.



Read from the bottom up the ""dashes"" and ""dots"" spell out ""Charlie"". But who is Charlie? Was it a nod to Artemis I launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson the first woman to lead NASA's launch control center? Was it a reference to Apollo 16 moonwalker Charlie Duke? Or maybe it was Charlie Brown Snoopy's owner in the Charles Schulz comic strip ""Peanuts""? (An astronaut Snoopy doll was flown aboard the Orion as the Artemis I zero-g indicator.)



""As you can see 'CHARLIE' can mean many things. For the Orion program it commemorates Charlie Lundquist Orion's deputy program manager who died in 2020"" said Humphries.



A similar tribute is represented by the bird on the right side of the Orion cabin. The icon is for Mark Geyer former Orion program manager and Johnson Space Center director — and a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team — who died in 2021.



The letters C B A G and F that appear on a yellow sticker to the right of Orion's hatch are hidden notes of the music type. Each represents an opening note in the 1954 song ""Fly Me to the Moon"" written by Bart Howard. A decade later the same song as performed by Frank Sinatra became associated with the Apollo missions to the moon.



""I think many of us were humming that song as we saw Orion perform the trans-lunar injection burn"" Humphries said adding that members of the Artemis I team from NASA and its international and industry partners recorded a video of them singing the same song before the mission's launch.



The black and white bars seen next to the NASA ""worm"" logotype is binary for the number 18. The last mission to fly astronauts to the moon was Apollo 17 hence the next number in the sequence. (By coincidence the Artemis I mission is set to splashdown on the same date 50 years ago that Apollo 17 landed on the moon.)



The last of the Easter eggs was the best hidden according to Humphries. The numbers on the forward bulkhead to the right of the docking tunnel — 1 31 32 33 34 39 41 43 46 47 and 49 — are the country calling codes for the nations that participated in building the Orion spacecraft: the United States and member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) the Netherlands Belgium France Spain Italy Switzerland Austria Sweden Norway and Germany.



Artemis I is not the first NASA mission to include easter eggs for the public to find. When the Curiosity Mars Science Laboratory began roving the Red Planet in 2012 its wheels left behind a track spelling out ""JPL"" in Morse code a reference to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California where the mission is managed. Similarly JPL engineers designed the descent parachute for the Perseverance Mars rover to display the lab's motto ""Dare Mighty Things"" and its GPS coordinates in binary code.



The practice even dates back to the first time NASA went to the moon. Though not seen by the public until decades later the MIT programmers who wrote the flight software for the Apollo 11 spacecraft included numerous Easter eggs in their 1969 source code. For example the file name that included the machine instructions for igniting the engine was labeled ""Burn Baby Burn"" while another file seemingly asked that the astronauts ""please crank the silly thing around"" before going ""off to see the wizard.""



Whether or not Easter eggs will also become an Artemis program tradition is still to be seen said Humphries.



""Nothing is planned at this time but you never know if we'll get some great ideas for future flights with crew"" he wrote.

In general a VLS is a system for deploying various missile types from surface warships like frigates. A VLS system enables the end-user to configure a warship with a relatively large complement of guided missiles for anti-air anti-ship and/or land-attack roles. Not only that but a VLS configuration also allows ships to launch their missiles in simultaneous volleys. From an air defence standpoint this could be a critical way of thwarting a saturation attack by enemy anti-ship cruising missiles (ASCM) for example.

The test marks a major breakthrough in Turkey’s efforts to develop homegrown air defence solutions for its land and naval systems. A VLS is a critical piece to that goal. It enables Turkey to deploy its indigenous SAMs from its surface vessels like frigates and corvettes.

In fact the head of Turkey’s Presidency for Defence Industries (SSB) Dr. İsmail Demir said that the Turkish Navy’s lead I-Class frigate the TCG Istanbul will be equipped with the MIDLAS in 2023. This clearly signifies that Turkey will not configure its domestically built ships with the Lockheed Martin Mk.41 VLS. Instead it will directly move ahead to its homegrown MIDLAS solution.

Thus not only does the MIDLAS test signify a key milestone from a development standpoint but the target induction date of 2023 indicates that Turkey’s VLS is nearing completion. Upon deployment the MIDLAS will carry the Roketsan HİSAR-RF short-to-medium-range SAM. In the future the MIDLAS will also deploy the SİPER long-range SAM system.

Overall the completion of the MIDLAS VLS program will help Turkey achieve the following:

Assuring Turkey’s Future Air Defence Requirements

The chill in Ankara’s ties with Washington is seemingly affecting a growing number of important Turkish defence programs. In fact if Turkey is directly moving to induct a homegrown alternative to the Mk.41 it now seems that more is at risk of supply challenges than only the most sensitive U.S. equipment (such as the Lockheed Martin F-35 or MIM-104 Patriot). Thus strictly relying on the U.S. could raise the risk of not securing key inputs and thus jeopardize Turkey’s workhorse capabilities in the future. The apparent risk of not gaining the Mk.41 would jeopardize Turkey’s sea-based anti-air warfare (AAW) capabilities.

Not only does the MIDLAS give the Turkish Navy its own modern SAM deployment system but it natively pairs with Turkey’s indigenous SAMs like the HİSAR-series and SİPER-series. Reportedly the MIDLAS will also be capable of quad-packing its SAM complement in a single cell. This would make the MIDLAS similar in concept to the Lockheed Martin Mk.41 and MBDA SYLVER.

Together these systems offer a strong starting point for Turkey’s indigenous air defence development.

Basically these programs have enabled Turkey to develop a foundation in rocket motor aerostructures solid fuel and guidance electronics technologies. With additional time and investment it could develop and further evolve these systems. For example a future block or variant of the SİPER will reportedly have a range of over 150 km which will translate into credible land and naval-based AAW. Turkey is also looking at pairing its SAMs with other AAW solutions like directed energy weapons (DEW)…

Worried about a recession in 2023? No wonder. The ""R"" word has been pumped on media outlets as 2022 draws to a close. With inflation still running hot there's worry that what has been a resilient consumer up to this point could finally tighten up on spending and induce an economic downturn.

But even among consumer goods stocks there's a way to play defense: luxury brands. Realistically recessions have a much lower impact on wealthy households so popular high-end goods tend to continue performing pretty well -- especially if the recession is mild as is broadly expected next year. If you're looking to play defense with your consumer discretionary stocks you can put the rich to work in your portfolio and profit.

With that in mind LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY -0.35%) Tapestry (TPR -0.74%) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU 0.00%) are three luxury stocks that could thrive even if a recession strikes in 2023.

LVMH: Good news for the world's largest house of luxury brands

The world's largest luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton was already having a pretty decent 2022. Through the first nine months of the year revenue across all five of its segments (wine and spirits fashion and leather perfumes and cosmetics watches and jewelry and selective retailing) grew at a strong double-digit pace. Overall sales jumped 28% compared to 2021 to 56.5 billion euros a new record as LVMH's 75 ""maisons"" fully recovered from pandemic lockdowns and then some.

In a sign of just how well things have been going LVMH co-founder and CEO Bernard Arnault and family have retaken the ""world's richest person"" spot from Elon Musk according to the Forbe's Billionaire List.

Will the good times keep strutting down the runway for LVMH though? It seems they certainly could in part because of a development in Asia. After social unrest China is ending parts of its ""zero-COVID"" policy a strict set of rules that have sunk the most populous country's economy. Not incidentally China is the second-largest market for luxury goods accounting for tens of billions of dollars in spending in normal times. There's optimism that some normalcy might be coming back.

As of this writing LVMH stock trades for 26 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. If double-digit sales and earnings growth continue -- and according to management's commentary they could -- it isn't an unreasonable price tag.

Tapestry: An American luxury icon making a comeback

I'll admit I used to follow Tapestry -- the parent organization of Coach Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman -- much more closely. But it fell off my radar as Coach (the original corporate name before the rebrand to Tapestry) had a messy go of things integrating its acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman (2015) and Kate Spade (2017). Shares have underperformed the market as a result.

Tapestry has rebounded nicely from an early pandemic slump though and sales are actually at all-time highs. For fiscal 2023 management is expecting a slight decline off of these highs due to a record run-up in the U.S. dollar (which lowers the value of international sales when converted back into dollars for financial reporting).

However in spite of this challenge earnings per share are expected to rise in the mid-single-digit percentage range this year helped by an estimated $700 million in share repurchases. And much like LVMH Coach will also see some lift if China's zero-COVID policies help the economy recover again.

In all this iconic American leather designer is in decent shape right now. And while earnings growth may not be much to show off to your friends Tapestry stock looks cheap at less than 12 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. Who knew a leather handbag (stock) could be so affordable? If you're looking for a solid luxury retailer to help weather challenging times Tapestry could be your ticket.

Lululemon: Part luxury part everyday comfort for the active enthusiast

Perhaps Lululemon doesn't spring to mind as a house of ""luxury."" Yet I'd argue luxury is more than price (though a pair of women's yoga leggings are easily over $100 but I digress). Luxury is about comfort as much as it is a symbol of how much money can be blown on superfluous items. And in that department Lululemon excels.

The blend of high-end activewear and comfort is clearly winning over fans. To wit Lululemon just released Q3 2022 earnings and revenue was up a sizzling 28% year-over-year driven by an impressive 22% increase in comparable sales (a blend of foot and web traffic and average customer ticket). International revenue jumped 41% in the quarter as Lululemon stretches its reach outside of its core North American market. China's reopening could help this metric continue running hot too.

One of my favorite things about Lululemon's business model though is its robust profit margins. Its Q3 operating margin was 19%. A typical clothing retailer is doing well if it puts up high-single-digit or low-teens operating margins. Often running close to or over 20% in recent years Lululemon's lucrative profitability is further proof this is a luxury brand at heart -- but one finding more mass appeal.

The shares did take a slight dip after the last earnings update due to weaker-than-expected Q4 guidance. Management thinks revenue will increase ""only"" 25% year-over-year. This is likely just a cool down as the stock has rallied more than 20% the last couple of months. Lululemon currently trades for 37 times expected adjusted earnings per share for 2022 a premium price tag. But for a company that has consistently grown as fast as this one the last few years it could be a worthwhile purchase here.

Recession or not Lululemon is clearly doing something right that's resonating with its patrons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uL2FmaXRuZS1mbGFyZS1sZWdnaW5ncy1zYWxlLWFtYXpvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Flare Leggings on Sale at Amazon Are a Lululemon Dupe,"If you've been online at all in the past year you've probably seen flared leggings coming back after their reign in the mid-aughts (except we called them yoga pants then).

These highly reviewed flared leggings from Amazon have over 4700 five-star ratings from shoppers who consider them an ""amazing dupe"" for more expensive pairs. Even better? There's a double discount on the leggings so you can score them for 50 percent off.

Made with ""buttery soft material"" it's easy to see why shoppers love them so much. The high-waisted silhouette is accentuated by a wide lined waistband that lays flat against the stomach but remains comfortable thanks to its ultra-soft four-way-stretch fabric. They can be worn for workouts too given that the material has moisture-wicking properties.

And you don't have to worry about any sheerness as you move throughout the day as shoppers testify that this pair is ""non-see-through"" and ""perfect"" for their daily activities and exercise. Yoga pants were made with your next Vinyasa flow in mind after all.

Reviewers say these leggings are almost a dead ringer for a Lululemon pair but this discounted style offers two waistband pockets — one in the front and one in the back — that are ideal for storing your keys and phone (the back pouch is zippered) for hands-free wear.

And if you're interested in taking a detour from the classic black yoga pants there's a bevy of other colors available like khaki maroon and dark olive and there's even a cropped style to really throw it back to the late 2000s.

Scroll down to grab a few extra pairs of these flare leggings in some fun colors and lengths while they're marked down so you can stroll the streets in the Jenner-approved style.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now.

If you’re in the market for fashion stocks then NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) should be at the top of your list.

It’s been a volatile few years for the apparel and fashion industry as a whole and its companies’ share prices in particular. Sales at clothing and accessories stores sank by 26% year-over-year in 2020 as pandemic lockdowns across the globe shuttered stores and kept people lounging around in their sweats at home.

After a year of barely updating their wardrobes consumers went crazy catching up for lost time in 2021 as societies reopened and people began socializing again. Sales jumped by 60% during the first nine months of 2021 and continued to be strong through the first half of this year.

Another slowdown for the industry appears to be underway now however with inflation and depressed consumer sentiment driving fashion sales into negative territory in the second half of this year. McKinsey predicts that the industry will grow by about 2-3% during 2023 primarily due to solid sustained growth in the luxury fashion market which is expected to grow between 5-10%.

That’s not surprising given that luxury retailers and other sellers of high-priced goods tend to weather economic storms better thanks to their focus on the wealthy consumer who isn’t as affected by economic downturns.

The fashion market is expected to be strong in both China and the United States growing by as much 6% or 7% in each country while an energy crisis in Europe is expected to lead to a 1% to 4% downturn for the fashion market in that region next year.

As cash-strapped consumers more carefully consider their clothing options the rise of secondhand apparel is becoming apparent and represents another challenge for apparel brands and retailers. The secondhand market is expected to grow by 24% to $119 billion this year and to reach $218 billion in sales by 2026. Meanwhile the broader apparel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% through 2026 hitting $843 billion and those projections might be somewhat optimistic.

The secondhand trend is particularly pronounced in North America where secondhand apparel has been outgrowing the broader apparel market by a staggering 700%. In response some fashion brands are beginning to launch their own resale initiatives to bring some of that market back within their own ecosystem.

Story continues

All told it could be a lean year or two for some or even many fashion companies and their corresponding shares which makes pinpointing only the best fashion stocks to buy now a priority for investors interested in the space. We’ll do that in this article using the smart money sentiment as our guide to which fashion stocks are likely to perform well in the years to come.

11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now

Our Methodology

The following fashion stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.

All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.

11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 15

Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) rank among the top five best fashion stocks to buy right now. Just cracking the list in 11th is Tilly’s Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) which sells apparel and accessories geared towards kids and teens.

Hedge fund ownership of Tilly’s Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) peaked in the third quarter of 2018 and has declined by 33% since. It did tick up during Q3 of this year however as multiple funds opened small stakes in the company. Among them were Israel Englander’s Millennium Management and Frederick Disanto’s Ancora Advisors.

Tilly’s Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) was a big beneficiary of the pandemic but has struggled to match up against those tougher comps in 2022. The third quarter wasn’t great but the company did perform better than both it and the market expected pulling in $178 million in revenue and $0.17 per share in earnings both of which beat estimates. Comparable net sales in Q4 had declined by 18.5% through November 29 compared to the year-ago period.

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17

Hedge funds bailed on Guess’ Inc. (NYSE:GES) in droves during the first quarter as there was a 41% decline in the number of smart money managers long the stock. There was a slight rebound in Q2 as Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies and Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital were among the funds to add GES to their 13F portfolios.

Guess’ Inc. (NYSE:GES) has hung in there somewhat better than Tilly’s this year growing Q3 sales by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis thanks to continued strong performance in Europe. The jeans and apparel maker’s operating margin stood at 8.6% in Q3 down from 14.1% a year earlier though company expects that figure to rebound to 13.2% in Q4 on an adjusted basis.

Guess’ Inc. (NYSE:GES) is undergoing several initiatives to improve its customer acquisition and retention efforts as well as its marketing capabilities. Chief among them is the company’s Customer 360 platform some of which has already been implemented in Europe with promising results. Guess has also been growing its digital business including its data analytics capabilities.

9. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22

There’s been a 29% drop in the number of hedge funds long Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) over the past two quarters with the stock hitting a ten-year low in smart money ownership as a result. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates sold off its stake in RL during Q3 while Arrowstreet Capital founded by Peter Rathjens Bruce Clarke and John Campbell held the largest long position consisting of 801348 shares.

Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) could be poised for a good holiday season if demand trends for the high-end fashion retailer are strong as the company significantly bolstered its inventory ahead of the fourth quarter to stave off any potential supply chain challenges. High-end retailers tend to perform better during economic downturns due to their wealthier clientele being less affected by the conditions of the day which the company appears to be banking on.

There are some troubling signs in the company’s recent results however which may be why hedge funds have been bailing on the stock. Ralph Lauren grew sales by 13% in its Q1 of fiscal 2023 but sales growth slowed to 5% year-over-year in its fiscal Q2. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)’s bottom line has also been getting pinched due to rising cost of goods sold which jumped by 14% in fiscal Q2 dwarfing the company’s sales growth. That contributed to earnings falling to $2.23 per share compared to $2.62 a year earlier despite the company having also bought back over 6 million shares or about 8.4% of its outstanding float prior to those purchases.

8. Victorias Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24

Hedge funds showed noteworthy interest in Victorias Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO) during its first quarter on the market as a publicly traded company following its separation from Bath & Body Works Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) in Q3 of 2021. That interest has waned considerably in the four quarters since however as there’s been a drop in hedge fund ownership of VSCO during each of those quarters.

The lingerie retailer was spun off in part so a new management team could take charge and help turn around the struggling company which suffered a major sales drop during its fiscal 2020 year. Victorias Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO)’s gross margins have trailed its peers by a wide margin (pardon the pun?) which is something management has been focused on improving with some success but more work remains to be done.

Victorias Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO)‘s Q3 comparable sales slumped by 11% year-over-year with the company pulling in $1.32 billion in sales in line with estimates. The retailer’s EPS of $0.29 topped estimates by a healthy $0.06 and also came in ahead of the company’s own guidance. Cowen analyst Jonna Kim has a $45 price target and ‘Outperform’ rating on VSCO shares. The analyst believes the company’s sales will remain pressured in the near-term but that longer-term it has a good opportunity to regain share in the U.S. and grow internationally.

T-6. Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25

Ownership of Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey sank to a nine-year low during the second quarter but rebounded big time during Q3 shooting up by nearly 50%. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group and Andrew Kurita’s Kettle Hill Capital Management were two of the funds to add HBI to their 13F portfolios during Q3.

Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) shares have trended down throughout the year losing 63% of their value which may have prompted some funds to go bargain hunting. The clothing and undergarments manufacturer has been facing several challenges in recent quarters including tighter inventory management among retailers and rising costs. Sales slumped by 7% year-over-year in Q3 sliding to $1.67 billion while adjusted net income fared far worse tumbling by 46% to $102 million. The company’s guidance for the holiday season also came in well below estimates with projections for as little as $1.4 billion in sales and $0.04 in adjusted EPS compared to $1.63 billion and $0.21 estimates respectively.

Chartwell Investment Partners shared some of the challenges that Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) has faced of late in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:

“The three worst-performing stocks in the Dividend Equity accounts includes Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI 1.1%) down 30.1%. Hanesbrands’ management is executing well but the challenging environment includes supply-chain headwinds higher input costs and some post-Covid inventory build-up.”

T-6. The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25

Hedge funds were adding The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) to their portfolio in the first year of the pandemic but many unloaded the stock during the third quarter of 2021. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management owns the largest GPS position among the funds tracked by our database while Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management built a large stake in the company during Q3.

The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) was another fashion stock trading at bargain bin prices heading into Q4 but the stock has enjoyed a nice resurgence this quarter gaining 76%. As noted above high-end products tend to perform better than their counterparts during economic slowdowns and that’s been evident at The Gap. A strong performance from the company’s Banana Republic brand which grew comparable sales by 10% during Q3 was driven in part by the brand’s wider range of premium items.

The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS)’s core brand also swung to 4% comparable sales growth after two quarters of double digit declines. All told The Gap grew sales by 2% to $4.04 billion during Q3 which beat estimates. It was also far more profitable than analysts expected pulling in $0.71 per share on an adjusted basis against expectations of neutral earnings.

One of Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) and NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is the top fashion stock to buy. See which one earns that title by clicking the link below.

Such was the case last month when the Manhattanite 56 touched down in the City of Angels to give Page Six an exclusive tour of her $13.4 million listing in Malibu.

But before walking us through the expansive James Bond-esque property Bensimon wanted to show us how she spends a day in LA.

From catching up over coffee at her favorite hotel to luxurious facials from her go-to stem cell specialist to sipping trendy smoothies the model-turned-mogul gave us an inside look at life in the fab lane.

“I’m so excited for your to see my LA” Bensimon tells Page Six as the day kicks off. “Let’s go!”

Chic stay

Sunset Marquis 1200 Alta Loma Rd. West Hollywood Calif. 20069

Bensimon always likes to stay at the iconic Sunset Marquis Hotel which became a favorite of hers during the height of her modeling career in the ‘80s and ‘90s.

“I used to run into Bono from U2 and Elton John! This really was the place to be. And it still is! It’s very nostalgic but feels chic and new at the same time” she says over coffee in one of the hotel’s many lush outdoor spaces.

“I’ve always stayed here.”

The reality star says she spent a few nights at the Sunset Marquis during Oscars weekend in March during which she felt particularly glamorous. “I was walking down the stairs in my long red dress and I was like ‘This reminds me of when I was younger’” she says. “And it was fun!”

Benismon notes she feels like a “different person” in LA versus New York City.

“Listen I love New York and I’ve lived there for so many years. I raised my girls there” she says. “But just the quality of life is different and people are just friendly.”

When she’s in town Bensimon loves catching up with her good pal and “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Sutton Stracke.

“I’m really good friends with Sutton. I love Sutton so much. I love her because she is genuinely interested and a great mom and a really good friend” she shares adding that she “just met Kyle [Richards]” this year too.

Asked if she’d ever consider moving to LA for a role on “RHOBH” Bensimon played coy. “Anything could happen!” she says with a laugh. “Who knows?”

Fabulous facials

Nathan Newman M.D. 9301 Wilshire Blvd #303 Beverly Hills Calif. 90120

Bensimon says her “first stop” in LA is always the Beverly Hills office of plastic surgeon Dr. Nathan Newman — a pioneer in stem cell therapy — who is renowned for his stem cell facials.

“These stem [cell] facials are unbelievable. I’m serious my skin has never looked better” she says. “The stem really hydrates my skin and is removing some of the wrinkles not all of them.”

Bensimon loves that the procedure hydrates her face rather than freezing it like other noninvasive cosmetic procedures. “I’m like ‘Listen I spent a long time smiling. Do not take away those memories’” she says giving fine lines and wrinkles a sweet rebrand.

12 Bensimon introduced us to Dr. Newman who gave us one of his famous skincare treatments.

After being introduced to Dr. Newman he told me to get ready for a “facial like [I’ve] never had before” — and he was right. It was transformative.

The relaxing hourlong treatment — which uses his plant-based stem cell serums — gave my skin an instant refresh and dewy glow.

Bensimon says she relies on Dr. Nathan whenever she finds herself in an epidermal crisis.

“My first [stem cell facial] was literally right after BravoCon [2023]” she recalls. “I was exhausted and so I came to Dr. Nathan Newman and I was like ‘I am so haggard. I’m feeling like not myself I’m feeling like totally someone else.’ And I had the facial and I’m telling you I was just like ‘Woah.’”

Trendy treats

Erewhon 339 N. Beverly Dr. Beverly Hills Calif. 90210

As Angelenos are well aware Erewhon is the grocery store to the stars — including Bensimon — so we made a visit to the Beverly Hills outpost.

“I started going to Erewhon because my oldest daughter [Sea Louise] was like ‘You have got to try these smoothies they are over the top’” she says of the 26-year-old’s assessment of the Erewhon’s tentpole creations.

12 We made a stop at Erewhon where Bensimon loves to fuel up on their smoothies.

Celebrities like Hailey Bieber Winnie Harlow Sofia Richie Molly Simms and Dr. Paul Nassif have signature smoothies on the menu but Bensimon prefers to procure her own blend.

For the both of us she ordered smoothies packed with greens greek yogurt and cayenne pepper that she raved would “jumpstart our metabolisms” as swimsuit season approaches.

Yes please!

‘Real Housewife’ of real estate

21056 Las Flores Mesa Dr. Malibu Calif. 90265

Bensimon — a broker with Douglas Elliman who has sold hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate since obtaining her license as an agent in 2019 — was particularly thrilled to explore her seaside listing at 21056 Las Flores Mesa Dr. with Page Six in tow.

“I just feel like this is a beautiful beautiful property. It has heritage it’s in Malibu Calif. it’s one of a kind” she says of the 3-bedroom 3-bathroom manse designed by celebrated architect Harry Gesner and built in 1997.

12 “It’s very ‘007’ very cinematic” the Bravolebrity raves. Page Six

12 She even showed us the furnished airstream outside — where she also took a break to sing an original tune inspired by the palatial property.

“He’s known for the wood and also the brick. He loves that juxtaposition. It’s very ‘007’ very cinematic” she elaborates acknowledging that the owners’ interior design choices were inspired by their love of the “James Bond” films.

Bensimon also points out the “stunning views” of the Pacific Ocean visible through the home’s cathedral-like windows from the pool and even from a furnished airstream located in the backyard.

“For me real estate just resonates so much because I love art and architecture so much” she tells Page Six. “My favorite part of the job outside of the aesthetic is making sure that my clients have what they need and what they want. That is very rewarding.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS91a3JhaW5lLWhpbWFycy11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWFpZC1wYWNrYWdlLXJ1c3NpYS13YXItMTg5OTU2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ukraine Gets HIMARS Boost in New $400M U.S. Package,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-himars-united-states-military-aid-package-russia-war-1899566 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS91a3JhaW5lLWhpbWFycy11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWFpZC1wYWNrYWdlLXJ1c3NpYS13YXItMTg5OTU2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM4OTIvdmVyaXpvbi10bW9iaWxlLWF0dC11bmxpbWl0ZWQtcGxhbi1mcmVlLXBob25lLW9mZmVycy1maW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile's “unlimited” plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist,"Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile will pay a combined $10.22 million to a group of states to settle claims that the carriers lied to customers about their “unlimited” plans and “free” phone offers. The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Michael Jordan card could fetch $5M at auction: Ken Goldin reveals '100 best collectibles',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.foxbusiness.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /lifestyle/rare-michael-jordan-card-could-fetch-5m-auction-ken-goldin-reveals-100-best-collectibles (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B0113E28F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Even after filing a police report and spending hours on the phone with Walmart customer service Hassan Gerami 77 and Maliheh Banej Shafiei 72 still owed more than $4000 on their Walmart Rewards Mastercard.

""I am so upset with Walmart"" Banej Shafiei told CBC Toronto.

The amount includes a $29 fee the couple was charged because whoever stole the card went over its $3500 limit.

Walmart has said it has spoken with the couple and is in contact with the company that issued their card but with payment on their card statement due on Monday frustration boiled over for the residents of Richmond Hill about 37 kilometres north of Toronto.

""I say to all the people: don't buy or shop in Walmart"" Banej Shafiei said.

On Friday shortly after CBC Toronto reported on the couple's ordeal a spokesperson for Walmart Canada said the issue was resolved. The couple confirmed the company had agreed to reverse the charges within 48 hours — bringing to an end their nearly month-long struggle.

Card stolen at Richmond Hill Walmart

The ordeal began on Nov. 14. After spending about half an hour shopping at the Walmart Supercentre on Major Mackenzie Drive Banej Shafiei says she got to the register and realized her wallet was missing.

From there the pair quickly reported the credit card stolen. They filed a police report.

At first it seemed the damage wasn't that bad. After spending about an hour on the phone with Walmart Mastercard customer service Germani was told the card was only used once for a charge of $258.

But about a week later their credit card statement arrived in the mail.

""I received the monthly bill and I was really shocked because I was charged $4117"" Gerami said.

Whoever stole the card managed to make 16 purchases all at Walmart. The card's tap function was used so no PIN number or signature was required.

""Tapping one after another. They cannot stop these people"" Gerami said. ""It is shocking and it is not safe for elderly people to use Walmart Rewards Mastercard.""

Customer service concerns

Since getting the statement the couple tried desperately to get the charges cancelled.

They sent the police report to the company. It had to be faxed to Walmart which required Gerami to make two trips to a Staples store because he says Walmart provided the wrong fax number.

And they've spent hours on the phone with Walmart Mastercard customer service. But they said it was difficult to get solutions or useful information and they felt they were mostly being read scripts by call centre operators.

""When you go on the phone with Walmart Rewards Mastercard they keep you on the phone. It goes on the music and it goes on other stuff"" Gerami said.

""And then they disconnect. They don't give us right answer."".

At the time a spokesperson for Walmart Canada told CBC Toronto that the company was aware of the issue and had spoken with Gerami and Banej Shafiei. In an email the spokesperson said the credit card was issued by Fairstone and that Walmart was in touch with the financial provider.

Seniors advocate surprised

Bill VanGorder with the Canadian Association of Retired Persons (CARP) says he's surprised at how long the couple's situation took to get resolved and that credit cards are usually quick to cancel fraudulent purchases.

""I've never heard of a credit card company not standing behind this if the individuals did everything they could to protect their card.""

Bill VanGorder the chief operating officer and chief policy officer of CARP says he's 'never heard of a credit card company not standing behind this if the individuals did everything they could to protect their card.' (CARP)

VanGorder says several years ago CARP raised concerns to credit card companies about the security risks and lack of consumer protection with the tap function on cards. He says they were told in these cases victims of theft or fraud would not have to pay.

""We were told very strongly that if your card gets stolen through no fault of your own and gets used they will stand behind it and that's the protection.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vdmlkZW8vbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1zb3VuZHMtYS1jbGFyaW9uLWNhbGwtZm9yLXdvbWVucy1jcmlja2V0LzQ4MjU4NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard sounds a clarion call for women's cricket | Advertising,"Mastercard and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have rolled out a campaign through which it urges viewers to not take women cricketers lightly ahead of India's T20 series against Australia.

Morocco shocked the 2016 European champion 1-0 and became the first African country ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.

And CR7? Have we seen the last big match of the football icon for his national team? The 37-year-old leaves Qatar without the coveted trophy.

Portugal made the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup and were hoping to do better this time around but it was not meant to be despite having enough opportunities to score against Morocco's defensive wall

Portugal never found their rhythm and flair which they displayed in the round of 16.

Portugal hammered Switzerland 6-1 with CR7 starting that game on the bench. He came on in the 73rd minute for Gonçalo Ramos who scored a hattrick. Pepe Raphaël Guerreiro and Rafael Leão added a goal each.

The Portuguese began their chase for their first ever title with a 3-2 win over Ghana then defeated Uruguay 2-0 confirming their slot in the round of 16 before losing 1-2 to the Republic of Korea in group play.

The Qatar campaign of the 'Three Lions' ended in tears on Saturday evening (10 December) after Gareth Southgate's side suffered a 2-1 quarter-final loss to defending champion France.

England's captain Harry Kane was the tragic hero of the night as his late penalty miss in the 84th minute proved costly.

Aurelien Tchouameni gave France the early lead (17') but Kane brought his team back converting a penalty in the 54th minute to equal Wayne Rooney's England record of 53 goals.

Olivier Giroud made it 2-1 for the French (78') before Kane had the chance to make history but his second penalty of the evening flew over the top. The English players were in disbelief.

They beat Senegal with ease 3-0 in the round of 16 on Sunday (4 December) to set up this clash with France after a convincing performance in the group stage. .

England made a stunning start to their Qatar 2022 adventure by running roughshod over the Islamic Republic of Iran with a 6-2 victory in their opening match. Midfielder Bukayo Saka spearheaded the goal fest celebrating his World Cup debut with a brace.

The 1966 World Cup winners held off a strong challenge from a tenacious U.S. team to walk away with a point after a goalless draw cementing their position at the top of their group.

Their 3-0 victory over Wales on Tuesday (29 November) sent them through to the knock out rounds.

The 'Three Lions' were hoping to win their first World Cup title since 1966. Ranked among the top-five teams in the world England reached the semi-finals in Russia 2018 and the Euro 2020 final last year but they are forced to wait for the next major trophy. .

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Redevelopment of the factory has stalled while the owner of the property appeals limits set by city council. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

There are concerns over this former east London factory as redevelopment plans have stalled Duration 0:56 Once a bustling confectionary factory the former McCormick building is now an eyesore that is dangerous for people going in to strip out any metal that can be sold for cash and youth looking for an urban exploring thrill.

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The fence that's supposed to keep people out of the crumbling factory is not very effective. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said. ""The neighbours just want it taken down.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9iaWctc2hvZXMtdG8tZmlsbC1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stdGFsa3Mtd2VhcmluZy1kYXZpZC1kZWNhc3Ryb3Mtbm8tNjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Big Shoes To Fill:' Mason McCormick Talks Wearing No. 66,"Though he’s been a Steeler for barely two weeks Mason McCormick knows the reputation that comes along with his new jersey number. Wearing No. 66 David DeCastro’s and Alan Faneca’s old numbers McCormick told reporters he’s fully aware of the legacy he’s replacing. At least in number.

“I have heard a little bit about it” he told reporters via Steelers.com when asked about his jersey digits. “I heard I got some big shoes to fill. And that’s super exciting.”

McCormick clearly isn’t backing away from the expectations. More similar to Troy Fautanu DeCastro was the team’s first-round pick in 2012 going lower in the draft than projections and the last West Coast college prospect the team had taken in the first round prior to Fautanu. After battling injury as a rookie DeCastro turned into one of the NFL’s best guards a six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro before ankle problems shortened his career. Faneca came before both of them a first round pick and Hall of Famer even if his call to Canton took longer than it should’ve.

A punishing run blocker with tons of experience McCormick didn’t get his phone call until early on Day 3 the team’s fourth round pick. While McCormick will keep his goals high expectations out of the gate are lower than they were for DeCastro. Pittsburgh’s starting guards of James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are set in stone entering the spring meaning McCormick is set to begin the year as a backup.

But o-line depth is valuable and can be quickly tested. Pittsburgh has been incredibly fortunate to avoid serious or multiple offensive line injuries the past two seasons but sheer law of averages suggests that luck will run out. That could push McCormick into a role sooner than expected.

“I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get on the field” he said. “I’ll play either guard spot center whatever it takes. I just want to help this organization in any way I can.”

That could include reps at center. McCormick noted he was the backup center in college and had South Dakota State’s starter gotten hurt he would’ve shifted over. Pittsburgh worked him out as such shortly before the draft and though Zach Frazier’s selection makes him a clear favorite to start the Steelers like to make their backups as versatile as possible. Friday McCormick played right guard and the Steelers will likely have him work at guard this spring before considering center come training camp."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2ktd2F0Y2hlZC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWNob29zZS1iZXR3ZWVuLWEtc2NyZWVuLWFuZC1hLWh1bWFuLWl0LXdhcy1zdGFydGxpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I watched McDonald's customers choose between a screen and a human. It was startling,"SOPA Images/Getty Images

Sometimes I end up performing research without knowing it. Or even wanting to.

Not your actual scientific kind you understand. Just the kind that ends up illuminating my world in unexpected ways.

Here I was the other day at Lisbon Airport Terminal 2 and suddenly hunger attacked.

In the near distance was one of society's foremost culinary sanctuaries McDonald's. So while my wife went to get something healthy I succumbed to experiencing the joys of a Portuguese Big Mac and of course fries.

There were six large screens on which you could order. All were occupied so I sauntered to the counter where a very nice man quickly punched in my needs. The food arrived quickly some might say disturbingly quickly.

Also: 5 must-have devices for work travel now

Then I sat down and observed the flow of humans coursing toward their red-and-yellow beacon.

The screens had an advantage. They were placed nearer to the aisle where people were walking. Ergo many gravitated immediately toward them.

Most tapped with confidence. None in the hour that I sat there seemed to have any trouble navigating these vast quasi-iPads.

My utterly unscientific estimate was that for every customer who ordered at the counter there were 30 who chose the screens.

Are the screens necessarily quicker? I really don't know. At the counter you look up at the menu speak to a human and then pay. On the screen you have to do a little scrolling a little tapping a little waiting and then pay.

It seemed clear though that the enormous majority of humans believed the screens would give them swifter satisfaction.

Also: Mushroom meat and robot chefs: Chipotle's vision for fast food

I hear you grumble that it was only older people who wafted to the counter. It wasn't. There was absolutely no age bias that I could see.

What was however curious was that of those who chose to go to the counter the overwhelming majority were men. Men who were on their own and men who were in groups.

Perhaps they had special orders that they thought a screen couldn't handle. Perhaps they didn't want anyone to see how much they were ordering or what. It couldn't be that they found the screens intimidating surely.

Watching humanity in action making natural choices -- or rather choices that felt natural to them -- is entirely absorbing.

If you order via a screen though the amount of human interaction is limited to someone handing you a tray or a bag and you -- perhaps -- saying ""Thank you.""

Yet this is fast food so the most important thing isn't the human contact. It's the speed governed by the need.

Onscreen ordering is of course merely one facet of fast food's future. For example McDonald's is rolling out robot ordering at the drive-thru.

Also: Amazon teams up with a fast food robot

Yet the company's CEO Chris Kempczinski continues to insist that McDonald's doesn't have a completely robotic future. He recently explained: ""The idea of robots and all those things while it maybe is great for garnering headlines it's not practical in the vast majority of restaurants.""

I fear what he means by practical is in fact profitable.

As with all research I was left with questions. What is it about men and counter ordering? Why don't people see onscreen ordering as innately less hygienic? Won't the future merely entail mobile ordering instead of these big screens?

I suspect though that you're left with only one question: How was my Big Mac?

Honestly it fell apart within seconds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlYWtvZm9oaW8uY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaW5kaWFuLWxha2UtbWNkb25hbGRzLXJlYWR5LXRvLW9wZW4tbW9uZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indian Lake McDonald's ready to open Monday – Peak of Ohio,"By Kris Allen

In 1998 Stacy Vorhees promised herself that she would own a McDonald’s restaurant in 10 years. In March of 2008 that dream became a reality. The next chapter in her story took another step forward at the ribbon cutting of the Indian Lake McDonald’s the culmination of a five-year project.

Vorhees the owner of three other McDonald’s restaurants in the area said that McDonald’s corporate office greenlighted her plans to remodel the store and planning began almost immediately. She indicated that industry standards suggest that restaurants get remodeled after 40 years. This is the last of her stores to be remodeled.

Pointing to new features at the store Vorhees said the kitchen has been expanded and a conveyor belt has been added to the prep area. Other improvements include three drive-thru windows an expanded drive-thru lane ordering kiosks and patio seating in front of the store.

The store posed unique challenges due to the lake frontage and the size of the lot. Coupled with the high standards that McDonald’s demands of its restaurants and her own personal flair she wanted to see in the restaurant it was a true collaborative effort on the part of everyone involved in the process.

She spoke highly of the support she received from local officials during the entire demolition removal and construction time which was approximately 110 days from the beginning of demolition.

Franchise Supervisor Ashley Mack said that as soon as the existing store was closed the employees of the restaurant were moved to different McDonald’s in the area all of which were newer stores. That allowed the employees to begin training on the equipment that they would be using at the Indian Lake store.

Store Manager Austin Miller stated that transportation for the high school-aged employees was arranged so the employees would be able to continue working. Throughout the entire process Miller said every one of the employees that wanted to continue working remained employed with the company.

Prior to the ribbon cutting Vorhees presented Chippewa Outreach Center Director Drew Shick a check for $3000 thanking him for everything that the center does for the community.

MINNEAPOLIS Minnesota — A car crash which initially occurred near 45th Avenue North and Lyndale Avenue North led to the recovery of several firearms and two arrests according to the Minneapolis Police Department. Police said they are still searching for a third person.

The incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when two vehicles collided and one of them drove over the snow-covered grass and into the McDonald’s parking lot striking three other unoccupied vehicles claimed MPD.

""It was a pretty loud bang and all of a sudden I got told to come outside right away"" General Manager Justin Lang said.

Lang's car received minor damage from the crash.

A Minneapolis sergeant who was already inside McDonald’s at the time heard the initial crash and responded to the scene. According to police three people were inside of the suspect vehicle and two of them ran off.

With the assistance of additional officers police detained two juveniles. MPD Chief Brian O’Hara said they are still searching for the third person. Officers also confiscated three firearms and an imitation or toy gun from inside the suspect vehicle.

Chief O’Hara said he believes the suspect vehicle was involved in a robbery of a business further down on Lyndale Avenue earlier Sunday.

""Thankfully all the others responded here quickly and we were able to get these guns off the street before any other robberies or crimes or violence occurred"" Chief O'Hara said.

There were no reported injuries at the scene and no damage was done to the building.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

“An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. Stop. I am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. Stop. Mail is only form of transportation. Stop.”

Dr. Curtis Welch

This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome Alaska to all the major Alaska towns to territorial governor Scott Bone in Juneau and to the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington D.C. Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.

Known as the “Great Race of Mercy” it’s an iconic story of human compassion.

Weather prevented delivery by air so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300000 units of antitoxin which was produced by Merck legacy company H.K. Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.

674 miles 5 days 300000 units

Over 130 years of vaccine leadership In 1895 the H.K. Mulford Company began marketing the first commercially available diphtheria antitoxin in the U.S. the very medication that helped avert the diphtheria epidemic in Nome. Today we have a significant presence in vaccine discovery development and distribution in both human and animal health.

Vaccines are not just for children

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider vaccines to be one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. In the U.S. vaccines are now available for a number of infectious diseases that once routinely affected people. While there are many vaccines available for children it’s important to remember that adults also are susceptible to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.

Each year in the U.S. thousands of adults suffer complications from these diseases. In low- and middle-income countries the toll is even higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L2Jpb3RlY2gtbmV3cy1tZXJjay1qdXVsLXBmaXplci1leWVwb2ludC1uYXNhLXNwYXJrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Readout Newsletter: Merck Pfizer EyePoint and more,"Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

With around 21 million American adolescents on social media parents took note.

Today there are more than 1200 families pursuing lawsuits against social media companies including TikTok Snapchat YouTube Roblox and Meta the parent company to Instagram and Facebook.

More than 150 lawsuits will be moving forward next year. Tonight you'll hear from some of the families suing social media. We want to warn you that some of the content in this story is alarming but we thought it was important to include because parents say the posts impacted their kids' mental health and in some cases helped lead to the death of their children.

Kathleen Spence: They're holding our children hostage and they're seeking and preying on them.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Preying on them?

Kathleen Spence: Yes.

The Spence family is suing social media giant Meta. Kathleen and Jeff Spence say Instagram led their daughter Alexis into depression and to an eating disorder at the age of 12.

Kathleen Spence: We realized that we were slowly losing her. We really had no comprehension to how severe social media had affected our daughter. She was being drawn into this hidden space and this dark world.

Kathleen and Jeff Spence

It began after the spences both middle school teachers from Long Island New York gave 11-year-old Alexis a cell phone to keep in touch with them after school.

Kathleen Spence: We had very strict rules from the moment she had the phone. The phone was never allowed in the room at night. We would keep the phone in the hall.

Jeff Spence: We checked the phone. We put restrictions on the phone.

Alexis Spence: I would wait for my parents to fall asleep and then I would just sit in the hallway or I would sneak my phone in my room. I wasn't allowed to use a lot of apps and they had a lot of the parental controls on.

Sharyn Alfonsi: And so how quickly did you figure out a way around the restrictions?

Alexis Spence: Pretty quickly.

Hoping to connect and keep up with friends Alexis joined Instagram. Instagram policy mandates users are 13 years old. Alexis was 11.

Sharyn Alfonsi: I thought you had to be 13?

Alexis Spence: It asks you ""Are you 13 years or older?"" I checked the box ""yes"" and then just kept going.

Sharyn Alfonsi: And there was never any checks?

Alexis Spence: No. No verification or anything like that.

Sharyn Alfonsi: If I had picked up your phone would I have seen the Instagram app on there?

Alexis Spence: No. There were apps that you could use to disguise it as another app. So you could download like a calculator 'calculator' but it's really Instagram.

Jeff Spence: There was always some work-around.

Sharyn Alfonsi: She was outwitting you.

Jeff Spence: Right she was outwitting us.

Kathleen Spence: She was addicted to social media. We couldn't stop it. It was much bigger than us.

Alexis Spence

Now 20 Alexis says an innocent search on Instagram for fitness routines led her into a dark world.

Alexis Spence: It started as like fitness stuff. And then I guess that would spark the algorithm to show me diets it then started to shift into eating disorders.

Sharyn Alfonsi: What were you seeing?

Alexis Spence: People would post photos of themselves who are very sickly or just very thin and using them to promote eating disorders.

Some of the images that were sent to Alexis through Instagram's algorithms

These are some of the images that were sent to Alexis through Instagram's algorithms – which process the user's browsing history and personal data then push content to them they never directly asked for.

Sharyn Alfonsi: What did you learn from looking at these pro-anorexic websites?

Alexis Spence: A lot. Learning about diet pills and how to lose weight when you're 11 and going through puberty and like your body is supposed to be changing. It's hard.

Sharyn Alfonsi: When did that stop being something that you looked at and start being something that you were doing to yourself?

Alexis Spence: Within months.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Did it normalize it for you? Did you think ""Oh well other people are doing this""?

Alexis Spence: Yeah. Definitely. Like they needed help. I needed help. And instead of getting help I was getting advice on how to continue.

By the time she was 12 Alexis had developed an eating disorder. She had multiple Instagram accounts and says she would spend five hours a day scrolling through the app even though it often made her feel depressed.

She drew this picture of herself in her diary crying surrounded by her phone and laptop with thoughts reading 'stupid fat...kill yourself.'

Alexis Spence: I was struggling with my mental health. I was struggling with my depression and my body image. And social media did not help with my confidence. And if anything it made me like hate myself.

It all came to a head her sophomore year when Alexis posted on Instagram that she didn't deserve to exist. A friend alerted a school counselor.

Kathleen Spence: That was the scariest day of our lives. I got a call to come to the school. And I went there and they were just showing me all of these Instagram posts of how Alexis wanted to kill herself and hurt herself. And if Instagram is really -- has all the software to protect them why was that not flagged? Why was that not identified?

This previously unpublished internal document reveals Facebook knew Instagram was pushing girls to dangerous content.

It says that in 2021 an Instagram employee ran an internal investigation on eating disorders by opening up a false account as a 13-year-old girl looking for diet tips. She was led to content and recommendations to follow 'skinny binge' and 'apple core anorexic.'

Other memos show Facebook employees raising concerns about company research that revealed Instagram made 1-in-3 teen girls feel worse about their bodies and that teens who used the app felt higher rates of anxiety and depression.

Sharyn Alfonsi: What was it like when you saw those Facebook papers for the first time?

Kathleen Spence: Sickening. The fact that I was sitting there struggling and hoping to save my daughter's life. And they had all these documents behind closed doors that they could've protected her. And they chose to ignore that research.

Attorney Matt Bergman represents the Spence family. He started the Social Media Victims Law Center after reading the Facebook papers and is now working with more than 1200 families who are pursuing lawsuits against social media companies like Meta.

Matt Bergman: Time and time again when they have an opportunity to choose between safety of our kids and profits they always choose profits.

Matt Bergman

Next year Bergman and his team will start the discovery process for the federal case against Meta and other social media companies a multi-million dollar suit that he says is more about changing policy than financial compensation.

Bergman spent 25 years as a product liability attorney specializing in absestos and mesothelioma cases. He argues the design of social media platforms is ultimately hurting kids.

Matt Bergman: They have intentionally designed a product that is addictive. They understand that if children stay online they make more money. It doesn't matter how harmful the material is.

Sharyn Alfonsi: So the fact that these kids ended up seeing the things that they saw that were so disturbing wasn't by accident; it was by design?

Matt Bergman: Absolutely. This is not a coincidence.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Isn't it the parents' job to monitor this stuff?

Matt Bergman: Well of course it is. I'm all for parental responsibility. But these products are explicitly designed to evade parental authority.

Sharyn Alfonsi: So what needs to be done?

Matt Bergman: Number one is age and identity verification. You know that technology exists. You know if people are trying to hook up on Tinder there's technology to make sure that the people are who they say they are. Number two would be turn off the algorithms. You know there's no reason why Alexis Spence who was interested in exercise should have been directed toward anorexic content. Number three would be warnings so that parents know what's going on. Let's be realistic you're never gonna have social media platforms be 100% safe. But you know these changes would make them safer.

Right now the Roberts family says social media is not safe for kids. Englyn Roberts was the baby in a large family the center of her parents Toney and Brandy's world.

Toney Roberts: She made every day...

Brandy Roberts: Special.

Toney Roberts: Every day felt like Christmas here.

Toney and Brandy Roberts

But Englyn's life online told a different story. As the pandemic played out Englyn wrote about struggles with self-worth relationships and mental health.

One August night in 2020 just a few hours after Toney and Brandy kissed their 14-year-old smiling daughter goodnight Brandy received a text from a parent of one of Englyn's friends who was worried about Englyn and suggested they check on her.

Toney Roberts: We went upstairs and we checked and her door was locked. That was kinda odd so I took the key from the top and we opened the door and no Englyn. And when I turned around that's when I found her. When you find your child hanging and you are in that moment in disbelief. It's just no way. Not our baby. Not our child. And then ultimately I fault myself.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Why do you fault yourself?

Toney Roberts: Because I'm dad. I'm supposed to know.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Prior to that night you had no idea that she was depressed?

Toney Roberts: Not. Not even close.

Like the Spence family Toney Roberts started connecting the dots after the Facebook papers came out and began digging through his daughter's phone for answers. He found an Instagram post sent to Englyn from a friend.

Toney Roberts: There was a video. And that video was a lady on Instagram pretending to hang herself and that's ultimately what our child did. Cause you ask yourself how did she come up with this idea? And then when I did the research there it was. She saw it on Instagram. It was on her phone.

Brandy Roberts: If that video wasn't sent to her because she copied it she wouldn't have had a way of knowing how to do that certain way of hanging yourself.

Toney and Englyn Roberts

Nearly a year and a half after Englyn's death that hanging video was still circulating on Instagram with at least 1500 views. Toney Roberts says it was taken down in December 2021. The Roberts are suing Meta the parent company to Instagram.

Toney Roberts: If they so call monitor and do things how could it stay on that site? Because part of their policies says they don't allow for self-harm photos videos things of that nature. So who's holding them accountable?

Meta declined our request for an interview but it's global head of safety gave us this statement - telling us ""we want teens to be safe online"" and that Instagram doesn't ""allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders"" and that Meta has improved Instagram's ""age verification technology.""

But when 60 Minutes ran this test two months ago our colleague was able to lie about her age and sign up for Instagram as a 13-year-old with no verifications. We were also able to search for skinny and harmful content. And while a prompt came up asking if we wanted help we instead clicked see posts and easily found content promoting anorexia and self harm -- showing more rigorous change is needed a challenge the Spence and Roberts families are ready for.

Kathleen Spence: We're being gaslighted by the big tech companies that it's our fault. When really what we should be doing as parents is banding together and say ""No. You need to do better. I'm doing everything I can. You need to do better.""

Brandy Roberts: We've lost we've learned but what's gonna stop these companies from continuing to let things happen if they don't change or be forced to make a change?

Toney Roberts: Social media is the silent killer for our children's generation. That's the conclusion I've come to. Why is everyone in power that can help change this why is it not changing quick--enough? If our children are truly our future what's the wait?

RESPONSES FROM META SNAPCHAT AND TIKTOK

Statement from Meta

""We want teens to be safe online. We've developed more than 30 tools to support teens and families including supervision tools that let parents limit the amount of time their teens spend on Instagram and age verification technology that helps teens have age-appropriate experiences. We automatically set teens' accounts to private when they join Instagram and we send notifications encouraging them to take regular breaks. We don't allow content that promotes suicide self-harm or eating disorders and of the content we remove or take action on we identify over 99% of it before it's reported to us. We'll continue to work closely with experts policymakers and parents on these important issues."" - Antigone Davis Vice President Global Head of Safety Meta

Statement from Snapchat Global Head of Platform Safety Jacqueline Beauchere



""The loss of a family member is devastating and our hearts go out to people facing these tragedies no matter the circumstances. We designed Snapchat to be different from traditional social media built around visual messaging between real friends and avoiding the most toxic features that encourage social comparison and can take a toll on mental health. We know that friendships are a critical source of support for young people especially when dealing with mental health challenges and we continue to work with leading experts on in-app tools and resources to support our community – especially those who may be struggling.""

Drew Angerer/Getty Images

Meta employees are posting negative comments about Mark Zuckerberg on anonymous forum Blind.

A software developer said Meta's CEO will ""single-handedly kill"" the company with the metaverse.

The reviews were posted on the day that Meta axed 13% of its workforce and on the following day.

Meta employees are taking aim at Mark Zuckerberg in employee reviews on Blind the anonymous forum.

Some reviews posted on Wednesday – the day Meta laid off 13% of its workforce – are negative although others are more positive. One user likened the layoffs to the ""hunger games"" and another said the Facebook owner had an ""uncertain future.""

Insider surveyed the workplace community app where staff can air their grievances in posts and reviews to see what was being said about Meta and its CEO. Some 44 employee reviews of Meta were posted on Blind on Wednesday and Thursday this week.

""The Metaverse will be our slow death"" one user who called themselves a senior software developer posted on Wednesday. They added: ""Mark Zuckerberg will single-handedly kill a company with the meta-verse.""

Zuckerberg apologized to staff for the need to cut 11000 jobs admitting that he ""got this wrong"".

Blind users must provide their work email email address job title and employer when joining the platform so the company can ""gauge the professional status"" of posters according to its website.

A user's employment is not officially verified however. Blind said it occasionally sent prompts to users to ""re-verify"" their accounts.

Rick Chen head of public relations at Blind told Insider: ""Nearly all of the reviews posted have been written by current employees of the respective companies at the time of writing as people generally cannot access Blind after they are laid off or resign.""

He added: ""The loss of access after an employment change is not immediate.""

Meta employees have posted almost 6000 reviews of the company on Blind since 2020 and it has a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.

A self-described engineer who gave the company five stars listed ""extremely smart and talented coworkers"" as well as ""great culture"" in a list of ""pros"". Posting on the day the layoffs were made they added that ""Zuck is leading this company in the wrong direction"" in their list of ""cons"".

A user who says they are a data scientist said Meta is in ""need of layoffs in executive level"" adding: ""Leadership is having no clue they mistake motion for a progress.""







One person who said they worked in talent acquisition gave Meta a four-star rating on Wednesday. They said it was an ""overall great place to experience"" adding that ""Mark is not afraid to take risks (which is a good and bad thing).""

A poster who says they are a senior technical program manager wrote on Thursday: ""Poor leadership is on track to sink this ship."" They went on to list ""good pay"" perks benefits and talented peers as ""pros"". The ""cons"" included: ""No accountability at and above Director level. VPs and Directors are here to just milk the company without adding any value.""

They added: ""I thought it was a data-driven company but actually it is one man's gut feeling and emotions-driven. Nobody can overwrite his decision.""

Not all Meta employees share the negative view of Zuckerberg however. One former staff member who was laid off Wednesday told Insider that they felt the CEO handled the layoffs ""with humanity"".

Another engineer gave the company just one star on Wednesday and described the mass cuts as the ""worst layoff in history."" They said: ""With the layoff I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there until the stock price fully recovers.""

Rent Out Land in the Metaverse.,"Investors can now earn rent from parcels of digital land in the metaverse.

When most investors think about earning passive income with crypto they immediately think of staking. But there are a variety of other ways to generate passive income especially if you are active in virtual metaverse worlds such as Decentraland (MANA -0.50%). In early December Decentraland formally introduced a new passive-income option that might appeal to metaverse users: virtual-property renting for owners of digital land.

In other words if you already own digital land in the virtual world of Decentraland you can now rent it to others who might want to set up a short-term presence in the metaverse perhaps for festivals product launches or community events. It's an interesting concept because it works similarly to real-world property renting which has always been a popular source of passive income. So is this metaverse-inspired passive income opportunity right for you?

High risk

While buying virtual land in the metaverse sounds interesting it also comes with a high bar to entry. If you've never explored a metaverse world like Decentraland before you'll need to get up to speed on how these worlds work and how they differ from traditional role-playing video games. You'll also need to familiarize yourself with metaverse land prices which can range from a few thousand dollars to over $1 million and then become acquainted with a map of Decentraland which has over 90000 parcels of land.

Since all transactions in Decentraland take place using MANA the in-game governance token your rental income will be in the form of Decentraland tokens. This comes with some risk and volatility given the price swings possible in metaverse cryptos. Thus you will have two things to worry about: falling land prices and potential currency devaluation.

In late 2021 the metaverse was all the rage and Facebook even rebranded itself as Meta Platforms (META 0.16%). Celebrities and major brands were announcing their involvement in the metaverse and the future looked limitless. Paris Hilton headlined the first-ever Metaverse Festival which featured over 80 artists within Decentraland. But then came 2022 and things are looking a lot more dicey for the Decentraland token which has fallen in price by 88% this year.

High reward

However this high risk does come with potentially high reward. For example experts such as consulting giant McKinsey continue to predict that the metaverse will be a nearly $1 trillion market opportunity within a few years. And there is certainly a lot of interest about what the metaverse is and how to get involved in it. According to the latest study from Capgemini a multinational information-technology services and consulting company headquartered in Paris more than 90% of consumers are curious about the metaverse.

As I see it the Decentraland passive-income opportunity comes down to this: Get in early while people are still figuring out the metaverse buy land while it's relatively cheap and then transform your parcel of land into something that brands and creative influencers will want to use for one-time events. If you are lucky enough you might find some brands artists musicians or small businesses eager to rent Decentraland land parcels from you for brand launches festivals or conferences.

Is virtual-property renting worth it?

For now this new ""passive"" income opportunity sounds way too ""active"" to attract the attention of casual investors. And it certainly requires too much of an up-front investment to be viable for most people just getting involved in crypto for the first time. The average cost of a parcel of land in Decentraland today is $2380.

Unless you're already an active user within Decentraland and have a social network in place I don't see how this can be a recurring source of passive income. Virtual-property rentals are not like real-world rentals where you can lock in rent for 12 months at a time. Even if DJs fashion designers and streetwear brands are knocking down the digital door to rent from you in Decentraland it seems like you're going to have to hustle quite a bit to make recurring rental income a reality.

Why not just stake MANA?

It might be easier instead to just stake your Decentraland tokens in order to earn passive income. For example right now you can earn staking rewards of 3% on your Decentraland tokens via some popular cryptocurrency platforms. This might not sound like a lot but it's easy and it's passive.

Thus as of now I'm out on virtual-property rentals as a source of passive income. While Decentraland is certainly an interesting crypto to consider as a possible rebound candidate in 2023 I need to see more activity within the metaverse before I can recommend the Decentraland token as a buy or to consider virtual-property renting as a viable source of passive income.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaW5zdGFncmFtLXJvbGwtY2FsbC12cy1nbGltcHNlLXN0b3JpZXMtYmVyZWFsLWNvcHljYXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Instagram Roll Call & Glimpse Stories: Which BeReal Copycat Is Better?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaW5zdGFncmFtLXJvbGwtY2FsbC12cy1nbGltcHNlLXN0b3JpZXMtYmVyZWFsLWNvcHljYXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmFseXRpY3NpbnNpZ2h0Lm5ldC9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1hbmFseXRpY3MtaW5zaWdodC82LW9mLXRoZS1iZXN0LW1ldGF2ZXJzZS10b2tlbnMtZm9yLWdyZWF0LXJldHVybnMtaW4tZGVjZW1iZXItMjAyMtIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmFseXRpY3NpbnNpZ2h0Lm5ldC9hbXAvc3RvcnkvY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktYW5hbHl0aWNzLWluc2lnaHQvNi1vZi10aGUtYmVzdC1tZXRhdmVyc2UtdG9rZW5zLWZvci1ncmVhdC1yZXR1cm5zLWluLWRlY2VtYmVyLTIwMjI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 of the Best Metaverse Tokens for Great Returns in December 2022,Part of Metacade's plan is to put the power back into the hands of gamers.

I value my civic pride highly. That certainly extends to when on the rare occasion I leave the city limits.

Attending the Eagles-Giants game at MetLife Stadium I got up to North Jersey fairly early since it's my first time at the venue as a media member and wanted to give myself ample time to get know the parking and press box setups. Walking into the stadium I was greeted with this eatery:

The Original New York Cheesesteak Company. Did someone purposely put this by the media entrance just to antagonize me? Against all that is right in this world I knew I had to try this and give the good people of Philadelphia a review.

After getting settled with my laptop and grabbing a coffee in the press box I went down to the concourse to buy one of these monstrosities. I get to a stand and it's roughly 10:55 a.m. They told me they didn't start selling until 11:00 a.m. I just felt like an idiot. What could they be thinking of me? ""Who is the freak in the leather jacket who cannot possibly begin his day without scarfing down this slop?"" I sat in the stands for about 20 minutes before heading back to that same place and buying a $14 cheesesteak.

""Do you want everything on it?""

I said yes not knowing what I was getting into. Were they going to slop this up and put green peppers on there? Mayonnaise? I prepared for the worst concoction possible.

Here's what this bad boy looked like as I opened the wrapper:

It was just cheese whiz and onions. Nothing outrageous which made me think that this could be at least not the worst thing I've ever eaten in my life.

It was as expected bad. Very bad.

The ratio here was all over the place. The roll was too soft and too doughy. It was falling apart. There was the slightest indentation from it being cut in half but I ultimately had to rip it causing the sloppy steak floodgates to open up. The whiz tasted like nothing. It was as if they took the roll and ever so slightly dunked the side of it in a vat of gooey nothingness.

I'm a big onion guy but when there are seemingly just as many onions on a cheesesteak as the meat itself there is a problem.

I felt like I was eating a plain roll at a certain point that was garnished with imitation cheese and bits of chopped meat.

Shamus Clancy/for PhillyVoice A cheesesteak from The Original New York Cheesesteak Company at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

When I ripped the cheesesteak in half it was basically a 60/40 split. I ate the larger half and then took a bite of the second half. I thought to myself ""Who am I doing this for? Do I really finish it? Do I owe it to people? Am I going to be in the hospital dying one day wishing I never shoved this down my gullet in the name of content?""

Eating a cheesesteak back in the city I know what I'm going to get and that enjoyment outweighs how terrible you might feel from eating something so unhealthy. This though? It made me question what I'm doing with my entire life. Has everything that's transpired over the last 28 years left me eating a disgusting excuse for a Philly staple alone a table 80-plus miles away from everyone I know and love? Is this the dream I was sold in life and happily bought up?

I didn't finish it and and take solace in that.

It can't be that hard to create a good cheesesteak this close to Philly. I made the drive in about 80 minutes this morning. Get some rolls shipped up. Do anything else. Be better.

All I know is that back in Philly this week I'm going to get a cheesesteak for lunch one day. Even if it's merely okay it will taste like the mana from Canaan in comparison to this.

The immediate reaction after what transpired on Sunday: Perhaps not.

“Understand that no one is going to feel sorry for us” Daniel Jones said. “It’s up to us to fix it and to move forward. Everything we want to achieve is still out in front of us.”

What they want is still achievable. What the Giants want and what they get well that might be two very different things.

There was nothing to be extracted from a dismal performance to make anyone feel encouraged about the state of a team in a free fall. Asking the Giants to knock off the best team in the NFL was asking too much but the way the Giants capitulated in an embarrassing 48-22 loss to the Eagles at MetLife Stadium was certainly not a performance to uplift the spirits of anyone invested in how the Giants fare in 2022.

“Sometimes you get your ass beat” Julian Love said.

“We got our ass whupped point blank” Saquon Barkley said.

Barkley started after speculation surrounding a neck issue that cropped up late in the week. His workload was limited and he stayed on the sideline once the score grew so lopsided. Barkley finished with nine rushing attempts for 28 yards and two receptions for 20 yards. It was smarter to save him for what comes next.

The Giants are 7-5-1 and their Week 15 meeting with the Commanders (also 7-5-1) at FedEx Field is a rematch of the Week 13 20-20 tie. Next Sunday night’s game stands as the most important game of the season for both sides — almost a playoff eliminator for the loser.

“We got to win this f—ing game that’s all I got to say” defensive end Jihad Ward said. “This is a must win so we got to do what we got to do.”

What the Giants have to do is shake whatever has infected them for more than a month. They are 0-3-1 in their last four games headed in the wrong direction as the season turns for home.

The Eagles (12-1) clinched a playoff berth. The Giants received a break when the Seahawks (7-6) were beaten by the Panthers. If the season ended today the Giants would be the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoff chase just ahead of the Seahawks.

4 Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) makes a run against the Giants at MetLife Stadium on Dec. 11 2022. Corey Sipkin

The first tangle with the Eagles showed the Giants how far they are from competing with an elite opponent. Daniel Jones (18 for 26 169 1 TD) had no help. Jalen Hurts (21 of 31 217 yards 2 TDs) was a force with his arm and his legs (7-77) and the Giants had no answers for running back Miles Sanders (17-144-2 TDs). Receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith both caught touchdown passes. The Eagles ran for 253 yards.

“Tough game” coach Brian Daboll said. “Credit to Philly; that’s a good football team over there. They pretty much did everything better than we did.

“We got beat handily. It was 48 to whatever it was.”

Whatever it was was not close to good enough.

4 Giants coach Brian Daboll looks on from the sidelines at MetLife Stadium on Dec. 11 2022. Bill Kostroun

Form held right from the start. The Giants managed to achieve a first down on their opening series on offense but Jones was sacked twice in the first five snaps. Hurts completed 9 of 10 passes for 64 yards on a methodical 14-play 84-yard drive that took 8:05 off the clock. The Eagles picked up six first downs and finished the deal with Sanders’ 3-yard run to make it 7-0.

The next time the Eagles got the ball Hurts scrambled for a first down on third-and-6 and then continued to shred the sagging Giants secondary and a particularly struggling Fabian Moreau. On fourth-and-7 the Giants seemingly were going to limit the damage to a field goal but Hurts fired 41 yards to Smith for a touchdown. Smith ran past Darnay Holmes but Love raced over to try to intercept the ball and whiffed on it allowing Smith to walk into the end zone.

“I read it perfectly I thought” Love said. “Ball was in the air. I thought it was slightly overthrown so I thought I had an easy ‘Catch it’ opportunity. I didn’t realize his positioning. I just misjudged.”

What followed was perhaps the ugliest moment of the season for the Giants. Punter Jamie Gillan dropped an accurate snap and then kicked the ball after it bounced on the turf. That was an illegal kick and the 10-yard penalty put the Eagles on the Giants’ 33-yard line. Not for long. Hurts on first down saw Brown motor past cornerback Nick McCloud and let it fly. Brown caught the ball before safety Jason Pinnock could provide any help and it was 21-0 much to the delight of the thousands of Eagles’ fans who made the trip north.

”We got beat; they outcoached us they outplayed us and we got to get ready to go soon; the season’s winding down here and we got an important one on Sunday” Daboll said.

“Call it a rough patch you can call it adversity we started off really hot and now we got to figure it out” Barkley said. “That’s life that’s football that’s in anything.

The DJ at the MGM Grand Garden Arena played Thunderstruck and the music rocked the venue on the Strip near the Tropicana Boulevard intersection.

It’s a four-team doubleheader includes a UNLV vs Washington State first game that’s part of what Las Vegas hoops promoter Brooks Downing calls “The Clash.”

It’s impossible to identify fans by their logo gear because red is the color for all four teams Saturday afternoon. Indiana plays Arizona at 4 PM.

.

UNLV is on a mini-tour of arenas in the Las Vegas Valley with the 10-day National Finals Rodeo taking over the Thomas & Mack Center this week. UNLV visited Henderson Wednesday to easily dispatch San Diego by 17 points at the Dollar Loan Center arena in suburban Green Valley Ranch.

The MGM Grand Garden is among MGM Resorts International’s roster of sports venues. It’s a utilitarian arena without the frills of T-Mobile Arena on the west side of the Strip but it’s still useful to host events like bdGlobal’s “The Clash” hoops event.

UNLV is unbeaten at 9-0 but this 4-4 Washington State hoops squad jumped out to a 13-4 lead as the Cougars played well against the Runnin’ Rebels’ vaunted nasty defense which would force 22 turnovers in this game.

Then UNLV ripped off your basic 18-0 run and seized a 22-13 lead over Washington State midway through the first half.

UNLV is a defensive stalwart that has a trio of six-foot-three to six-foot-six inch players who spark the offense: sophomore Keshon Gilbert fifth-year player EJ Harkless and all-purpose senior Luis Rodriguez. The Rebs were leading 33-30 at the half and enjoyed a 64-54 advantage with about seven minutes left in the second half. Jackie Johnson III pictured below is also a sparkplug off the bench.

There wasn’t a giant showing of UNLV fans at MGM Grand Garden today because this game is not part of the Rebels basketball season ticket deal with the university. The get-in price was $49 plus there’s another $20 for parking and gas.

The quartet of college basketball teams was part of a busy sports Saturday as the final day of the 10-day National Finals Rodeo was wrapping up at Thomas & Mack a mile to the west down Tropicana while Las Vegas-based UFC was staging its final PPV fight show event of the year at T-Mobile Arena only a mile to the west on the other side of the Strip.

The Cougars pulled within six points at 69-63 with less than a minute and a half to go.

But UNLV eventually polished off Washington State to win 74-70 before Arizona and Indiana took the floor. Gilbert led UNLV with 23 points while Harkless scored 20.

I felt like we played a lot of that game at Wazzu’s pace and their temperament but I thought we did a good job of creating enough momentum swings in our direction to where we had favor in the way the game was going. It was a little more up and down which our guys do better at. When the game is moving we are able to get turnovers run and get good offensive looks that way. Washington State shot the ball really well and they do a really good job of finding the open guy and when you’ve got that many that can make plays and shoot it and make some of the shots they did today that’s what’s probably going to happen — UNLV coach Kevin Kruger

The Runnin’ Rebels are 10-0. They play San Francisco at Thomas & Mack Center Dec. 17 at 2 PM. Here’s the ticket deal UNLV is pitching.

Indiana and Arizona fans came and it was a marquee matchup of two well-known college basketball programs. The event sold out for that game at 13357 at the MGM Grand Garden. Tenth-ranked Arizona defeated Indiana 89-75.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvdml0YWx2ZWdhcy9nYW1lLW9mLXRocm9uZXMtZHJhZ29uLWF0dHJhY3Rpb24tY29taW5nLXRvLWxhcy12ZWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Game of Thrones"" Dragon Attraction Coming to Las Vegas | Vital Vegas","“Game of Thrones” Dragon Attraction Coming to Las Vegas

A new dragon attraction inspired by the HBO series “Game of Thrones” is coming to Las Vegas.

Details are sparse but a teaser video featured a dramatically toasted “Welcome to Las Vegas” sign.

Everyone doing anything of a cinematic nature in Las Vegas has to muck with the Las Vegas sign. It’s the law. (See also “Army of the Dead” and every other apocalyptic movie TV show or videogame ever.)

Please don’t get distracted by the fact the Las Vegas sign appears to have moved to a mountainside nowhere near Las Vegas. The graphics folks made up for it by setting the palm trees on fire as that’s a very Las Vegas thing for some reason possibly the fact that everything is more flammable when it’s 140 degrees outside for nine months of the year.

Moving on!

That image is about all we’ve been given related to the new attraction. It’s a screen capture from a Tweet that got the attraction on everyone’s radar.

Dragons are coming to Las Vegas. Learn more: https://t.co/3QM0w6cohu pic.twitter.com/NPFzwshquo — Game of Thrones (@GameOfThrones) December 11 2022

We have spent most of our adult life in marketing so have a robust disdain for “teaser” campaigns but that’s all we’ve got for the “Game of Thrones” dragon attraction in Las Vegas we’ll take what we can get.

There’s an official Web site for the new attraction. We also have a disdain for splash pages but it’s just the regular kind of disdain (not the robust kind) despite the fact splash pages went out of fashion a decade or so ago.

“Must you always be so critical of everything?” you are thinking. “Just have some fun! It’s a new attraction and there will be dragons and possibly little people with terrible British accents!”

Point taken.

Can we at least agree Peter Dinklage’s accent in “Game of Thrones” was the second worst actor accent of all time after Don Cheadle’s in “Ocean Eleven”? Thank you! It’s refreshing when we can all find common ground.

Anyway the “Game of Thrones” dragon attraction Web page offers interested parties the opportunity to provide their e-mail and phone number to learn more about the attraction when it becomes available.

Yes against our better judgment we provided our phone number and got a text which again provided zero information about the attraction.

While we wait for more information we’ll take some guesses about the new attraction:

1) It will feature dragons.

2) Guests will hear the word “dracarys” a lot. (It’s the command given to dragons to make them breathe fire and turns enemies into kabobs.)

3) The attraction will be promoted as being immersive and interactive.

4) Everything involved will be state-of-the-art.

5) There will probably be costumes from the series on display. (See also the “Hunger Games” attraction still chugging along at MGM Grand.)

6) It will be much more satisfying than the finale of “Game of Thrones.”

7) The attraction will be infinitely better than “House of the Dragon” the prequel to “Game of Thrones.”

8) Ironically the attraction will be non-smoking.

9) Most of the attraction’s revenue will be generated from merch.

10) There will be two-for-one tickets available in 4-6 weeks after opening.

“You used to be so bright-eyed and excited about everything in Las Vegas” you are thinking. “What happened to you?” Well honestly 50 immersive and interactive attractions happened.

Some are better than others but none of them involve drinking or gambling honestly. (Although there is a “Game of Thrones” slot machine.)

Las Vegas has some history with “Game of Thrones.” Here’s a random item we Tweeted awhile back.

Celebrity sighting of the night! This is the daughter of Ghost from ""Game of Thrones"" spotted at Spare Room at Downtown Grand. pic.twitter.com/0ApXvCC6QE — Vital Vegas (@VitalVegas) July 10 2019

At one point there was a “Game of Thrones” promotion that involved a show on the fountains at Bellagio.









We enjoyed “Game of Thrones” so we’ll definitely check this attraction out we just like to set our expectations low so we can be surprised by how fire it is. If you didn’t think we’d get a dragon reference into this story somewhere you don’t know this blog at all.

“Game of Thrones” has a big fanbase going for it and people love dragons as much as dinosaurs probably.

A whole industry has grown up around tours and attractions related to the “Game of Thrones” franchise with shoot locations becoming legitimate tourist attractions.

Check back again for further details about this new attraction and we’ll cut and paste our asses off from the official news release when it’s available.

Update (12/21/22): We’ve exclusively confirmed the “Game of Thrones Dragons” attraction will be at Horseshoe Las Vegas (formerly Bally’s). The attraction will be located on the east end of the resort near the Caesars Entertainment employment center. You can see the logo of the company involved with producing the attraction (SPiE) on the wrap around the Horseshoe’s surface parking lot.

LAS VEGAS Nev. – Indiana needs to lock in on defense and Trey Galloway did his part on this play.

Arizona guard Courtney Ramey drove hard down the right side of the paint and scooped the ball toward the rim. But Galloway had other ideas swatting Ramey's shot off the backboard.

Indiana trails Arizona 46-36 at halftime and Galloway has four points three rebounds one assist one block and one steal.

And it ended their feud in so conclusive a fashion that Pacquiao was simply never the same again.

4 After 42 rounds in the ring over four fights Marquez ended his rivalry with Pacquiao Credit: Getty

When the Filipino was left lifeless face down on the canvas at Las Vegas’ MGM Grand Garden Arena there was briefly far greater concern than the fact that he had for the first time in his celebrated career suffered successive defeats.

The fight that had partly been chosen to revive interest in the overdue super fight with Floyd Mayweather had become the one that had left it at far greater risk. After having also controversially lost via split decision to Timothy Bradley Pacquiao could no longer realistically claim to deserve parity with Mayweather and the illusion that theirs would prove the most absorbing and competitive of fights was shattered almost as convincingly as Marquez had thrown the explosive punch that landed on Pacquiao’s jaw.

At his remarkable peak Pacquiao recognised most of all for his success against fighters of Mexican descent had recorded two victories over Marco Antonio Barrera two over Erik Morales one over Oscar De La Hoya one over Antonio Margarito and two that were increasingly controversial over Marquez – perhaps by then his finest opponent of all.

In the first at the same venue in May 2004 at featherweight off the back of his first defeat of Barrera Marquez so impressively recovered from three knockdowns inside the opening round that he fought back to force the three ringside judges to score a split draw. The most cultured intelligent and aggressive of counter-punchers had learned to read and eventually negate his then-unorthodox opponent and to the extent that there were even observers who felt that he had deserved to win.

When they fought for the second time at Vegas’ Mandalay Bay in March 2008 at super featherweight Pacquiao was again the favourite having evolved as a fighter – after beating Barrera for the second time and twice beating Morales – even if he was still to start to transcend his sport. Another damaging start for Marquez in which he suffered a knockdown in the third round and a significant cut was followed by another brilliant display of counter-punching in which he again started to read the improved Pacquiao and he ultimately deserved more than his narrow split-decision defeat.

The once-raw Pacquiao under the guidance of Freddie Roach then widely recognised as the world’s finest trainer had repeatedly improved – physically and technically – as a fighter in between those two fights. After the second he went on a run as impressive as any fighter in history – as the naturally smaller fighter moving up to lightweight to stop David Diaz super lightweight to stop Ricky Hatton welterweight to stop De La Hoya and Miguel Cotto before outpointing Joshua Clottey and Shane Mosley and finally light middleweight to convincingly beat Margarito over 12 rounds.

From fighting at 130lbs against Marquez he had repeatedly beaten world-class and in some cases elite opposition in as heavy a weight division as 154lbs. In doing so – the victory over De La Hoya was that which introduced him to a wider audience; that which followed over Hatton was his most destructive and that over Cotto his most impressive of all – he had also proven himself a rival and to some observers surpassed Mayweather as the finest fighter in the world.

When after beating Mosley he was matched with Marquez again in November 2011 he was widely considered to not only have improved to such an extent technically that even decorated naturally bigger opponents had proved incapable of containing him but to have matured so much physically that their third fight at welterweight was taking place at a weight at which Marquez had already demonstrated he shouldn’t fight. It was September 2009 when Marquez first moved up to welterweight to fight Mayweather and when he looked sluggish and by his standards slow in the process of a one-sided defeat.

What instead unfolded against the significantly more polished Pacquiao at the MGM Grand was his most straightforward fight tactically of the four they were to have. Roach had refined the Filipino to such a degree that he had become more effective than ever previously imagined against opponents with the qualities of Hatton and Cotto and yet in the context of the near-unrivalled boxing IQ of Marquez he had become significantly more predictable and to the extent that when Pacquiao was awarded a majority decision it was widely considered the most unjust scorecard of the three.

Even with the wide sense of injustice at those scorecards and the similarly controversial defeat by Bradley that followed a similar logic dictated that Pacquiao was again rightly the favourite for their fourth of four fights and that the Filipino then 33 would win without controversy to finally silence his greatest rival.

Each of their fights had been high of the highest quality and entertainment and even after the first had featured Marquez surviving three knockdowns in the opening round their most dramatic fight was also the last of the four.

Fighting with an intensity not seen since the victory over Cotto in 2009 Pacquiao as stung by the sense of injustice of the loss to Bradley as he was by suggestions he had been lucky against Marquez and by the Mexican’s subsequent taunts forced a pace and punishing nature of fight that for the first time since the knockdown Marquez had suffered in their second fight appeared to have placed the Mexican at risk of being stopped.

Instead with Pacquiao detecting some vulnerability in the 39-year-old Marquez towards the conclusion of the sixth round and responding by continuing to move forwards Marquez countered him with a right hand as immaculately timed as it was accurate dropping Pacquiao so conclusively that Marquez had instantly secured his crowning victory ensuring that on the evening of December 8 2012 he truly sent shockwaves through their sport.

“I knew I could be knocked out at any time when he was coming at me in those last three rounds” said Marquez by then significantly more convincing at welterweight and having also knocked Pacquiao down in the third round and recovered from a knockdown in the fifth.

“But I threw the perfect punch.”"

Dec. 6 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing or TSMC one of the world's largest chip makers announced the construction of two labs with the capacity to manufacture N4 and 3nm technology in Arizona representing the largest foreign direct investment in Arizona.

In the official announcement TSMC outlined a $40 billion investment to build a US-based semiconductor production facility in Phoenix Arizona. According to the plan the Taiwanese chip giant will import industry-leading technology and relocate engineers from Taiwan–both of which were previously limited to the company's factories in Taiwan.

The Taiwan-based company has been the biggest maker of leading-edge semiconductor chips and a long-term contractor of Apple's iPhone. Yet its location worries US investors companies and officials due to Taiwan's geopolitical conflict with China. Once the new facility in Phoenix is fully upgraded the US factories will have the capacity to eventually produce chips for Apple's iPhone under a significantly lower geopolitical risk. Combined with the economic interest the new factory will present in the southwest US the plan receives endorsement from across the US officials and industries including President Joe Biden and Apple's CEO Tim Cook.

The significant upgrade to the US-based facility will make the US one of the first countries outside of Taiwan to have the capability to manufacture the latest semiconductor chip with industry-leading technology. TSMC will build advanced semiconductor factories also called ""fabs"" which can fabricate hundreds of fingernail-size chips on 12-inch silicon wafers. Some of the necessary equipment for this microchip production has already arrived at the Arizona site in massive crates.

This expensive and complicated equipment is part of TSMC's $40 billion investment including the $12 billion promised when the initial facility's construction was announced in 2020. The new upgrade marked not only the largest foreign direct investment in Arizona but also one of the largest investments in the history of the United States. The plan is estimated to employ 4500 permanent workers while creating 21000 construction jobs.

Perhaps more appealing than the job creation that drew President Biden to Arizona this Tuesday is the national security and economic advantage this plan will provide for the US. After touring the massive facility President Biden framed the TSMC investment as part of his plan to win America ""the economics competition of the 21st century"" and ""lead the world once again in manufacturing.""

Addressing the importance of chips has been one of the only Biden administration's common ground with the Trump administration. In July the $52 billion package of subsidies in the CHIPS act proved semiconductor chips development again in the US can garner bi-partisan support. Similarly Commerce Secretary Gina Raimando addressed the national security issue during Tuesday's event with President Biden. The inability to produce sophisticated microchips is ""a national security issue a national security vulnerability"" according to Raimando.

Clearly the move to produce semiconductor chips in the US will bring political capital and national security edge to the Biden administration. But for Taiwan where TSMC is based there is an unease that the east Asia island will lose its ""chip shield."" Besides the potential of TSMC stripping Taiwan of its unique asset–advanced chip technology–there is a growing concern that the decreased presence of the company's leading-edge production in Taiwan would expose Taipei to potential invasion. In the past the administration and the general public believed that the TSMC's unique presence in Taiwan incentivised Western allies to defend Taiwan from China's invasion. Once the Arizona facility can mass-produce microchip products the risk presented by Beijing's aggression will decrease and so as the incentives to protect Taiwan.

As a matter of fact Taiwan is not the only risk the Arizona facility can help decrease for the tech industry. In the past Zhengzhou protests or similar domestic unrest in China created huge delays in iPhone production. Although the Arizona facility is responsible for more sophisticated microchips instead of simple assembly moving the manufacturing focus away from East Asia will provide a more robust supply chain when any unrest happens. The implication is the diminished importance of China in the global supply chain which explains the raging reaction from Chinese media by calling the Arizona fab a ""dark turn"" for the global semiconductor industry. Either way we will likely see a new era of the global supply chain where the US will play an even more vital role in innovation and design for microchip production after the TSMC Arizona fab.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vZnV0dXJlLXBlcmZlY3QvMjAyMi8xMi8xMS8yMzUwMDE1Ny9uZXVyYWxpbmstYW5pbWFsLXRlc3RpbmctZWxvbi1tdXNrLXVzZGEtcHJvYmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Elon Musk Neuralink animal cruelty allegations explained,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.vox.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /future-perfect/2022/12/11/23500157/neuralink-animal-testing-elon-musk-usda-probe (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00DEEEB00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vZnV0dXJlLXBlcmZlY3QvMjAyMi8xMi8xMS8yMzUwMDE1Ny9uZXVyYWxpbmstYW5pbWFsLXRlc3RpbmctZWxvbi1tdXNrLXVzZGEtcHJvYmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbmx0aW1lcy5ubC8yMDIyLzEyLzEwL2R1dGNoLWNvbXB1dGVyLWNoaXBzLWZvdW5kLWlyYW5pYW4ta2lsbGVyLWRyb25lcy11c2VkLXdhci11a3JhaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dutch computer chips found in Iranian killer drones used in the war in Ukraine,"Iranian weapon drones used in the war in Ukraine contained chips supplied from Dutch companies. The British research organization Conflict Armament Research (CAR) which is responsible for researching Western technology in Iranian drones confirmed this to the Dutch newspaper AD.

Deputy Director of Operations at Conflict Armament Research Damien Spleeters said ""Most of the western components we found were made between 2020 and 2021. There are also Dutch components among them.""

In the summer of this year the Dutch chip companies NXP and Nexperia received the message that their chips were found in Russian drones. Another British research organization Rusi subsequently found components of Dutch origin in 10 of the 27 Russian objects examined. These included pressure sensors from washing machines.

It now appears that chips from Dutch companies have also been found in Iranian weapon drones used by the Russians. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian admitted on Saturday that it had delivered a limited number of drones to Russia ""months before the war in Ukraine began."" However Ukraine reportedly found more than 200 of them in a month.

Editor’s note – Dec. 13 2022 – The name of Microsoft Purview was corrected.

LONDON — Dec. 12 2022 — London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Microsoft have entered into a new long-term strategic partnership to architect LSEG’s data infrastructure using the Microsoft Cloud and to jointly develop new products and services for data and analytics. The partnership will build on the good progress made by LSEG on the integration of Refinitiv and enhance its position as a world-leading financial markets infrastructure and data provider.

With the Microsoft Cloud and its AI capabilities the deal significantly advances LSEG’s strategy of building an efficient and scalable platform for its Data & Analytics business to deliver next-generation services for a range of customers across the financial markets value chain through improved workflow and greater flexibility.

Under the arrangements LSEG’s data platform and other key technology infrastructure will migrate into Microsoft’s Azure cloud environment. Workspace LSEG’s next-generation data and analytics workflow solution will become interoperable with certain Microsoft applications and the companies plan to introduce innovative new cloud-based analytics services. LSEG and Microsoft have also agreed to explore the development of digital market infrastructure based on cloud technology with a goal to transform how market participants interact with capital markets across a broad range of asset classes. Migration of regulated applications will be subject to applicable regulated entity board and regulator approval prior to the relevant migration.

David Schwimmer CEO of LSEG said: “This strategic partnership is a significant milestone on LSEG’s journey towards becoming the leading global financial markets infrastructure and data business and will transform the experience for our customers.

“Bringing together our leading data sets analytics and global customer base with Microsoft’s comprehensive and trusted cloud services and global reach creates attractive revenue growth opportunities for both companies.

“We are delighted to welcome Microsoft as a shareholder. We believe our partnership with Microsoft will transform the way our customers discover analyze and trade securities around the world and create substantial value over time. We look forward to delivering on that potential.”

Satya Nadella Chairman and CEO Microsoft said: “Advances in the cloud and AI will fundamentally transform how financial institutions research interact and transact across asset classes and adapt to changing market conditions.

“Our partnership will bring together the industry leadership of the London Stock Exchange Group with the trust and breadth of the Microsoft Cloud — spanning Azure AI and Teams — to build next-generation services that will empower our customers to generate business insights automate complex and time-consuming processes and ultimately do more with less.”

Key elements of the strategic partnership

Data platform with Microsoft Cloud

LSEG has already made good progress on its existing program for the delivery of its cloud-based data platform since the completion of the Refinitiv acquisition in January 2021.

Under the arrangements with Microsoft LSEG will use Microsoft Purview and Azure Synapse to create its cloud-based data architecture that consolidates LSEG datasets onto one flexible infrastructure that is simple responsive and efficient and built with security privacy and compliance. The program accelerates LSEG’s cloud migration plans. LSEG customers will be able to access data faster when and wherever they need it — enabling resilience and adaptability as capital markets continue to evolve.

Additionally data scientists and engineers will be able to utilize LSEG’s data and analytics services on LSEG’s infrastructure or leverage LSEG’s open financial data ecosystem by integrating their own data to build custom solutions.

LSEG Workspace to use Teams and Microsoft 365 to transform user experience for finance professionals

Over the last two years LSEG has made significant progress on Workspace its next-generation data and analytics workflow solution with over 50% of users now migrated from legacy platforms and all products either live or in beta testing by the end of this year.

As part of LSEG’s product development with Microsoft the companies plan a step-change in the advancement of Workspace by creating an all-in-one data analytics workflow and collaboration solution specifically designed to help finance and investment professionals improve communications and productivity while maintaining regulatory compliance. It will be a connected intuitive experience with a single simple-to-use interface that helps users:

For the first time collaborate with other LSEG customers inside and outside of their organizations using Teams to connect chat call and meet with built-in compliance security and privacy;

Create financial models run data analysis and design graphs using LSEG content delivered in Excel; and

Work seamlessly between LSEG Workspace Teams and Microsoft 365 tools to deliver financial presentations and reports.

New cloud analytics and modelling services built with Azure Machine Learning

Microsoft and LSEG will use Azure Machine Learning and LSEG’s advanced analytics and modelling capabilities to co-develop a new suite of solutions to give financial institutions much broader reach across sophisticated cross-asset sustainable investment-aligned and non-traditional analytics. Businesses that rely on analytics will be able to scale without the need for complicated processes and systems that often require extra servers hardware and employee resources.

On the modelling side development will focus on model construction validation diagnostics and deployment helping banking and investment institutions avoid the labor-intensive and expensive process of creating models from the ground up. Built on the LSEG data platform with Microsoft 365 connectivity these new analytics and modelling services will be available on Workspace and developer-friendly APIs.

Cloud infrastructure built on Microsoft Azure

As part of the strategic partnership LSEG and Microsoft have entered into a 10-year commercial agreement to migrate LSEG’s data platform and other key technology infrastructure into the Microsoft Cloud.

This infrastructure plan will be the foundation for the product development programs outlined above and enable LSEG to build and run scalable applications to achieve faster speed to market and greater customer reach. At the same time it will allow LSEG to align costs more directly to revenue streams reduce operational complexity through the consolidation of multiple legacy technologies and further strengthen resilience and security.

Governance

LSEG and Microsoft have established a governance structure that will be responsible and accountable for the commercial delivery of the programs described above and the operational service delivery of the cloud infrastructure. This will include senior representation in joint workstreams across the different initiatives regularly reporting to the senior leadership of LSEG and Microsoft.

LSEG will provide further updates to LSEG investors on the progress of these programs later in 2023.

Microsoft investment in LSEG shares

Microsoft has agreed to purchase shares in LSEG that would result in Microsoft holding approximately a 4% equity stake in LSEG such shares to be purchased from York Holdings II Limited and York Holdings III Limited entities owned by certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone an affiliate of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board an affiliate of GIC Special Investments Pte. Ltd and by Thomson Reuters the former Refinitiv shareholders. In accordance with LR 9.6.17R of the FCA’s Listing Rules LSEG notes that it has agreed to a limited variation of the lock-up arrangements contained in the Relationship Agreement entered into on completion of the Refinitiv transaction to enable the sale of these LSEG shares to Microsoft.

As a result of LSEG granting the lock-up waiver the number of LSEG shares that the Blackstone/Thomson Reuters consortium will be able to sell between 30 January 2023 and 29 January 2024 will be unchanged and the number of LSEG shares that the Blackstone/Thomson Reuters consortium will be able to sell between 30 January 2024 and 29 January 2025 will be reduced by half of the number of shares sold to Microsoft. Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement the lock-up ceases to apply after 29 January 2025. The share purchase will be subject to customary antitrust and regulatory approvals and is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2023.

Microsoft has entered into a separate agreement with LSEG pursuant to which Microsoft has agreed in addition to customary standstill and orderly marketing arrangements to be subject to a lock-up in respect of the LSEG shares purchased by it. This will restrict any sales of such shares during the first year following completion of the share purchase after which Microsoft shall then be restricted from selling more than half of the acquired shares during the second year following completion of the share purchase.

Financial effects for LSEG

The strategic partnership is expected to increase LSEG’s revenue growth meaningfully over time as the key workstreams are delivered.

LSEG and Microsoft have agreed to co-invest in the product development roadmap for the data platform Workspace and analytics initiatives. LSEG’s total incremental cash costs relating to the programs from 2023 to 2025 are expected to be in the range of £250-300 million. Within this LSEG expects incremental capex over 2023-2025 of approximately £100 million. The balance of the cash costs which relate to one-off change costs are expected to have a 50-100 basis points impact on EBITDA margin in the years 2023-2025.

In addition as is customary under cloud infrastructure agreements LSEG has committed to a minimum cloud-related spend with Microsoft over the life of the agreement amounting to $2.8 billion (£2.3 billion). The amount reflects LSEG’s expected minimum cloud consumption will be strongly weighted towards the second half of the period as consumption builds and is already factored into LSEG’s existing long-term cost projections either for cloud or for the legacy opex and capex it will replace over time.

Any additional spend LSEG incurs with Microsoft will be driven by the success of the strategic partnership based on demand for LSEG’s data platform and other professional services.

For Listing Rules purposes the gross assets related to the partnership are $500 million.

In accordance with LR 9.6.15R the Company confirms that no disclosure is required under LR 9.6.13R in respect of the appointment of Scott Guthrie. The effective date of the appointment is not yet known and LSEG will make a further announcement as soon as the effective date is known.

Windows 11 sports new features like integrated Android apps a more Mac-like interface widgets multitasking features an improved gaming experience using Xbox technology and more.

Windows 11's updates to Microsoft Teams are poised to be some of the most helpful changes however.

In Windows 11 Teams lives in the Windows taskbar -- it's called ""Chat"" and replaces the Skype Meet Now button from Windows 10 -- making starting a call as simple as it is with FaceTime in MacOS. Teams also becomes more accessible on Mac iOS Android and Windows PCs.

Microsoft started testing a preview of the new integration with Windows Insider testers earlier this year.

After SCORadar flagged a Microsoft data breach at the end of October the company confirmed that a server misconfiguration had caused 65000+ companies’ data to be leaked. A security lapse left an Azure endpoint available for unauthenticated access in the incident termed “BlueBleed.”

In a statement about the scale of the leak it was revealed that security researchers at SOCRadar informed Microsoft of the leak on September 24. Although the “investigation found no indication customer accounts or systems were compromised” information regarding customer names email addresses email content company names and phone numbers were included in the data that could have been accessed without authentication.

SOCRadar’s report suggests that this Microsoft data breach can be considered one of the most significant B2B leaks of recent years but Microsoft disputes the severity of the incident. The Windows creator argues that the report “greatly exaggerated” the reach of the problem since the data used by SCORadar contains “multiple references to the same emails projects and users.”

Insisting that the issue isn’t serious Microsoft requested that the cybersecurity vendor temporarily suspend all BlueBleed queries in the Threat Hunting module offered to SCORadar customers.

In a now-deleted tweet security researcher Kevin Beaumont said: “Microsoft being unable (read: refusing) to tell customers what data was taken and apparently not notifying regulators – a legal requirement – has the hallmarks of a major botched response. I hope it isn’t.”

Microsoft did not break news of the leak only confirmed almost a month after it had been flagged. It stated that it focused its attention on directly notifying customers that its investigations had flagged as being impacted by the leak starting on October 4.

The severity of the Microsoft data breach

It is perhaps not so shocking that a data exposure can be caused by a misconfiguration by a Microsoft staffer (the probable cause) but the slow response from the company is concerning. As well as suggesting that SCORadar miscounted and exaggerated the numbers impacted by the problem the type of data leaked has been arguably trivialized by the party at fault in this case Microsoft.

Erich Kron told The Hacker News  “While some of the data that may have been accessed seems trivial if SOCRadar is correct in what was exposed it could include some sensitive information about the infrastructure and network configuration of potential customers.”

Responding to the Microsoft data breach the company seems to have gone on the defensive against the wrong people. Although it “appreciate[s]” being informed about the misconfigured endpoint the company certainly does not refer to SCORadar positively in its report on the leak.

The incident undermines the inherent trust customers place in the services provided by hyperscalers. Despite being household names human error in configuration setups can expose many thousands of details that could easily be used maliciously.

The relationship between large cloud providers and security companies has its more positive sides in the bug bounties on more-or-less permanent offer: find security holes and win money. In this case no bounty was involved but the fact that Microsoft did not step forward and release details of the incident proactively devalues its reputation. Questioning the numbers posited by SOCRadar and downplaying the importance of the exposed data exacerbates the tarnishing of its reputation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8xMi8wMS9wb3B1bGFyLTI5OTktbWljcm9zb2Z0LW9mZmljZS1mb3ItbWFjLWhvbWUtYnVzaW5lc3MtMjAyMS1kZWFsLXJldHVybnPSAXVodHRwczovL2FwcGxlaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjIvMTIvMDEvcG9wdWxhci0yOTk5LW1pY3Jvc29mdC1vZmZpY2UtZm9yLW1hYy1ob21lLWJ1c2luZXNzLTIwMjEtZGVhbC1yZXR1cm5zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Popular $29.99 Microsoft Office for Mac Home & Business 2021 deal returns,"If you buy through our links we may get a commission.

A stock market sell-off in 2022 has brought down the share prices of some of the world's most valuable companies. For instance Microsoft's (MSFT 0.59%) shares have tumbled 26% year to date while Amazon's (AMZN -1.07%) have fallen 48% in the same period.

As leading companies in some of the most lucrative markets Microsoft and Amazon are attractive investments amid a sell-off. Microsoft has a considerable market share in cloud computing computer operating systems and gaming. Meanwhile Amazon is the leader in cloud computing and the champ in e-commerce.

As a result you might be looking at adding at least one of these companies to your portfolio wondering which is the better buy. So without further ado let's take a look at each.

Microsoft

Despite a stock dip in 2022 Microsoft shares have risen 195% in the last five years. The company offers investors a diverse business home to top-performing brands such as Windows Office Xbox and Azure and has expanded its dominance in multiple industries.

Since its CEO Satya Nadella took the reins in 2014 Microsoft has become a true force in the tech world. In fact the company has seen a compound annual revenue growth rate (CAGR) of 15.4% in the last five years and 12.08% over the last decade.

The company's primary growth driver has been its cloud computing platform Azure. The service is responsible for the second-biggest market share in the industry at 21% only behind Amazon Web Services' 34%. In its most recent quarter Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment rose 20% year over year to $20.3 billion with operating income earning $8.9 billion.

According to Grand View Research the cloud computing market will increase at a CAGR of 15.7% until at least 2030. And with that Microsoft could be in an excellent position to see significant gains over the long term.

Moreover Microsoft's Windows operating system has held between a 70% and 91% market share since 2013 helping the company grow its software and gaming businesses.

With powerful brands and a discounted stock Microsoft makes a superb long-term investment.

Amazon

The past year has been challenging for Amazon investors with shares plummeting almost 50%. Macroeconomic headwinds have hit the company hard over the last year. Its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS) made up 100% of its operating income in the previous quarter while its e-commerce business saw earnings slump.

Despite the deep dive in Amazon's stock this year investors who bought in five years ago are still up as the stock has increased 52% over the past five years proving its consistency as a growth stock.

While the e-commerce market could suffer in the coming months with a recession looming in 2023 the $9 trillion industry is still expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.7% until at least 2027. Considering Amazon held a 37.8% leading market share in the e-commerce industry as of June 2022 the company will likely gain the biggest advantage from the market's continued growth.

Additionally as the biggest name in cloud computing AWS is the company's fastest-growing segment. In Q3 2022 AWS revenue grew 27.4% year over year to $20.5 billion while operating income rose 10.6% to $5.4 billion. AWS is incredibly promising for Amazon's future; despite being the smallest segment it managed to make up for the $2.89 billion operating loss in the company's e-commerce segment.

Which should you choose?

Amazon's long-term outlook is positive. However when comparing its price-to-earnings ratio of 82 against Microsoft's more attractive 26 the Windows company offers more value. Furthermore Amazon's negative $26.3 billion in free cash flow as of Sept. 30 compared to Microsoft's $63.3 billion makes the Xbox manufacturer feel like a more secure investment for now.

Both companies are home to robust businesses that have permeated their respective industries making them exciting investments for the long term. However after a challenging 2022 Microsoft has fared better making it the superior stock and a solid buy this month."

On the other side of the county Grace White 25 has been describing that plan very differently. The leaflets she passes out at a farmers market each weekend mostly to fellow renters say the Arlington County Board may “consider allowing Missing Middle housing options.”

“Want more housing opportunities?” her flier asks. “Keep your future in Arlington.”

Like a growing number of U.S. cities and counties this wealthy inner-ring D.C. suburb has been ensnared in a fiery debate over whether to reconsider its zoning rules. The tentative changes would allow townhouses duplexes or garden apartments on any residential lot including those reserved for only one detached house.

Similar proposals have elicited controversy almost everywhere they have been discussed. From Minneapolis to the California state legislature to Montgomery County Md. civic groups and elected officials have clashed — sometimes in nasty terms — over whether such an effort might diversify or destroy their neighborhoods.

But that louder more consequential debate over exactly what might happen under this policy has been belied by a less visible question: what exactly to call it.

Is it adding “missing middle housing” as Arlington planners assert? Ending single-family zoning as skeptics like Duston argue? Yielding “gentle density” or legalizing “stickplexes”?

The answer stands to mold public opinion on the idea determining if and how Arlington lawmakers can move forward — and shape whether it can take root elsewhere too.

“All the emotions come out with zoning” said Jason Jordan the public affairs director at the American Planning Association. “We have to be sensitive and try to find a vocabulary … that avoids the technical jargon debate or this very polarized culture-war debate over whether the suburbs are good or bad.”

Even Jordan’s organization which supports proposals like the one before Arlington has not settled on one specific phrase. “People who have agendas in this space are smart” he added “and they’re choosing frames and language that help advance their point of view.”

Advocates say expanding housing supply would open expensive enclaves to more people undoing policies once meant to keep out people of color. Opponents express concerns the changes would overwhelm local infrastructure and spoil what made these areas so attractive in the first place.

In a polarized America political disputes that veer into the linguistic are nothing new: Advocates for or against abortion rights have long labeled themselves “pro-life” or “pro-choice.” Opposite camps in the immigration debate have sparred over whether to call some immigrants “illegal” or “undocumented.”

But as a similar dynamic creeps into the technical somewhat obscure realm of municipal zoning a growing war about these words shows just how charged — and how widespread — the debate has become even and especially in areas that are uniformly Democratic.

***

Duston a retired real estate agent who owns a five-bedroom Cape Cod in Alcova Heights said she talks with her neighbors about Arlington “ending single-family zoning” because it more clearly communicates how the county’s plan might affect older houses in the neighborhood.

“It hits people where they live” she said. “They can easily visualize the house next door being torn down and a multiunit building going up [and the increase in] cars or people associated with it.”

In October the median home price in Arlington was $650000 and nearly double that — $1.17 million — for a single-family house. But Duston maintains that for younger people with realistic expectations there are plenty of attainable options on the market.

Single-family zoning has for decades been the bedrock of American suburbia and undoing it she added might mean fewer empty parking spots more crowding on roads and fewer trees to offer shade and green.

Jenny Schuetz an urban economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said that “ending single-family zoning” is an imprecise way of describing the change — and it’s one that can mislead people.

“'Ending single-family zoning’ — that doesn’t tell you what it’s going to turn into” said Schuetz who has expressed support for Arlington’s plan. “Is this going to turn into a neighborhood where you’re allowed to build single-family and duplexes or where you can build single-family duplexes and skyscrapers?”

When Minneapolis officials first proposed a plan similar to Arlington’s in 2018 they framed their effort as one that would allow new multifamily types of housing in every neighborhood. Concerned residents ginned up opposition with red yard signs that warned “Don’t Bulldoze Our Neighborhoods.”

Yet it was local advocates for the policy Schuetz notes who doubled down on the idea of the plan “ending” Minneapolis’s single-family zoning.

One local group of urbanists created a meme in the style of a retro national parks ad with a cartoon beaver: “Remember: Only you can prevent sprawl. Help keep America green. End single-family zoning.”

As other governments started following suit — in Oregon then Sacramento then all of California — the idea of “ending single-family zoning” caught on as a shorthand. That included some who were vehemently against the idea.

Advertisement

In the throes of his 2020 reelection campaign for president Donald Trump penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed in which he lambasted Democrats’ efforts to “abolish” single-family zoning.

“America’s suburbs are a shining example of the American Dream where people can live in their own homes in safe pleasant neighborhoods” he wrote alongside Ben Carson the secretary of Housing and Urban Development. “The left wants to take that American Dream away from you.”

Schuetz the Brookings economist said this kind of rhetoric demonstrates how the phrase can be used to provoke a more upsetting — and false — notion: that banning single-family zoning means single-family houses will be banned too.

“Whether you’re offering a vision of something positive for society or criticizing something that exists does matter in the tone” she said. “The ‘invading a single-family neighborhood’ language that gets used all the time can also feel aggressive and hostile to people.”

When Arlington County planners launched a multiyear study in 2019 to consider how to solve the county’s housing crunch they instead chose to call their initiative “missing middle housing.”

The term was coined by the Berkeley Calif. architect Daniel Parolek to describe the housing types that did not exist under many cities’ zoning codes: townhouses small apartment buildings and much more.

“The reason we created this concept was to effectively frame the conversation about this need for these housing choices” said Parolek who presented it at an Arlington event in 2016 “without using terminology that comes with some baggage.""

But the mere effort to study the idea immediately generated concern among Arlington civic leaders who feared it would mean “ending single-family zoning” even as some county board members insisted that was not yet on the table.

Skip to end of carousel What is ‘missing middle’ housing? arrow left arrow right “Missing middle” housing is a term that refers to small multiunit residential buildings like townhouses duplexes and garden apartments.

It covers a range of housing types that fit into the “middle” between detached single-family houses and high-rise apartment buildings in terms of scale form and number of units. Local laws have made it difficult or impossible to build this type of housing in many neighborhoods. That is why advocates say it is “missing.”

Indeed many suburban neighborhoods in the United States were developed under zoning rules that allow for only one house with a yard on each lot.

This is sometimes known as “single-family zoning.” A growing list of governments including Minneapolis and Oregon have in recent years voted to roll back their zoning rules and make it easier to build missing middle housing.

Several localities in the D.C. area are following suit: Arlington County passed a similar policy in spring 2023 and Alexandria followed in the fall. Changes that eliminate single-family zoning still allow for the construction of standalone houses. These policies simply mean that other types of homes — such as missing middle — can be built there too.

But in Northern Virginia and other communities around the country these efforts have been met with political pushback and legal action. Many longtime homeowners say more homes and more density could ruin their single-family neighborhoods.

They worry that missing middle will crowd schools clog sewers remove trees and make it harder to find parking.

Critics also say the idea will not create housing for residents being priced out and will only benefit real estate developers instead. Advocates who support missing middle say this concept reverses racist zoning policies and create more affordable options.

New duplexes or townhouses will still be expensive they say but will still cost less than single-family houses.

That will add supply to the real estate market and bring down skyrocketing housing costs. 1 / 6 End of carousel

Three years later with those changes on the horizon skeptics of the policy — as well as some of its proponents — maintain that the phrase “missing middle” has mucked up some of the public conversation.

“I don’t think there’s a missing middle” said Duston the Alcova Heights homeowner. Although most of Arlington’s residential land is reserved exclusively for single-family homes she pointed out that nearly one third of the county’s housing stock is made up of townhouses duplexes and other small apartments.

For residents who are not closely tuned-in Duston added the label seems to point toward creating housing for a different middle: the middle class.

White who canvasses with the group YIMBYs of NOVA often sets up a whiteboard at the farmers market asking passersby to mark down what types of homes they’ve lived in: high-rise apartments detached single-family houses and everything in between.

A renter who splits a two-bedroom in Westover she said that Arlington officials have had “a little bit of trouble” trying to figure out how to phrase and frame their effort.

Instead she often talks about “re-legalizing” missing middle housing. The townhouses and duplexes scattered around Arlington are there White added because they were legal to build until the early- to mid-20th century — when the county codified land-use policies to keep out low-income residents.

Those small multifamily homes “are some of the most affordable units available in Arlington” she said.

Some county board members have said they would have thought twice about the “missing middle” label. Erika Moore a county spokeswoman said Arlington officials have added mention of “expanding housing choice” to their official study on the idea. But two years into their efforts with a vote expected in March at the earliest they opted not to rebrand the whole thing.

Mayor Joe Pannullo led the fight against the initial application proposed in 2018. Today he still isn't happy.

""When I ride by there I get sick"" Pannullo said from his office this week. ""My stomach is upset. I lose sleep over what's happening there.""

The stretch of land once owned by Mondelez International Inc. which Pannullo said was ""probably the most beautiful piece of property that we have here in East Hanover"" will soon be home to more than 500 housing units built by the Jersey City-based Kushner Real Estate Group.

KRE received approval from the township Land Use/Planning Board in August 2021 for a residential development with 548 units on more than 74 acres along River Road and Deforest Avenue.

The initial phase of the project includes 239 luxury rental units across five four-story buildings said George Cahn a public relations official representing KRE. It will feature mostly one- and two-bedroom residences with some three-bedroom homes in select buildings. Thirty-four rental units will be reserved for low- and moderate-income residents.

""We’re excited to enter the East Hanover market and look forward to delivering a high-quality residential development to this well-located and desirable suburban community"" said KRE President Jonathan Kushner.

Mondelez a snack manufacturer whose brands include Oreos Chips Ahoy and Ritz crackers sold 80 acres of its 120-acre property to KRE to help the township meet its court-mandated fair-share housing obligation Pannullo said. KRE began site work late this summer and the township was told the project will take two to three years to complete.

The application originally called for about 1500 units Pannullo said before he and the township fought to reduce it to the current 548.

""Am I happy with that? No. Is that a win? Yes it is"" the mayor said. ""But the only way I would have been happy and the residents of this town would have been happy [is] if nothing went through.""

Pannullo criticized KRE for its work on the site saying the company has been ""nothing but uncooperative"" with the township during the process. He said there are frequent issues on the property from trucks not traveling on proper routes to dust blown off the site and silt running into storm drains.

Pannullo said he's not against building affordable housing. Rather the scope of the project has him and other officials concerned about the effect on roads schools and other aspects of the township infrastructure.

Joe Tempesta East Hanover's municipal administrator said the township will likely have to add police officers and buy another firetruck to cope with the influx of residents in the new units.

""Not only do they force this down your throat but as the mayor said we're left to pick up the pieces with the infrastructure"" Tempesta said. ""These people move in they're part of our community. We still have to provide the services for them.""

East Hanover is one of more than a dozen municipalities suing Gov. Phil Murphy and demanding that the state Council on Affordable Housing which was disbanded in 2015 be brought back to determine housing quotas in each town. Pannullo has volunteered to sit on the board saying municipalities should ""decide their own fate"" on low-income housing based on what the community can bear.

The council was formed after a series of landmark court decisions that found suburban New Jersey towns were blocking housing that would serve low-income residents. The agency's demise has shifted the debate back to the courts where affordable housing advocates and private developers have sued municipalities to win approvals for new construction.

When the municipalities sued Murphy last summer the nonprofit Fair Share Housing Center said the towns were trying to revive a system that was “dysfunctional.""

“Towns that want to go back to that system want to circumvent their constitutional affordable housing obligations and keep out low-income people and people of color from their towns” said Alex Staropoli director of advocacy and communications for the center.

But the results of the current system are ""just totally unfair"" Pannullo said this week. ""I'm going to do everything in my power and the council will do everything in their power to protect the peace and tranquility of East Hanover.""

With site work now underway Pannullo is looking ahead to when the complex is expected to be finished. He has no doubt residents will accept the newcomers who move in but he wishes the township had more of a say in the matter.

""The people that move in there I'm 100% sure will be people that are going to love and embrace this town"" Pannullo said. ""They'll probably work here at one time or another. They'll contribute to this town being a great town. It's not about the people that are going to be here — it's about the amount of human beings that you're going to stick into a small area.""

SWEET news for choc fans — boffins have finally come up with low-calorie versions of their favourite bars.

Experts have found a way of slashing the sugar and fat in honeycomb caramel nougat marshmallow and fudge by 75 per cent.

The Cadbury team reckon they can replace them with plant-based fibres without compromising on taste or texture.

It could mean healthier versions of Crunchie Caramel Double Decker Fudge and Turkish Delight bars.

The new tech may also help manufacturers avoid any future sugar tax.

Adam Harris of Mondelez International which owns Cadbury said: “We know consumers are not willing to compromise on taste or texture.

“We’ve had scientists working on this tech for several years and we’re really proud of our progress.”

Mondelez has filed four patent applications with the UK Intellectual Property Office.

One states fillings can be made from a blend of up to ten different plant fibres.

These have “the same qualities taste texture and function” as full-sugar versions.

There is no strict definition of blue chip stocks but they are generally recognized as long-standing reliably profitable large-cap businesses.

These are the companies that are seen as the pillars of American enterprise. They are the components of the Dow like Walt Disney Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson.

Blue chip stocks offer a number of benefits including safety income profitability and a proven ability to bounce back from recessions and other economic shocks. Let's take a look at each one of these primary benefits.

1. Blue chip stocks are safe

Year to date the Dow Jones Industrial Average has outperformed the Nasdaq by an unusually wide margin as the chart below shows.

The Dow is beating the Nasdaq by more than 20 points currently because in bear markets and uncertain economic environments investors flock to safe stocks like those on the Dow.

That's why so many Dow stocks have risen this year even in a down market and the winners are from diverse sectors including Caterpillar Coca-Cola and UnitedHealth.

A rising-interest rate environment also favors blue chip stocks as most of them tend to be highly profitable. In a high-interest rate environment future profits become less valuable so investors look to stocks that are generating strong cash flows in the moment.

These are precisely the types of stocks that Warren Buffett has favored and that strategy has served him well over his investing career especially in bear markets.

Because blue chips are able to outperform in bear markets and maintain profitability they tend to be safer than other stocks.

2. Blue chips pay dividends

While it's not a hard-and-fast rule that blue chip stocks must pay dividends nearly all of them do. That's because these are mature profitable companies that have ample cash to return through dividends or share buybacks. Many of them are Dividend Aristocrats meaning they've raised their dividends for every year for at least 25 years.

In addition every Dow stock pays a dividend. Paying a dividend also helps make a stock more defensive as yields will rise as the stock price goes down making the stock more attractive to buyers.

Over the long run dividend stocks have a history of outperforming their counterparts that don't pay dividends. This is likely because dividend stocks carry less risk and these companies have already proven themselves in the market as they've generated consistent cash flows for decades and have the kind of businesses that can be expected to continue bringing in cash.

3. Blue chip stocks have competitive advantages

Companies don't become blue chip stocks by luck or accident. They have proven their mettle over decades withstanding competitors adapting to changes in the market and delivering consistent growth along the way.

While blue chip stocks don't tend to be high-growth companies they use their competitive advantages to find new ways to grow. Coca-Cola for example has a long track record of acquiring smaller beverage brands and folding them into its distribution network to accelerate their sales. The company has also made more high-profile deals to reach into new corners of the beverage market acquiring Costa Coffee for example and taking a stake in and forming a strategic partnership with Monster Beverage.

As another example Disney benefits from a unique flywheel in entertainment where it's able to monetize its intellectual property in both box releases TV shows theme park rides live entertainment consumer products like toys and more. It's also made several acquisitions bringing in valuable content like Marvel and Star Wars.

Blue chip stocks have stood the test of time and that is often because they have a competitive advantage such as a well-known brand and an industry-leading market position. It's no accident that these companies have been a market leader for generations.

If you're looking to make investing easy on yourself be like Warren Buffett and buy some blue chip stocks today.",,,,,,,,,

Adrienne loved her grandkids going to their games family parties BYU her dogs Neil Diamond Billy Joel Elvis Presley Nat King Cole and Alabama. She loved to sing along to the total embarrassment of her sons and grandchildren. We will especially miss her singing with all her heart “Give Me One More Shot” by Alabama. Her example of hard work loyalty and devoted faith to her Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ were traits her family will always hold dear. Thankfully her family had time to say goodbye to her before she passed through the veil to the waiting arms of her son Steve her family who have gone before and the tail wagging of her many dogs who’ve been waiting for her for a long time.

The position laid out by US State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel sought to balance between the Biden administration’s opposition to Israeli settlements and its belief that the UN is not a platform for dealing with such issues.

The settlement blacklist was created in February 2020 in response to a 2016 UN Human Rights Council resolution calling for a “database for all businesses engaged in specific activities related to Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory.”

The list contained the names of 112 firms — 94 Israeli and 18 foreign including Airbnb TripAdvisor Booking.com and Motorola Solutions. In Norway the list led the sovereign wealth fund to dump companies involved in settlements citing concern over human rights violations.

The database returned to the news this week following a report in the Axios news site that the Biden administration has been pressuring the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights not to update the list.

Patel did not go as far as to say that the US was pressuring the UN on the matter but he acknowledge that the administration has made its position against the blacklist clear to officials in the UN human rights office.

“The US opposes the creation of this database… and continues to oppose any work to update it” he said.

“We have not provided and will not provide any information to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on this database and our position has been repeatedly made clear in public statements as well as in meetings that we’ve had directly with the Office of the High Commissioner.”

The State Department spokesman argued that the database “only serves to reinforce an anti-Israeli bias” which the Biden administration has repeatedly condemned and worked to oppose.

Patel also argued during the press briefing that the blacklist “poses a genuine threat to companies doing business or considering business operations in the region.”

Asked how this threat could manifest Patel declined to elaborate.

The remarks came less than a week after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the Biden administration’s position against Israeli settlements warning the incoming right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu that the US will “unequivocally oppose” settlement expansion as well any move toward annexation of the West Bank.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Reuters) -Wall Street stocks oil prices and U.S. Treasury yields all rose on Monday as investors took an optimistic stance ahead of the last round of transatlantic central bank interest rate hikes this year hoping that the now-hefty pace of increases in borrowing costs will finally slow.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 1.6% the S&P 500 gained 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite rose about 1.25%. Boosting the indexes was a nearly 3% rise in shares of Microsoft Corp following the software maker's plans to buy a stake in the London Stock Exchange Group.

After a multi-week decline oil prices also jumped as a key crude pipeline supplying the U.S. closed and Russia threatened a production cut even as China's loosening COVID-19 restrictions bolstered the fuel demand outlook. [O/R]

The dollar was virtually flat in thin trading as investors awaited in the release of U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data for November on Tuesday when a slowdown in core annual inflation is anticipated.

The MSCI all country stock index gained 0.55% still down nearly 18% so far this year wiping out all gains from 2021.

In Europe the STOXX index of 600 companies was down about 0.5% as investors awaited interest rate moves.

In Asia MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 1.3% erasing some of the previous week's gains stemming from optimism that China is finally opening up its economy with the dismantling of its zero-COVID policy. Japan's Nikkei eased 0.2%.

CENTRAL BANK WATCH

Economists expect the Fed on Wednesday and the European Central Bank and Bank of England on Thursday to all raise rates by 50 basis points - slowing down from the 75 basis point hikes seen in recent meetings.

Patrick Spencer vice chair of equities at Baird investment bank said central banks will start taking a less aggressive stance this week though Tuesday's CPI data will be critical.

""It's the last important week of the year after this week you've got no real sort of catalysts. If the CPI is a muted number we're off to the races and we'll get our year-end rally"" Spencer said.

But irrespective of the CPI deflationary pressures are increasing with crude oil prices down for the year and iron ore lumber and house prices also down Spencer said.

""All this talk of recession I think it is certainly in the price it's in the markets. The key about recession is generally employment and I think employment is going to be stronger than people give it credit"" Spencer said.

While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday at its last meeting of 2022 the focus will also be on the central bank's updated economic projections and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference.

""This week's focus is likely to be centered on CPI and the Fed. To us that is yesterday's news"" Morgan Stanley market strategists wrote in a note on Monday.

""While it's important for ... year-end trading ranges the final chapter to this bear market is all about the path of earnings estimates which are far too high in our view.""

DOLLAR MUTED YIELDS EDGE UP

U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly on Monday ahead of the Fed's next move. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 4.4 basis points at 3.613% and the yield on 30-year bonds was up 2.9 basis points at 3.579%. Two-year yields which typically move in step with interest rate expectations rose 5.8 basis points to 4.388%.

In currency markets the dollar index was slightly lower at $105.01 not far from the five-month trough of $104.1 hit a week ago. The euro was also flat at $1.0535.

Brent crude futures settled 2.5% higher at $77.99 a barrel and U.S. crude finished at $73.17 a barrel 3% higher on the day.

Gold prices slipped as investors stayed on the sidelines awaiting news later in the week. Spot gold dropped 0.9% to $1780.56 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 1.10% to $1778.30 an ounce.

The Indian stock market is currently the most expensive in the world. A dollar-based index MSCI India is trading at a premium of 43% and 92% to MSCI - Emerging Markets and MSCI - World respectively.Other stock markets are so cheap that it is a rising risk to the future return of the domestic stock market.It is rational to deploy additional funds in developed and emerging markets (EM). Because the valuation gap between India & Others has widened exponentially and the domestic economy is forecasted to slow down in FY24.India is forecasted to grow by 6% in FY24 compared to 6.8% and 8.7% in FY23 and FY22. Foreign investors will have the option to deploy and shift funds from one country to another while possibilities for a domestic investor will be limited.However there are options to invest in foreign stocks and based funds through direct schemes which is not the debate of the article.We will discuss what a retail investor should expect and act as the risk of underperformance in India is rising:Firstly we should understand that the general outlook for emerging markets has improved. Overall EM economies are expected to improve in CY2023. According to the IMF's October 2022 report the Emerging and Developing Asia region's GDP will grow by 4.9% in 2023 up from 4.4% in 2022.The Chinese economy can provide a wonderful rally supported by the relaxation in the zero tolerance Covid-19 policy. Similarly the South-East Asian Region is expected to perform well and benefit the overall EM stock market.This will bring invariable positivity to India. We can underperform but expect moderate returns without falling into negative territory.Secondly as the EM economies improve world supply constraints will be resolved. Supplies were heavily impacted by the pandemic and the issue expanded in 2022 through the Russia-Ukraine war.The effect started to diminish and is visible from the fall in commodity prices. The majority of Asian EMs are heavy importers & traders of commodities and related products. Ease in inflation & increase in supplies will benefit EMs especially India by fall in crude & metal prices inching margins higher.Thirdly the valuation of total EMs has become lucrative while the economic worst is over. This will trigger buying interest for EMs. The valuation of MSCI-EM is at 11.3x which is 25% below compared to the long-term average.Generally India gains from the positive movement of EM being an important part of the category.However this time there is a risk of underperformance in the short term due to premium valuation. Still India will be able to garner gains by being a resilient long-term player. A fall in the share of foreign inflows can be supported by stable investments by retail and DII inflows.A retail investor should not be very concerned about the risk of underperformance by India. We should continue to invest in India with moderate expectations.Coincidentally if we have a consolidation in the short term it should be taken as a shot in the arm generating an opportunity to buy deeply.Such a correction can be triggered if the recession risk enlarges to a long stagnation surprises in the union Budget 2023 and the general election of 2024.An important caution while investing is to avoid highly valued stocks and sectors. Focus on areas that are going to benefit from the fall in inflation.And also provide an ample share of investment in bond papers which offer a healthy coupon rate from 7.5% to 10% annually.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW50YW5kZXIuY29tL2VuL3ByZXNzLXJvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi8xMi9zYW50YW5kZXItYW1vbmctdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1tb3N0LXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWJhbmtzLWluLXRoZS1kb3ctam9uZXMtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktaW5kZXgtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Santander included among the world's most sustainable banks in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 2022,"Santander scored 83 points out of 100 placing it in the 98thpercentile of all banks reviewed.

The bank is among the top three European banks in this index.

Santander has featured in the index which assesses companies based on environmental social and governance criteria for the last 22 years.

Madrid 10 December 2022.

Santander has ranked among the world’s most sustainable banks in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 2022 and among the top three in Europe. The bank scored 83 points out of 100 placing it in the 98th percentile of all banks reviewed. Santander has featured on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past 22 years. This index an international corporate sustainability benchmark measures companies’ sustainable performance against economic environmental and social criteria.

The bank scored well in every category: economic (86) environmental (76) and social (83). It also highlighted areas where the bank has improved such as financial inclusion environmental and social reporting and climate strategy privacy protection and customer relationship management.

Santander has achieved good results in other similar benchmarks including MSCI Sustainalytics CDP ISS Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index FTSE4Good Index and Vigeo Eiris of Moodys.

The group ended the first half of the year as the world’s leader in renewable energy finance with over 2.4 billion euros in 33 funding transactions and a worldwide market share of 6.4% according to Infralogic’s ranking. In the past decade Santander has been a leading bank in renewable energy finance ranking among the top three in the world in number of transactions and the top five in funding volume.

In supporting the fight against climate change and the green transition Santander continues to make progress on its goal to reach net zero carbon emissions group-wide by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement. This year Santander outlined three new interim targets to decarbonize its portfolios by 2030: a 29% reduction in absolute emissions financed in the energy sector; a 33% reduction in emissions intensity in aviation sector; and a 32% reduction in emissions intensity in the steel sector. The targets add to those the Group had announced in February 2021 which include a 46% reduction in emissions financed in the in the power generation sector.

To achieve these targets Santander is focused on supporting customers in their green transition. Santander remains committed to earmarking €220 billion for green financing between 2019 and 2030 and has also set an intermediate target of €120 billion for 2025. As of September 2022 €78.7 billion had been mobilized.

Furthermore Santander has financially empowered more than nine million citizens by providing access to the banking system financial education and financing for individuals and SMEs with difficulties accessing credit. It has awarded more than 387000 scholarships and grantsand has helped more than six million people through its community investment programmes collaborating with NGOs and other social entities. The bank has been recently recognized as global Bank of the Year for Financial Inclusion by The Banker magazine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy9hc2lhbi1zaGFyZXMtZGlwLWRvbGxhci1maXJtcy0wMDE5NDE0MjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall St turns bullish ahead of inflation data Fed action,"By Lawrence Delevingne

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now.

If you’re in the market for fashion stocks then NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) should be at the top of your list.

It’s been a volatile few years for the apparel and fashion industry as a whole and its companies’ share prices in particular. Sales at clothing and accessories stores sank by 26% year-over-year in 2020 as pandemic lockdowns across the globe shuttered stores and kept people lounging around in their sweats at home.

After a year of barely updating their wardrobes consumers went crazy catching up for lost time in 2021 as societies reopened and people began socializing again. Sales jumped by 60% during the first nine months of 2021 and continued to be strong through the first half of this year.

Another slowdown for the industry appears to be underway now however with inflation and depressed consumer sentiment driving fashion sales into negative territory in the second half of this year. McKinsey predicts that the industry will grow by about 2-3% during 2023 primarily due to solid sustained growth in the luxury fashion market which is expected to grow between 5-10%.

That’s not surprising given that luxury retailers and other sellers of high-priced goods tend to weather economic storms better thanks to their focus on the wealthy consumer who isn’t as affected by economic downturns.

The fashion market is expected to be strong in both China and the United States growing by as much 6% or 7% in each country while an energy crisis in Europe is expected to lead to a 1% to 4% downturn for the fashion market in that region next year.

As cash-strapped consumers more carefully consider their clothing options the rise of secondhand apparel is becoming apparent and represents another challenge for apparel brands and retailers. The secondhand market is expected to grow by 24% to $119 billion this year and to reach $218 billion in sales by 2026. Meanwhile the broader apparel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% through 2026 hitting $843 billion and those projections might be somewhat optimistic.

The secondhand trend is particularly pronounced in North America where secondhand apparel has been outgrowing the broader apparel market by a staggering 700%. In response some fashion brands are beginning to launch their own resale initiatives to bring some of that market back within their own ecosystem.

Story continues

All told it could be a lean year or two for some or even many fashion companies and their corresponding shares which makes pinpointing only the best fashion stocks to buy now a priority for investors interested in the space.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) rank among the top five best fashion stocks to buy right now. Just cracking the list in 11th is Tilly’s Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) which sells apparel and accessories geared towards kids and teens.

Hedge fund ownership of Tilly’s Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) peaked in the third quarter of 2018 and has declined by 33% since. It did tick up during Q3 of this year however as multiple funds opened small stakes in the company. Among them were Israel Englander’s Millennium Management and Frederick Disanto’s Ancora Advisors.

Tilly’s Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) was a big beneficiary of the pandemic but has struggled to match up against those tougher comps in 2022. The third quarter wasn’t great but the company did perform better than both it and the market expected pulling in $178 million in revenue and $0.17 per share in earnings both of which beat estimates. Comparable net sales in Q4 had declined by 18.5% through November 29 compared to the year-ago period.

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17

Hedge funds bailed on Guess’ Inc. (NYSE:GES) in droves during the first quarter as there was a 41% decline in the number of smart money managers long the stock. There was a slight rebound in Q2 as Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies and Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital were among the funds to add GES to their 13F portfolios.

Guess’ Inc. (NYSE:GES) has hung in there somewhat better than Tilly’s this year growing Q3 sales by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis thanks to continued strong performance in Europe. The jeans and apparel maker’s operating margin stood at 8.6% in Q3 down from 14.1% a year earlier though company expects that figure to rebound to 13.2% in Q4 on an adjusted basis.

Guess’ Inc. (NYSE:GES) is undergoing several initiatives to improve its customer acquisition and retention efforts as well as its marketing capabilities.

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22

There’s been a 29% drop in the number of hedge funds long Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) over the past two quarters with the stock hitting a ten-year low in smart money ownership as a result. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates sold off its stake in RL during Q3 while Arrowstreet Capital founded by Peter Rathjens Bruce Clarke and John Campbell held the largest long position consisting of 801348 shares.

Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) could be poised for a good holiday season if demand trends for the high-end fashion retailer are strong as the company significantly bolstered its inventory ahead of the fourth quarter to stave off any potential supply chain challenges. High-end retailers tend to perform better during economic downturns due to their wealthier clientele being less affected by the conditions of the day which the company appears to be banking on.

There are some troubling signs in the company’s recent results however which may be why hedge funds have been bailing on the stock. Ralph Lauren grew sales by 13% in its Q1 of fiscal 2023 but sales growth slowed to 5% year-over-year in its fiscal Q2. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)’s bottom line has also been getting pinched due to rising cost of goods sold which jumped by 14% in fiscal Q2 dwarfing the company’s sales growth. That contributed to earnings falling to $2.23 per share compared to $2.62 a year earlier despite the company having also bought back over 6 million shares or about 8.4% of its outstanding float prior to those purchases.

8. Victorias Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24

Hedge funds showed noteworthy interest in Victorias Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO) during its first quarter on the market as a publicly traded company following its separation from Bath & Body Works Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) in Q3 of 2021. That interest has waned considerably in the four quarters since however as there’s been a drop in hedge fund ownership of VSCO during each of those quarters.

The lingerie retailer was spun off in part so a new management team could take charge and help turn around the struggling company which suffered a major sales drop during its fiscal 2020 year. Victorias Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO)’s gross margins have trailed its peers by a wide margin (pardon the pun?) which is something management has been focused on improving with some success but more work remains to be done.

Victorias Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO)‘s Q3 comparable sales slumped by 11% year-over-year with the company pulling in $1.32 billion in sales in line with estimates. The retailer’s EPS of $0.29 topped estimates by a healthy $0.06 and also came in ahead of the company’s own guidance. Cowen analyst Jonna Kim has a $45 price target and ‘Outperform’ rating on VSCO shares. The analyst believes the company’s sales will remain pressured in the near-term but that longer-term it has a good opportunity to regain share in the U.S. and grow internationally.

T-6. Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25

Ownership of Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey sank to a nine-year low during the second quarter but rebounded big time during Q3 shooting up by nearly 50%. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group and Andrew Kurita’s Kettle Hill Capital Management were two of the funds to add HBI to their 13F portfolios during Q3.

Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) shares have trended down throughout the year losing 63% of their value which may have prompted some funds to go bargain hunting. The clothing and undergarments manufacturer has been facing several challenges in recent quarters including tighter inventory management among retailers and rising costs. Sales slumped by 7% year-over-year in Q3 sliding to $1.67 billion while adjusted net income fared far worse tumbling by 46% to $102 million. The company’s guidance for the holiday season also came in well below estimates with projections for as little as $1.4 billion in sales and $0.04 in adjusted EPS compared to $1.63 billion and $0.21 estimates respectively.

Chartwell Investment Partners shared some of the challenges that Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) has faced of late in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:

“The three worst-performing stocks in the Dividend Equity accounts includes Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI 1.1%) down 30.1%. Hanesbrands’ management is executing well but the challenging environment includes supply-chain headwinds higher input costs and some post-Covid inventory build-up.”

T-6. The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25

Hedge funds were adding The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) to their portfolio in the first year of the pandemic but many unloaded the stock during the third quarter of 2021. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management owns the largest GPS position among the funds tracked by our database while Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management built a large stake in the company during Q3.

The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) was another fashion stock trading at bargain bin prices heading into Q4 but the stock has enjoyed a nice resurgence this quarter gaining 76%. As noted above high-end products tend to perform better than their counterparts during economic slowdowns and that’s been evident at The Gap. A strong performance from the company’s Banana Republic brand which grew comparable sales by 10% during Q3 was driven in part by the brand’s wider range of premium items.

The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS)’s core brand also swung to 4% comparable sales growth after two quarters of double digit declines. All told The Gap grew sales by 2% to $4.04 billion during Q3 which beat estimates. It was also far more profitable than analysts expected pulling in $0.71 per share on an adjusted basis against expectations of neutral earnings.

Nasdaq won approval to expand the limits on capital raises in direct listings in an effort to encourage more companies to go public using them with New York Stock Exchange soon to follow.

Nasdaq Inc won approval to expand the limits on capital raises in direct listings in an effort to encourage more companies to go public using them with New York Stock Exchange soon to follow.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved Nasdaq’s request earlier this month and is expected to do the same for NYSE’s proposal according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information.

Representatives for NYSE and the SEC declined to comment.

“Once we see the new issue markets open this will be much more topical in terms of being an alternative” Karen Snow senior vice-president and head of US listings and revenue at Nasdaq said in an interview. “This is a silver bullet because you now have the option to issue primary not just secondary shares.”

The revised rules on both exchanges could make direct listings more appealing to companies as an alternative to traditional initial public offerings. The changes will allow companies to raise more money in a direct listing as well as garner wider investor participation.

Nasdaq and NYSE already allow a company to raise money in a direct listing but only if the shares are sold in the range stated in the company’s registration statement. This has proved too limiting and presents too high of a risk of a failed offering. As a result no companies have raised capital in a direct listing to date.

“We’ve removed the friction with this solution and you will see large and small companies using it on a more regular basis going forward” Snow said.

The new Nasdaq rule will allow a company to sell shares in the opening auction on the exchange at a price outside of the range in their registration statement — up to 20% below and 80% above. It will also require that the company listing securities retain and identify an underwriter.

Nasdaq scored a direct listing from Coinbase Global Inc. in 2021 which was the biggest of its kind. Companies including Slack Technologies Inc Palantir Technologies Inc and Roblox Corp have listed on the NYSE.

In those direct listings the companies didn’t issue any new shares. Unlike a traditional IPO banks in a direct listing don’t underwrite shares or allocate them to institutional investors the night before they begin trading. They are instead sold by shareholders on the day of the listing based on market demand. One of the key advantages of a direct listing is that that investors can sell shares without waiting for a lock-up period — typically six months — to expire.

Heralded by some as the cure for the shortcomings of IPOs there have been only 11 significant direct listings on US exchanges with eyeware retailer Warby Parker Inc’s September 2021 debut being one of the most recent.

The most recent large listing was by cannabis company Bright Green Corp whose shares surged as high as $58 in their Nasdaq debut in May and have since fallen to about 53 cents.

Traditional IPOs set a record last year with more than 1000 companies raising almost $339bn on US exchanges according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So far this year only 207 companies have raised a combined total of $24bn the data show.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWRpbmd2aWV3LmNvbS9jaGFydC9TTUNJL3hOdzlhYnZrLVdpbGxpYW0tTy1OZWlsLVJ1bGUtV0FMTC1PRi1CTFVFL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William O'Neil Rule – WALL OF BLUE for NASDAQ:SMCI by TintinTrading,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWRpbmd2aWV3LmNvbS9jaGFydC9TTUNJL3hOdzlhYnZrLVdpbGxpYW0tTy1OZWlsLVJ1bGUtV0FMTC1PRi1CTFVFL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B011518A30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The highly anticipated first three episodes of the six-part series titled ""Harry & Meghan"" were released Thursday on Netflix.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex open up in the docuseries about everything from their love story to their decision two years ago to step down from their senior royal roles.

The docuseries directed by Oscar-nominated Liz Garbus is billed as a ""first-hand account of Harry and Meghan's story told with never before seen personal archive."" It opens by noting that interviews for the docuseries were completed by August one month before the death of Harry's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.

Here is a look at the docuseries' biggest moments so far.

Harry and Meghan take on tabloids media coverage

From the first episode of the docuseries on Harry and Meghan offer harsh criticisms of the media and its coverage of their relationship and the royal family.

Harry describes a childhood of being followed by paparazzi leading up to the death of his mother Princess Diana who died following a car crash in 1997 after being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.

""I accept that there will be people around the world who fundamentally disagree with what I've done and how I've done it but I knew that I had to do everything I could to protect my family especially after what happened to my mom"" Harry said referring to his decision with Meghan to leave their senior royal roles. ""I didn't want history to repeat itself.""

Harry also said he was afraid the media pressure would scare off Meghan as it had done with girlfriends before her. ""I was terrified of her being driven away by the media -- the same media who'd driven so many people away from me"" he said.

Meghan described how her life was turned upside down after meeting Harry. She was followed by paparazzi in Toronto where she said neighbors were paid to position a camera on her backyard.

Harry who has taken U.K. tabloids to court in the past also spoke about the royal rota system where different press outlets are given access to cover the royal family.

""If you're part of the royal rota you have priority over the story over everybody else. All royal news goes through the filter of all newspapers within the royal rota most of which apart from the Telegraph happen to be tabloids"" Harry said. ""It all comes down to control. It's like 'This family is ours to exploit. Their trauma is our story and our story and our narrative to control.' ""

Harry's family members absent from docuseries

In the opening seconds of the docuseries Netflix states that members of Britain's royal family ""declined to comment on the content within this series.""

After the docuseries aired royal sources countered that claim telling ABC News that ""neither Buckingham Palace nor Kensington Palace nor any members of the royal family were approached for comment on the content of the series.""

According to royal sources Kensington Palace the household of Harry's brother Prince William and his wife Kate the Princess of Wales received an email purporting to be from a third-party production company via a different unknown organization's email address.

The palace contacted Harry and Meghan's production company Archewell Productions and Netflix to attempt to verify the authenticity of the email but received no response sources claimed.

According to the sources without being able to verify the email's authenticity the palace was ""unable"" to provide any response.

A source at Netflix told ABC News Thursday that communications offices for Harry's father King Charles III and William were contacted in advance and given the right to reply to claims within the series.

Both Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace the household of King Charles III and Camilla the Queen Consort declined Thursday to comment on the docuseries.

Meghan's race put in the spotlight

Harry and Meghan speak out in the first episodes about what Harry calls the ""race element"" of the media coverage of their relationship.

Meghan was born to a white father and a Black mother and grew up biracial in Los Angeles. In the docuseries she said her mother was asked by neighbors if she was the nanny and described witnessing her mother being called the N-word over a parking spot.

Harry says he believes the ""race element"" made their situation different than what other members of the royal family had experienced with the press.

""What people need to understand is as far as a lot of the family were concerned everything that she was being put through they had been put through as well so it was almost like a rite of passage and some of the members of the family were like 'My wife had to go through that so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be protected?' "" he said. ""I said 'The difference here is the race element.' ""

Meghan's mom Doria Ragland said in the series that she told Meghan the negative treatment she received in the British press was due to her race.

""I said to her -- I remember this very clearly -- that 'This is about race' "" Ragland said recalling that Meghan reacted by saying she didn't want to hear that prompting her to respond ""You may not want to hear it but this is what's coming down the pike.""

Sussexes reveal details of their love story

For the first time Harry and Meghan share extensive details of the start of their relationship in 2016 when Meghan was an actress on the TV show ""Suits.""

Harry revealed he saw Meghan on a mutual friend's Instagram page and asked to be connected. The friend is not named by the couple.

They had their first date in July 2016 at Soho House in London followed by a second dinner date at the same location.

After two dates Harry and Meghan went on a five-day trip to Botswana.

""We had to get to know each other before the rest of the world and the media sort of joined in"" Harry said.

He later added of their romance ""When I got to know Meghan more and more I'm like 'Now I'm really falling in love with this girl' so despite my fear I just opened my heart to see what's going to happen.""

The couple also shared details of their engagement which Harry said had to take place in the U.K. and with the queen's permission.

Meghan is heard on a phone call telling a friend the engagement is happening as Harry sets it up in a garden outside Nottingham Cottage their home on the grounds of Kensington Palace.

""It's happening it's happening it's happening. He told me not to peek"" Meghan is heard saying later adding that she said yes immediately when Harry finally proposed.

Harry says Meghan reminds him of Princess Diana

In one clip Meghan who has two children with Harry is seen holding a baby and showing them a framed picture on the wall of Harry's mom Diana whom she calls ""Grandma Diana.""

Later Harry described the similarities he sees between his wife and his mom.

""So much of what Meghan is and how she is is so similar to my mom"" Harry said. ""She has the same compassion. She has the same empathy. She has the same confidence. She has this warmth about her.""

Harry also said that he sees Diana in himself too.

""I think for so many people in the family especially obviously the men there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit in the mold as opposed to somebody who you perhaps are destined to be with the difference between making decisions with your head or your heart"" he said. ""And my mom certainly made most of her decisions if not all of them from her heart. I am my mother's son.""

Harry gives a glimpse into pressures of royal life

The docuseries is also a rare look into Britain's royal family from Harry and Meghan's perspective.

Harry is the fifth in line to the British throne. His father Charles is currently king and his older brother William is the heir to the throne.

Harry said his childhood memories are mostly ""of being swarmed by paparazzi.""

""Rarely did we have a holiday without someone with a camera jumping out of a bush or something"" he said. ""Within the family the system the advice that's always given is don't react. Don't feed into it.""

""There was always pressure with its fair share of drama stress and also tears"" he continued. ""And witnessing those tears I could always see it on my mom's face I thought 'Who am I? What am I a part of?' ""

Charles William and other members of the royal family have not commented publicly on the Sussexes' docuseries.

Meghan's mom friends speak out for the first time

Ragland Meghan's mom and the only member of Meghan's family to attend her wedding to Harry in 2018 spoke out in the docuseries for the first time about her daughter being thrust into the spotlight after meeting Harry.

""I am Meghan's mom"" Ragland sad introducing herself. ""And um the last five years have been challenging. I'm ready to have my voice heard that's for sure a little bit of my experience as her mom.""

Ragland described her first time meeting Harry. ""He's like 6'1 handsome man with red hair"" she said. ""Really great manners. He was just really nice and they looked really happy together. Yeah like he was the one.""

She also described raising Meghan on her own after she and Meghan's father Thomas Markle divorced when Meghan their only child was young. Meghan said later in the docuseries that she would spend weekdays with her mom and weekends with her father from whom she is now estranged.

""We had a nice network of women who really helped me raise Meg"" Ragland said saying she was helped by her mother sister and friends.

""She was always so easy to get along with very congenial making friends. She a very empathic child very mature"" Ragland said of Meghan.

Meghan's friends also spoke out in the docuseries including her ""Suits"" co-star Abigail Spencer ""Suits"" producer Silver Tree and tennis star Serena Williams.

One friend Lucy Fraser said she warned Meghan about the intensity of the British press in the early days of her relationship with Harry.

""I remember saying to her 'When this goes public it is not going to be easy"" Fraser said. ""The U.K. media are notorious for doing whatever they can to get a story and that they will go through rubbish bins they will try and break into accounts. They will do whatever they can to get an exclusive and make money. I remember she was quite shocked and she was like 'Really? They would do that?' And I said 'Well yeah when it's going to make them millions.' ""

Meghan addresses her family challenges

Meghan her mom and Harry all spoke about the challenges that being thrust into the royal spotlight brought on Meghan's family.

Ragland spoke about being followed by paparazzi near her Los Angeles-area home.

""I felt unsafe a lot"" she said. ""I couldn't just walk my dog I couldn't just go to work. There was always someone there waiting for me following me to work. I felt I was being stalked by the paparazzi.""

She also spoke about the disappointment she said she felt when Meghan's father was accused of staging paparazzi photos shortly before the Sussexes' wedding.

""I was absolutely stunned that Tom would become part of this circus"" said Ragland. ""I felt sad that the media would run with this that he would capitalize. Certainly as a parent no that's not what you do. That's not parenting.""

Thomas Markle did not attend Harry and Meghan's wedding and is now estranged from the couple.

Meghan alleged that her dad would not call her or Harry and said she found out through a tabloid that he would not attend her wedding.

Harry said he carries the blame for their estrangement.

""Of course it's incredibly sad what happened. She had a father before this and now she doesn't have a father"" said Harry. ""I shoulder that because if Meg wasn't with me then her dad would still be her dad.""

More to come

The final three episodes of the docuseries will be released on Netflix on Dec. 15 and appear to cover Harry and Meghan's wedding and their exit from their royal roles.

The series is part of a deal the couple inked in 2020 with Netflix shortly after they stepped down from their royal roles. The Sussexes now helm a California-based production company Archewell Productions.

Next month Harry will release his memoir titled ""Spare.""

The publisher said the book contains ""raw unflinching honesty"" and described it as a ""landmark publication full of insight revelation self-examination and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.""

When the book was first announced last year Harry said it would be a ""firsthand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful.""

Half Bad: The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself won’t be returning for a second season just after we’d highlighted it as one of the seven best new Netflix shows this month.

Sadly yes Netflix have cancelled this. Very proud of it and really liked the people I got to make it with. Sorry not to be able to finish the story... https://t.co/HUGi13R6OwDecember 9 2022

That story was based on Sally Green’s YA fantasy novel Half Bad. The Netflix version tells the story of Nathan Byrne the illegitimate son of the “World’s Most Dangerous Blood Witch” who becomes friends with a new classmate Annalise. Annalise it turns out just happens to be the daughter of the rival Fairborn Witchers’ leader putting him at the center of a supernatural war.

In its tweet Imaginarium highlighted the critical acclaim the show received over its short run. Indeed at the time of writing Half Bad has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 93% fresh and only one dissenting critical review in the 14 collected.

“The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself is the best YA fantasy Netflix has ever made by a wide margin — and that's because it's not afraid to take risks” wrote David Opie of Digital Spy.

At Den of Geek Rosie Fletcher was also hugely positive calling the show a “clever adaptation that takes the bones of the much-loved book and adds its own flavor.” Like others the review expressed excitement for a second series and indeed others were optimistic that The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself could avoid the same fate that’s befallen 16 shows cancelled by Netflix this year alone.

At Ready Steady Cut Jonathon Wilston described the show as “as guaranteed a hit as the platform has had in some time.” Andrew Murray at The Upcoming argued that it had “the style personality and ideas” to “avoid becoming another casualty of cancellation as has been the case with so many other similar shows.”

Neither proved correct.

A short-sighted strategy

This just goes to show once again that there really is no magic formula for a hit show no matter how much streaming platforms and writers would like there to be one. By all accounts Half Bad did everything right but evidently it didn’t do the numbers to justify a second season.

I didn’t see the show but that still strikes me as a worrying trend. When I think of all the great shows that had a famously rocky start but were given enough time to find their feet and become true classics (Seinfeld say or The Office) it’s heartbreaking to see that even programmes which wow from the get-go being culled.

It’s not only bad for viewers; it’s ultimately bad for the streamers as it makes failure a lot more likely. A new show can only get recommissioned if it gets good viewing figures but why would viewers bother getting invested in something that may be cancelled with no satisfying resolution? I know I wouldn’t.

If Netflix gets a reputation for canceling promising shows before the story is complete then breakout hits are going to be harder and harder to come by. And that’s an outcome that’s bad for everybody.

Led by 21 chiefs the Moshies who reside in Ouagadougou capital of Burkina Faso were tracing their roots ancestral home and connections which is believed to begin at Zecco in the present-day Burkina Faso near the borders of Ghana.

The visit was part of efforts to create enabling opportunity for the Moshies to know and socialise with chiefs and people of Sirigu whom they believe were descendants of the same ancestor.

History has it that in the past when warriors were conquering territories a man named Atalmiro migrated from Gambaga in the present-day North East Region to Zecco the then Upper Volta.

According to history Atalmiro had five children including four sons and a daughter who also migrated and settled in various communities spreading especially across Ghana and Burkina Faso.

The first son Adare it was told migrated from Zecco to form his own family whose children created the present-day Tungo and Yelewongo in Burkina Faso and Yua in Ghana.

It is also said that while Akarigea the second son remained at Zecco the third son Azuko moved to Sirigu while his son also moved to Sherigu in the Bolgatanga Municipality.

While the fourth son Adampoore gave birth to the people of Navrongo Atalmiro’s only daughter Anyelinga married a man who was believed to be staying in the bush and gave birth to the Moshies in Burkina Faso.

The name Moshie means bush to depict that the first man to be called a moshie was staying in the bush.

Balole Naba Akango one of the chiefs revealed that it was important for people to trace their roots to ensure that they knew where they came from to build forces for peace and development.

He said knowing one’s history was key to appreciating different cultures and building alliance for sustainable development.

The Sirigu Paramount Chief noted that the visit by the Moshies was historic and one that would further strengthen the relationship that existed between the Moshies and Frafras.

“We are one and it is very important for us to know each other though they are staying far away from here.

Our people engage in trading activities with them but they do not know each and it could happen that they could have misunderstanding which could evolve into serious conflict but knowing each other will strengthen our unity” he said.

Cultural dance performances from both tribes characterised the occasion.",,,,,,,,,

Its conspiratorial claims of a parade of cover ups from the 2012 Benghazi attack to the climate crisis and Covid-19 have been lapped up by Fox viewers and scorned by much of the rest of America and then the world moved on. But on Tuesday the 91-year-old billionaire media mogul will be obliged to answer difficult questions under oath about the inner workings of Fox.

Dominion Voting Systems is suing the cable news station and its Murdoch-owned parent company Fox Corp for $1.6bn (£1.3bn) over repeated claims that it rigged its voting machines as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 presidential election from Donald Trump.

The suit shines a spotlight on Fox News’ part in promoting Trump’s “stop the steal” campaign and its hand in driving the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. But legal experts say that Dominion which supplied voting machines to 28 states appears to be building a wider case that Fox News has a long history of misinformation and steamrolling facts that do not fit its editorial line.

Over the past few months Dominion’s lawyers have been working their way up the tree of Fox News producers executives and presenters with interrogations under oath about the network’s work culture and its weeks of conspiratorial and at times outlandish claims about Trump’s defeat. On Monday lawyers deposed Murdoch’s eldest son presumed successor and Fox Corp CEO Lachlan.

Now Dominion has reached the top of the tree. Months of accumulated testimony are expected to put Murdoch the chair of Fox Corp in the difficult position of either having to deny he has control over what happens at his most influential US news operation or defend its campaign to promote the biggest lie in US electoral history.

Murdoch is already grappling with the costly legacy of phone hacking by British newspapers the News of the World and the Sun. His UK company has paid more than £1bn ($1.2bn) over the past decade to keep the gruesome details from being heard in open court with no end in sight after a high court judge earlier this year refused to prevent the filing of new claims.

When Murdoch was called to give evidence to a UK parliamentary hearing in 2011 about News of the World hacking the phones of a murdered schoolgirl as well as hundreds of politicians celebrities and other public figures he said that it was the most humble day of his life. He also claimed to have known nothing about the wrongdoing and said that he had been misled.

“I feel that people I trusted … I’m not saying who … let me down and I think they behaved disgracefully” he told parliament. “And it’s time for them to pay.”

But he can make no such claim about Fox News where its misrepresentations were on full display. So far the only people to pay at the network are the ones who got it right.

The trouble started on election night after Fox called the key swing state of Arizona for Joe Biden. The call drew Trump’s ire and unleashed a backlash against the network from his supporters.

At that point Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott warned against bowing to pressure to embrace an alternate reality and reverse the Arizona call.

“We can’t give the crazies an inch” she said according to court records.

As it turned out “the crazies” took a mile as Fox News put a parade of Trump lawyers advisers and apologists front and centre over the following weeks to promote a myriad of conspiracy theories about how the election was stolen from Trump including by rigging the voting machines.

Alongside them some of Fox’s biggest names took up the cry of fraud. NPR revealed that during the discovery process Dominion acquired an email written by a Fox News producer begging colleagues not to allow one of those presenters Jeanine Pirro on the air because she was spreading conspiracy theories about the vote. Pirro a former district attorney and judge who is close to Trump continued broadcasting.

Lawyers have also obtained rafts of internal messages that are “evidence that Fox knew the lies it was broadcasting about Dominion were false” and part of a culture of politically loaded reporting and broadcasts far from the network’s claim to be “fair and balanced”.

Dominion claims that without Fox “these fictions” about electoral fraud would never have gained the same traction among large number of Americans.

“Fox took a small flame and turned it into a forest fire” the company claims in its lawsuit.

In August lawyers questioned another presenter Sean Hannity who has been described as “part of Trump’s campaign apparatus”. He was grilled for more than seven hours including about a broadcast two weeks after the presidential election in which Trump lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell was a guest.

Powell claimed that Dominion “ran an algorithm that shaved off votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden”. She said the company “used the machines to inject and add massive quantities of votes for Mr Biden”. Powell has also claimed that Dominion used software developed to help the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez steal elections.

Dominion has said that it warned Fox News that such claims were false but that it continued to air them in an attempt to assuage Trump supporters out of concern they would move to other right-wing broadcasters.

“It’s an orchestrated effort” Dominion’s lawyer told a court hearing. “It’s not just on the part of each host individually but it’s across Fox News as a company.”

In a statement to the Guardian a Fox News spokesperson said their position was based on defending freedom of the press. “We are confident we will prevail” they said.

So far the only Fox employees to pay a price for the debacle are those who got it right. Weeks after the election the network fired its political editor Chris Stirewalt who had infuriated Trump and other Republicans by refusing to back down from calling Arizona for Biden. The Washington managing editor Bill Sammon who supported Stirewalt’s decision took retirement.

Fox argues that Hannity and the other presenters are protected by journalistic privilege but that position has been complicated by the Fox host’s own description of his role.

In defending his overt bias in favour of Trump and Republicans Hannity has more than once said he is not a journalist but a talk show host and so does not have to adhere to the profession’s ethical standards. He took the same position earlier this year after the January 6 congressional committee exposed dozens of his messages to Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows offering advice and seeking direction as the White House challenged the presidential election result.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL21lZGlhLWFuZC1tYXJrZXRpbmcvbmV3cy1jb3JwLXMtbWFrZXMtYW4tZXZlbi1iaWdnZXItYmV0LW9uLW9ubGluZS1nYW1ibGluZy0yMDIyMTIxMS1wNWM1ZjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Betr's new cash: News Corp ups stake in online bookmaker,"News Corporation has increased its wager on the online gambling industry lifting the company’s stake in Betr the start-up co-founded with betting entrepreneur Matthew Tripp.

The piece Ben earned his nomination for was the outstanding story of transgender jockey Tyler Leslight and his fascinating journey headlined ‘Becoming Tyler'.

The Queensland jockey opened up to Ben about the hurdles he had to overcome transitioning from being born a girl and how he'd made the conscious decision to confront the transgender issue ‘head on'.

As Tyler said to Ben if you have a question about him don't whisper it to a friend – just ask him.

It was a wonderful read and insight into the life of an honest and open young man and the people who have supported him.

ASC CEO Kieren Perkins OAM said it was great to see strong interest from a range of media organisations with the high quality of nominations for the awards.

""We received a record number of entries across the 12 categories which reflects how highly regarded the ASC Media Awards are in the industry"" he said.

""From covering international sporting events to investigating local sporting issues affecting regional and remote Australia the media continues to play an important role in telling the stories that connect us to sport.

""The diversity of coverage across gender race and ability is pleasing to see as it continues to be a key focus for the ASC and the sport sector more broadly as part of the Green and Gold decade we're embarking on.""

The awards presentation will be conducted at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 16 February 2023. The ASC will also announce a new recipient of the prestigious Lifetime Achievement award – last year awarded to legendary News Corp AFL journalist Mike Sheahan."

Ben has been nominated as one of four finalists in the category ‘Best Depiction Of Inclusive Sport'.

The piece Ben earned his nomination for was the outstanding story of transgender jockey Tyler Leslight and his fascinating journey headlined ‘Becoming Tyler'.

The Queensland jockey opened up to Ben about the hurdles he had to overcome transitioning from being born a girl and how he'd made the conscious decision to confront the transgender issue ‘head on'.

As Tyler said to Ben if you have a question about him don't whisper it to a friend – just ask him.

It was a wonderful read and insight into the life of an honest and open young man and the people who have supported him.

READ: ‘BECOMING TYLER'

ASC CEO Kieren Perkins OAM said it was great to see strong interest from a range of media organisations with the high quality of nominations for the awards.

""We received a record number of entries across the 12 categories which reflects how highly regarded the ASC Media Awards are in the industry"" he said.

""From covering international sporting events to investigating local sporting issues affecting regional and remote Australia the media continues to play an important role in telling the stories that connect us to sport.

""The diversity of coverage across gender race and ability is pleasing to see as it continues to be a key focus for the ASC and the sport sector more broadly as part of the Green and Gold decade we're embarking on.""

The awards presentation will be conducted at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 16 February 2023. The ASC will also announce a new recipient of the prestigious Lifetime Achievement award – last year awarded to legendary News Corp AFL journalist Mike Sheahan."

To clarify Woods did not create the famous Nike swoosh fairly obviously given it was created in 1971.

Woods who turns 47 on December 30 was born in 1975.

Watch: Tiger's best moments from The Match

The first deal Woods signed with Nike was believed to have been a five-year deal worth $40 million in 1996.

Woods' next contract then came in 2001 reportedly worth double the initial contract.

Here's how much Woods is estimated to be worth in 2022.

KraftyGolf on Instagram stuck up a video using the lines in Woods' swing to draw the exact Nike swoosh.

He then captioned the video: ""Siri how was the Nike swoosh created?""

WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW:

Here's how some fans reacted:

""How was this never a Nike commercial.""

""Really never knew that!""

""Fair enough!""

""Makes sense to be fair.""

""The fact people are taking this seriously is amazing.""

""Oh come on LOL""

""I think a lady called Carolyn will have something to say about that.""

KraftyGolf who goes by the name of PGA pro Justin Kraft then wrote some details on what golfers can learn from Woods' swing.

""Notice the downward arc of the clubhead is NARROWER (closer to the target) than the backswing arc.

""Why is that? Multiple reasons:

""Tiger has laterally started moving his body toward the target.

""Tiger has a little more wrist hinge early in the downswing.

""These are two good ways to add power and make sure you don't hit the ground before the ball.""

So back to the Nike swoosh...

The Nike logo was indeed created by graphic design student Carolyn Davidson more than 50 years ago now.

Maybe Carolyn could predict the future and knew a certain Tiger with 15 majors to his name was on the way.

The swoosh logo was was first created for the company that was back then known as Blue Ribbon Sports.

One of the founders Phil Knight who acted as Davidson's accounting professor at the time asked her to come up with a logo inspired by the adidas brand.

He wanted something that encouraged movement.

Davidson came up with a number of different designs before Knight chose the swoosh.

It was inspired by the wings of the Greek goddess Nike.

According to Free Logo Design Nike's wings ""motivated her fighters to be daring and courageous and when they won they would say 'Nike' to each other as a token of thanks.""

It is understood that Knight was not initially pleased with the logo but his budget prevented him to design another one so he just grew to like it.

Nike Inc. as we all know is now one of the biggest companies in the world.

It's the world's most valuable apparel brand for a seventh consecutive year according to the latest data.

Nike Golf represents some of the best golfers in the world such as Woods Rory McIlroy Tony Finau and Brooks Koepka.

The brand pulled out of golf equipment back in 2016 due to a lack of sales and attracting millenial players.

Nike does however continue to produce footwear and apparel.

Utilizing the Air Force 1 Low and Dunk High silhouettes Nike issues an interesting makeover using cutout techniques revealing underlying layers inspired by the models' past schemes.

Sure it may give Off-White™ Blazer Low and Air Jordan 5 vibes. However the Swoosh carves out various shapes on its Forces and Dunks unveiling contrasting hues and textures on the uppers.

Take the drop's Air Force 1s for instance. What once was a crisp pair of white Air Force 1 now boasts two vibrant Swooshes — one reptilian and the other bright blue — nodding to the Silver Snake and Fantastic Four's Invisible Woman colorways from the early 2000s.

Meanwhile hints of orange and black pop out on the toe drawing cues from the Air Force 1 ""Carnival"" sneaker.

The same exposed nostalgia follows for the release's Wheat Forces and Dunk High renditions which also borrow elements from their sneaker predecessors like the OG Skyline Forces and Brazil Dunks.

While we see enough Dunks daily 2022's Air Force 1 drops have been pretty solid the latest included.

In honor of its 40th anniversary the AF1 has enjoyed quite a bit of love this year courtesy of spins by Off-White™ AMBUSH and Mr. Certified Lover Boy Drake.

Nike's cutout treatment serves as a clever way of continuing to honor the sneaker's legacy reminding us of its lengthy history and most iconic colorways in the same breath.

Nike has historically signed some of the best athletes in the world including some of the best basketball players in the NBA. Not all of them have shoe deals but a chosen few do. It is rare for a player to blame a sneaker company for having negative effects on their career. However in an interview Scottie Pippen claimed that Nike did cause damage to his career.

Nike signed Michael Jordan who went on to start a sneaker line of his own with the company. Helping Jordan not only become a billionaire but also popularize his signature sneakers around the world.

Scottie Pippen blamed Nike for his injuries

How could one Bulls legend gain so much whereas another legend of the Chicago Bulls ended up blaming the shoe company? In an interview that was posted on Sole Collector’s official YouTube channel Pippen explains how.

Nike at the time was promoting a new ‘Air Bubble’ sole which apparently did not sit well with Scottie Pippen. Pippen ended up rolling his ankles numerous times and also had to undergo surgery on both of his ankles.

Pippen said “I was a player that always wanted to be closer to the floor. Nike at that time was really promoting the ‘Air Max’ which was more looking at the bubbling thing. I was just caught in an era where they were trying to promote the ‘Air Bubble’ and I was a player that I needed to be lowered to the ground.”

“I turned my ankle numerous amount of times. In fact I had ankle surgeries on both ankles.” That is when the host asked him if it was because of the sneakers he wore. To that Pippen did say yes highlighting “Yeah I feel like playing in the air bubble shoe roll made me roll my ankles a lot.”

After years of sitting on this Pippen finally broke his silence. For him to blame Nike may not have been the smartest move. Nike did pay Pippen a huge amount of money for signing a deal with the company.

Nike back then was focusing more on surrounding their sneakers with Michael Jordan’s abilities of high-flying and acrobatic plays. They decided to go all in on that due to the popularity that came with Jordan. It would however be interesting to see some spokesperson from Nike giving Pippen a reply over his claims."

The first-ever 59 on the PGA Tour was recorded in 1977 during the second round of the Memphis Classic by Al Geiberger who made 11 birdies and an eagle on the par-72 layout at Colonial Country Club to make history.

The second came 14 years later in Las Vegas from Chip Beck who made 13 birdies in the third round at Sunrise Golf Club. And the third was fired by David Duval who hit the magical number with 11 birdies and an eagle in the fifth and final round of the 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic to take a one-stroke victory.

While still an incredible accomplishment the 59 has become a bit more common what with the advancements in equipment fitness and analytics. Since 2010 eight golfers have hit the number on the PGA Tour — and that’s not including Jim Furyk’s record-setting 58 in the final round of the 2016 Travelers Championship.

However Furyk is a two-time member of the sub-60 club as he fired a 59 in the second round of the 2013 BMW Championship at Conway Farms.

WASHINGTON – Dec. 11 2022 – NASA’s Artemis I mission came to a successful conclusion today with the splashdown and recovery of the Orion spacecraft. This mission was an uncrewed integrated flight test of the hardware and technology that will take humans back to the Moon for the first time in more than five decades.

The Space Launch System (SLS) rocket Orion spacecraft and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida performed flawlessly during the Artemis I launch on Nov. 16. During a nearly 26-day mission Orion traveled more than 1.4 million miles on a path that took it around and beyond the Moon before returning to Earth. The flight testing and data from the mission inform future Artemis missions.

As the foundational elements of NASA’s deep space exploration architecture Orion is the safest human spacecraft ever developed and the launch and ground systems were designed to deliver greater mass and volume with more Earth-orbit departure energy than any existing system. With planned upgrades the architectures will be able to support future missions to destinations beyond the Moon including Mars.

The next step in NASA’s Artemis program is launching the first crewed flight to the Moon and back on the Artemis II mission. All elements for that mission are deep into assembly. Work on Artemis III which aims to put the first woman and person of color on the Moon is well under way with many of the systems such as the propulsion for SLS and Orion nearly complete.

The Artemis program constitutes an important national capability that leverages more than 3800 suppliers and 60000 workers across all 50 states. The program sustains an essential industrial base of large mid-size and small companies that provide high-tech professional jobs across the country.

AARGM-ER missile confirms its ability to hit maritime targets

Northrop Grumman conducted the fourth successful flight test of the AARGM-ER extended-range anti-radiation missile.

The press service of the company reported this.

The U.S. Navy launched an AARGM-ER missile from the F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft. It had successfully hit a moving maritime target.

The tests were carried out back in late November at Point Mugu in California but the results were reported later.

The missile confirmed its ability to detect identify and engage targets at a long distance.

“This test proved the systems’ ability to engage moving maritime targets a vital capability supporting our Navy’s ability to control sea lanes during the conflict. Congratulations to the government/industry team for their continual focus on delivering this crucial capability to our warfighters” said Capt. Alex Dutko Navy Program Manager for Direct and Time Sensitive Strike.

Northrop Grumman is currently under contract to deliver production units of AARGM-ER to support Initial Operational Capability fielding within the next two years.

Preliminary tests were held in July 2022.

AARGM-ER

AARGM-ER (Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile – Extended Range) is installed on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet EA-18G Growler as well as F-35 Lightning II Navy`s aircraft.

The AARGM-ER is designed to defeat elements of enemy air defense such as missile air defense systems anti-satellite systems and ground and maritime radar stations.

The AARGM-ER (AGM-88G) missile is a deep upgrade of the AARGM (AGM-88E).

The AGM-88G guidance system includes an inertial system a GPS navigation system and the WGU-48/B radar homing head with an active millimeter Ka-band sensor (frequency from 26.5 to 35 GHz).

Target identification and analysis algorithms are used in the multi-band active-passive radar homing WGU-48/B. This ensures the defeat of not only radiating targets but also radiocontrast targets: surface ships of various classes launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems and other defense system equipment.

AARGM-ER is equipped with the WAU-7/B high explosive warhead which has already been used on previous models of the missile. The weight of the warhead is 70 kg. The warhead contains 12845 striking elements made of tungsten and an upgraded explosive charge which provides a greater striking capacity. The warhead is capable of penetrating a 12.7 mm thick metal sheet or 6.35 mm thick armored plate from a distance of up to 6 meters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3MubmFzYS5nb3YvYXJ0ZW1pcy8yMDIyLzEyLzExL2FydGVtaXMtaS1mbGlnaHQtZGF5LTI2LW9yaW9uLXNwbGFzaGVzLWRvd24tY29uY2x1ZGluZy1oaXN0b3JpYy1hcnRlbWlzLWktbWlzc2lvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artemis I – Flight Day 26: Orion splashes down concluding historic Artemis I mission – Artemis,"NASA’s Orion spacecraft successfully completed a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 9:40 PST 12:40 EST as the final major milestone of the Artemis I mission. Engineers will perform several additional tests while Orion is in the water and before powering down the spacecraft and handing it over to the recovery team aboard the USS Portland.

At the direction of the NASA recovery director Navy divers and other team members in several inflatable boats will approach the spacecraft. When Orion is ready to be pulled into the ship’s well deck at the waterline the divers will attach a cable called the winch line to pull the spacecraft into the ship and up to four additional tending lines to attach points on the crew module. The winch will pull Orion into a specially designed cradle inside the ship’s well deck and the other lines will control the motion of the spacecraft. Once Orion is positioned above the cradle assembly technicians will drain the well deck and secure it on the cradle.

Once aboard the vessel teams will take the spacecraft to U.S. Naval Base San Diego and soon return it to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center for inspection. Technicians in Florida will thoroughly inspect Orion retrieving data recorded on board removing onboard payloads and more.

Artemis I was the first integrated test of NASA’s deep space exploration systems – the Orion spacecraft SLS rocket and the supporting ground systems – and the first in a series of increasingly complex missions at the Moon. Through Artemis missions NASA will establish a long-term lunar presence for scientific discovery and prepare for human missions to Mars.

Aerojet Rocketdyne provided the 39 propulsive elements to the mission including the RS-25 and RL10 engines affixed to the core and upper stage that carried the SLS and Orion into orbit as well as the jettison motor for the Orion spacecraft’s Launch Abort System (LAS).

Boeing is the prime contractor for the design development test and production of the launch vehicle core stage and upper stages as well as the development of the flight avionics suite.

Jacobs was responsible for the rocket’s final assembly integration testing launch and recovery operations support including development of the Artemis ground and launch control software used in the NASA Launch Control Center at Kennedy Space Center.

Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the Orion spacecraft including the LAS crew module and crew module adaptor.

Northrop Grumman contributed the twin solid rocket boosters that supplied more than 75% of the thrust at launch as well as the abort motor and attitude control motor for the LAS.

Update 5 posting…

Orion exited the lunar sphere of gravitational influence on Tuesday December 6 at 1:29 a.m. CST for the last time on the Artemis I mission — less than a day after completing the return powered flyby burn that put the spacecraft on course for splashdown on Sunday December 11 — Earth’s force of gravity is now the primary gravitational force acting on the spacecraft.

Orion successfully performed the fourth return trajectory correction burn at 4:43 a.m. using the reaction control system thrusters. The burn lasted 5.7 seconds and changed the velocity of the spacecraft by 0.6 feet per second.

Flight controllers used Orion’s cameras to inspect the crew module thermal protection system and European Service Module the second of three planned external spacecraft inspections. Teams conducted this survey early in the mission to provide detailed images of the spacecraft’s external surfaces after it had flown through the portion of Earth’s orbit containing the majority of space debris and teams reported no concerns after reviewing the imagery. This second inspection during the return phase is being used to assess the overall condition of the spacecraft several days before re-entry.

During both inspections the Integrated Communications Officer or INCO commanded cameras on the four solar array wings to take a series of still images. Engineers and flight controllers at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston will review the imagery over the coming days. A final photographic survey will be conducted Friday as Orion continues its journey home.

Teams responsible for recovering Orion after its splashdown are continuing preparations ahead of the Dec. 11 splashdown off the coast of California. The mission management team will determine the landing site location Thursday December 8. Listen to NASA’s Artemis I recovery director Melissa Jones talk about what it takes to fetch the Orion spacecraft from the Pacific Ocean at the end of the mission on “Houston We Have a Podcast.”

Just after 5:30 p.m. on December 6th Orion was traveling 244000 miles from Earth and about 79000 miles from the Moon cruising at 500 miles per hour.

Images are sent down to Earth and uploaded to NASA’s Johnson Space Center Flickr account and Image and Video Library. When bandwidth allows views of the mission will be available in real-time via video stream.

UPDATE 4 posting…

On November 16th the Orion spacecraft took off on its first voyage around the Moon powered by the European Service Module (ESM) designed and built by Airbus engineers that will supply the astronauts with everything they need to survive in the subsequent crewed missions — from air and water supply to propulsion energy supply and thermal control.

The Orion spacecraft has now reached the halfway point of its journey. The first key moment came just two minutes after launch when the Orion-ESM propulsion system was activated — this was shortly followed by the successful deployment of the solar panels after just 18 minutes. Two hours into the mission the upper stage separation burn released the Orion spacecraft and it began to fly autonomously towards the Moon.

Just under 8 hours into the mission the Outbound Trajectory Correction Burn (OTC) was carried out. The purpose of this step was to fine-tune the Orion spacecraft onto the correct trajectory as necessary. Before the second OTC it became apparent that Orion was so well positioned it needed less correction so that only four smaller RCS attitude control thrusters could be used instead of the eight auxiliary thrusters. From the second to the fourth day of the mission the Orion spacecraft was already halfway to the Moon. With its solar panels perfectly angled to get as much sunlight as possible for power generation first evaluations have shown that the spacecraft produces more energy than had been predicted. Minor trajectory corrections were made to keep the Orion spacecraft properly on course. On the third day of the mission flight controllers used Orion cameras to examine the crew module’s thermal protection system and the ESM the first of two planned external assessments of the spacecraft. The second external assessment is planned during the return phase to assess the overall condition of the spacecraft several days before re-entry. On the sixth day of the mission the Orion spacecraft had a successful burn of its main engine the orbit maneuvering system engine OMS-E. This burn known as the outbound powered flyby was the first of four major burns conducted by the ESM to steer the Orion spacecraft into a ‘distant retrograde’ orbit around the Moon and later back to Earth. The orbit is ‘distant’ being at a high altitude from the lunar surface. As Orion travels around the Moon in the opposite direction to that in which the Moon travels around Earth — it is ‘retrograde.’ This main engine burn during a nail biting communications blackout as the spacecraft was in the shadow of the Moon where no radio contact is possible. After approximately 15 minutes contact with Orion was re-established and the burn confirmed as successful with all the propulsion systems having worked as planned. This first major burn also marked an important milestone in the mission which saw the Orion spacecraft fly just 130km above the surface of the Moon. On November 25th Orion ESM made its 2nd major burn reaching 430000km from Earth beating the previous record of 400000km held by Apollo 13 in 1970. For now Orion will remain in the lunar orbit until Monday December 5th to test spacecraft systems before exiting lunar orbit to put the spacecraft on a trajectory back to Earth. The second half of the Artemis I mission still has many key steps ahead including when the main OMSE engine completes its longest burn on December 5th roughly a 3.5-minute firing in the Moon’s shadow return powered flyby burn (RPF) leaving lunar orbit on the Orion spacecraft’s journey back to Earth and not forgetting the separation of the crew module from the service module 40 minutes before the splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on at 17:40 (GMT) on December 11th. “All mission critical milestones in the first half of the Artemis mission were successfully achieved” said Kai Bergemann Deputy Head of the Orion Program at Airbus. “Initial evaluation of the test data has confirmed that the Orion spacecraft consumes much less and produces much more than calculated. This is a very positive finding meaning that we can already look at design optimisations for the ESM-4 onwards.” Scope for conducting additional tests not originally envisaged for this test flight is also currently being explored by the European team to make optimum use of the vehicle in consultation with NASA. The way things are going at the moment we couldn’t be happier about how our vehicle is performing and are optimistic that the second half of the mission will also go well.”

On November 11th at 13:44 CET (12:44 GMT) the Artemis spacecraft Orion powered its main thruster on the European Service Module to slingshot around the Moon just five days after liftoff from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.

The European Service Module is ESA’s contribution to NASA’s Orion spacecraft that will send astronauts to the Moon and beyond. It provides electricity water oxygen and nitrogen as well as keeping the spacecraft at the right temperature and on course.

The European Service Module is powering Orion around the Moon and back providing propulsion temperature control electricity as well as storage and delivery for essential supplies such as fuel water and air. This first Artemis mission is an uncrewed test mission putting the spacecraft through its paces preparing to send astronauts forward to the Moon.

After liftoff at 07:47 CET (06:47 GMT 01:47 local time) on November 16th the European Service Module unfolded its 7 meter solar wings to start generating electricity. The Orion spacecraft received a final boost from NASA’s Artemis rocket’s second stage and has been on a five-day cruise to the Moon since then. This was a key moment for the NASA and ESA teams operating Orion at just a little more than 130 km from the lunar surface the main engine on the European Service Module – a repurposed Space Shuttle engine that is now on its 20th spaceflight – fired for just under 150 seconds to push the spacecraft and head towards a lunar orbit using the Moon’s gravity to reduce fuel consumption. Mission control for Orion is at the Johnson Space Center in Houston USA with European engineers on hand at all times to offer in-depth expertise on the finer details of the service module. The mission evaluation room based at ESA’s technical heart in The Netherlands has personnel round the clock in direct communication with mission control.

The goal of the Artemis I mission is to stress-test the mission profile the spacecraft and the people operating it in preparation for flights with astronauts. Inside the Orion crew capsule are multiple experiments to prepare for astronaut flights responsibly. These include an ESA investigation recording the radiation doses an astronaut will receive and a German Aerospace Center DLR mannequin that is being used to test a radiation vest that astronauts could wear for protection during solar storms. Orion is now following the Moon’s orbit around Earth and will officially enter lunar orbit on its tenth day of flight 25 November when the European Service Module performs the Distant Retrograde Insertion firing its thrusters to brake Orion and keep flying around the Moon. The mission is set to end with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on 11 December. Visit ESA’s Orion blog for frequent and more detailed updates. “It has been an absolute joy to follow the mission so far” said ESA’s Program Manger for the European Service Modules Philippe Deloo adding “all the thousands of components inside have been working together flawlessly as designed a testament to the international collaboration and prowess of European and US industry. Operationally the spacecraft is performing perfectly and the international collaboration with this new spacecraft with new flight rules is great to see. The teams across both sides of the Atlantic are showing exemplary skills knowledge and teamwork leading humankind forward to the Moon.”

The launch of Artemis I from Kennedy Space Center.

With all of the past launch stutters now water under the bridge NASA has successfully launched the Artemis I mission from the Kennedy Space Center via the agency’s Space Launch System rocket. With four RS-25 engines powering the rocket with 8.8 million pounds of thrust the view of the lift-off from the ground was unimpeded by any weather anomalies.

Artemis I is the first integrated flight test of NASA’s SLS rocket an uncrewed Orion spacecraft and the ground systems at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The mission will pave the way for a crewed test flight and future human lunar exploration as part of Artemis.

NASA teams conducted thorough assessments of the rocket spacecraft and associated ground systems and confirmed there were no significant impacts that would prevent the launch.

NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9qLXNwb3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03MjQ1MznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,900 Israelis join a 'Norwegian Epic' cruise,"When Nick Wilkinson came to Tel Aviv in September to promote Norwegian Cruise Line’s new cruises from Haifa he predicted that about 20% of the passengers would be Israeli.

In fact Wilkinson announced onboard the Norwegian Epic on November 15 (when the ship embarked from Israel for the first time) about 900 passengers – one third of the total – were Israeli citizens.

Many of the thousands of non-Israeli passengers arrived in the country earlier to tour before the cruise.

Wilkinson NCL’s regional VP for Israel the Middle East and Africa noted that Israel was already one of the cruise line’s top-10 markets despite the country’s small size.

Only about 1% of Israelis have already taken a cruise according to NCL research but 30% would like to. IN THE SKYY Vodka Ice Bar passengers don colorful ponchos and gloves to drink from ice glasses while sitting on an ice throne in the -8°Celsius chill. (credit: LAURI DONAHUE)

Many Israelis were attracted by the ultra-low prices for the inaugural cruise – starting from less than $500 (NIS 1715) per person for the 11-day trip – about the cost for one person to spend a weekend at a luxury hotel in Eilat.

But as Wilkinson noted on a cruise ship the scenery changes every day. The Epic docked in Cyprus Turkey Greece and Italy on its way to its final stop in Civitavecchia near Rome.

The Epic also offers far more food and entertainment options than most hotels with two main dining rooms two buffets a 24-hour pub a Chinese restaurant and specialty restaurants that include a sushi bar the upscale French Bistro and a Brazilian steakhouse. Many dining options are included in the fare and some are available for an additional charge.

Passengers can if they wish eat like hobbits with a complimentary light breakfast delivered to the cabin and “second breakfast” at the buffet or in a restaurant.

With a “Free at Sea” offer or a beverage package passengers can drink unlimited wine beer and cocktails (otherwise up to $15 per drink) in any of the 14 bars and lounges. In the Skyy Vodka Ice Bar passengers don colorful ponchos and gloves to drink from ice glasses while sitting on an ice throne in the 17-degree Fahrenheit (-8°Celsius) chill. (It’s uncomfortable but oh-so-Instagrammable.)

There’s even a Starbucks on board. THE EPIC had a kashered kitchen and dining room. (credit: LAURI DONAHUE)

NCL offers pre-packaged kosher meals on all its ships for those who request them 30 days in advance. On this cruise however passengers had another option: Golden Tours reserved a kitchen and dining room for 45 passengers kashered the kitchen and brought kosher groceries and wine – including foie gras for the last-night feast.

Aviva Hexter a Jerusalem Post subscriber from Rehovot noted that the food was “more than excellent.”

“It’s like going to a wedding every day” she said. “You don’t have to think at all. Every detail is taken care of. I feel like a princess.”

THE GOLDEN Tours group also turned one of the ship’s meeting rooms into a synagogue complete with a Torah scroll. A Hebrew-speaking guide took the group to places of Jewish interest during shore excursions.

The Epic offers a wide range of entertainment including a sexy ballroom dance show called Burn the Floor the jukebox musical Priscilla Queen of the Dessert a Beatles cover band dueling pianos movies (including Jaws ironically) karaoke dance lessons magicians a juggler and the world’s fastest violinist.

There are also pools hot tubs water slides a climbing wall arcades a bowling alley library mini-golf a well-equipped gym spa running track basketball court ping-pong shuffleboard shops and a casino.

World Cup matches were playing on the screen

World Cup soccer matches were shown on many screens around the ship (and in the cabins) and the restaurants offered turkey dinners for Thanksgiving.

According to NCL research 47% of Israelis travel with a spouse or partner and 30% travel with their families. Cruising with kids can be a bargain since the third and fourth guests staying in the same cabin pay a lower rate and on some excursions can cruise for free.

Parents (or grandparents) who want more privacy can reserve connected cabins for the kids or splurge on a two-bedroom villa or owner’s suite (with an ocean-view whirlpool tub) in The Haven – the ship’s VIP area.

Guests traveling on their own can book studio cabins that come with access to a private lounge that offers cocktail receptions for solo travelers.

Parents can entertain children up to two years old in the Guppies Room or drop off older kids (three-12) at the Splash Academy. Teens have their own private Entourage Lounge at the top of the ship equipped with video games foosball and a dance floor.

The Epic didn’t have any Hebrew-speakers on duty in the Splash Academy on this trip but parents are supplied with pagers in case a child has a meltdown. “We understand ‘Eema’ [Mommy]” said one crew member.

According to NCL Israelis often plan their holidays 12 to 18 months in advance and are already booking Haifa sailings for 2023 and 2024. In addition to the Epic the Norwegian Getaway will be sailing from Haifa starting in 2024 and the Breakaway starting in 2025. NCL’s newest ship the Viva (sister to the Prima) will be coming to Israel in 2025 with an itinerary that includes Egypt and Istanbul.

AMD and Intel grabbed their share of headlines but it was Nvidia's name that cropped up more often than not during the supply-and-demand shake-up that swept through the GPU market over the last two years. Of course more often than not we were talking about how expensive Nvidia's graphics cards could be especially at the height of the global chip shortage.

Thankfully graphics card prices finally started to slip down out of the stratosphere in 2022 much to the relief of many. This was the year I finally started to seriously consider building a new gaming PC and I know I'm not alone. But as I look ahead to 2023 and plan out what GPU to buy when I have to think about what came out this year and what the big card companies are likely to do in the wake of 2022.

If you like me are wondering what happened this year in GPUs and whether you should buy one now or wait until 2023 read on—here's a brief rundown of what happened to the GPU market in 2022 and what to look for in the year ahead.

Nvidia's on top and begging to be challenged

Nvidia started 2022 riding high in large part because of the global supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its GeForce 30-series cards started shipping in 2020 at the height of COVID-19 quarantines and the entire line was a hot commodity from day one. Scalpers and crypto fiends were the scourge of anyone trying to buy a new RTX 3080 in 2020 and similar problems persisted all the way through 2021 and well into 2022.

In short if you wanted to buy a new Nvidia GPU at the regular retail price it was almost impossible—until a few months ago when new 30-series cards started to show up on store shelves in quantities that made it possible for a normal person to buy one for a less-than-extravagant price.

Around the same time (October 12th to be specific) Nvidia launched its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 the first of the 40-series cards. This is the current top-of-the-line GeForce GPU and yet when you look up where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 you have no trouble finding it for MSRP at retailers like Best Buy.

That's great news for folks with a lot of cash to burn on a new GPU but it seems like less than great news for Nvidia who for the last year or two has seen its new GPUs sell out at speeds we haven't seen since Nintendo launched the Wii. But now it seems the global supply of GPUs has caught up to demand at least for the moment and that suggests Nvidia's GPU fortunes may fall a bit in 2023.

a new RTX 3080 GPU is more than powerful enough to play all the latest games at great framerates

It all hangs on how customers will respond to the rest of the GeForce 40-series cards launching in the year ahead. Now that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 is out alongside the 4090 and they both cost over $1000 the big question is: What will the other 40-series cards cost?

The truth is it may not matter that much because there's still plenty of 30-series cards in stock at retailers around the world. This remains true even after Nvidia's disappointing Q2 results back in August when CEO Jensen Huang told investors that the company's earnings were being dragged down by ""excess inventory"" of 30-series cards and thus it would change pricing and reduce the number of those cards sold to vendors. Now nearly four months later you can still get a new RTX 3080 for less than its $700 MSRP if you spend a bit of time deal-hunting.

While true performance maniacs won't be able to tear their eyes from all the bells and whistles of the new cards (including DLSS 3 which is only available on 40-series Nvidia GPUs) the fact is that a new RTX 3080 GPU is more than powerful enough to play all the latest games at great framerates. And since you can buy one right now for nearly half the price of a new 4090 it looks like Nvidia has set itself up for a backward slide in 2023.

AMD could be poised to shine in 2023

If PC enthusiasts are turned off by the high prices (and massive power demands) of Nvidia's new 40-series cards rival AMD will be there to offer an enticing alternative.

That alternative is the new AMD Radeon RX 7000 series of cards which will begin arriving on store shelves later this month in the form of the Radeon RX 7900 XT and 7900 XTX. They offer improvements over their predecessors that are similar to what Nvidia's latest cards offer including performance improvements better ray tracing support and improved upscaling (via AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution tech).

But what's perhaps most relevant is the pricing on AMD's new top-of-the-line cards: $999 for the 7900 XTX and $899 for the weaker 7900 XT. That's several hundred dollars less than Nvidia's top-tier cards and that could make all the difference in 2023.

AMD continues to price its cards lower than the competition in what seems like a bid to control the mid-range GPU market -- and in 2023 that could pay off in a big way. (Image credit: AMD)

Of course we'll have to wait and see how true enthusiasts take to AMD's new GPUs before we know how much competition they'll bring to Nvidia's offerings. The RX 7000 series is the first series of Radeon GPUs to feature a chiplet design which to put it (very) simply basically means they stack self-contained ""chiplets"" tightly together in linked configurations designed to be more powerful and efficient than a single piece of silicon.

AMD is the first GPU manufacturer to try this and it has done so using lessons learned from taking a similar chiplet approach with its CPU designs most recently the Ryzen 7000 chips. This could be a big differentiator that could help AMD tear some market share from Nvidia in 2023 but we'll have to wait and see how the cards perform before we say for sure.

What about Intel?

Don't forget about Intel which re-entered the graphics card market this year after decades away with the launch of its first Intel Arc GPUs. While we saw Arc GPUs showing up in laptops as early as March we had to wait until October to see the launch of the top-of-the-line Intel Arc A750 and Arc A770 desktop GPUs.

Intel provided internal benchmarks which make the Arc A770 appear to outperform Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060 @ 1080p. (Image credit: Intel)

These are the two most powerful Arc graphics cards currently on the market and with starting prices of $289 and $329 (respectively) they're clearly trying to compete with Nvidia and AMD's mid-range cards. With support for hardware-based raytracing DirectX 12 Ultimate and Intel's new proprietary XeSS upscaling tech these cards are just as capable of playing modern games well as anything the competition can field.

Outlook: A hot GPU summer is coming

However it's hard to know how much excitement the market has for these new mid-range cards now that global supply chain issues have eased and it's easier to find more powerful cards in stock for MSRP. We've seen multiple reviews with benchmarks which suggest the Arc 770 can compete with and even outperform the similarly-priced Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 in many games so Intel seems to have successfully delivered some mid-range competition for AMD and Nvidia in 2022.

But we've also seen multiple complaints of buggy drivers in those Intel Arc GPU reviews suggesting Intel still has some work to do before its graphics cards are reliable recommendations.

By delaying the launch of desktop Arc GPUs from summer 2022 'til the end of the year Intel was forced to debut them alongside the latest and greatest from AMD and Nvidia. Now it seems hard to find anyone talking about the new Arc GPUs over all the noise made by the 40-series and 70-series GeForce and Radeon cards. Intel will have to give us more of a reason to take notice in 2023 if it hopes to build the successful launch of Arc into a well-respected GPU line. And we look forward to seeing if Intel can provide said reason.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ob3ctbnZpZGlhLXRyaWNrZWQtZXZlcnlvbmUtaW50by1idXlpbmctcnR4LTQwOTAv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL2hvdy1udmlkaWEtdHJpY2tlZC1ldmVyeW9uZS1pbnRvLWJ1eWluZy1ydHgtNDA5MC8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Nvidia tricked everyone into buying a $1600 GPU,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?

Nvidia’s RTX 4090 is intensely powerful but at the first glance it’s hard not to call it overpriced. Spending upwards of $1600 on a graphics card is a lot especially if you consider that you can build an entire gaming PC for the same amount of money.

Of course the flagship RTX 4090 only sounds like a rip-off until you look at the $1200 RTX 4080. Has Nvidia really managed to trick us into thinking that a $1600 GPU is a great deal?

Nvidia’s RTX 4090 is a beast with a scary price

When Nvidia first launched its Ada Lovelace flagship the RTX 4090  and the reviews started pouring in it was clear that the GPU was a real beast. It’s easily the best graphics card right now and I dare say it will remain so until Nvidia eventually drops an RTX 4090 Ti or perhaps even resurrects the Titan.

The RTX 4090 blows other graphics cards out of the water no questions asked. Based on our testing it’s 68% faster than the 3090 Ti in 4K gaming it unlocks DLSS 3 and despite previous warnings and wild speculations it’s somewhat power efficient. For today’s standards it’s almost too good; so much so that it’s begging for a new AAA game to come out and fully take advantage of it.

It also costs $1600 for the Founders Edition but you’ll find many versions of the card up for sale for $2000 to $2500.

Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past was disheartening.

Still the RTX 4090 sold out and came back at scalper prices with some eBay sales on launch day reaching as high as $5000. There was a single sale for $9999 but it’s hard to believe that this was a legitimate purchase.

The RTX 4080 doesn’t make much sense

The insanity of these prices made some of us actually look forward to the (also overpriced) RTX 4080 set with an MSRP (recommended price) of $1200. Unfortunately once the card arrived the taste of excitement grew bitter with a large heap of disappointment.

Comparing the RTX 4090 to the RTX 4080 reveals a flaw in Nvidia’s pricing plan for this generation — the numbers just don’t add up.

If you look at the RTX 4080 alone regardless of the price it is a really good graphics card . It outperforms every GPU from the previous generation including the RTX 3090 Ti by a considerable amount.

The sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what gamers truly think.

It’s also around 30% slower than the RTX 4090 while only being 25% cheaper and this is where things get complicated because at MSRP the RTX 4090 is a much better deal than the 4080 — even if it’s more expensive.

It offers much better performance per dollar which historically hasn’t been the case. The flagships were aimed at enthusiasts who didn’t try to get the best deal; they just wanted the best performance. Take one step down from the top and the good deals start where the performance is still great but the price is less ridiculous.

That hasn’t been true in this generation and the sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what Nvidia’s customers think about this.

Tough luck scalpers

Every time a new GPU drops scalpers can be counted on to buy it en masse and then throw it up on eBay at a huge markup. This was often the only way to get a graphics card during the GPU shortage when regular users faced a lot of competition from scalpers and crypto miners during the brief windows of time when GPUs were actually in stock.

Of course scalpers tried their luck with the new Ada cards too and while they were successful with the 4090 it seems that their success with the 4080 has been moderate at best so far. We only really have sales data from eBay but let’s see how these numbers compare.

Since the launch of the RTX 4090 on October 12 a total of 3050 units have been sold through the U.S. version of eBay at an average price of $2328.

It’s barely worth it to resell these cards right now.

Around the time of the RTX 4080 launch (November 16) the sales of the 4090 started rising and have been on a steady albeit slow rise ever since. The prices are now close to what they were around the time of launch.

The RTX 4080 is not doing so well. Only 281 units have been sold since November 16 at an average price of $1496. For scalpers this means that the sales are just about enough to break even when you consider shipping and fees. It’s barely worth it to resell these cards right now and with only 281 GPUs sold in 3 weeks the demand is scarce. The average sale price has also been gradually trending lower ever since launch.

Nvidia’s flagship RTX 4090 can be found at various online retailers such as and  but the cards priced near MSRP are all sold out. Meanwhile or near it and there are plenty of cards . Some models are just $50 shy of hitting the recommended list price of the 4090 — by default without any scalper tax.

It almost feels like people would just rather buy the RTX 4090 instead.

Some retailers won’t even refund the RTX 4080

Having looked at the eBay sales numbers for both GPUs I can tell you one thing — the RTX 4090 doesn’t seem to have slowed down just because the RTX 4080 launched. On the contrary it benefited from the release.

While the RTX 4080 appears to be selling at a snail’s pace and scalpers are desperate to get rid of it the 4090 thrives and it’s still a catch at MSRP. Considering the vast chasm of performance between the two the 4090 remains a better deal if caught at the recommended price of $1600 however expensive that might be.

It seems that Nvidia’s customers are aware of this if you look at the large number of 4080s that the scalpers can’t seem to make a profit on. Newegg actually made 4080s non-refundable seemingly because too many scalpers wanted to get rid of their cards.

NVIDIA 4080 shipment units: 🟢30000 NVIDIA 4090 shipment units: 🟢130000 Total RTX 40 shipment units: 🟢160000 NVIDIA's 4090 was pretty much sold out at launch. Retailers still have 4080 in stock. 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️ — Hassan Mujtaba (@hms1193) November 19 2022

I almost feel sorry for these scalpers but I’m not that benevolent. Talk about miscalculated risk.

Wccftech’s Hassan Mujtaba claims that the 4080 initially shipped in much smaller numbers than the 4090 — 30000 units versus 130000. If this is true and the 4080 is still laying around at MSRP then the community has truly spoken — people just don’t want those decent but questionably priced RTX 4080s. Might as well get an RTX 4090 if you’re spending that kind of money assuming your budget can stretch to it.

Has Nvidia played itself or have we been played?

In short — the RTX 4080 seems to have done the 4090 a favor. It made an overpriced GPU suddenly appear much more desirable than it ever should have been.

Now the question is was this Nvidia’s plan all along or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080?

Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon it might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090.

Nvidia also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080 but at more reasonable prices — $999 and $899 respectively.

With the upcoming price cut the RTX 4080 might become a more worthwhile contender. For now if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1600 it is a better deal — but only if you can make use of it. If you’re a casual gamer save your money and get the 4080 without worrying about benchmarks and comparisons.

Personally I’m still waiting for the 7900 XTX and judging by the performance per dollar of the RTX 4080 I really have no regrets.

The Dell PowerEdge XE9680 finally allows the company to offer a legitimate high-end AI training platform to its customers. In a blue-lit corner of SC22 the huge system was on display for all to see.

Dell PowerEdge XE9680 8x NVIDIA H100 Drops EMC and Finally Covers AI

Here is the 6U server from Dell. One can see that we have the main server on the top of the chassis. This system has dual 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and 16x DDR5 DIMMs/ CPU for 32 total. One can also see the 10x front PCIe Gen5 slots.

This side view is interesting for two reasons. First we can clearly see Dell continue its design of offering what is essentially an integrated disaggregated chassis. Most other vendors in the market square off chassis for this class of device. Dell shows that it has a server and a PCIe/ accelerator portion of the server by making the chassis depth different depending on which portion you are looking at. Dell has effectively taken a disaggregated server and an acceleration box and integrated the two. Just based on industry trends and the strange chassis design this is fun to see Dell do something different. At the same time it is similar to the Dell EMC PowerEdge XE8545 we reviewed.

The other great thing that we see is that this is the “Dell PowerEdge XE9680” not the “Dell EMC PowerEdge XE9680.” Dell is finally after six years dropping the “EMC” from its naming convention.

The rear of the system is full of fan modules both from the 10x fan modules on the bottom to the 6x PSUs on the top of the chassis.

Atop the system is the 8x NVIDIA H100 board. In the previous generation A100 series also supported by this platform we called this the “Delta” platform while the 4x A100 assembly was the “Redstone” platform. In the H100 generation these are now called Delta-Next and Redstone-Next. The XE9680 supports both Delta and Delta-Next using air cooling at up to 500W for the A100 and 700W for the H100.

Dell is going to continue supporting Redstone-Next but it was great to see the Delta-Next H100 platform.

Final Words

This server may not seem like a huge deal to many of our readers. Afterall we have reviewed several 8x A100 “Delta” platforms over the years and seen many H100 Delta-Next platforms already launched. The reason the PowerEdge XE9680 is such an important moment in the market is that Dell has finally decided it is time to compete in the high-end AI market. Along with NVIDIA’s enterprise software push Dell can now sell additional software and support along with the AI training hardware to higher-margin customers. Many companies that utilize a lot of AI compute find that it is much less expensive to house clusters in a colocation facility than use cloud resources. Now Dell’s customers do not need to buy Supermicro NVIDIA DGX or another brand of training server for AI workload they can instead just buy PowerEdge.

Most server vendors tell us that they are expecting the PCIe to OAM/SXM mix to be around 50-50 soon so Dell needed this product line. It is great to see Dell finally start offering high-end AI training servers. Now we just want to see the company’s OAM platforms since that is becoming an industry trend and companies like HPE Lenovo Inspur and Supermicro already are selling OAM-based solutions.

Gone are the days when MCUs were just a mix of processing simple RAM memory and peripherals. Today’s crop of MCUs pack in a rich set of technologies aimed at complex system design challenges.

In this article we round up some recent near-end-of-the-year MCU news ranging from edge processing functionality to embedded MCU memory to payment security.

MCUs Serve up Neural Processing Technology

For its part NXP Semiconductors recently announced its new MCX N MCUs. An expansion of the company’s MCX family announced back in June the MCX N are the first devices to embedded an NXP NPU (neural processing unit).

At the Electronica trade fair last month All About Circuits’ Editor-in-Chief Jeff Child (left) gets a demo of the MCX N MCU from Romain Ricci (right) NXP’s regional marketing manager for MCUs.

The first two members of NXP’s MCX N series include the MCX N94x and the MCX N54x. The two devices are general purpose MCUs and embed dual Arm Cortex-M33 cores with clock speeds operating up to 150 MHz. Other features include 2 MB of flash with optional full ECC RAM and a DSP co-processor for audio and voice processing.

As mentioned above these MCUs are NXP’s first to introduce a new version of the NXP-designed Neural Processing Unit (NPU). The company says this integrated NPU provides up to 30x faster machine learning (ML) throughput versus a CPU-only core solution. This means it can spend less time awake which shrinks overall power consumption. Engineers can make use of NXP’s eIQ ML software development tools to train and support ML models using the integrated NPU.

Rich Security and Peripheral Mixes

For security the devices leverage NXP’s EdgeLock secure subsystem. Edgelock provides secured boot and crypto accelerators. The MCUs have on-the-fly encrypt and decrypt

for external serial flash/PSRAM that is connected via the FlexSPI interface. This ensures that code and externally stored data are protected says NXP.

While the N94x and N54x share many of the same features the MCX N94x puts emphasis on advanced analog and motor control peripherals while the MCX N54x includes peripherals ranging from high speed USB with PHY to SD or smart card interfaces suited to IoT and consumer applications.

The N94x boasts a CoolFlux DSP three embedded op amps and two CAN-FD bus links. In contrast the N54x lacks the DSP and op amps and has a single CAN-FD interface. The MCX N94x and MCX N54x appear to share a product page. More information is available on the MCX N fact sheet. NXP plans to begin sampling the MCX N series in Q1 2023.

AURIX TC4x MCUs Get TSMC's RRAM On-chip

For its part Infineon Technologies’ most recent MCU news revolves around memory. Infineon and TSMC recently announced that the two companies are working to add TSMC’s Resistive RAM (RRAM) non-volatile memory technology into Infineon’s next gen AURIX family MCUs.

The goal here is to serve the needs of automotive systems says Infineon. MCUs with embedded flash have traditionally been key components in automotive electronic control units (ECUs). They are also critical for next gen advances such as electrification new E/E (electrical/electronic) architectures and autonomous driving.

While today’s MCUs are based on embedded flash memory technology Infineon says that RRAM is a next step in embedded memory because it enables scaling to 28 nm and beyond. For Infineon’s AURIX TC4x MCUs TSMC and Infineon say they have successfully created the basis for introduction of RRAM in the automotive domain.

The RRAM offers “high disturb immunity” while allowing bitwise write without the need of erase. Meanwhile endurance and data retention performance is comparable to flash says Infineon.

Infineon says it is now shipping samples of its AURIX TC4x family to lead customers that are based on TSMC’s 28 nm eFlash technology. First samples based on 28 nm RRAM technology are expected to be available to engineer customers by the end of 2023.

Certified for Biometric Card Payments

In other MCU news STMicroelectronics (ST) recently announced that it has completed EMVCo1 certification for its STPay-Topaz-Bio biometric payment card platform. The platform is co-packaged with ST’s STM32L443 MCU in a module compliant with EMV specifications.

According to the company the certification confirms the security of the platform and its interoperability with payment systems. EMVCo is the organization that manages the EMV specifications and test programs for card payments worldwide.

ST says the certification means that STPay-Topaz-Bio and its embedded secure hardware is now “the first one-stop-shop EMVCo-certified platform to comprise a biometric secure element and secure operating system (OS).”

The secure element used in the platform is ST’s ST31N600 secure element IC which is basically an MCU in its own right. The chip offers a variety of defenses for card-payment applications and sensitive processes. Among these are biometric template matching for cardholder authentication which uses software libraries developed with Fingerprint Cards AB (Fingerprints).

Running on the ST31N600 is a secure OS. The device is built on the latest Arm SecurCore architecture for secure MCUs. In addition designers can introduce value-added card features by securely connecting various types of peripherals.

In the STPay-Topaz-Bio platform the STM32L443 MCU handles non-sensitive aspects says ST. These include managing the card’s fingerprint sensor module and the user interface. The STPay-Topaz-Bio platform also boasts energy harvesting for batteryless operation and meets standards for contact and contactless cards: EMV ISO 7816 ISO 14443.

MCU Complexity Under the Hood

Embedded system design is all about complex functionality under the hood that enables powerful simplicity at the user level. To achieve this for today’s demanding applications MCU vendors are providing new types of co-processing memory technologies and application-specific functionality such as secure payment capability.

Solutions such as described here will perhaps address emerging needs of design engineers but the appetite for future advances will continue to grow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzEwL3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3JfdmNfZnVuZGluZ19kb3duX3N0YXJ0dXBzL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS9BTVAvMjAyMi8xMi8xMC9zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yX3ZjX2Z1bmRpbmdfZG93bl9zdGFydHVwcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As semiconductor VC funding dips startups trip crash build for the next boom,"As the economic downturn brings the astronomical level of investor hype over semiconductor startups back to Earth some venture-backed companies think now is the right time to build for the next boom period while others stumble and crash.

Global venture capital funding for semiconductor startups reached new heights in 2020 and 2021 after several years of modest growth but this year's economic realities have translated into substantially less capital for privately held silicon firms that rely on investor cash to survive or grow.

According to data provided by PitchBook global VC funding for semiconductor startups in 2022 reached $7.8 billion as of December 5. That's a 46 percent decline from the record $14.5 billion investors pumped into silicon firms last year and a 24 percent decline from the $10.3 billion raised in 2020.

At the same time while the number of worldwide semiconductor funding deals fell this year to 618 it only declined by nearly 20 percent from the 771 deals recorded last year and it was actually nearly 21 percent higher than the mere 511 funding rounds in 2020.

Investor scrutiny increases creating greater risk for some startups

Ruta Belwalkar private investor and chip designer told The Register that this year's slowdown in economic activity has increased investor scrutiny over the viability of semiconductor startups.

While the bar has always been higher for silicon firms than software startups because of how capital-intensive they are investor money was easier to come by previously.

""But now specifically what they're asking is 'Do you have a customer? Have you taped out your first chip? And do you have a roadmap to the future generations?'"" Belwalkar said.

Belwalkar is referring to fabless chip design firms that need to raise enough money to hire people design integrated circuits and then pay tens of millions for a tape-out the final step of the design process where a photomask is sent to a contract chipmaker like Taiwan's TSMC for manufacturing.

One chip design startup that apparently lost investor interest this year is Mythic.

The Texas-based firm which had raised a $70 million round last year tried to stand out by designing analog chips for edge AI use cases but it ran out of venture capital funding before it was able to generate revenue according to a November post by a top executive in November. (Company officials have declined to comment further.)

Belwalkar said she wouldn't be surprised if other chip design startups met a similar demise soon because they didn't transition fast enough from research and development to commercialization.

""Now if a startup doesn't have the runway to survive the next year and they can't raise money by mid next year then maybe they will run out of money. I'm not saying that their IP is bad or anything. It's just there are high chances. Sustaining that many people on the team it's tough"" she said.

Alternatively a startup could end up acquired if there is an interested buyer.

However such interest could be diminished by increased regulatory scrutiny over merger and acquisition deals as well as capabilities developed by incumbent semiconductor firms according to a recent note by PitchBook analyst Brendan Burke on the state of AI chip startups.

Burke is talking about the objections by Western regulators that killed Nvidia's $66 billion bid to acquire Arm earlier this year plus acquisitions made by Intel and AMD over the past few years – Habana Labs and Xilinx respectively – that boosted each of their AI chip capabilities.

There is an area where chip startups could see more M&A interest – automotive – due to larger players like AMD and Nvidia lacking some capabilities compared to auto-focused chip companies.

""The size of the market encourages large bets to capture market share from the range of automotive chipmakers led by Infineon NXP and Renesas"" Burke said.

In commercialization some stumble while others puff their chest

Even if a semiconductor startup starts selling to customers it doesn't guarantee future success a reality that can become more pronounced when the economy goes down.

Graphcore a well-funded Bristol UK-based AI chip startup that has aimed to compete with Nvidia reportedly had its private valuation slashed by $1 billion this year after losing a key deal with Microsoft amid other financial woes. The Times reported in October that while Graphcore's revenue grew slightly to $5 million last year so did the company's losses to $185 million. The struggles prompted Graphcore to lay off roughly 170 employees this year the newspaper added.

""Graphcore has significant cash reserves and is well positioned … however the macroeconomic backdrop is extremely challenging. This means making some hard but necessary decisions around our priorities to put us in the best possible position for sustainable growth in 2023"" Graphcore said in a statement to The Times.

The 2022 State of AI Report authored by two AI-focused venture capitalists underlined the difficulty of smaller AI chip companies competing with Nvidia showing that GPUs are referenced in AI research papers 90 times more than chips from Graphcore Intel's Habana Labs units and three other well-funded startups: Cerebras Systems SambaNova and Cambricon. Out of the smaller Nvidia rivals Graphcore had the most citations in research papers in 2021 and 2022.

""We've got years of runway and we've got many paying customers and I don't think the others have"" Andrew Feldman CEO of the Silicon Valley wafer-scale AI chip company Cerebras Systems told The Register.

Feldman declined to discuss financial figures of his own company but he said customers are buying more of its systems ""year-over-year."" He added that the startup won't have to raise another funding round for the next six to nine months.

""How do you know when you're doing well in a difficult market? When your customers buy more when you have more customers and when you're solving really hard problems for them"" he said.

For some now's the best time to build

Cerebras isn't the only venture-backed silicon firm that's feeling confident about the future in the midst of an economic downturn and for two startups one major reason is how they plan to take advantage of two growing trends in the semiconductor space.

One of them is Eliyan. The Silicon Valley startup announced in November that it had raised a $40 million funding round to commercialize its die-to-die interconnect technology which the company claims will make chiplet design – increasingly embraced by the industry as the superior way to design chips – more economical and efficient than advanced packaging solutions.

Ramin Farjadrad Eliyan's CEO told The Register that with the economy weighing down on margins for semiconductor firms the need for its solution has increased because it could help them save on chiplet manufacturing costs in the future.

""One of the key things that we offer as part of our technology by eliminating advanced packaging is improving the overall cost for these types of products"" he said.

Farjadrad said the current downturn has come with other benefits. With demand cooling in the industry Farjadrad said he has been able to obtain certain materials for less money and quicker. And with semiconductor stocks down from earlier this year the labor market has become less competitive and made it easier for Eliyan to hire technical talent from larger companies.

""Even up to six months ago we had maybe trouble snatching really good guys from the big companies because their [restricted stock units] were high and so on and so forth"" he said. ""But right now it's much easier. People even approached us so we don't have to spend as much money for recruitment.""

Astera Labs is also in the middle of a hiring spree though the semiconductor startup wasn't originally planning to do so as a privately held company for much longer. That's because it had hoped to go public before the year's end and then decided against it.

Instead Astera Labs raised another funding round this year from investors worth $150 million that more than tripled its valuation to $3.2 billion going against 2022's trend of tech companies seeing their valuations dramatically reduced.

Jitendra Mohan CEO and founder of Astera Labs told The Register that the Silicon Valley firm didn't need to raise more capital because it has already been generating a ""tremendous amount of revenue"" and has a decent balance sheet.

However Astera Labs and its investors believe the company is on the cusp of a major opportunity because it is developing chip architectures that will allow hyperscale and cloud customers to take advantage of Compute Express Link. CXL is a standard being introduced in new Intel- and AMD-based servers that will among other things enable cheaper more flexible and larger DRAM configurations as well as memory pooling.

""We find ourselves in a leadership position on CXL. Our investors along with us looked at the business and said 'Look it's time to put the pedal on the gas'"" he said. ®",,,,,,,,,

As they have done all season the Eagles relied on their playmakers to produce points and their defense to stifle opponents in defeating Madison 48-14.

In other words there was nothing different or out of the ordinary in how Freedom (15-0) reached the pinnacle of high school football. No matter the opponent. No matter if the game occurred during the regular season or the postseason. They led from the start. Extended their lead throughout. And left the outcome never in doubt.

In doing so Freedom which opened in 2004 became the first state football champion from Prince William County since Battlefield won the Group AAA Division 6 state title in 2010. Freedom is also the first football team from Prince William County to go undefeated since Osbourn went 14-0 in 2006 to win the Group AAA Division 6 state title.

And with most of the team returning including all of its key skill players Freedom is in position to win another state title.

Sophomore running back Jeffrey Overton Jr. ran for 212 yards on 23 carries and three touchdowns while junior quarterback Tristan Evans the state-record holder for single-season touchdown passes increased his total to 61 by throwing two Saturday.

Evans also increased his single-season touchdown responsibility (rushing-receiving-runbacks) to 74 which is second all-time in the state two behind leader Ronald Curry. He finished the game 14 of 20 for 155 yards and one interception.

Overton’s rushing total gives him 2599 on the season the most in Prince William County high school football history. Tyquan Brown who graduated from Freedom in 2019 held the old mark of 2584 over 15 games when Freedom last reached the state final in 2018.

Overton is also now the third member of his family to win a state football title as a player. Jeffrey's uncle Freedom head coach Darryl Overton won one in 1998 with Hylton.

Jeffrey's father Jeff Sr. claimed a state title in 2002 with Hylton. Jeff is currently Freedom’s defensive coordinator.

The defense often overshadowed by an offense that set a state single-season record for most points with 952 got in on the act as well Saturday when first-year starter Isaiah Harper returned an interception 68 yards for a touchdown. It was Freedom's 21st touchdown for a return this season and sixth for an interception.

With multiple options to score points Freedom outgained Madison 453 to 235 yards. Those options Overton said make it hard for opponents to stop Freedom. And Madison was no exception.

“We can simulate Madison’s offense and its personnel better than they can do ours” Darryl Overton said. “And I felt like that gave us a big edge.”

Freedom scored on its first three possessions of the first half to take a 21-6 lead. Jeffrey Overton Jr. got things started on a 7-yard run followed by a 17-yard pass from Evans to Elijah Reid. James McKay converted both extra points as Freedom took a 14-0 first-quarter lead.

In the second quarter Madison got within eight on quarterback MacPherson Lewis' one-yard run on fourth-and-goal with 9:02 left in the period. The extra-point attempt failed.

Freedom closed out the first-half scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Evans to Kam Courtney.

Overton Jr. added two more rushing touchdowns in the third quarter on runs of 63 and 1 yards. Overton’s 63-yard run showed his speed and toughness as he broke a number of tackles in running up the middle and then sprinting outside to the left before fending off one final defender just before the goal-line to score.

Freedom backup quarterback Caleb Tucker closed out the scoring when he hit Reid with a 42-yard touchdown pass to close with 32 seconds remaining.

The victory was particularly gratifying for Darryl Overton.

“Just proud of their resilience and our resilience” said Overton. “Football is football but it’s a lot that we go through at Freedom and being part of this program that other people don’t have to go through.”

Overton said he’s been investigated 17 times primarily by the Prince William County School system during his eight years at the helm.

“Accused everything from colleague theft to you think of it it’s happened” Overton said when asked to elaborate. “Even this playoff run they suspended one of my coaches for posting on Facebook a song … It’s a lot.

Omnicom’s OMD Publicis Media Stagwell Horizon Media and Tinuiti are said to be among the agencies vying for the business according to sources. OMD and Tinuiti are the incumbents.

The review comes just over a year after the NFL took parts of its media buying account in-house according to Business Insider retaining OMD as a lead strategy agency. The NFL has worked with OMD in some capacity since 2019 when it brought the agency on to manage media buying and planning for NFL games without a review.

The NFL also expanded its relationship with digital agency Tinuiti at the time to oversee most of its digital media buying budget including paid social video and display.

The NFL is estimated to have spent $400 million on U.S. media between July 2021 and June 2022 including $120 million on digital according to Comvergence data.

The NFL’s global media account is believed to cover the U.S. Canada Mexico and U.K. market according to sources.

The NFL has worked with 72andSunny which is part of Stagwell Group as its lead creative agency since 2018. The two have collaborated on notable work such as the Football is Gay campaign in 2021.

In addition to being a massive advertiser the NFL offers a major and growing advertising platform for brands. The league generated a record $4.4 billion in ad revenue during the 2021-2022 season a 14% year-over-year jump according to Standard Media Index.

Chips are imperative to the defence industry and technologies of the future. By targeting this critical input the Biden administration aims to freeze China’s semiconductor suite at 2022 levels and impede its military development.

China will probably struggle to maintain its rapid advances in artificial intelligence quantum and cloud computing without access to US technology and expertise. Chipmakers like the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — China’s largest logic chip producer — will lose access to machine maintenance and equipment replacement under the new controls.

US chip equipment suppliers like Lam Research Applied Materials and KLA Corporation have suspended sales and services to Chinese chipmakers while ASML Holding a Netherlands-based supplier told its US staff to stop servicing Chinese customers until further notice.

The new controls exploit China’s weaknesses in developing talent and research. They require all US citizens residents and green card holders — including hundreds of ethnic Chinese educated and trained in the United States — to seek permission from the US Department of Commerce to work in Chinese fabrication plants. Since such permission is unlikely US citizens working at Chinese semiconductor companies will be forced to sacrifice their citizenship or their job. Most will have to give up their current jobs. Indeed Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp has already asked core US staff to leave the company.

Despite the bleak short-term outlook it is wrong to assume that US controls will hobble China for years. In the case of nuclear weapons significant resources were poured into acquiring bomb technology once political leaders decided that they were essential for national defence. That effort inevitably starved other sectors but more often than not successfully delivered nuclear weapons programs.

Now that advanced semiconductors are seen as essential to national defence Beijing is adopting the ‘whole of the nation’ approach and investing national resources into the industry. Many engineers and computer scientists are likely to be assigned to semiconductor design and manufacture assisted by espionage against US South Korean Taiwanese Japanese and European chip firms.

The export controls won’t cripple the Chinese military. According to a 2022 RAND Corporation report China’s military systems rely on older less sophisticated chips made in China on which US export controls will have no affect. If China needs more advanced chips for AI-driven weapons systems it can likely produce them albeit at a very high cost. Many semiconductor industry experts agree that China has the technical capability to produce cutting-edge chips yet lacks the commercial capability to scale up production. This means that the US ban will have less effect on weapons systems instead delaying the rollout of civilian applications such as autonomous vehicles.

Nor will US semiconductor firms emerge from the sanctions unscathed given many have China as their largest market. China comprises 27 per cent of sales at Intel 31 per cent at Lam Research and 33 per cent at Applied Materials. Both Applied Materials and Nvidia expect the new export controls to cut US$400 million (6 per cent and 7 per cent respectively) from next quarter’s sales. Lam Research — one of Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp’s largest suppliers — expects the controls to cut a whopping US$2.5 billion (15 per cent) from 2023 sales.

These dramatic cuts come at a particularly difficult time for the US semiconductor industry which is experiencing falling revenue and increased input costs. By one estimate the damage US sanctions inflict on research and development and capital investment in the Western semiconductor industry ‘will exceed Washington’s modest subsidies for the chip industry by a factor of five or more’.

Tit-for-tat retaliation against Washington is not an option for China given its heavy reliance on foreign technology. Any reciprocal measure would inflict more damage on China itself. Punishing US companies with big exposure in China — like Nike or Apple — would harm the Chinese labour market since those firms employ many Chinese citizens. Other foreign supply chains and Chinese businesses supplying Nike and Apple would also suffer.

Imposing export controls on products China dominates like rare earths or pharmaceutical ingredients would accelerate the US movement to ‘reshore’ onshore and ‘friend-shore’ manufacturing those products as was the case with Japan in 2012.

Instead of overt retaliation China will probably seek alternatives to US chip technology. But since alternatives are decades away intellectual property theft and the nationalisation of foreign semiconductor firms could spike.

Whether US chip controls represent a stand-alone policy or foreshadow sanctions across a wider range of high technology sectors is unclear. In the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election many Republicans will call for harsher controls. At his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit Biden sought to tamp down US–China hostilities. But unless he resists calls from the US ‘China hawks’ Biden could find himself dragged into a Second Cold War.

Global venture capital funding for semiconductor startups reached new heights in 2020 and 2021 after several years of modest growth but this year's economic realities have translated into substantially less capital for privately held silicon firms that rely on investor cash to survive or grow.

According to data provided by PitchBook global VC funding for semiconductor startups in 2022 reached $7.8 billion as of December 5. That's a 46 percent decline from the record $14.5 billion investors pumped into silicon firms last year and a 24 percent decline from the $10.3 billion raised in 2020.

At the same time while the number of worldwide semiconductor funding deals fell this year to 618 it only declined by nearly 20 percent from the 771 deals recorded last year and it was actually nearly 21 percent higher than the mere 511 funding rounds in 2020.

Investor scrutiny increases creating greater risk for some startups

Ruta Belwalkar private investor and chip designer told The Register that this year's slowdown in economic activity has increased investor scrutiny over the viability of semiconductor startups.

While the bar has always been higher for silicon firms than software startups because of how capital-intensive they are investor money was easier to come by previously.

""But now specifically what they're asking is 'Do you have a customer? Have you taped out your first chip? And do you have a roadmap to the future generations?'"" Belwalkar said.

Belwalkar is referring to fabless chip design firms that need to raise enough money to hire people design integrated circuits and then pay tens of millions for a tape-out the final step of the design process where a photomask is sent to a contract chipmaker like Taiwan's TSMC for manufacturing.

One chip design startup that apparently lost investor interest this year is Mythic.

The Texas-based firm which had raised a $70 million round last year tried to stand out by designing analog chips for edge AI use cases but it ran out of venture capital funding before it was able to generate revenue according to a November post by a top executive in November. (Company officials have declined to comment further.)

Belwalkar said she wouldn't be surprised if other chip design startups met a similar demise soon because they didn't transition fast enough from research and development to commercialization.

""Now if a startup doesn't have the runway to survive the next year and they can't raise money by mid next year then maybe they will run out of money. I'm not saying that their IP is bad or anything. It's just there are high chances. Sustaining that many people on the team it's tough"" she said.

Alternatively a startup could end up acquired if there is an interested buyer.

However such interest could be diminished by increased regulatory scrutiny over merger and acquisition deals as well as capabilities developed by incumbent semiconductor firms according to a recent note by PitchBook analyst Brendan Burke on the state of AI chip startups.

Burke is talking about the objections by Western regulators that killed Nvidia's $66 billion bid to acquire Arm earlier this year plus acquisitions made by Intel and AMD over the past few years – Habana Labs and Xilinx respectively – that boosted each of their AI chip capabilities.

There is an area where chip startups could see more M&A interest – automotive – due to larger players like AMD and Nvidia lacking some capabilities compared to auto-focused chip companies.

""The size of the market encourages large bets to capture market share from the range of automotive chipmakers led by Infineon NXP and Renesas"" Burke said.

In commercialization some stumble while others puff their chest

Even if a semiconductor startup starts selling to customers it doesn't guarantee future success a reality that can become more pronounced when the economy goes down.

Graphcore a well-funded Bristol UK-based AI chip startup that has aimed to compete with Nvidia reportedly had its private valuation slashed by $1 billion this year after losing a key deal with Microsoft amid other financial woes. The Times reported in October that while Graphcore's revenue grew slightly to $5 million last year so did the company's losses to $185 million. The struggles prompted Graphcore to lay off roughly 170 employees this year the newspaper added.

""Graphcore has significant cash reserves and is well positioned … however the macroeconomic backdrop is extremely challenging. This means making some hard but necessary decisions around our priorities to put us in the best possible position for sustainable growth in 2023"" Graphcore said in a statement to The Times.

The 2022 State of AI Report authored by two AI-focused venture capitalists underlined the difficulty of smaller AI chip companies competing with Nvidia showing that GPUs are referenced in AI research papers 90 times more than chips from Graphcore Intel's Habana Labs units and three other well-funded startups: Cerebras Systems SambaNova and Cambricon. Out of the smaller Nvidia rivals Graphcore had the most citations in research papers in 2021 and 2022.

""We've got years of runway and we've got many paying customers and I don't think the others have"" Andrew Feldman CEO of the Silicon Valley wafer-scale AI chip company Cerebras Systems told The Register.

Feldman declined to discuss financial figures of his own company but he said customers are buying more of its systems ""year-over-year."" He added that the startup won't have to raise another funding round for the next six to nine months.

""How do you know when you're doing well in a difficult market? When your customers buy more when you have more customers and when you're solving really hard problems for them"" he said.

For some now's the best time to build

Cerebras isn't the only venture-backed silicon firm that's feeling confident about the future in the midst of an economic downturn and for two startups one major reason is how they plan to take advantage of two growing trends in the semiconductor space.

One of them is Eliyan. The Silicon Valley startup announced in November that it had raised a $40 million funding round to commercialize its die-to-die interconnect technology which the company claims will make chiplet design – increasingly embraced by the industry as the superior way to design chips – more economical and efficient than advanced packaging solutions.

Ramin Farjadrad Eliyan's CEO told The Register that with the economy weighing down on margins for semiconductor firms the need for its solution has increased because it could help them save on chiplet manufacturing costs in the future.

""One of the key things that we offer as part of our technology by eliminating advanced packaging is improving the overall cost for these types of products"" he said.

Farjadrad said the current downturn has come with other benefits. With demand cooling in the industry Farjadrad said he has been able to obtain certain materials for less money and quicker. And with semiconductor stocks down from earlier this year the labor market has become less competitive and made it easier for Eliyan to hire technical talent from larger companies.

""Even up to six months ago we had maybe trouble snatching really good guys from the big companies because their [restricted stock units] were high and so on and so forth"" he said. ""But right now it's much easier. People even approached us so we don't have to spend as much money for recruitment.""

Astera Labs is also in the middle of a hiring spree though the semiconductor startup wasn't originally planning to do so as a privately held company for much longer. That's because it had hoped to go public before the year's end and then decided against it.

Instead Astera Labs raised another funding round this year from investors worth $150 million that more than tripled its valuation to $3.2 billion going against 2022's trend of tech companies seeing their valuations dramatically reduced.

Jitendra Mohan CEO and founder of Astera Labs told The Register that the Silicon Valley firm didn't need to raise more capital because it has already been generating a ""tremendous amount of revenue"" and has a decent balance sheet.

However Astera Labs and its investors believe the company is on the cusp of a major opportunity because it is developing chip architectures that will allow hyperscale and cloud customers to take advantage of Compute Express Link. CXL is a standard being introduced in new Intel- and AMD-based servers that will among other things enable cheaper more flexible and larger DRAM configurations as well as memory pooling.

""We find ourselves in a leadership position on CXL. Our investors along with us looked at the business and said 'Look it's time to put the pedal on the gas'"" he said. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy90dXJucy1vdXQtY29mZmVlLWFsc28tbWFrZXMtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMtd29yay1mYXN0ZXItdG9v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turns out coffee also makes semiconductors work faster too,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy90dXJucy1vdXQtY29mZmVlLWFsc28tbWFrZXMtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMtd29yay1mYXN0ZXItdG9v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002B00FC64220>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Also Tuesday TSMC made its own announcement: it will more than triple its investment in Arizona from $12 billion to $40 billion making it one of the largest Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in United States history. The company also announced that it will add a second fab to the Phoenix site that will produce of advanced smaller 3 nanometer (nm) chips in addition to the already-announced plans for 4nm wafers.

“In addition to placing us on the leading-edge of high-tech manufacturing TSMC’s presence here is nothing short of transformational” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. “I can sum up the effect on the community in a single word and that word is ‘jobs.’ TSMC is already employing close to 10000 construction workers. Nearly 4500 people will work at the fab once it is online. Plus we have already heard from more than 40 of the company’s suppliers who also want to locate in Phoenix. All told we expect this ecosystem will create up to 80000 jobs over the next five years with much of that demand met by local Phoenix talent.”

Arizona State University (ASU) is already a major player in the job training pipeline. Its Fulton School of Engineering with more than 30000 students currently enrolled is poised to provide a vast corps of potential employees from which TSMC can draw. Yet not all employees will need to be Ph.D. level engineers; technicians will also be in high demand. To that end and with assistance available through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law the Maricopa County Community College District launched its “Route to Relief” program that includes specific training certifications in semiconductor fields. To date 18 classes have graduated with 197 people having earned their NIMS Semiconductor Certifications. This program is expected to grow as more people understand the lasting value of working in the semiconductor industry.

The federal CHIPS and Science Act is a fundamental reason the TSMC expansion is happening and an equally important factor in attracting suppliers to the area. In his remarks President Joe Biden underscored that fact and added an equally powerful observation. “What I’m most excited about is people are starting to feel a sense of optimism as they see the impact of the achievements in their own lives. It’s going to accelerate in the months ahead as part of the broad story about the economy we’re building that works for everyone” said the President. He added “As we build a stronger supply chain our allies and partners are building alongside us as well. That’s why what we’re doing here in Arizona matters across the country and around the world.”

Among the other dignitaries at today’s event was Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple recently announced it will use TSMC chips made in Phoenix for its iPhones. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo Governor-elect Katie Hobbs and members of Arizona’s congressional delegation also participated in today’s ceremony.

Mayor Gallego remarked on how far the city has come.

“I have been looking forward to this day since I traveled to Taiwan three years ago to make the case to TSMC that Phoenix is the place they would want to be. To stand here today with this extraordinary high-tech future becoming a reality I am utterly thrilled to imagine what Phoenix will look like in ten years.

Web application firewalls are a key line of defense to help filter monitor and block HTTP(S) traffic to and from a web application and safeguard against attacks such as cross-site forgery cross-site-scripting (XSS) file inclusion and SQL injection (SQLi).

The generic bypass ""involves appending JSON syntax to SQL injection payloads that a WAF is unable to parse"" Claroty researcher Noam Moshe said. ""Most WAFs will easily detect SQLi attacks but prepending JSON to SQL syntax left the WAF blind to these attacks.""

The industrial and IoT cybersecurity company said its technique successfully worked against WAFs from vendors like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloudflare F5 Imperva and Palo Alto Networks all of whom have since released updates to support JSON syntax during SQL injection inspection.

With WAFs acting as a security guardrail against malicious external HTTP(S) traffic an attacker with capabilities to get past the barrier can obtain initial access to a target environment for further post-exploitation.

The bypass mechanism devised by Claroty banks on the lack of JSON support for WAFs to craft rogue SQL injection payloads that include JSON syntax to skirt the protections.

""Attackers using this novel technique could access a backend database and use additional vulnerabilities and exploits to exfiltrate information via either direct access to the server or over the cloud"" Moshe explained. ""This is a dangerous bypass especially as more organizations continue to migrate more business and functionality to the cloud.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vZ2JoYWNrZXJzLmNvbS9ieXBhc3Mtd2ViLWFwcGxpY2F0aW9uLWZpcmV3YWxscy9hbXAv0gE7aHR0cHM6Ly9nYmhhY2tlcnMuY29tL2J5cGFzcy13ZWItYXBwbGljYXRpb24tZmlyZXdhbGxzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Technique Discovered To Bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAF) Of Several Vendors,"Experts from Industrial and IoT cybersecurity company Claroty developed a generic method for bypassing the web application firewalls (WAF) of a variety of leading manufacturers.

Following a study of the wireless device management platform from Cambium Networks Claroty’s researchers identified the technique. They found a SQL injection flaw that might allow unauthorized access to private data such as session cookies tokens SSH keys and password hashes.

Reports stated that the vulnerability could be exploited against the on-premises version but the Amazon Web Services (AWS) WAF prohibited all attempts to do so against the cloud version by flagging the SQL injection payload as malicious.

“This is a dangerous bypass especially as more organizations continue to migrate more business and functionality to the cloud” Noam Moshe a vulnerability researcher at Claroty wrote in a company blog post.

“IoT and OT processes that are monitored and managed from the cloud may also be impacted by this issue and organizations should ensure they’re running updated versions of security tools in order to block these bypass attempts.”

Later finding revealed that the WAF could be bypassed by abusing the JSON data-sharing format. All of the significant SQL engines support JSON syntax and it is turned on by default.

“Using JSON syntax it is possible to craft new SQLi payloads. These payloads since they are not commonly known could be used to fly under the radar and bypass many security tools.” Claroty reports.

CVE-2022-1361 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used In a SQL Command (‘SQL INJECTION’)

Further a specific Cambium vulnerability the researchers uncovered proved more challenging to exploit (CVE-2022-1361). Moshe says “at the core of the vulnerability is a simple SQL injection vulnerability; however the actual exploitation process required us to think outside the box and create a whole new SQL technique”.

Hence they were able to exfiltrate users’ sessions SSH keys password hashes tokens and verification codes using this vulnerability.

The vulnerability’s main problem was that the developers in this instance did not utilize a prepared statement to attach user-supplied data to a query.

“Instead of using a safe method of appending user parameters into an SQL query and sanitizing the input they simply appended it to the query directly” he added

New SQL Injection Payload That Would Bypass the WAF

The WAF did not recognize the new SQL injection payload that Claroty researchers created but it was still valid for the database engine to parse.

They did this by using JSON syntax. They did this by utilizing the JSON operator “@<” which put the WAF into a loop and let the payload reach the intended database.

Reports say the researchers successfully reproduced the bypass against Imperva Palo Alto Networks Cloudflare and F5 products.

Claroty added support for the technique to the SQLMap open-source exploitation tool.

“We discovered that the leading vendors’ WAFs did not support JSON syntax in their SQL injection inspection process allowing us to prepend JSON syntax to a SQL statement that blinded a WAF to the malicious code” the security firm explained.

Hence Claroty says by adopting this innovative method attackers might gain access to a backend database and utilize additional flaws and exploits to leak data directly to the server or via the cloud.

Their global value has reached $55 billion in 2022 and is expected to surpass the $60 billion mark in the next two years.

Live sports have become a valuable commodity thanks to expensive contracts with major networks and streaming services including domestic rights deals for the NFL and Indian Premier League.

In 2021 the combined global value of all sports media rights was $54.45 billion .

. The NFL is No. 1 in the world holding 15% of the sports media rights market in 2022.

in the world holding 15% of the sports media rights market in 2022. Roughly 97% of income from the NFL’s media rights deals is domestic.

In 2021 the NFL finalized media rights deals with CBS NBC Disney FOX and Amazon worth a collective $113 billion over 11 seasons.

As part of the deals Amazon received exclusive rights to “Thursday Night Football” — the first time a tech company has held exclusive NFL rights.

CBS retained its AFC package for Sundays while Fox kept the NFC Sunday package it has held since 1994. Disney kept “Monday Night Football” on ESPN and NBC retained rights to “Sunday Night Football.”

Markus Dohle’s decision effective at the end of the year comes just weeks after a federal judge blocked the company’s attempt to buy rival Simon & Schuster.

“Following the antitrust decision in the US against the merger of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster I have decided after nearly 15 years on the Executive Board of Bertelsmann and at the helm of our global publishing business to hand over the next chapter of Penguin Random House to new leadership” Dohle 54 said a statement released on Friday by parent company Bertelsmann the German conglomerate.

Dohle who will remain with the company in an advisory capacity had been working under a 5-year contract set to expire in December 2025.

Dohle is also leaving his seat on the Bertelsmann executive board. His departure was made at “his own request and on the best of mutual terms” according to the Bertelsmann announcement.

A Bertelsmann spokesman said Friday that Dohle’s ill-fated push to acquire Simon & Schuster was not seen as a “mistake” by the company and did not lead to pressure for him to resign as CEO.

Dohle will be succeeded on an interim basis by Nihar Malaviya 48 currently president and COO of Penguin Random House.

“I’ve partnered with many of you across functions and various countries and I’ve experienced firsthand the abundance of talent that we have in our community” Malaviya wrote in a company memo shared with The Associated Press. “It is an incredible honour for me to lead the premier publishing company in the world and I look forward to working with even more of you to build on the energy and dynamic culture we have collectively created.” A native of Arnsberg Germany Dohle had worked in Bertelsmann’s printing and services division before succeeding Peter Olson as Random House CEO in 2008 a time when the company’s sales were dropping.

He presided over an era of enormous growth notably the 2012-13 merger with Penguin and such blockbuster successes as Michelle Obama’s “Becoming” and Delia Owens’ “Where the Crawdads Sing.” Earnings had fallen in 2022 as they had for much of the industry with inflation and supply chain issues among the factors cited.

In 2015 PEN America honoured Dohle for his “commitment to defending free expression and access to literature.” He has since personally donated USD 500000 and with PEN formed the Dohle Book Defense Fund to fight book banning efforts.

During Dohle’s acceptance speech in 2015 he cited “The Little Prince” as a favorite childhood story and recalled a scene when the prince climbs to the top of a mountain and calls out to the world at large but hears only an echo of his own words.

“The dismayed prince walks away dejected by this planet where he can hear nothing but himself. Can you imagine a world dominated by a single voice?” Dohle said.

One of Dohle’s biggest achievements ironically was avoiding an earlier government antitrust suit: In 2012 Random House was the only top New York publisher not sued by the Justice Department for allegedly conspiring with Apple to fix e-book prices.

Dohle had not yet agreed to terms with Apple which had launched an e-book store in hopes of competing with Amazon.com (the other publishers all settled out of court) and otherwise shrewdly invested in printing and distribution at a time others in the industry were expecting e-books to become the dominant format.

“We regret Markus Dohle’s decision to leave Bertelsmann and Penguin Random House” Christopher Mohn chair of Bertelsmann’s supervisory board said in a statement. “He has sustainably focused Penguin Random House on growth and profitability. Under his leadership our book division more than doubled its revenues and quintupled its profit. The fact that our global book publishing group is in such a strong position today is largely thanks to Markus Dohle.” A DOJ attorney for the Apple case John R. Read headed the government’s team last summer during the 3-week antitrust trial that was a showcase for the Biden administration’s tougher approach to corporate mergers.

Book publishers had been consolidating for decades with little resistance but the government cited a new approach in suing to stop Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster — concern that the merger would give the new company dominance over book deals of USD 250000 or more and lead to lower author advances and fewer books.

Questioned by Read last summer Dohle agreed that the purchase of Simon & Schuster would “cement” Penguin Random House’s power.

The trial was widely seen as going badly for the defendants with Judge Florence Y. Pan openly skeptical of Penguin Random House’s insistence that the merger would not unduly alter the publishing market. Dohle himself acknowledged under oath that his promise to allow Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster imprints to continue to bid against each other for books was not legally binding and was forced to address internal correspondence that revealed tension between himself and other executives.

Pan ruled in the government’s favour in late October. Penguin Random House had planned to appeal the decision but soon after Simon & Schuster’s owner Paramount Global announced it was calling off the USD 2.2 billion deal.

As part of the initial agreement Penguin Random House paid Paramount USD 200 million because the merger fell through. Paramount still plans to sell Simon & Schuster which publishers HarperCollins and Hachette Book Group each have expressed interest in buying.

The three co-founders and stockholders cleared regulatory hurdles to acquire First State Bank of Elmore City Oklahoma the state’s first and oldest bank and will rename the financial institution Old Glory Bank. According to a press release the company will “never cancel law-abiding customers for their beliefs or for exercising their lawful rights of free speech.”

“It’s been dismaying to see the political weaponization of the financial system” Rich commented. “Old Glory Bank was created to be the full banking solution for folks who still believe in freedom and the greatness of America.”

Old Glory Bank clients will be permitted to round up to the nearest dollar every time they make a transaction and donate the funds to charity including Oklahoma nonprofit organization Folds of Honor which provides academic scholarships for the spouses and children of fallen soldiers. Among other leaders in the venture is William Shine the former co-president of Fox News and president of Fox Business News who serves as executive chairman.

The bank which will be backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation plans to openly support first responders and the military as well as offer no-fee accounts free overdraft protection and early direct deposit access. Old Glory Bank Senior Regulatory Officer Bennett Brown said that “cutting-edge digital technology” will permit customers from across the nation to access the company’s services.

“Old Glory Bank will serve lower- and middle-income Americans and those Americans that other banks have marginalized and ignored hard-working patriots who keep this country running every day” added Carson who worked as director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University before leading the Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Trump administration.

The venture comes as established financial institutions grow increasingly hostile toward free expression. PayPal which has deplatformed multiple organizations and commentators for their political views unveiled a change to its acceptable use policy two months ago that would have banned the promotion of “misinformation” and drawn $2500 penalties from account holders deemed to be in violation. Within one day of The Daily Wire reporting on the policy change however PayPal reversed the guidelines and claimed that they had been published “in error.”

PayPal trended on social media after the retracted acceptable use policy garnered public attention leading thousands of customers to balk at the move and cancel their accounts. The company’s stock price fell precipitously in subsequent trading.

Other companies such as Amazon Twitter and Facebook have sanctioned conservatives over their positions on controversial social issues including transgenderism vaccine mandates and homosexuality. GoFundMe seized millions raised for trucker protests in Canada earlier this year while Google began suppressing search results for crisis pregnancy centers.

“Greater encroachment by large technology and financial companies into public speech will only exacerbate Americans’ increasing mistrust of such institutions” members of the Senate wrote in a letter to PayPal executives. “Policies that empower companies to punish individuals’ beliefs by acting as arbiters of fact in our ever-changing news and public debate environment represent poor business decisions. Instead large technology and financial institutions should focus on serving the needs of their customers without bias.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9maW50ZWNoL3RvcC1lLXdhbGxldC1hcHBzLWluLXRoZS1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Digital Wallet Apps in the Philippines in 2022 » YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews,"Tracing their origins back to the 1990s digital or electronic wallets have become mainstream in recent years especially in the Philippines. This despite the fact that more or less 56 percent of Filipinos in 2022 have bank accounts lower than the global account ownership level of 76 percent. Perhaps in part due to the pandemic the expansion of cashless mechanisms had accelerated but the Financial Times notes of other factors at play:

Apart from the favorable government policy factors that enable going cashless are: the penetration of technology such as smartphones e-commerce and internet access plus the penetration of banking services such as online banking mobile banking cards and POS devices.

This video was recorded on Dec. 4 2022.

Indra Nooyi: But I will say something. This is based on my biases from my past. I don't know how you build a corporate culture unless people come together I really don't know. There's something to be said about the human interaction. I don't know how you do leadership development unless you have people coming together. How do you judge people unless you have people actually physically coming together? The first thing I did when I was CEO across the world I visited people. I met them I shook hands with them talked to them saw them in action. It was just an unbelievable feeling.

Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that's Indra Nooyi. She joined Pepsi in 1994 as a Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning. Over the next decade she rose to become President and Chief Financial Officer and in 2006 was named CEO a position she held for 12 years. Motley Fool Co-Founder and CEO Tom Gardner caught up with her for a conversation at our company's recent Annual Meeting. We're bringing you part of that conversation today. They talk about the business leaders she's learned from and her path to the corner office at Pepsi.

Tom Gardner: What was the process like for you in becoming CEO at Pepsi? How was the idea introduced? Were you an applicant? Had that been something that you've considered part of your pathway at different stages along the way at Pepsi and what was that onboarding like?

Indra Nooyi: Well all PepsiCo CEOs at run big businesses. I was through strategy the CFO job than I was President running all the corporate functions and Steven Reinemund my predecessor CEO did something very interesting he said look in all the work you've done you've operated left of the decimal in big numbers. I want you to learn the right of the decimal small pennies. How you extract value from small pennies applied over many things and you get cost-savings. He had me do a project of Frito-Lay to improve the distribution system. I had done projects on operations but never really run a P&L in its entirety day to day. There were lots of other extraordinary people in PepsiCo that the board could have picked. We were not told there was a succession race going on but some of us were on the board at that time so the board knew us. I honestly believe Tom that if you decide you want to be CEO and you start to run for it you actually work against yourself because you're so obsessed with becoming CEO you forget that you have to do the work. I was focused on doing the work because at the end of the day I didn't think my boss was going to retire when he did. I thought the two of us were going to retire at the same time because he was a young person and I enjoyed working with him. When he walked into my home one day and said the board would like to tell you on Saturday that you're going to be CEO. I said why are you leaving? That was my first reaction because I was enjoying working with him. He said ""I'm going back to Dallas my family would like to relocate"". I think the board felt there was a strategic repositioning that was needed of the company. Companies go through ebbs and flows. You have great operational leadership then you need a strategic tweak then again you get a great operational leadership and other strategic tweak. I think Roger Enrico did all the strategic transformation. Steve extracted phenomenal performance from that transformation. I came in strategically repositioned. The new CEO is extracting operational benefits from all that repositioning. I think the board was very clever in deciding what CEO you needed for the times. I was surprised I was picked but I'm now in retrospect I understand why I was picked.

Tom Gardner: What are the biggest differences between being a CFO than being the president and running all the corporate functions and then being CEO. What does that progression look like as we each look at our own career journeys and what it means to level up to that next spot?

Indra Nooyi: There are two kinds of CFOs is what I call the control and numbers-oriented CFO. Then there is the strategically focused numbers CFO. PepsiCo typically had CFOs that came from a strategic focus became the partners to the CEO. I came from that ilk big picture strategy but I was also good at zooming in to the numbers and running the finance function. Because I was President also and because I was part of so many of the transformations I knew every new can corner of the company around the world. I knew everyone of our bottling partners our joint venture partners employees knew me. The CEOs before me gave me a lot of visibility because that was the first immigrant women of color in the executive suite. I was given a lot of visibility by my predecessors and pushed and promoted. I thought I was totally prepared when I was told I was going to be CEO. But then when you become it like you're doing a game of tag Tom the view is completely different because when you are President and CFO your CEO is the first-line for the shareholders for everybody outside when you become it you're the first line of attack and you're fair game. CEO is a fair game for anybody who wants to attack a CEO. You couldn't retool your mind to say I thought I knew everything about the job but now I am the one making all the decisions. I get great input but I'm making the decisions. I have to think about my 250000 employees their families to suppliers the partners. You have very different sense of responsibility and boy I tell you I came to work every day with a little bit of butterflies in my stomach saying I hope I do right by this company.

Tom Gardner: Thank you so much for that. As the CEO at Pepsi you introduced Performance with Purpose PwP. That was maybe quoting directly a plan to put environmental goals and customer and employee well-being on par with financial goals. I was wondering to what extent your pathway to becoming CEO and CFO background for example and running businesses. I'm wondering to what extent you think anyone any level of any company anywhere inside the Motley Fool or inside a Pepsi or any other company. How important do you think it is to work with a purpose and understand the business realities to see both of those things together? Because naturally some people come to work and they're like I'm the transactional I'm the numerical I'm the money side of it. They'll figure out how to make it all come across the right way in the world and others will say I'm the one who's out front interacting with you. I don't really know how the pricing works. I'm not sure distribution costs. I don't know what the cost of acquisition is for new customer. I don't really know those details. How important do you see it to continually try to bring those two things together within an individual's career no matter the company?

Indra Nooyi: In my experience I've come across two kinds of people. People who come to work saying I got to do a job I've just got to go do the job get a paycheck and go home which is perfectly good as long as they do a job well. Then there are those who go to work saying this is my company even if it was a big public company this is my company. They have an ownership culture about it. They feel they're part of this company and whenever they have to do whatever job they are in they redefine the job to be more expensive. Thinking about all the linkages with the job to other functions. I'll give you an example but let me start off by saying I was a second type. Whatever I was given to do I would do it well but then I would ask the question who's going to use the output of my work? How is it going to be used? I always thought about people two levels above me. How would they use it? If it was a board I'd say what's the board going to say when they see this document? What can they do with it? What information I'll be trying to give them? But by doing the work at ground level but then levitating about 10000-15000 feet and looking at the work and impact on others you have a different perspective of the work. That's the way I was trained at the Boston Consulting Group. That's a skill I brought to PepsiCo. I think in many ways that ability to zoom in and zoom out constantly is what got me the attention of all the leaders in PepsiCo saying here's an unusual person. I've said to anybody those that do that zooming in and zooming out have an ownership culture about the company and want to make the company a better place are those that develop a sense of purpose about coming to the company. Getting up every morning and coming to work whether you're doing remotely or in person. There are other people get up every morning saying I care deeply about this company and I care deeply about PepsiCo. I mentioned in my book saying I had an irrational love for the company and till this day I carry that irrational love. When you have that love and think it's you-all company the way you act is completely different. You cared about everything. Everything I do I worried about the broader impact of it. That gave me a tremendous purpose.

Tom Gardner: How about having the business detail alongside that sense of purpose? You essentially shared your thoughts on that with the zooming in zooming out. Then how about somebody who zooms in zooms out but just doesn't quite yet understand the business implications of decisions. What would you advise to them?

Indra Nooyi: It's a tenable thing Tom because if you make decisions in a vacuum without knowing how it's going to land on people and businesses and processes. You might actually make big blunder. Because the whole idea of leaders making good decisions is that they're not just making a good decision on what do you think is the right decision for the company. You're thinking about how it's going to be implemented. That's why they say people who've actually run P&Ls know-how is going to land and how people have interpreted and act on it. I think anybody who's CEO or in a C-suite has to know what the impact is and how it's going to land on businesses functions people regions any decision you make. For example Performance with Purpose as a overarching strategy we had to take it on the road to see how is it going to land in various countries? How are they going to interpret it? How can they execute Performance with Purpose. Should we tweak Performance with Purpose at the margin for certain countries. We had to go through that exercise. I think anybody who thinks decisions can be made up on high and miraculous land is making a mistake. You've got to constantly think about all of the pitfalls when it lands then go back and tweak the decision. Not to much but enough to make it work. Is it an art and a science?

Tom Gardner: An art and a science. We are obviously in a very tough market environment now with a lot of unexpected factors that few people would have imagined the collection of them five years ago. I don't know that anyone in the world would have been able to put together the scenario that we're in. I want to hear a little bit about how you managed through change and through crisis. I would just say for the Motley Fool we face a unique challenge in that even though our assertions in our advice may be right in the long term it can look very wrong in the short term. You could recommend what could end up becoming a great company or is a great company could be a great investment seven years from now but in the next year it's down 58 percent. For a member coming in to see that and experienced that and not be able to process that harsh early experience doesn't mean a long-term failure. Although of course in investing you do also make mistakes that do end up being long-term mistakes. The complexity of laying that out for our members in an environment like this obviously there are plenty of things that are analogous in your work career and at Pepsi and Pepsi facing recessions how do you suggest managing through change and through crisis for the employees and making sure everyone understands the mission and why we're here and what we're working on but for all the stakeholders that are suffering at different points along the way as well?

Indra Nooyi: Let me give you three scenarios Tom because I think it's important in a very different. When we are transforming future back which is what you're talking about we know what the future is going to be we have to change the company. It behooves me to paint a beautiful picture of the future in vivid terms to people tell them why we need to change and make the change happen. Those that stand in the way sometimes when you try to change them and they don't you got to move them out because you have such a clear idea of what changes need to be made for the future. That's one kind of change. The second kind of change when you've got force measure War in Ukraine geopolitics with China you've got inflation. You've got stuff that you don't control. Financial crisis. All these you didn't make happen but they happen around you. You've got to navigate the company through that. When you have something like that just had to bring their employees together and say ""you know what we can do it"". Give them confidence when they are feeling nervous give them stability when they feel like the world is spinning out of control.

Just give them stability tell them we go through a tough time but we will come out of this. The third kind of change unsettling aspect has been an activist comes into this talk and demands you do all kinds of things. But this is not stuffed you're planning this is not stuff that happened to you this is an activist who thinks they know lot more about the company than you do even though they don't. What do you do then? At that point again is when the best of a CEO has to come out and say our strategy is clear this is what it is. We're not backing off of that. Our board is not backing off that. You guys keep running the company and delivering results. I will take care of the activist with the CFO and the legal camps. You have to have separation of roles so that everybody is not worried about the same issue. I think in each of these cases you have to behave differently. You've got to really understand what you're trying to do and behave differently. I'll be honest with you Tom one of the things that I was blessed with I ran a company like PepsiCo which made products to eat and drink them. If I was running a company that made products that are based on bits and bytes which is being disrupted every which way to Sunday I don't know how I would have run that because anything that's bits and bytes and digitally movable is going through massive disruption at this point. Just like what you're talking about. All different ballgame.

Tom Gardner: I guess in the difference between ideas and products some of the way the pandemic played out would naturally be different because in the product world there are maybe a point-of-sale with a customer or a necessity to have somebody at a distribution point.

Indra Nooyi: Manufacturing the product.

Tom Gardner: Exactly. In the world of ideas perhaps every one can be in their home office because there are gaps and differences in the way you work. But for the most part you were actually able to make your way through learn as you go but continue to work remotely. I'm wondering if you were running Pepsi now or looking at any company what advice would you have for how to think about how work is going to be different and not in a temporary way a longer-term bet on the way work will be different now because of what we've been through?

Indra Nooyi: I'm glad I'm not the CEO now because this is a confusing time in some ways but I will say something. This is based on my biases from my past. I don't know how you build a corporate culture unless people come together I really don't know. There's something to be said about the human interaction. I don't know how you do leadership development unless you have people coming together. You judge people honestly if people actually physically coming together. The first thing I did when I was CEO across the world I visited people. I met them I shook hands with them talked to them saw them in action. It was just an unbelievable feeling. The thing that I always worry about in PepsiCo but I'm sure you're doing some shape of form in Motley Fool is if you're a servant leader really servant leader you wouldn't allow some people to come into work and all other staying home. People who have figured out a way to come together because you're solving the people that work for you. So net that what I'd say is conducted few experiments and see what works best. My biggest concern is productivity I think is not where it should be given the lack of clarity on hybrid working. I'm all full flexibility. Don't get me wrong. It makes for good family building but what we should agree on is x number of days of the week you're going to come in. We can actually build a community We can build culture we can build a leadership team we can get to know people so be it we can put name and face together in a human way and shake hands. There's a lot to be said for that. Talk about productivity if we work at home or in the office just talk about all that. Then do experiments in different parts of the company. Two days three days everybody coming in some coming in rotation do that. But do not disadvantage any group. Don't say women didn't come and therefore they disadvantaged men came and therefore they're advantaged. Be very careful about favoring or not favoring one group of people.

Tom Gardner: I thank you for that. I want to respect your time. But I also have three more questions.

Indra Nooyi: Go ahead.

Tom Gardner: Good. You've expressed that you feel like career wise you won the lottery because the journey of an immigrant women of color was not a well-worn path into the executive suite at a company like Pepsi or any other Fortune 50 Fortune 100 Fortune 500 company or many companies. I'm wondering to what extent you think that is different now how far along are we that the odds are not so long and so stacked against let's specifically take an immigrant women of color but in any other forms of obstacles that exist to the merited rise of talent to create the most dynamic marketplace with the greatest rate of innovation and enthusiasm. Impossible to achieve perfect setting how far are we today versus when you began your journey inside a Pepsi?

Indra Nooyi: My time when I first came to the US to now I'd say that my journey would have been possible only the US not in any other country in the world. I still think we have to pat ourselves in the back as citizens of this great nation and say we're still one of the wonderful meritocracy in the word that gives everybody a chance. On a relative basis we are out there phenomenon. Now let's talk about what could be improved. I think that we are making progress on saying the most talented people should rise to the top. We're making progress but there are biases there are barriers that exist to people like women or as diverse people rising. It doesn't happen overnight you've got to build the pipeline very methodically and get them up. It's not just we say we need CEOs who are diverse and then all of a sudden CEO show up. You've got to build a pipeline very systematically. I will say one thing Tom because I was only one of a kind when I was early in my life and corporate America and then when I became CEO a lot of people saw me my hard work and how much I felt ownership about the company and stepped up to support me push me mentor me critique me and really give me a leg-up. Now there's more like me that are more diverse people in leadership positions. They now being viewed as competition normal competition is happening. While I was singled out for help because maybe it's a combination of my hard work and the people I was surrounded by I think I was given a real push and pull up. Today I think the environment is better but there's more people like me and the competition is more intense. On balanced different issues but still issues but we're making problems I'd say overall we're making progress [inaudible] at all but I think in mainstream we're slowly making progress.

Tom Gardner: It's unfair to do this but I always love to play the game scale of 1-10. What would you say in terms of relative to other countries you identify the US in a very positive way relative to the potential within the US of what could be if we addressed biases more effectively and really looked at the system. You could begin in the schooling system you can begin anywhere you want all the way through. Where do you think we are at a scale of 1-10 on fulfilling the true potential of the talent of the US.

Indra Nooyi: I think there's some of it in a a seven and eight because it's a relative thing. We don't know what the absolute is because it isn't anybody that much better than us. Relative to what I know we have in our country we have talent pools that are not fully utilized because there's no child care for them to come to work. I think that if wee taught stem in a very different way in schools and colleges more people will stay in stem and we can have more people homegrown who become quantum physicist or software engineers or all these advanced technologies. I think that there are changes we can make if we invested more in our own country like we're doing now that'll open up more jobs for people here. I think our potential is endless. I think there's somewhere between a seven and eight. A little push here and a little tug there we could just be unbeatable really. I think we underestimate what a great country we live in. We underappreciate.

Tom Gardner: Thank you for that. I'm wondering if there are a few CEOs alive or not that you either looked to as you were running the company. In many ways I would say the vast majority of my useful ideas for our company and I've plenty of bad ideas as well and the vast majority of the useful things that I've done in my role and their mistakes that I've made have come from other people that I've been able to sit and study because at the Motley Fool we're studying other companies all the time so we're able to see what Pepsi does and its culture and introduced that as a test and our culture see what that CEO did in deciding whether to make an acquisition or invest in R&D or not etc to just constantly be looking at the playbooks of other companies has been so helpful for me and I'm wondering if there are a few leaders today or when you were beginning as CEO at Pepsi or at any point in your life that standout as people that you admire and learn from loved and why.

Indra Nooyi: All of us say Steve Jobs. I had a chance to meet him and talk to him. I think he was a difficult person but an extraordinary person. How passionately felt about Apple that was his company the sense of ownership we had and the changes he had to make you just face the world head-on and said I've got to make changes. The reintroduced design thinking into Apple the way he invested in new technologies we're all fantastic. Anybody who had the opportunity to meet Steve Jobs lucky them and if you didn't I feel sorry for you because he was such an unusual person. Albert Bourla of Pfizer impresses me too the way MRNA was developed for COVID and Monster and what a humble guy he is. I just like him and I think people like him are hard to come by and I've liked Albert Bourla. Recently I've run into a woman called Penny Pennington who runs Edward Jones private company but extraordinarily smart in the way she runs the company. How she's made the Edward Jones culture her own and how she acts like the owner of Edward Jones in this partnership is spectacular and that's what you really need people who say I might be one of the partners or the managing partner but I'm going to make it one of my own very important. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Jeff Bezos. He built one of the most consequential companies of our times from the back of his car. Let's not forget from the back of his car. People like me stepped into an existing infrastructure and processes and systems and made it better and so somebody like Jeff Bezos transitioning to Andy Jassy today. I'm an often so I never learned from one I look at many people and then I'd take a little nugget from each of them.

Tom Gardner: I think there's a wonderful it may be a Seneca quote I can't remember the philosopher but it's essentially the idea that you may not love the author you may not love the book but you probably can find a really good line-

Indra Nooyi: Agreed.

Tom Gardner: Or a really amazing paragraph and is a wonderful way to study other leaders. You don't have to and evaluate whether check every single box.

Indra Nooyi: Exactly. Only one message to you that is profile.

Expert take,"As more reports of sudden cardiac arrest in young and healthy trickle in from various parts of the country the possible impact of Covid vaccine on heart has once again come under spotlight. Even as Covid vaccines have been marked safe and effective medical practitioners do not completely rule out a mild impact of vaccine on heart health. They however maintain that vaccine benefit far outweigh the side-effects if any suspected in people.

#Heartattack trended on Twitter a few days back after a series of unfortunate cardiac deaths - from a bride dying of heart attack during her varmala ceremony to a bus driver in Jabalpur succumbing to sudden cardiac arrest while driving the vehicle and in the process killing two others. Not so long back a middle-aged guy collapsed while dancing at his relative's wedding while the others looked on with horror. Such incidents are being reported after every few days and make people wonder if it is Covid or the vaccine that could be the culprit behind sudden cardiac deaths.

""Recently we have seen a lot of young people dying of acute heart attack and cardiac arrest in particular while doing physical activity like dancing driving wedding ceremonies and all. This was seen during peak Covid time also when a lot of people had presentation of cardiac arrest. Now post Covid vaccine too we have seen increase in cardiac events even when infected with milder form of Covid infection. Waves spurred by Omicron are lighter but they have got their own effect"" says Dr Viveka Kumar Principal Director & Chief of Cath Labs (Pan Max) - Cardiac Sciences.

""Couple of studies suggest that even if somebody had Covid few years back the effect may last longer than a year and a half - even two years. Probably we are seeing spurt in cardiovascular sudden deaths and Myocardial infraction because of Covid sequelae"" says Dr Kumar.

Is there a connection between vaccine and heart attack?

""Vaccine is not a complete answer yet because vaccine also led to certain side effects and caused cardiac events. There are people who have had only vaccine and within a week or a month’s time we saw that patient came with heart attack. Even after taking booster dose no further guidelines also whether in this milder Omicron era people should take booster doses or not. Covid is really taking its toll. Side effects of vaccine is of lesser intensity but Covid infection is causing increased events of cardiovascular events especially cardiac arrest"" adds Dr Kumar.

‘Pfizer vaccine associated with rare cases of myocarditis

According to Dr Neha Rastogi Panda Consultant Infectious Diseases Fortis Memorial Research Institute Gurugram Covid vaccine is rarely associated with any cardiac issues.

""Pfizer vaccine has been associated with rare cases of myocarditis - inflammation and thickening of heart muscle but till date among million vaccine users - 3-4 cases have been found and not fatal. Vaccine has minimal to no effect on heart rhythm abnormality except mild fluctuations in heart rate immediate post vaccination which is rare and mild in nature requiring no treatment. Covid disease itself causes more inflammation and long-term sequelae than vaccine"" says Dr Panda.

She adds that no cardiac arrest and no heart attack at football match or any other untoward cardiac incident is directly linked with Covid vaccine.

Causes of heart attack in young

""Heart ailments - inflammation coronary artery diseases or even heart attacks are multifactorial in nature with various attributes - lifestyle i.e sedentary obesity food habits. Second important factor - pre-existing comorbidities or conditions - diabetes hypertension lipid disturbance.

Third important factor could be COVID infection and its long-term sequelae. Both delta and omicron variant of COVID induces mild to moderate inflammation thrombosis - blood clot along with gradual changes in architecture of heart muscles and we have observed after COVID cardiac issues and problems.

As far as vaccine is considered no strong data to suggest adverse cardiac event or changes after vaccine"" says Dr Panda.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWF0dG9ybmV5LXByaXNvbi1yZWxlYXNlLWFwcGVhbC5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml6am91cm5hbHMuY29tL2NpbmNpbm5hdGkvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtYXR0b3JuZXktcHJpc29uLXJlbGVhc2UtYXBwZWFsLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Godfrey Phillips Breaking Out Capitalmind on YouTube: Investing at market highs sector rotation in 2023 & More

What’s up with markets? 📉📈

IT stocks suffered this week HCL tech corrected by 9.4% followed by Tech Mahindra and TCS. Due to macroeconomic turmoil in the west the IT sector is seeing headwinds and it will be a challenge to deliver higher growth.

Crude was down by 10.4% over last week as it went below $80 for the first time in 2022 due to recession and interest rate woes. It will be interesting to see if OPEC will cut down production to drive prices up “bring stability to the oil market”.

Off the Charts 📉📈

Foreign Portfolio Investments or FPIs are investments that are held by investors outside India. In the below chart we see the equity investments of FPIs in Indian stocks. Interesting to see our markets scaling new highs during a year when the FPI outflows have surpassed the exodus of 2008.

Of course the size of our market and the dollar value of investments will vary for these time points yet it’s a significant outflow nonetheless. The below chart also indicates the impact domestic investors have had in keeping the markets afloat and rising while FPIs have been large sellers in 2022.

Godfrey Phillips Breaking Out💡

Every week we at Capitalmind discuss what’s behind an outlier standing out. This week we have New Delhi-based Godfrey Phillips at the center stage.

The company has two major businesses:

Tobacco and related products: The company makes and sells cigarettes under its own brands–such as Four Square Red and White Cavanders Tipper North Pole and Stellar–and partner-brand Marlboro under an exclusive licensing agreement with global giant Philip Morris. In all they are the second-largest cigarette makers in India with about one-tenth market share with a network of 800+ distributors covering 800000+ retail touchpoints. Processed non-manufactured cut tobacco and tobacco leaves in India as well as 70+ other countries. This segment accounted for 89% of net sales during the first half of this financial year.

They also have a confectionary product line that primarily sells candies. Convenience stores and confectionary combined this segment accounted for 11% of net sales during the first half of this financial year.

Side note if your mind is wandering like mine did to the glaring question of why Phillips in Godfrey Phillips has two L’s and Philips in Philips Morris only has one the now-obvious answer is the two Philips (Phillips?) is referring to two different tobacconists. Yes “tobacconist” is a real word.

Coming back to the Godfrey Phillips the numbers don’t seem at par with some of its peers:

What’s the stock doing in Capitalmind Outliers then? Godfrey Phillips was earlier involved in making and selling chewing products a loss-making venture but the company has recently divested this segment to focus more on its core business. This a relatively stable taxation regime in recent times and signs of strengthening the partnership between Philip Morris and the company appear to have cheered up the markets.



It’s worth keeping in mind that the promoter family is currently in a legal dispute among themselves. Further developments could be an overhang in the future.

But Russia's barrage could force more Ukrainians to flee as winter bites,"CNN —

What Russia cannot win on the battlefield it is seeking to win by casting Ukrainian cities into the dark and cold as a long winter sets in.

The result is a grinding battle of attrition: Barrages of Russian missiles fly across Ukraine and Ukrainian power engineers work for days in freezing temperatures to restore power.

Monday saw the largest wave of missile attacks since November 23. Ukraine’s state power generator Ukrenergo says that about 40% of normal electrical supply was offline at one point in October.

It’s become known as the electricity deficit and it swings one way and another depending on missile impacts.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko the deputy chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN that “what the Ukrainian energy system has been experiencing since October no energy system in the world has ever experienced.”

The CEO of state power generator Ukrenergo Volodymyr Kudrytskyi says the issue is not in generating power but in getting it to the people.

“The enemy is hitting the most important facilities and key elements of substations that ensure the output… and transmission of electricity.” Kudrytskyi told CNN.

The Russians go after the most vulnerable parts of the system. “By the nature of the attacks we see that Russian missiles are directed by Russian power engineers” says Tymoshenko.

That’s in part because until this year Ukraine was in the same energy network as Russia and Belarus. Russian engineers knew the Ukrainian network inside out.

The main targets are high-voltage power lines substations and distribution grids.

Joseph Majkut director of the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies says that “Russia’s attacks have focused on key elements of Ukraine’s transmission network preventing generated electricity from moving through the grid and to consumers… and forcing blackouts to balance the grid.

“Attacks on high-voltage substations have been particularly damaging as they are critical for grid operation and difficult to repair.”

Ukraine is now scouring the world to find compatible parts and carry out repairs – as the morale of ordinary people is tested by power cuts that often last more than 12 hours a day. Prolonged blackouts threaten to send another wave of Ukrainian civilians fleeing westwards to Poland and other neighboring countries.

There is a glimpse of hope: Ukraine’s air defenses are getting better at taking out Russian cruise missiles often with newly arrived Western equipment. Ukraine said it had taken out about 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday; video emerged of one being intercepted by a German-made Gepard anti-air missile.

But as few as a dozen Russian missiles hitting critical targets wreak havoc. 15 gigawatts of Ukraine’s power capacity have been taken out compared to the pre-war capacity of 56 gigawatts (GW) of power according to Ukrenergo.

Gradually power engineers are patching up the system – by this week the electricity deficit had been cut to 19 per cent. But the recovery is tenuous.

Sergey Kovalenko CEO of power supplier YASNO says that “Ukrainians will most likely have to live with blackouts until at least the end of March.”

Some people in Kyiv have told CNN they are ready to retreat to rural dachas where at least wood-burning stoves provide warmth.

Specialist equipment

Conscious of the impact on Ukrainian morale Western governments have stepped up aid in the form of transformers thousands of generators and other equipment.

The US has mobilized allies in the G7 group to focus on a multi-layered approach to keeping the lights heat and water on. Washington has already provided more than $100 million for everything from circuit breakers to surge arresters and generators that are now reaching Ukraine.

The European Union is shipping emergency equipment including welding electrodes and circuit breakers. The Ukraine Energy Support Fund has sent 37 shipments from 20 countries; 47 more deliveries are scheduled.

Kudrytskyi the Ukrenergo CEO reels off the list of countries that have sent equipment Poland Germany Italy Finland and Lithuania among them.

But Ukraine’s grid also requires specialist equipment that’s made to order according to Joseph Majkut at CSIS. One example is the high voltage (750kV) system that moves electricity from nuclear plants to other parts of the grid.

“There is not enough equipment available to enable full and lasting repairs to the power grid. For example high voltage auto-transformers are hard to come by and have long lead times for fabrication from companies like Hitachi or Siemens” Majkut told CNN. They also weigh up to 250 tonnes.

Most of Europe runs at lower voltages and many critical items would need to be manufactured specifically to meet Ukraine’s needs. Tymoshenko told CNN that some would take six to nine months to make though he hoped that South Korea might be a promising source of compatible equipment.

Meantime Ukrainian engineers are carrying out patchwork repairs according to Kudrytskyi installing “used equipment that often does not meet the full technical specifications of the grid but can be temporarily implemented by grid engineers.”

But he warned the company is running out of equipment.

“Although Ukrenergo had a significant stock of other equipment for emergency restoration works it is being exhausted due to the scale of damage.”

There are some short-term options. As of the beginning of December USAID had provided 2200 generators to communities across the country. Hundreds more have been imported from Europe – and mobile boiler houses could provide heating for 7 million civilians later this winter the US State Department says.

Generators help keep critical services running: hospitals sewage plants housing for the vulnerable. But Kudrytskyi says they are “a temporary alternative. They cannot replace power generation at any type of power plant.”

They also require a lot of fuel of which there has been a shortage at times during the conflict.

In the longer-term Ukraine looks to its integration into the European grid. Tymoshenko told CNN that Ukraine’s power system has been part of the continental network since March after synchronization of the systems. This enables an easier trade in electricity.

“And this of course will encourage us to further technological development of the power system after victory” he says.

That synchronization is already paying dividends. To stabilize the grid in Ukraine some electricity destined for Kyiv or Odesa passes through Europe and back into Ukraine.

Defending the skies

The other half of the equation is better anti-missile defenses. With their S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile systems and more recently Germany’s highly capable IRIS-T and the US NASAMS Ukraine’s air defenses have intercepted a growing proportion of Russian cruise missiles and Iranian attack drones.

In October Ukrainian air defenses were taking out just over half of the cruise missiles being fired according to the Ukrainian military’s figures. That proportion is now above two-thirds - and the Ukrainians believe the Russians are running out of their more accurate systems.

Last month the Pentagon also cleared the dispatch of HAWK missiles (the launchers are coming from Spain) and four Avenger air-defense systems. The Ukrainians want more – and ask Germany and the US almost every day for Patriot missile batteries. US officials have been coy about the prospect saying it is not currently under discussion.

As engineers work around the clock Kudrytskyi said “the percentage of the electricity deficit is gradually decreasing. But then Russian missiles and drones again fly to Ukrainian energy facilities and destroy everything that has been restored.”

Some Ukrenergo facilities have been targeted eight times he said and eight times they’ve been patched up.

Tymoshenko told CNN: “The enemy aims to plunge Ukraine into cold and darkness. And we are aware that it requires courage and endurance from each of us this winter. We know that it will be the most difficult in the history of Ukraine.’

But he said he was confident Ukraine would prevail and that the ultimate goal was to “build back better” – and faster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvZ29vZ2xlLWFzc2lzdGFudC13aWxsLXN0b3AtcGF5aW5nLWZvci1nYXNfaWQxNDQxOTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starting Monday December 12th Assistant and Google Pay will not pay for your gas or parking spot,"

Android users have been employing Google Wallet to make quick payments at the point-of-sale (POS) terminals found inside retail stores. The only thing you have to do is tap the back of your Android phone against the POS terminal and verify your identity with the fingerprint sensor; after the satisfying ""ding"" is heard you're good to go. Google collects a small portion of the transaction as a fee.

Starting December 12th Google would prefer that you Tap-to-Pay at the pump







Instead of using Google Wallet's Tap-to-Pay some Android users have been using the ""pay for gas"" feature offered with Google Assistant/Google Pay. However this feature will be going away starting this Monday December 12th. With more gas stations supporting tap to pay at the pump it is so much easier to just let your phone do all the heavy lifting by tapping it against the pump in the right spot. Using Google Assistant or Google Pay's ""pay for gas"" option to pay for the gallons of Ethyl that you fill up your car with is a much longer process than simply using Google Wallet's Tap-to-Pay feature.











As 9to5Google mentions the Google Assistant/Google Pay process for paying for gas started in 2021 and requires you to select the pump number choose the payment method activate the pump pump the gas and make the payment. Participating gas purveyors include Union 76 Conoco Exxon Mobil Phillips 66 and Shell. Compare that process with Google Wallet's Tap-to-Pay which can be used at most gas stations. Put the phone against the pump. Start pumping the gas. That's it!





Google said ""We are removing the pay-for-gas feature from the Google Pay app in the US. We originally offered this functionality to give people a simpler way to pay at the pump and to help our partners enable contactless payments. As gas stations continue to get equipped with chip readers consumers are increasingly using tap and pay as their preferred method of contactless payments. Consumers can continue to use Google Wallet and Google Pay app to tap and pay at the pump.""

Google Assistant/Google Pay will no longer allow you to pay for street parking starting December 12th







Wait. There's more. Google Assistant/Google Pay will no longer allow you to ""pay for street parking."" With the feature you would have to select a certain parking zone from the Google Pay app select how much time you wanted to pay for and submit the payment. But starting this Monday December 12th Google would prefer that you use your local city's mobile payment option instead.









As Google said ""We are removing the pay-for-park feature from the Google Pay app in the US. We originally offered this functionality to give people a simpler way to pay at meter and to help our partners enable contactless payments. Consumers can continue to use their local city’s mobile payment option for parking.""





Frankly Tap-to-Pay is so convenient fast and easy why would you want to use anything else? And when the temperature is so cold outside that you don't feel like fumbling with your credit card to pay for gas (heck you can't even feel your credit card) Tap-to-Pay using your phone comes in handy.





So to make this clear Google is removing the ability for Android users to select the ""pay for gas"" or ""pay for street parking"" options using Google Assistant or Google Pay starting on December 12th. The Alphabet subsidiary wants you to Tap-to-Pay using Google Wallet and why shouldn't it? After all it is easier and quicker to use and the company still earns a small percentage of the transaction amount every time you use it to pay.





And as far as paying for ""street parking"" using Google Assistant and Google Pay will also be disallowed starting on December 12th. Use your local city's mobile payment option for parking instead.

Approximately 60 entries signed up for the Old Town Orcutt Christmas Parade which organizers had said would take place rain or shine.

However the rain remained away from Orcutt’s event as thousands of spectators lined Clark and Broadway to cheer on participants.

Recognizing Old Orcutt’s oil history the grand marshal of this year’s parade was Phillips 66.

Properties and Japanese firm Hankyu Hanshin launch new housing project in Laguna,"Laguna-based property developer P.A. Alvarez Properties and Development Corporation (P.A. Properties) and Japan’s Hankyu Hanshin Realty have added yet another feather in their hat as they formally launched their most recent community today: the Idesia Cabuyao. This is the newest offspring of their joint venture located in Brgy. Marinig Cabuyao Laguna.

P.A. Properties-Hankyu Hanshin takes pride in the 3.87-hectare modern Asian-inspired community comprising a total of 276 units which showcases the elevated sense of community of the Filipino and the expertise of the Japanese when it comes to quality living.

Idesia Cabuyao offers two house designs: the YAMA – Townhouse units and SORA – Single Attached housing units for both investors and home buyers. These designs are unique from the other Idesia township projects of P.A. Properties and Hankyu Hanshin in Dasmariñas Cavite; Lipa Batangas; and San Jose del Monte Bulacan.

One common denominator of the Idesia township projects is the consistency of P.A. Properties-Hankyu Hanshin in terms of putting a premium on the well-being of homeowners. Homeowners are assured of a togetherness zone a serenity zone and a wellness zone. The Idesia Cabuyao has been developed to be a haven for relaxation and quality family time. Not only does it have typical amenities such as the basketball court clubhouse indoor fitness gym swimming pool and children’s playground but also meditation gardens jogging paths and pet park which enable all members of the family to have a relaxing and enjoyable stay.

P.A. Properties-Hankyu Hanshin also carefully selected the project’s location making sure that the families will enjoy the peace and convenience of living in the province without having to sacrifice accessibility since the community is near several manufacturing establishments malls educational institutions hospitals and the South Luzon expressway (SLEX). This makes the community ideal not only for prospective homeowners but also for individuals on the lookout for the perfect real estate investment.

P.A. Properties-Hankyu Hanshin wants to assure future buyers and homeowners that despite the prime location expert architecture and complete amenities these homes in Idesia Cabuyao will still cater to low and middle-income families.

“Quality living in a secured and self-sufficient community near Metro Manila need not be expensive. With Idesia Cabuyao any average-earning Filipino has a fair chance at building a life that they once only dreamed of. Our doors are well open for everyone and we assure you that we will be with you every step of the way” says Atty. Marianne Reyna Lina – Cruz P.A. Properties’ President and Chief Executive Officer.

Recently P.A. Properties also celebrated its 28th anniversary. From a meager capitalization of 300000 pesos in 1994 the company has grown into a 23-billion-peso enterprise that is now recognized as one of the top developers in the country.

The Pag-IBIG Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) even recognized the company as the Top 8 developer in North Luzon and Top 7 in the National Capital Region for Q1-Q3 2022.

For nearly three decades P.A. Properties has successfully provided affordable homes and built safe and future-proofed communities in growth areas in the country. In this span of time the company has built more than 20000 housing and condominium units in over 40 communities in Laguna Batangas Cavite Bulacan Pampanga and Metro Manila.

These communities have stood the test of time and weather – a testament to the quality of homes that P.A. Properties have consistently brought to the table.

As the company continues to grow it vows to continue building affordable safe and future-proofed homes in key growth areas in the country because it believes that the Filipinos deserve nothing less.

In the current scenario of rising interest rates with the economy grappling with decadal-high inflation what would be the best investment option for retail investors who need an alternative to the ‘ever-loved’ fixed deposits? Direct investment in NCDs is the most logical alternative ex – Public Issue of NCDs.Which is the best investment for retail investors? An investment that high-return-low-risk combination perhaps? An investment vehicle that offers sky-high returns as quickly as possible without the risk of losing principal money period!But unfortunately such a combination doesn’t exist! Rather the ‘best investment’ would be the one that best matches one’s risk profile and traditionally we Indians have been predominantly risk averse.Speaking of traditions of the lot a few things you would most certainly find Indians engaging in – ‘Big Fat’ Indian weddings a plethora of colourful festivals and our parents and grandparents parking their savings in fixed deposits (FDs especially Bank FDs). What sparks this love affair between retail investors and bank deposits is simple – “one knows what they will receive when the FD matures” As per aSEBI investor Survey completed in 2018 more than 95% of the households preferred to invest in bank deposits.However with an increasing risk appetite of common retail investors and general rise in financial literacy the trend is changing especially in the current scenario grappled by global macro headwinds which have kept the central banks around the globe busy tackling the decadal-high inflation levels by tightening their respective monetary policies.Fixed deposits may be the most popular investment option in India but they aren’t the best. In the current rising interest rate environment plagued by high inflation investing in bank deposits primarily is not enough to build a substantial corpus as the returns get eaten into by tax and inflation rates and these are fairly large bites.Also the rates on these fixed deposits have not kept pace with rising interest rates. Though the RBI has raised the repo rate by 190 basis points since May it has not been fully transmitted by banks into lending and deposit rates. Banks currently offer interest rates on 5-year fixed deposits ranging from 5.80-7.00% but AAA rated NCDs offer much higher interest rates making them more attractive than fixed deposits which makes a good case of retail Investors moving to invest in such NCDs.The same is warranted from the overwhelming response garnered by National Highways Infra Trust’s (NHIT) public issue of NCDs in late October.NHIT the Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) which operates Toll road assets raised Rs 15 billion through 13-year 18-year and 25-year STRPP (Separately Transferable and Redeemable Principal Parts) bonds at 7.90% semi-annual coupon and was three times oversubscribed on the first day of their issuance. The public issue saw Retail participants submitting bids worth Rs 5.25 billion exceeding the retail portion by 1.4 times.The ability to diversify the investor base instead of being restricted to the institutional investor segment only (which they access via issue of debt capital on a private placement basis) against the backdrop of tight systemic liquidity augurs well for the issuers as well.So far in the year Indian corporates have raised Rs 41 billion between April and October this year and are expected to cross reach the Rs 100 billion mark by the close of FY23 with known issuers like L&T Finance Holdings and first-time issuers like Adani Enterprises Limited among others are expected to tap the bond market to raise debt capital via public issuance route in the coming months.(Ajay Manglunia MD & Head Investment Grade Group JM Financial Products Ltd",,,,,,,,,

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

For weeks in 2007 he stewed about it.

At the time Mr. Schultz hadn’t been in charge of Starbucks for years and he couldn’t shake the feeling that the company was adrift. Starbucks which had long sought to bring an authentic Italian coffee experience to the masses was in his view becoming watered down and warmed over. And no feature better epitomized the decline than its breakfast sandwiches — specifically the odor they gave off when heated.

“Whatever rich hearty coffee aroma remained in the store was overwhelmed by singed Monterey Jack mozzarella and most offensively cheddar” Mr. Schultz wrote in “Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul” the second of his three memoirs. He added: “As far as I was concerned nothing could be further from the romance of the Italian espresso bar. I could not stand it.”

The following year Mr. Schultz was back and the sandwiches were on their way out. It would not be the last time Mr. Schultz came back to fix a problem at Starbucks he thought no one else could. Since then he has left and come back again for a remarkable third turn in the C.E.O.’s chair.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYm9iZWNjbGVzLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvYS1zdWdnZXN0ZWQtdGFyZ2V0LWZvci1ob3VzZS1oZWFyaW5ncy1vbi1lc2ctbmV4dGVyYS1lbmVyZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Suggested Corporate Target For House Hearings On ESG: NextEra Energy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobeccles/2022/12/10/a-suggested-target-for-house-hearings-on-esg-nextera-energy/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYm9iZWNjbGVzLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvYS1zdWdnZXN0ZWQtdGFyZ2V0LWZvci1ob3VzZS1oZWFyaW5ncy1vbi1lc2ctbmV4dGVyYS1lbmVyZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbW1vbmRyZWFtcy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzExL21vbWVudHVtLXJlcGxhY2Utc2luZW1hLWFscmVhZHktYnVpbGRpbmctYWZ0ZXItc2hlLWRpdGNoZXMtZGVtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Momentum to 'Replace Sinema' Already Building After She Ditches Dems,"While the White House and Democratic congressional leadership are publicly hoping U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's departure from the party won't change much in Washington D.C. progressives in her home state of Arizona and across the nation are already pushing to replace the newly declared Independent if she runs for reelection in 2024.

The ""Primary Sinema"" campaign rebranded on Saturday as ""Replace Sinema"" following the senator's Friday announcement--which came just days after Democrats secured 51 seats in the Senate with Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) winning his second crucial runoff in as many years.

The Change for Arizona 2024 PAC project was launched in September ""to educate the public about the ways Kyrsten Sinema has let down Arizonans and caved to special interests"" said the campaign which has raised over $500000 from thousands of grassroots donors. ""Now as Kyrsten Sinema has left the Democratic Party the group's effort will shift toward defeating her in a potential three-way general election and replacing her with a real Democrat.""

Sinema--who insists she won't caucus with the GOP--is now one of three Independents in the upper chamber joining Sens. Angus King (Maine) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.) who both caucus with the Democrats. Sanders notably sought the party's nomination for president in 2016 and 2020.

The ""Replace Sinema"" campaign on Sunday spotlighted Sanders' morning appearance on CNN during which he called her out for so far serving as a ""corporate Democrat"" who along with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has ""sabotaged enormously important legislation.""

""I happen to suspect that it's probably a lot to do with politics back in Arizona"" Sanders said of Sinema abandoning the party. ""I think the Democrats there are not all that enthusiastic about somebody who helped sabotage some of the most important legislation that protects the interests of working families and voting rights and so forth.""

""So I think it really has to do with her political aspirations for the future in Arizona"" added Sanders who said he'd be watching closely to see who may challenge her in two years. ""But for us I think nothing much has changed in terms of the functioning of the U.S. Senate.""

In response to a video Sinema shared about her decision--which she has framed as an attempt to ""stay focused on solving problems and getting things done for everyday Arizonans""--Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted that ""not once in this long soliloquy does Sinema offer a single concrete value or policy she believes in.""

""She lays out no goals for Arizonans no vision no commitments"" the progressive ""Squad"" member added. ""It's 'no healthcare just vibes' for Senate. People deserve more. Grateful this race and nomination has opened up.""

Pushing back against Sinema's statements about the move Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) said: ""Bye Felicia... This isn't about the party this is about your pharma donors! Stop lying!""

Others also took aim at Sinema's wealthy donors and history of obstructing key priorities of President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats including efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and increase taxes on corporations.

""We are not surprised that she would once again center herself"" Alejandra Gomez executive director of Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA) toldThe New York Times. ""This is another unfortunate selfish act. It is yet another betrayal--there [has] been a slew of betrayals but this is one of the ultimates because voters elected her as Democrat and she turned her back on those voters.""

While suggesting her shift won't impede the party Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said in a statement that ""this is a predictable outcome for Sinema as she has entirely separated herself from any semblance of representing hardworking and struggling Arizonans. Her alignment with wealthy and corporate interests has crippled her ability to support the Democratic agenda.""

Stephanie Taylor co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee toldThe Hill that ""she should join her friends on Wall Street in 2024 and Democrats should nominate someone truly on the side of the working class who can unite and win Arizona.""

Morris Pearl chair of the Patriotic Millionaires highlighted that ""in the past year alone she torpedoed efforts to raise corporate taxes in Biden's Build Back Better Act killed the momentum to change the carried interest loophole in the Inflation Reduction Act and tanked the movement to change the filibuster to safeguard American elections--all things that Democrats rightly wanted to do to make life better for working people.""

""By registering as an Independent Sinema is just admitting what the rest of us have known for years--she has no allegiance to the Democratic Party or Democratic voters. Sinema works for her ultrarich corporate donors and no one else"" he added. ""Her label change might improve her prospects of winning a corporate board room seat after her inevitable demise in 2024 but it won't change the fact that she has never and will never have the best interests of ordinary Arizonans and Americans at heart.""

Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats tweeted that ""Sinema and her big corporate donors know her politics have no path forward among Democratic primary voters. She's made this decision simply to cling to power as one of corporate America's leading obstructionists to the Democratic Party agenda.""

""After seeing her horrifically low poll numbers with Democratic voters Sinema is once again doing everything she can to protect herself and big corporate donors at the expense of multiracial democracy"" Shahid toldThe Hill.

""Either Kyrsten Sinema is actively helping the Republican Party by splitting the Democratic vote or she is a fundamentally self-interested person who would rather throw lives under the bus than give up her political career"" said Ellen Sciales of the Sunrise Movement who wants to see a progressive challenger. ""We're wondering if she's just trying to force the Democratic Party to not challenge her in 2024 because she knows her polling is incredibly unpopular.""

""There's a whole question about her calculus here"" Sciales continued. ""One thing is really clear: She's not thinking about the people of Arizona she's thinking about her own political career.""

As the Times detailed:

The working assumption in Arizona political circles has long been that progressive anger at Ms. Sinema was concentrated among Democratic political activists and that she could survive a primary from her left. But recent polling suggests that she has lost the confidence of many Arizona voters outside the center-right Chamber of Commerce types whom she has cultivated with the latest iteration of her political identity.



A Civiqs survey conducted shortly before Election Day found she had an approval rating of just 7% among the state's Democrats 27% among Republicans and 29% among Independents.



While some such as Pearl were more optimistic about 2024 others warned that despite victories by Democrats in statewide races last month the party could face a significant battle if it runs a candidate and Sinema seeks reelection--a topic she has declined to address in recent days despite an abundance of media attention.

NBC News reported on comments from a leader in the state Democratic Party which last year censured Sinema after she opposed reforming Senate rules to pass a voting rights bill:

""I am not surprised. But I'm still shockingly disappointed at how awful she continues to be"" said Michael Slugocki an outgoing vice chair of the Arizona Democratic Party. He said Sinema has had ""no relationship and no contact with the state party for months"" and did not inform them prior to her decision.



""It does shake up this race"" in 2024 he said. ""She's deliberately trying to make it difficult for Democrats in Arizona.

He added that her decision could also make it harder for Democrats to carry Arizona on the presidential level again in two years if she spends two years attacking her party and splintering its successful coalition. ""It does make things more difficult for Joe Biden but I don't think she cares at all.""



Arizona-based pollster Mike Noble chief research and managing partner at OH Predictive Insights toldThe Hill that ""the fastest growing political party in the state is actually Independent voters.""

""There's got to be representation for folks more in the middle"" he said. ""I could absolutely see Democrats having a progressive candidate Republicans having a more hard-right candidate and then you have Sinema in the middle. Absolutely there is a path to victory there for her.""

Stacy Pearson an Arizona-based Democratic strategist who wasn't surprised by Sinema's move given criticism from the party in their state agreed that Sinema has a decent shot at winning.

""Democrats in Arizona only comprise 30% of the electorate"" Pearson pointed out. ""It's the smallest bloc behind Republicans on top and Independents in second place.""

Grijalva told the Times that he would support fellow Democratic Arizona Congressman Ruben Gallego if he runs for Senate in 2024 but also issued a warning: ""Anybody that underestimates Sen. Sinema is being foolish... She's going to be formidable if she decides to run.""

The newspaper interviewed Gallego who referenced Warnock's Tuesday win:

""I wish she would have waited for the Democrats at least to enjoy a couple more days after the victory"" he said. ""But you know she's not known really for thinking of others.""



Mr. Gallego said he would make a decision about what office to seek in 2024 in the new year. He had just gotten off the phone with his mother who was catching up on the news.



""She said: 'I heard Sinema is not running. Make sure to talk to me before you do anything'"" Mr. Gallego said.



The other potential Democratic candidate whose name is already making the rounds is another Arizona congressman: Greg Stanton a former Phoenix mayor who on Friday tweeted an image of results from a statewide survey about his possible run for Senate.

""Democratic leaders were cagey on Friday about how they would approach the 2024 race or a potential Independent Sinema campaign"" according to the Times. ""Representatives for Senate Democrats' campaign arm and for Senate Majority PAC the leading Democratic super PAC devoted to Senate races declined to comment on Friday afternoon about Ms. Sinema's move.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement that Sinema ""asked me to keep her committee assignments and I agreed. Kyrsten is Independent; that's how she's always been. I believe she's a good and effective senator and am looking forward to a productive session in the new Democratic majority Senate. We will maintain our new majority on committees exercise our subpoena power and be able to clear nominees without discharge votes.""

Whilte House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre struck a similar tone:

Sen. Sinema has been a key partner on some of the historic legislation President Biden has championed over the last 20 months from the American Rescue Plan to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law from the Inflation Reduction Act to the CHIPS and Science Act from the PACT Act to the Gun Safety Act to the Respect for Marriage Act and more. We understand that her decision to register as an Independent in Arizona does not change the new Democratic majority control of the Senate and we have every reason to expect that we will continue to work successfully with her.



Meanwhile progressive strategist Max Berger said of Sinema ditching Democrats ""The level of shamelessness that it takes to do something like this at this particular moment in history it's really mind-boggling.""

""The White House and leadership have no choice but to treat her like a very important figure in the Senate but they should be working to defeat her as quickly as possible"" he argued. ""No one should have the slightest amount of deference or respect for her because what she's done is a betrayal of the voters of Arizona and of American democracy and it's loathsome.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXBvbGl0aWNzLXR3aXR0ZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Are the Politics of Elon Musk?

But droves of Wall Street employees are resisting those mandates as the future of work evolves. On Wall Street as in most corporate settings the pre-pandemic office shows few signs of roaring back.

A survey of employees across the financial industry published last month — covering institutions including the likes of Goldman Sachs BlackRock and JPMorgan — found 95% of respondents favored hybrid work while only a handful backed a full-time office return.

The study conducted by Women in Banking and Finance and the London School of Economics saw none of the 100 participants however call for fully remote setups.

“Experimentation within firms is the best way to understand what is needed for operations to run smoothly while allowing for maximum productivity” authors Dr. Grace Lordan Dr. Jasmine Virhia and Yolanda Blavo said. “Leaders need to let go of wanting to know what their team is doing every second of every day and focus on what they’re achieving.”

The report underscores the struggle Wall Street institutions face in a post-pandemic world filling their offices with staff day in and day out.

Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon — among the staunchest of remote work critics in the financial industry — appeared to admit in a conference on Tuesday that even he has only managed to get employees back on site four days per week.

“We needed to create a culture of bringing people back very quickly because we thought it was hurting our competitive position as a business and so we have nudged cajoled and evolved but the bottom line is we generally are operating close to the way we operated before the pandemic — certainly Monday to Thursday"" Solomon said in an interview at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit Tuesday

""Our business is a professional services human capital business where 50% of the people who work for Goldman Sachs around the world are in their twenties and they come to Goldman Sachs to have an experience to learn to work in teams and to collaborate” Solomon said.

""And if that's all fragmented that experience breaks down and that's a hugely important part of what Goldman Sachs is — how we serve our clients how we operate.""

Solomon — who famously called remote work an ""aberration"" — has pushed for a full-scale office return since last year.

The bank also lifted COVID mandates this fall a move seen as removing the last remaining hurdles that might stop employees from daily office attendance. Still insiders have told Yahoo Finance many workers kept flexible setups with individual teams establishing their own rules.

Story continues

3 + 2 = 5

Some firms in the financial world however have charted less ambitions office-attendance courses than Goldman Sachs with an eye towards finding a mandate that can actually be enforced.

Earlier this year BlackRock ordered staff to be on-site three days per week as first reported by Yahoo Finance. The world’s largest asset manager said that exceptions to its “3 + 2 model” — or three days in an office two days out — would be “rare and require formal approval” through an official exception request.

“Time together is how we deliver for clients” BlackRock's COO Rob Goldstein and head of human resources Manish Mehta wrote in an email sent to employees in September. CEO Larry Fink said the same day in a TV interview the company would take a “harder line” on bringing people back.

In a September survey Deloitte subsidiary Casey Quirk – a consulting arm of the business that advises investment and wealth management firms – found the bulk of industry leaders have implemented a “3-days-in the office 2-days-remote” model even accepting that “Fridays have been lost forever.” Responses were collected from 28 of the world’s largest asset managers per Casey Quirk collectively managing about $48 trillion in funds.

Those which maintained a “laissez-faire” office-is-open-but-optional policy saw low attendance with few reaching the modest 50% or more level of employees coming in one day per week according to the survey.

Some participants remained hopeful the 3 and 2 model was an interim step to transitioning back to a five-day in-office work week.

Overall the asset management leaders in Casey Quirk’s study said return-to-office policies have been difficult to implement without strong language.

“Interestingly our research showed that while there were some firm leaders at each extreme — those who were strident proponents of five days a week in the office and others willing to completely rethink the traditional in-person model — most ended up in the same place for practical purposes” the report said. ""Leadership teams think that ‘3/2’ achieves a reasonably beneficial equilibrium for all parties.""

'The paradigm has shifted quite significantly'

PGIM the asset management division of insurance giant Prudential is among prominent Wall Street names that has advocated for flexible work.

“What we have done that is a bit different from our competitors is that we have not issued mandates” PGIM VP and head of human resources Pamela Sinclair told Yahoo Finance in an interview. “We have allowed each business leader to decide what works for them.”

The response from employees has been so positive that office attendance is near 2019 levels Sinclair said though emphasizing the firm does not track badge swipes to monitor who shows up but rather for a head count on catering orders for lunch.

Sinclair said PGIM has “embedded flexibility” into its workplace for the long haul.

In its own survey of the broader corporate world conducted in conjunction with Morning Consult the firm found attitudes about the new way of working vary widely.

For example 57% of workers said returning on-site has increase stress and that stress could be alleviated by employer flexibility about worksite attendance. On the other hand 47% of employees reported concerns about career advancement opportunities in a remote or hybrid work environment and 47% feared it would be harder to learn new skills.

At the manager level 44% said navigating remote work policies has burned them out and the same share were concerned about falling behind in their own career development.

Overall 78% of workers still believed hybrid work models that balance remote and in-person work will be a mainstay over the next 10 years.

“I don’t think you can ask people to work from home for two years and then suddenly say you can’t do that again” Sinclair told Yahoo Finance. “I think the paradigm has shifted quite significantly.”

Most people in Pioneer Theatre Company’s audience already own the 1983 film A Christmas Story or know how to find one of the marathon screenings on cable TV. So why would one venture out to the theater to see the decade-old musical version?

On its own A Christmas Story: The Musical doesn’t make a terribly convincing case. But director-choreographer Karen Azenberg and her high-energy cast more than make up for any shortcomings in the material. Azenberg strikes just the right tone in delivering an evening that’s wholesome enough for children and witty enough to keep the grown-ups entertained.

The story set in 1940s Indiana revolves around nine-year-old Ralphie Parker who desperately yearns for a Red Ryder Carbine-Action BB Gun. Mack Boyer (alternating with Soren Ray) is a marvel in the role. He sings with ebullience and accuracy even when galloping all over the stage on a stick horse in “Ralphie to the Rescue” one of the musical’s many delightful fantasy sequences. His stage presence is natural and winsome; the scene in which Ralphie tries to hide his disappointment on Christmas morning is beautifully acted.

Boyer receives strong support from a dozen talented children. Asher Nehring as younger brother Randy shows a fine comic touch and harmonizes skillfully with Boyer. The other children in the cast sing and dance like pros; Daniel Sorokine is a standout as the unfortunate Flick. A similarly sized adult ensemble zips through the production numbers. The brass- and wind-heavy pit orchestra overpowered them at first on Friday but was quickly reined in by conductor Helen Gregory.

Danny Bernardy and Stacie Bono as Ralphie’s parents convey real affection for each other and their children. Owing to a chest cold Stacie Bono acted the role of Mother on opening night while Stephanie Maloney sang from the wings. (The effect misfired only once; otherwise Maloney’s vocals aptly reflected the warmth of Bono’s stage performance.) Bernardy delivers The Old Man’s string of faux obscenities including “Fahrvergnügen” and “Chuck-a-Rama” with panache while Bono makes Mother’s exasperation and forbearance equally believable.

Creators Joseph Robinette (book) and Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (music and lyrics) have given a handful of songs to the parents in an effort to flesh out the characters—or perhaps to give the boy playing Ralphie a breather. These songs feel redundant but are serviceable enough: “The Genius on Cleveland Street” gives The Old Man a chance to do more than bluster while “What a Mother Does” makes the subtext of under-appreciated Mother clear to anyone who might have missed it. “A Major Award” on the other hand does full justice to one of the film’s most iconic scenes and Bernardy is in top form joining the dancing lamps in a kick line.

Author Jean Shepherd who based Ralphie on his childhood self was the unseen narrator in the Christmas Story film. In the musical the narrator occupies a liminal space—addressing the audience directly never speaking to the characters but occasionally handing them props. Don Noble’s performance in PTC’s production is less droll and more matter-of-fact than Shepherd’s.

The musical offers few surprises to anyone who has seen the movie; Friday’s audience laughed at all the punchlines before the characters delivered them. And most of the tunes aren’t as instantly indelible as “Ralphie to the Rescue” which is probably why it pops up two or three times.

The most fun comes from Azenberg’s clever stage pictures James Noone’s charming snow-globe set (including a priceless crayon-picture backdrop for “Ralphie to the Rescue”) and Azenberg’s pitch-perfect choreography. For example the fantasy sequence set in a speakeasy featuring the strict schoolteacher Miss Shields as a flapper could so easily have gone wrong but in the hands of EJ Zimmerman and her backup dancers it’s both innocent and irresistible—an apt encapsulation of this jolly production.

30 Units To Rise On Maple Avenue In Monsey

Financing has been secured and ground broken for parcels at 200 202 204 and 206 Maple Avenue in Monsey. Northeast Community Bank has agreed to provide a construction loan in the amount of $9795000 to Arem Associates LLC of Spring Valley.

Construction is underway on the 1.23 acre parcel for five buildings consisting of 15 duplexes and 15 accessory apartments for a total of 30 units.

The project dates back to 1998 when a subdivision map was approved and filed with the County Clerk. Several variances were granted to the developer by the Town of Ramapo to enable the project to move forward. The Maple Avenue corridor in Monsey has seen extensive redevelopment over the years.

Northeast Community Bank is providing financing at the prime rate plus 2 percent with an interest rate floor of 7.5 percent for a two-year interest only loan. The prime rate as per the Wall Street Journal is currently 7 percent. Interest rate floors are commonly used by lenders to secure a minimum interest rate regardless of changes to the prime rate.

Last month Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) presented a webinar outlining the company’s vision of a 6G world and the technological advances it will both require and enable.

“This initial work on 6G is setting the stage for this broader focus on where cellular needs to go next. What are going to be those use cases in 2030? What are the technologies that are going to enable the most cost-effective cellular deployment?” said John Smee senior vice president of engineering at Qualcomm.

‘Huge Path Ahead’

According to the timeline laid out in the presentation early deployment of 6G capabilities could begin as soon as 2030. Currently cellular is in the ending stage of the initial implementation of 5G and the beginning stage of rolling out “5G Advanced” Smee said.

The initial rollout of the 5G platform included innovations like mobile millimeter wave technology; advancements in cellular vehicle-to-everything and industrial IoT uses; a new spectrum above 52.6 GHz; and non-terrestrial networks using satellites. 5G standardization still has “another full five years” ahead while 5G advancements are being researched optimized and deployed.

“There’s a huge path ahead of us for 5G Advanced as we’re setting the stage for 6G” Smee said.

That path includes implementing smart repeaters for extended coverage; utilizing AI and machine learning data-driven designs; and advancing extended reality capabilities.

Starting in the second half of 2026 Qualcomm will begin work on the first release of the 6G platform with a goal of initial deployment in 2030.

‘Predicting the Future’

To begin planning for 6G Qualcomm engineers are taking a “long view” of where cellular technology and its applications are today and where these applications are heading over the next 15 years Smee said and specifically cited technologies like collaborative robotics and holograms.

“Where does that technology need to be in 2030 even in 2035 and 2040” he said. “It’s important to understand that just as 5G is addressing the era of 2020 to 2030 6G is addressing the era of 2030 into 2040.”

Smee said understanding the evolution of technologies virtual reality and wireless sensors and use cases for it like smart hospitals allows engineers to create an “overall core network design” that will enable them to be put together and serve more effectively.

“As we’re designing 6G it’s not about perfectly predicting the future” he said. “It’s also about making sure we’re designing the system to be scalable so it can address some the future’s unknown use cases.”

Core Technologies

Although some future use cases are unknown many will be based on advancing current technology in development like digital twins for use in medicine and factories or 3D computing for immersive experiences in the metaverse.

To enable these technologies for use on the cellular network Smee said 6G will need to evolve the use of AI and machine learning from 5G’s “cross-node” system where the AI on devices and the AI in the network coordinate with each other to a “native” system where the machine learning operates autonomously between the network and devices.

“Technologies like machine learning and AI can be brought to bear much more foundationally in 6G than they were in the 5G era that started in the research stage more than 10 years ago” he said.

In addition to utilizing advancements in AI computing the 6G platform will also need to utilize advancements in core cellular technologies like an expanded spectrum band.

The 6G spectrum will target all spectrum types and bands including research into upper mid-bands and sub terahertz bands. Engineers are also exploring ways to go beyond the licensed spectrum and find ways to share unlicensed spectrum.

“So the 6G spectrum is going to target all types of bands to make sure we have the most economical use of spectrum to meet as many of the use cases and requirements as possible” Smee said.

Other core technology advancements for 6G’s cellular “air interface” include improving antennae to have higher gain and better steering of signal to enable more coverage area for the higher frequency bands. A 6G network will also utilize technologies like small sub cells and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces to enable the coverage and positioning needed for the vast amounts of data expected for the network’s use cases.

“A lot of these core technology advancements are the ingredients that we can put together creatively to have a compelling 6G era interface and make sure we’re bringing that balance of technology evolution and at the same time leveraging these core advancements” Smee said.

Notable: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X65 is the first 10 Gigabit 5G modem-to-antenna solution designed for rapid commercialization in mobile broadband fixed wireless industrial IoT and 5G private networks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZmluaW1pemUuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvdHNtY3MtbW9uZXllZC1hbmQtbW92aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chipmaker TSMC bucked the broader chip slump,"TSMC the world’s biggest contract chipmaker revealed on Friday that business was booming in November.

What does this mean?

Talk about a killer month: TSMC raked in over $7 billion in revenue this November – a whopping 50% improvement from the same time last year – to bring this quarter’s revenue goal of around $20 billion within spitting distance. The reason for that sterling performance is simple: the firm’s top-of-the-range chip-making services were snapped up by titans like Qualcomm while its favorite customer Apple has got TSMC producing chips to power its latest high-end iPhone. That means that while whole swathes of the chip industry are being rocked to sleep by a spiraling global economy TSMC’s still bright-eyed bushy-tailed and bagging success after success.

Why should I care?

Zooming in: Caught in the crossfire.

TSMC’s based in disputed territory Taiwan and operates in a powder-keg industry – so despite the firm’s bumper revenue its bosses probably aren’t sleeping all that soundly at night. After all the US is trying to cut China off from the kind of high-tech chips TSMC specializes in and is encouraging TSMC to take its operations to safer overseas locations – to the US in short. That meant that TSMC’s decision to up its investment in Arizona from $12 billion to $40 billion last week probably wasn’t a total bolt from the blue. But it could signal that the firm’s moving into a new prominent role at the heart of US chipmaking.

The bigger picture: Made in China soon.

China’s not going to take this lying down mind you. The People’s Republic is bringing out the big guns Alibaba and Tencent to design chip tech rivaling anything the West has got its hands on. But Rome wasn’t built in a day and experts think China’s vision of home-grown first-class chips could remain a pipe dream for another few years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi93ZXZlLWJlZW4tbG9va2luZy1hdC10aGUtZ29vZ2xlLXBpeGVscy10ZW5zb3ItY2hpcC1hbGwtd3JvbmctaGVyZXMtd2h50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We've been looking at the Google Pixel's Tensor chip all wrong — here's why,"Google went its own way with the Pixel's chipset last year introducing the Tensor G1 with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. When those phones launched a lot of people including us here at Tom's Guide criticized the relatively weak performance when compared to other flagships at the time.

Fast forward to 2022 with the Tensor G2 powering the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. Google made a lot of strides in terms of performance but the new chip still lags behind Qualcomm and Apple.

But I think we as an industry and as Android enthusiasts have looked at Google's new venture wrong. It's not about the Geekbench or 3DMark numbers. It's about what the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) — the part Google added to the system-on-chip — can do. Here's what I mean.

Numbers don't always tell the full story

When we look at Tensor's numbers in synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench and 3DMark Wild Life they aren't all that impressive. Compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 such as what you find in the Galaxy S22 the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro lag behind by a few hundred points.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

But looking at the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 the gap widens. For example the Galaxy Z Fold 4 scored 1328 in single-core and 3831 in multicore. The Pixel 7 Pro managed just 1060 and 3046 respectively. And don't get us started on the delta between the latest Google flagship and the iPhone 14 Pro.

No the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are not powerhouses on the level of Apple or any Android phone using the latest Qualcomm silicon. But they aren't meant to be. Google isn't chasing the performance crown.

So what is the point of Tensor? I'm glad you asked.

What is Tensor actually for?

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Google has outright said Tensor is meant for AI and the proof is in the pudding. I've hailed the Pixel 7 Pro as the smartest phone ever. It can do things that seemed impossible on a smartphone just a few years ago — the Pixel 5 as much as I love it did not inspire much confidence which made the Pixel 6 such a revelation.

Tensor is designed to show off Google's software prowess.

With features like Magic Eraser Photo Unblur Call Suite and the fantastic Assistant upgrades the Pixel 7 Pro has no equal when it comes to AI and machine learning on a smartphone. Don't get me wrong the iPhone 14 Pro comes very close like being able to copy or translate text from basically anything or pulling the subject out of a photo to paste elsewhere. But Google has the edge.

Tensor is designed to show off Google's software prowess. It's the showcase for Assistant's future the computational photography magic that we see get better each year and the future of how we interact with a smartphone.

Tensor outlook

Tensor is what makes Pixels unique in an ocean of same-y phones. It's more than just the design. (Though the camera bar does draw a lot of attention.) Although it is a great device in its own right the Galaxy S22 Ultra struggles to catch up to the Pixel 7 Pro in pushing the smartphone forward despite features such as the S Pen.

I get a lot of joy out of using the Pixel 7 Pro more than any other phone released this year. And no it's not a perfect phone. The battery life is inexcusable. The display could be brighter. Charging is still slow.

But Tensor is one the most exciting things to happen in this industry in a long while and I can't believe I've been looking at it the wrong way this whole time. I look forward to seeing Tensor G3 and what it can do in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5ld3Nib3kuY29tL3hpYW9taS0xMy14aWFvbWktMTMtcHJvLWxhdW5jaGVkLXByaWNlLXNwZWNpZmljYXRpb25zLWF2YWlsYWJpbGl0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xiaomi 13 Xiaomi 13 Pro launched: price specifications availability,"Xiaomi 13 and Xiaomi 13 Pro prices availability and full specifications were announced during the launch event on Sunday.

A major company that runs testing sites and medical laboratories across the country will take over much of Northern Light Health’s lab services operation next spring.

Under the arrangement Quest Diagnostics will manage nine of Northern Light’s hospital laboratories as well as the laboratory at Northern Light Cancer Care in Brewer. Northern Light employees working in the labs will become Quest Diagnostics employees and no one is being laid off according to Northern Light spokesperson Suzanne Spruce.

Quest which is acquiring the Northern Light assets in an all-cash transaction is based in New Jersey and has more than 2250 lab locations throughout the U.S. Its existing Maine operations are scattered across York and Cumberland counties.

Northern Light based in Brewer is the parent organization for 10 hospitals including Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and affiliated medical practices.

The acquisition will allow more Maine patients and physicians to access Quest’s testing options and allow for lower out-of-pocket costs for many services Quest Diagnostics and Northern Light said in a joint statement announcing the transaction.

Quest’s laboratory in Marlborough Massachusetts will provide nonurgent advanced and routine clinical testing for physicians and patients now served by Northern Light Laboratory. A Quest rapid response lab in the Bangor area and select Northern Light Health hospital labs will perform tests requiring rapid results.

“Diagnostic testing is a highly specialized and rapidly evolving area of medicine” Northern Light Health President and CEO Timothy Dentry said. “By collaborating with Quest Diagnostics the industry leader Northern Light Health positions itself to deliver the highest level of diagnostic innovation service and affordability while energizing our core focus on patient care.”

The parties will complete the transaction in the first quarter of 2023 but declined to disclose the financial details of the deal.

The transaction between Northern Light and Quest isn’t yet finalized so many details such as how patients will schedule lab services where they’ll go and where their bills will come from will be worked out in the coming months Spruce said.

For the time being Spruce said people who receive diagnostic lab services from Northern Light will continue to do so at the same places and through the same processes and will continue to do so until the sale is final next year.

This sale comes at a time when the health care industry has seen challenges and changes Spruce said and “we must continue to evolve to survive.”

“Diagnostic laboratories are highly specified high tech organizations that need continuous investment” Spruce said. “Stepping away from this space leaves more room for us to focus on and invest in the delivery of patient care.”

Though Northern Light understands change is difficult Spruce said the health care system “feels good about this relationship.”

“Annually Quest serves one in three adult Americans and half the physicians and hospitals in the United States” she said. “They know how to do this very well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTEvaGVhbHRoL2Z1bGxlci10b3JyZXktcHN5Y2hvc2lzLWNvbW1pdG1lbnQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Behind New York City's Shift on Mental Health a Solitary Quest (Published 2022),"BETHESDA Md. — The psychiatrist E.

And touchdowns. And almost every other passing statistic. But what is remarkable — what sets him apart from most athletes in most sports — is that he is still playing at age 45 and still performing at an elite level.

To put that in perspective we’ve come up with a list of history’s greatest quarterbacks as a comparison. Each week we’ll look at the final three seasons of a different quarterback versus what Brady has done with the Bucs in presumably his final three seasons.

It’s not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison because there are differences in eras and most quarterbacks are retired long before 45. But it does give you an idea of how rare it is to see a player still dominating while holding off middle age.

Brady vs. Roethlisberger

The set-up: He was an elite quarterback who will be a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame but “Big Ben” may still be one of the more underrated passers in history. Roethlisberger threw for more than 60000 yards and won two Super Bowls. Do you know how many other quarterbacks can match those milestones? Brady and Peyton Manning. That’s it. Roethlisberger had a higher passer rating than Joe Montana and won more Super Bowls than Brett Favre or Drew Brees. Not a bad legacy.

The end: Roethlisberger had been dealing with an elbow injury for years before blowing it out on a deep pass in Week 2 of the 2019 season. He was 37 at the time and was coming off a season when he led the NFL in passing yards. Roethlisberger had surgery and missed the rest of the season but came back in 2020 to go 12-3 and throw for more than 500 yards in a playoff loss to the Browns. He made his 12th postseason appearance at age 39 before calling it quits.

Roethlisberger

Years: 2019-21

Ages: 37-39

Completed 824 of 1275 passes with 55 touchdowns and 21 interceptions for 7894 yards and a 89.3 passer rating. Was 21-12 as a starter.

Brady

Brady in Week 14: Arguably the most embarrassing game of Brady’s NFL career. Playing near his boyhood home in the San Francisco bay area he was under pressure from the pass rush threw behind receivers complained constantly to officials and the Bucs were blown out by halftime. Brady has more interceptions in the past two games than he did in the season’s first 11 weeks.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports | Reuters



Ever since Tom Brady got the ‘questionable’ flag against the Atlanta Falcons in his favor there has been much debate on the topic. Many NFL legends have called the call wrong.

Shannon Sharpe is the latest in the list to have his say. Three-time Super Bowl winner has called out Brady after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback said it wasn’t him who was throwing the flags.

Shannon Sharpe calls out Tom Brady

Sharpe was appearing on his ‘Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED’ talk show where he almost went on a rant against Brady.“I got a problem with Brady because look I don’t throw the flags but all you do is complain and whine about it. That’s what started the scuffle at New Orleans. Because you thought Mike Evans got interfered with so you ran your butt down the field. You got an unsportsmanlike conduct in the divisional round because you thought you got hit too hard and you said something” Sharpe said. “So this notion about you don’t throw flags you are right Tom. But you complain an awful lot to get flags thrown”.

Reacting to Brady calling the tackle on him by Jarret “a long unwelcome hug” the analyst said on his podcast. He wanted NFL players to do to Tom Brady what he did to Jarret. Sharpe was referring to the apparent kicking incident.

“I want players to start doing to him what he did to Grady Jarrett. I want somebody to start kicking at Tom Brady to let him know how it feels because he has a history” Sharpe went on.“You remember a couple of years ago he had a problem about having a slide and going like you going to second base. So let’s talk about how Tom is a little dirty too while we are here” the legendary Tight End added.

The controversy

The controversy erupted when Brady was sacked in the game against the Falcons by Grady Jarrett. The referee deemed the play as roughing the passer. Due to the call the Buccaneers who were leading by six points in the last quarter prevented a turnover. Tampa ran the clock out to win the game after that call. It has been a hot topic ever since.

Journalists pressed Brady about the call after the game. “I don’t throw the flags” was his answer for everyone. This controversy doesn’t seem to have an end in sight and the debate about the call will go on. What is your view on the call?

The loss of EVGA in the graphics card markets was surprising and affected several company fans. EVGA has had a long history with its consumer base and its departure left users needing to find another manufacturer that would compare to the company. Some cards were offered to prominent tech YouTube content creators that have worked with EVGA but a few are still in the company's possession.

Now EVGA is taking to the popular auction site eBay to sell the remaining engineering samples of the RTX 4090 FTW3 graphics cards. The company plans to donate the net proceeds from the auction to the St. Jude Children's Hospital furthering the organization's help in combatting diseases and searching for cures.

The eBay auction which was set to end in six days has now seemingly disappeared from the site. VideoCardz last reported that the bidding price was sitting at $13100. It is unknown if the card was pulled due to a significantly larger offline bid or something else entirely. Before the link disappeared the auction listing read:

Limited Edition EVGA Next Gen Video Card.

100% of proceeds benefit St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital

Ships directly from EVGA. United States Only.

This is a working card but is preproduction and sold as is.

No warranty/returns.

YouTuber JayzTwoCents notified his Twitter followers about the charitable auction from Team EVGA and was met with atypical Twitter responses of doubt graciousness trolling and more. However JayzTwoCents did confirm that the auction was actual but has not commented about it missing at the present moment. The EVGA card was featured during last night's Team EVGA stream on the streaming platform Twitch but the highest recorded bid only had reached $6600 at the last recorded time.

EVGA will continue to sell computer components and peripherals but has halted production of its graphics card line due to conflicts with the leading company NVIDIA. Some users speculated that AMD would partner with EVGA to take NVIDIA's ex-partnership for their gain but the company has been straightforward about never selling GPUs again.

After the company’s abrupt exit from the GPU market the GeForce RTX 4090 FTW3 prototype or “Next Gen Graphics Card” as EVGA calls it due to licensing issues will make a fine collector’s item.

EVGA previously took to eBay to auction off the graphics card. It had fetched up to $13200 before eBay removed the listing. The company has restarted the auction on the EVGA forums where the current bid at the time of writing is $6200. However it still has a long way to go before it matches the last bid on eBay.

All the proceeds from EVGA’s auction will go to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The auction finalizes on December 16th at 11:59 AM PT so interested parties have more than enough time to submit a bid. However the brand is auctioning the graphics card as it is and will not provide a warranty or accept returns.

Although it’s a preproduction sample EVGA’s GeForce RTX 4090 FTW3 is a working graphics card. YouTuber JayzTwoCents has already taken one of the samples for a spin. Since EVGA ended its partnership with Nvidia the graphics card uses a qualification AD102 die and relies on EVGA’s home-brewed firmware. The prototype features a 2520 MHz boost clock the same as the Founders Edition. Therefore its performance should be in the same alley as the GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition.

EVGA was one of the most popular Nvidia partners and was very good at making graphics cards. So it’s a shame that the company departed from the graphics card market. Many enthusiasts would love to see EVGA hook up with another significant chipmaker like AMD or Intel. However the company has said it is concentrating on its other hardware products which we suspect potentially offer higher profit margins.

Just before NVIDIA unveiled its GeForce RTX 40 series EVGA had announced it will not participate in this and any other GPU launch moving forward. The company has completely abandoned the GPU market and will now focus on other PC components.

The departure of EVGA from the GPU business was a massive blow to many graphics enthusiast fans and to make matters worse the company’s prototype showcased weeks later was actually a very well looking card.

It was confirmed that EVGA made a few engineering samples of RTX 4090 FTW3 card before the decision to cancel the project was made. Some of those prototypes were given to the most popular YouTubers working closely with EVGA. But EVGA still has a few cards left and one of those cards has just ended up on eBay.

According to a new series of leaks both the GeForce RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti could be about to arrive and repopulate the most popular segment of the market.

The GeForce RTX 4070 fell off the radar some time ago but leaker Kopite7kimi has put it back on the map with a tweet listing its specs. Kopite has an excellent track record dating back to the GeForce 20-series and is as reliable as any anonymous leaker. That said he isn't infallible and nothing is official until it's been confirmed by someone wearing a leather jacket.

Some updates of RTX 4070:

5888FP32

12G 21Gbps GDDR6X

36M L2

250W --- kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 9 2022

Kopite claims that the 4070 will arrive with the same core count as the 3070 – but the cores are of a different architecture and thus improved. The 4070's memory system has been expanded from 8 GB to 12 GB and upgraded from GDDR6 to GDDR6X. The newer memory type has enabled the bandwidth to increase from 448 GB/s to 504 GB/s despite a reduction in bus width from 256-bit to 192-bit. The total board power (TBP) has been increased by 30W to 250W.

The selling point of the RTX 4070 might be its clock speed. Kopite didn't comment on it but it's thought that the 4070 and 4070 Ti will have a similar clock speed to the 'unlaunched' RTX 4080 12GB: 2610 MHz. That's almost a whole gigahertz higher than the 3070's 1730 MHz.

Compared to the GeForce RTX 4080 the 4070 is quite a step down. However the 4080 retails for an outlandish $1200 so the 4070 could still be good value if it's priced reasonably. In raw numbers the RTX 4070 has 39% fewer cores than the 4080 three-quarters of the memory capacity and 70% of the memory bandwidth and a 22% lower TBP. It should have a similar clock speed.

Nvidia is already purported to be announcing (technically re-announcing) the RTX 4070 Ti at CES 2023 in early January. It might add the 4070 to the roster or delay it another few months until demand for the RTX 30 series has cooled or AMD has announced its own next generation mid-range offerings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL2F1dG8vYmlrZS1uZXdzL2R1Y2F0aS1kZXNlcnR4LWFkdmVudHVyZS1iaWtlLWluZGlhLWxhdW5jaC10b21vcnJvdy1wcmljZS1leHBlY3RhdGlvbi1hcnRpY2xlLTk2MTQ4MTE40gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbm93bmV3cy5jb20vYXV0by9iaWtlLW5ld3MvZHVjYXRpLWRlc2VydHgtYWR2ZW50dXJlLWJpa2UtaW5kaWEtbGF1bmNoLXRvbW9ycm93LXByaWNlLWV4cGVjdGF0aW9uLWFydGljbGUtOTYxNDgxMTgvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ducati DesertX adventure bike India launch tomorrow: Price expectation,"Ducati Desert X

The engine comes mated to a six-speed gearbox and produces a maximum power output of 110bhp at 9250rpm and peak torque of 92Nm at 6500rpm. Apart from tweaking the engine the company has also reworked the gearing ratios.

The new Ducati DesertX gets features such as six riding modes (Sport Touring Urban Wet Rally and Enduro) and four power modes full-LED lighting a standard Bluetooth-enabled five-inch TFT display cruise control Bosch IMU engine brake control bidirectional quickshifter traction control wheelie control and cornering ABS.

In terms of exterior looks the new DesertX will sport a full-fledged rally inspired design with exterior highlights such as twin-pod headlight a tall windscreen a semi-fairing design split-style seats side-slung exhaust among other.

With inflation at its 40-year high dividend stocks offer one of the best ways to generate a dependable income stream for investors. In the current economic environment investors are gravitating toward dividend stocks to steadily increase the value of their investments. Historically dividend stocks outperformed the market during recessionary periods.

According to a report by AllianceBernstein dividend-paying stocks have a long-term return potential and are a hedge against inflation. From 1971 to August 2022 high-dividend stocks delivered a risk-adjusted return of 0.83% compared with a 0.71% return from the broader market during the same period. The report also mentioned that returns of high-dividend stocks are positively correlated with inflation during previous inflationary periods. Not only do dividend stocks perform better during periods of economic downturn but these securities have also repeatedly outpaced inflation in the past. Quality companies tend to increase their payouts during these periods. In the past 15 years ending August 2022 the average dividend growth came in at 13.71% versus a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index as reported by S&P Global. The report also referred to the data by IHS Markit mentioning that the year-over-year dividend growth for the next four quarters is expected to be at 6.7%.

When investing in dividend stocks investors are advised to focus on the respective companies’ dividend growth track records and cash flows. Companies with strong cash flow generation and sound balance sheets are more committed to shareholder return. Some of the best dividend stocks that are popular among investors include Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) because of their solid dividend policies.

Lunsumio or mosunetuzumab triggered a response in 77.8% of patients with follicular lymphoma who had previously tried at least two prior therapies and 60% of patients saw no sign of cancer. The median duration of response and duration of complete response weren’t reached at the data cutoff.

The data came from a longer median 27-month follow-up of a phase 1/2 trial. Roche previously used an earlier evaluation of the study to win a global-first approval for Lunsumio in Europe and for an FDA application that bears a target decision date for Dec. 29.

The FDA wanted more follow-up data than their counterparts did at the European Medicines Agency hence the later ruling Ginna Laport M.D. global head of lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia clinical development at Roche’s Genentech said in an interview with Fierce Pharma. The FDA wanted additional patient survival data and to make sure no late side effects emerge over the long term she explained.

The FDA application includes data after a median follow-up of 18.3 months which showed an 80% tumor response rate and 60% complete response rate. By investigators' estimates 79.5% of complete responders continued to have their tumor in check for at least two years and 51.4% of patients would be alive without disease progression after two years.

The tale of two CD20 bispecifics

The company is also working on a subcutaneous version of mosunetuzumab for convenience and safety reasons Laport noted. The under-the-skin formulation triggered a similar 82% response rate and a 62% complete response rate in a group of patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma according to data shared at ASH 2022.

The subcutaneous version appears to come with better safety; investigators recorded 27% of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) cases across patients with follicular lymphoma and aggressive lymphomas and they were all below grade 3. As for infused Lunsumio the updated analysis of the phase 1/2 trial showed a 44.4% CRS rate and grade 3 or above cases were reported.

Lunsumio represents the first CD20xCD3 T-cell engager approved anywhere. It works by latching onto the CD20 marker on malignant B cells and the CD3 protein on T cells to bring the killer immune cells closer to neutralize the cancerous cell.

Roche has another CD20 bispecific glofitamab which has arrived at the FDA and the EMA for evaluation in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In a group of patients with heavily pretreated LBCL 74% of patients who had seen no sign of tumor at the end of treatment remained in complete remission after a median follow-up of 18.1 months according to data shared at ASH 2022. One of 44 patients who had at least 12 months of post-treatment follow-up experienced disease progression.

Glofitamab’s off-treatment progression rate looks “particularly encouraging” and was “rarely observed” in this treatment-experienced patient population the trial investigators noted in an abstract. But they also cautioned that longer follow-up is needed to confirm the durability of glofitamab’s ability to maintain cancer eradication.

Roche isn’t prioritizing either one of the two CD20 bispecifics but is directing them at different diseases Laport said. The company is developing Lunsumio for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma because it offers “more outpatient flexibility” including a relatively lower CRS rate Laport said. Glofitamab the more potent and less tolerable agent of the two is being developed in aggressive lymphomas.

Upcoming competitions

The Roche products while in the lead so far in terms of regulatory progress could face some competition from other CD20 T-cell engagers especially ones from Regeneron and a partnership between AbbVie and Genmab.

At ASH 2022 Regeneron reported for the first time data from a higher 160mg weekly dosing of its CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody odronextamab from the pivotal ELM-2 study. In 130 patients who had failed at least two prior lines of therapy odronextamab shrank tumors in 49.2% of patients and cleared out signs of cancer in 30.8% after a median follow-up of 21.3 months. After investigators adopted a regimen gradually stepping up treatment dosage no grade 3 or above CRS events occurred. But five treatment-related deaths occurred because of other conditions including COVID pneumonia and Pseudomonas sepsis.

For glofitamab the Roche drug had previously shown an overall response rate of 51.6% and a complete response rate of 39.4% after following a pivotal phase 2 study for a median 12.6 months. CRS occurred in 63% of patients including combined 3.9% of grade 3 and 4 events.

At ASH 2022 the pair unveiled initial early-phase results for a combination pairing epcoritamab with Rituxan and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Revlimid or R2 in newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma. Among 29 efficacy-evaluable patients the combo posted a 90% response rate.

Fixed-duration treatment is a key selling point that Roche thinks could differentiate its bispecifics from the others Laport said. While other candidates are given until progression a fixed-duration therapy gives patients longer treatment intervals and could potentially reduce the probability of long-term side effects and improve the overall patient experience she said.

In DLBCL Roche is waiting for an FDA decision for CD97b-targeted antibody-drug conjugate Polivy in combination with the R-CHP regimen in newly diagnosed patients. Roche plans to launch a phase 3 trial “in the near future” to combine glofitamab with the Polivy-R-CHP cocktail in frontline DLBCL Laport said.

For many facilities in the US the company’s new recyclable tubes are indistinguishable from those made from more common plactics prompting recyclers to reject them

By Daniela Sirtori-Cortina / Bloomberg





Colgate-Palmolive Co spent years devising a recyclable toothpaste tube. Pulling it off was a technical masterstroke substituting plastic for a mix of materials that was historically tough to reclaim. The result was “nice squeezability” one executive said.

One big problem remains: Many sorting centers in the US and elsewhere do not accept them.

The gap between Colgate’s engineering success and the practicalities of where-do-we-toss-our-empties underscores a persistent challenge for the corporate US: Switching to packaging that can bypass landfills is not enough if there is no easy way to recycle it. In Colgate’s case that is 9 billion tubes a year requiring extra effort to avoid the trash heap.

The new tubes which cover 78 percent of the company’s US toothpaste lineup are made with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) the recyclable plastic used for products such as milk jugs.

In the fragmented US system however companies making recyclable products have to persuade a wide range of stakeholders from local governments to private companies to accept the items sort them and turn them into something new. It is a process that can take years. The tubes are still not classified as recyclable by How2Recycle an organization that issues standardized labels with instructions on how to dispose of packaging.

Goods eligible for collection vary by community and an estimated 40 million US households do not have access to recycling services from their homes. This all means that plastics get reclaimed at rates of only 8 to 28 percent depending on the type.

In light of the challenge Colgate said it has engaged players across the supply chain for years. It has also shared its new tube design with other companies and said competitors would adopt similar recyclable plastic tubes by 2025.

“It is not easy work given the many aspects of the process but we are committed and we believe we are on the right path” Colgate said.

The company has pledged to shrink its plastic waste and use “100 percent recyclable reusable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025” it said.

Sarah Dearman chief innovation officer at the Recycling Partnership an industry-funded group working to improve the system said the new tubes are “a great step.”

However consumers must also have access to collection systems that accept the tube.

It is not clear how many do nationwide assessment by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition an industry working group said.

Colgate said the tube has a third-party certification showing it can be processed alongside HDPE bottles which 87 percent of Americans can put in recycling bins.

That type of plastic ends up being recycled nearly 30 percent of the time one of the highest rates among recyclable materials in the US.

However Colgate said that acceptance might still be limited and advised consumers to check with local community programs.

The company started updating the artwork on its boxes to provide more information.

Some consumers are taking note.

Ethan Helvering a tech worker living in Los Angeles said he was looking for sustainable toothpaste alternatives when he stumbled upon Colgate’s new tube. He sees recyclability as a selling point and is glad to see the company’s efforts although he has questions about what ultimately happens.

“If there’s an option to put something in the recycling I’ll do it” Helvering said. “Hopefully processes improve and at some point it becomes an actual reality.”

Colgate’s new tubes usually get sorted to the correct group once they reach plants that recover materials and bundle similar plastics together a test commissioned by the company showed.

However most US recovery facilities do not take tubes because the recyclable and traditional versions are so similar said Sandeep Kulkarni a technical consultant at the Association of Plastic Recyclers a trade group.

The old tubes could cause contamination if consumers put them in the recycling bin so it is still easier for recycling facilities to reject toothpaste tubes across the board he said.

Waste Management Inc which offers recycling and disposal services said the tubes are not in its list of acceptable items.

Another concern is leftover toothpaste causing contamination said Pete Keller an executive at waste disposal company Republic Services Inc.

It is another area that seems to have discrepancies: On its Web site Colgate says any residual toothpaste in the tubes is removed during the rinsing process at recycling facilities.

Together Waste Management and Republic Services run about one-quarter of US materials-recovery facilities tracked by the Recycling Partnership which said processing capacity is also an important factor.

Sander Defruyt who leads a plastics-reduction initiative at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation said that given the challenges of recycling companies should invest more in alternatives such as reusable containers and packaging.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6Y2VudHJhbC5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wYXIwNjU3MjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert E. “Bob” Dougherty II Obituary - The Arizona Republic,"Robert E. “Bob” Dougherty II 83 of Keokuk passed away on Wednesday November 30 2022 at the West Point Care Center in West Point Iowa.

At least 131 civilians were killed including 17 women and 12 children and eight others were injured.

Support for investigations

“The Secretary-General expresses his deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wishes a swift recovery to the injured” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement on Friday.

“He welcomes the decision of the Congolese authorities to investigate these incidents with a view to bringing those found responsible to justice.”

Meanwhile the UN’s human rights office in the DRC and its peacekeeping operation there MONUSCO will continue to support the Government in these efforts.

End hostilities now

“The Secretary-General urges the M23 and all other armed groups immediately cease hostilities and disarm unconditionally” the statement continued.

Mr. Guterres also called on all parties to facilitate humanitarian access to affected communities and to ensure the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law.



He also underlined the UN’s ongoing commitment to support the Congolese Government and people in their efforts to bring about peace and stability in the east of the country.

The attacks are the latest in a series of violence inflicted on civilians by armed groups in eastern DRC.

MONUSCO chief Bintou Keita briefed the UN Security Council in New York on Friday.

She told ambassadors that the security situation in eastern DRC “has deteriorated dramatically” in the past weeks.

HR experts weigh in,"'Tis the season for giving — but should your holiday shopping list include your boss or your co-workers?

Workplace gift giving can be tricky. As the end-of-the-year holiday season fast approaches you might stress about which of your colleagues should receive a gift how much to spend what to buy or whether you should get them a gift at all.

Ideally gift giving should be a show of appreciation or to remind a colleague that you really enjoy working with them Burgette White the vice president of human resources at Adecco North America a staffing firm tells CNBC Make It. ""It shouldn't be a costly or anxiety-inducing endeavor"" she says.

But timing is everything with workplace gift giving White adds. Presenting a lavish expensive gift to your manager right before your annual performance review for example could be perceived as an attempt at bribery — and ""you don't want to make things awkward for your boss"" White adds.

Here are three rules you should follow when it comes to gift giving at work according to HR executives:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzExL3JvYmVydC1zYWxlaC1hZnRlci1sb3NzLXRvLWJpbGxzLXdlLWFyZS1nb2luZy10by1zZWUtdGhlc2UtZ3V5cy1hZ2Fpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Saleh after loss to Bills: 'We are going to see these guys again',"ORCHARD PARK N.Y. — The Jets came into a two-game road trip needing to win at least a game against the Vikings and the Bills.

But Gang Green came away empty-handed on its trips to Minneapolis and Orchard Park.

The Jets latest loss came to the Bills as they exacted revenge for last month’s loss to Gang Green as Buffalo won 20-12 at home. The defeat dropped the Jets to 7-6 on the season as they’re clinging to the seventh spot in the AFC.

Gang Green is in a funk during the final month of the season. The Jets have lost four of its last six games and two straight.

The Jets have taken on the personality of their coach.

Despite that Jets coach Robert Saleh is not only confident his team will make the playoffs but they could play the Bills a third time.

“Obviously I love our guys and they fight their tails off” Saleh said. “I think I speak for everyone when I say…we are going to see these guys again. I just think we are.

“I think our team is good enough. Obviously it is week to week but we got a good football team.”

This confidence from the Jets is nothing new as the team has taken on Saleh’s personality. Before training camp Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley said it was “playoffs or bust” for the team.

Then following a season-opening loss to the Ravens Saleh told reporters he was taking receipts of all the doubters of the Jets. Gang Green began the year without its then-starting quarterback Zach Wilson left tackle Duane Brown yet they have continued to battle through adversity.

The Jets won four consecutive games in October to get back into the playoff conversation. At the team’s bye week and a 20-17 home victory against the Bills the Jets were 6-3 and looking to not only challenge for the playoffs but for a division crown.

But since their bye week the Jets have only won once against the Bears who were without their starting quarterback. Despite that the team has never wavered as they still believe the Jets players also Saleh’s message. Especially after giving arguably the best team in the AFC everything they could handle.

“I know the dudes we got in here” Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson said. “We go about our business the right way and we left it on the field today and we came up short.

“We feel like we got a great squad great team and we are going to be in position to win games but we gotta finish. We are going to go this week and put the work in and start finishing games the way we should and start the games we should as well.”

The road for the Jets during the last four weeks of the season doesn’t get any easier. Gang Green will host a red-hot Lions team that has won five of their last six games including a 34-23 victory against a Vikings team that the Jets lost to a week ago. Then on a short week the Jets will host the Jaguars in their final home game of the season on Dec. 22.

The Jets will end the regular season at Seattle and at Miami two teams that are also chasing spots in the postseason. The team is also dealing with injuries to Mike White and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams.

What should give the Jets confidence is the team’s offense is much better with White under center after benching Wilson as he has thrown for 952 yards three touchdowns and two interceptions in his three starts. However the Jets have won just two of their last six games since rookie running back Breece Hall tore his ACL against the Broncos on Oct. 23.

“It’s a championship week every week” cornerback D.J. Reed said about the remaining schedule for the Jets. “Obviously we lost we are going to watch the tape going to learn from it and we gotta move on.

“The one thing you can’t to is dwell on we let Minnesota get away we let Buffalo get away and let that go into the week of going into Detroit. We gotta just watch the film learn from it be a student of the game and you gotta move on to focus on who you’re playing next.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Mi5jYm4uY29tL2FydGljbGUvcmVkZW1wdGlvbi9zaGVkZGluZy1saWdodC11bmNvbWZvcnRhYmxlLXBpZWNlLXJpY2htb25kcy1oaXN0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shedding Light on an Uncomfortable Piece of Richmond's History,"CBN

Shockoe Bottom along the James River is one of Richmond Virginia’s oldest neighborhoods. It also lays claim to its darkest past. From 1830 to 1865 it served as one of the largest slave trading hubs in the south second only to New Orleans. Over 300000 people passed through here during a life in bondage. Virginia Delegate Delores L. McQuinn has been working to memorialize the pathway they walked through the port – where the atrocities of enslavement were hidden away from polite society.

“My first walk on the slave trail I began to cry” Delegate McQuinn shares. “What people who lived at a different era but I was connected to by DNA had to live through.”

The area contained numerous slave jails - holding pens for those waiting to be auctioned or carried away by their new owners. While the conditions in the jails were harsh none compared to Lumpkin’s Jail also known as “The Devil’s Half Acre.” Run by Robert Lumpkin it was the jail where slave owners brought so-called “disobedient” or “troublesome” slaves to break them… through whatever brutal means necessary.

Delegate McQuinn says “Based on what I have read Robert Lumpkin was a mean man. Robert Lumpkin was an evil person.”

The slaves were crammed into small cells shackled and covered in filth and stench with no toilet facilities and little food or water. Some were beaten. It was especially torturous for slaves whose owners felt they needed to be punished. An 1856 biography of runaway slave Anthony Burns describes his time at Lumpkin’s.

As Dr. Raymond P. Hylton Professor of History at Virginia Union University explains Lumpkin “cooped him up in the loft of the jail where the air was stale. He was shackled it was filthy he was given a starvation diet. He only got out in the open air once in a while to show him to people to humiliate him. He was there for eight months.”

In the end though Lumpkin’s Jail would no longer be a gateway into humiliation and slavery but one where Black Americans would have access to a brighter future. It was after the Civil War. The newly ratified 13th Amendment ensured freedom to some 4 million enslaved people. At the forefront were the abolitionists many of whom were Christians committed to living out the teachings of Jesus Christ.

“They took the Gospel seriously and said ‘Christ will make you free’” explains Dr. Deborah Van Broekhaven Executive Director Emerita of the American Baptist Historical Society. “And that stands for everybody. These people do deserve not just freedom but they deserve equality.”

And many believed equality would come through education. Generations of slaves had been forbidden to learn how to read or write.

Dr. John W. Kinney Professor of Theology at Virginia Union University states that at the time “Education immediately becomes a threat to the hierarchy. Enlightenment becomes a threat ‘Cause if I can keep you ignorant I can keep you in your place.'”

While many started a campaign to provide the basics other groups such as the American Baptist Home Mission Society had an even loftier vision – to empower Black Americans to become leaders in society especially in churches through higher education.

As Dr. Van Broekhaven explains “Most people thought ‘Okay vocational education was okay.’ But the idea of training these newly-freed people to be college professors to be ministers to head up seminaries that was pretty radical.”

And dangerous. As schools began cropping up teachers and students experienced violence and some schools were burned or vandalized. Still they were not alone.

Dr. Van Broekhaven continues “Christians who had a heart for these people who had suffered were willing to suffer alongside.”

One of them was a 70-year-old Baptist minister named Dr. Nathanial Colver. Sent by the American Baptist Home Mission Society he came to Richmond in 1867 looking for a place to start a Black seminary. Finding a city tattered from the war there were few options.

“Thirty blocks of Richmond had been destroyed” says Dr. Hylton “and most of what was left was in the hands of White southerners who were ‘unsympathetic’ to say the least. Dr. Colver apparently was praying on it a lot. And he met a group of congregants outside First African Baptist Church told them of his plight. And a tall fair-faced woman said that she had a place that he could rent very cheaply.”

Her name? Mary Ann Lumpkin – former slave and widow of notorious slave jailer Robert Lumpkin.



She was around eight years old when Lumpkin bought her and she would bear him five children in their twenty-five years together before he legally married her at the end of the war. Delegate McQuinn says “She was in a constant mode of surviving. There was no power of her own. But she survived it.”



When Robert died in 1866 he left everything to Mary including his infamous jail in Shockoe Bottom.

Dr. Hylton says “That quickly turned to the idea of turning good into evil turning ‘The Devil's Half Acre’ into what was rechristened by Dr. Colver ‘God's Half Acre.’”

In its three years there the school known then as the Colver Institute would graduate some two hundred students: young men born into slavery seizing a more hopeful future for themselves.

Dr. Kinney says “Authentic education thrusts you and calls you to a commitment to freedom and justice.”

It’s with that commitment the school moved forward into the future. It joined with another Black seminary to form Virginia Union University in 1899 not far from Lumpkin’s Jail. More than a century later Virginia Union still stands maintaining its tradition of excellence while bringing up generations of leaders to continue the fight for equality for all Americans.

As for Lumpkin’s Jail it was torn down in 1888 and its painful history was almost lost until activists and archeologists excavated it in 2008. Delegate McQuinn is part of an effort to build a museum on the site.

She says “If you talk about the journey of African Americans in America many say ‘Well this is African American history.’ But this is American's history. We’ve got to tell the truth.”

Just as people of faith stepped in to address the evils of slavery Dr. Kinney says Christians today must continue that legacy reaching out with the love of Christ to end racism: “I will put my life my status and my privilege at risk for the sake of the truth that I recognize in God and the principles of the land I love require. That's for this nation to be healed.”

Following a win and a draw in their last two matches a goal on the stroke of half time from Robert Simón was enough to decide the encounter in the home side's favour.

Only goal of the game

In the opening half both sides had opportunities to open the scoring but failed to take them. Then just when it appeared that the two teams would go in at half time goalless Nàstic took the lead. The home side went ahead with Robert Simón turning home a cross right on the stroke of half time.

The goal was a psychological blow for Rafa Márquez's team but they did have chances to equalise in the second half. The best opportunity fell to Fabio Blanco who failed to hit the target with just three minutes of the game remaining.

Nàstic also could have added another when Gorostidi hit the post but in the end Simón's goal was enough for victory for the home side and to end Barça Atlètic's recent run of positive results.

The increasing need for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing is expected to drive significant growth for Rockwell Automation as it aims to increase its share from the automobile sector which is a part of the discreet sector to 20% of its overall revenues in the near future.

In an interaction with Mobility Outlook Arvind Kakru Director Rockwell Automation said the automobile industry as a whole “including EV battery manufacturing vehicles manufacturing tyre manufacturing and more allied activities” will adapt to automation at a larger scale in times to come.

Among OEMs the company expects future growth of automation to be led by commercial and passenger vehicle manufacturers. Rockwell Automation is already working with Volvo-Eicher and Daimler Kakru said. “The bigger opportunity we see is in PV manufacturing. The ICE market is one of the biggest markets for automation at the moment” Kakru said.

Notably the company globally reported revenue figures of $7.76 billion for FY22 (October 2021 to September 2022).

ICE EVs & Batteries

In addition to automation in EV and battery manufacturing the company is confident that even traditional internal combustion engine OEMs will resort to more automation as the demand for vehicles keeps going north. It must be noted here that November 2022 reported the highest-ever vehicle sales in India.

Additionally Kakru is certain that the recently announced PLI schemes around vehicle and battery manufacturing will further require the OEMs to assure maximum output in minimum time.

“Start-ups traditional OEMs battery makers tyre makers and more are turning towards automation to minimise downtime in order to keep up with the rising demand” Kakru explained.

He further stated that investments taking place in the auto industry are “definitely bigger than most other industries at the moment”. Some he said are being driven by the evolution of mobility mediums while others are being driven by mandates announced by the government of India.

Start-ups including Ola and Ather and traditional OEMs including Tata Motors Maruti Suzuki Mahindra & Mahindra have already announced plans to set up separate facilities for manufacturing EVs. Additionally tyre makers have also announced mammoth investments for expanding their manufacturing capabilities.

Advantages OEMs See

The biggest advantage OEMs associate with automation is the capability of being able to deliver “ahead of time” Kakru said. In the same manner start-ups associate automation as a tool to faster scale-up.

“One of the most difficult phases for a start-up is when the time to scale-up arrives” he said referring to reports pointing towards less availability of EVs and higher demand in the Indian market.

Cost competitiveness is the second trait of automation that OEMs usually relate to Kakru said. “Technology can help reduce the overall weight of a vehicle and a lot of other things while automation can help produce more vehicles than the conventional approach in limited time” he said.

Further automation allows OEMs to benefit from better forecast of what components it will need in the future including an improvement in the overall supply chain.

The last and 1574th B747 produced in Boeing’s widebody factory was a B747-8 Freighter. It will be delivered to Atlas Air early next year. Atlas Air Worldwide was the final customer for the aircraft having placed orders for four freighters in January this year.

Arguably one of the most recognisable commercial jetliners ever built the B747’s instantly recognisable hump massive frame and twin deck design resulted in its nickname ‘Queen of the Skies’. The B747 was also known as the ‘Jumbo Jet’ and was the largest commercial aircraft in service for decades.

It was the first airplane with two aisles and the first commercial aircraft powered by a high bypass turbofan engine. The aircraft was instrumental in transforming long-haul travel and made it more affordable to the travelling public. Since it entered service well over six billion people have flown in the B747.

Air India was an early operator of the B747-100 and its first aircraft ‘Emperor Kanishka’ commenced service in 1971.

Record Breaker

The earliest variant of the aircraft was the B747-100 the world’s first commercial wide-body jetliner. The prototype aircraft made its maiden flight on February 9 1969. Pan American World Airways better known as ‘Pan Am’ was the launch customer for the aircraft. The jumbo-jet age began in January 1970 when a Pan Am B747 with 336 passengers took off from New York's John F. Kennedy airport to London and into the history books.

The B747 went on to have a 55-year production run and by the end Boeing had produced 1574 B747s across all variants for more than 100 customers. It is the first wide-body airplane in history to reach the 1500 aircraft milestone. By its 50th anniversary in 2019 the global fleet had logged more than 57 billion nautical miles (121.5 billion km) equal to more than 137000 trips from the Earth to the moon and back!

By the end of production the fleet logged more than 118 million flight hours and nearly 23 million flight cycles.

Joe Sutter Father of the 747

Incredible Aeroplane

The longevity of the B747 can be attributed to Boeing’s culture of engineering excellence at the time and the design team led by Joe Sutter who became known as the 'Father of the 747'. Sutter had a hand in many iconic commercial airplane projects including Boeing’s Dash 80 its cousin the 707 and the 737. But it was the 747 that secured his place in aviation history. From concept to roll-out Sutter’s team completed the design of the B747 in 29 months.

More than 50000 employees were involved in the programme and they became known as the ‘Incredibles’ for producing what was at the time the world’s largest airplane in such a short period. The first B747 was built in less than 16 months!

The fuselage of the original B747 was 68.5 meters long; its tail was as tall as a six-story building. When the cabin was pressurised it held a tonne of air. The cargo hold had room for 3400 pieces of baggage.

In its final design the B747-100 was offered in three configurations: all passenger all cargo and a convertible passenger/freighter model. The freighter and convertible models loaded 2.4 x 2.4 metre cargo containers through the huge hinged nose.

To produce the massive B747 Boeing constructed a 5.6 million cubic-metre assembly plant in Everett Washington which became the world's largest building by volume.

For such a large and complex aircraft the B747 also developed a reputation as being a safe aeroplane. This was largely due to Sutter who ensured that the aircraft's design gave primacy to safety. Boeing introduced quadruple hydraulic systems redundant structures and four main landing gears even though the plane is able to operate on two.

Unmatched Longevity

Over its long history there were four main variants of the B747 - 100 200 400 and 8. The 747-400 which first entered service in 1989 was essentially an entirely new airplane with improved aerodynamics digital avionics a high-tech flight deck the latest in-flight entertainment systems and 4828 km more range compared to its predecessors. The 747-400 had greater passenger capacity take-off weight engine thrust and dispatch reliability. Air India also ordered the 747-400.

The final variant of the B747 was the 747-8 programme which was launched in November 2005 and included the 747-8 Intercontinental passenger airplane and 747-8 Freighter airplane. The 747-8 Intercontinental passenger airplane was stretched 3.6 m compared to the 747-400 to accommodate 34 additional seats in a typical three-class configuration. Lufthansa was the launch customer for the 747-8 Intercontinental and took delivery of its first airplane in April 2012. Powered by four GEnx-2B engines the 747-8 could travel the length of three FIFA soccer fields in one second!

End Of An Era

Air India has decided to sell its four remaining B747-400s and has appointed a UK-based firm Skytech-AIC for outright sale. The aircraft have not been operational for more than two years and are being sold on an immediate delivery basis. These aircraft are powered by Pratt & Whitney 4056 engines and were built between 1993 and 1996.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation had deregistered these four B747-400s in April this year. Air India’s B747 were iconic in their own right with her early 747-100 and 747-300 aeroplanes painted in a distinct livery. The departure of the 747 from the Air India fleet truly marks the end of an era.

When he does so it will mark a number of firsts.

Singh at age 40 will be the youngest mayor ever.

He will be the first immigrant elected mayor.

Singh is the first Punjabi-American to he elected mayor.

He also will be the first Sierra High grad to be elected mayor.

Singh’s highest personal priority as mayor for the next four years isn’t addressing the homeless issues pumping up public safety finding ways to improve streets pushing for good paying public safety jobs taking downtown to the next level and positioning Manteca to be a vibrant city when it hits 100000 people.

All of that is on is must do list as well as those of his fellow council members.

But his top priority as he told a previous council in 2014 when they appointed him to the Manteca Planning Commission at age 32 is “to build bridges.”

“When (the council) interviewed me for the commission I told them as a millennial I wanted to build a bridge between the generations’ Singh said.

Today that is still a primary motivation.

But given the backdrop of the just completed rancorous election as well as the dynamics of a community that is within four or so years will be on the cusp of 100000 residents as one of the perennially fastest growing cities in California.

To understand why taking steps whether it is through efforts to take transparency and communication to what he hopes will be unprecedented for Manteca as well as push for city initiatives that bring the community together consider the year 2000.

That was when Singh graduated near the top of his class academically from Sierra High. Manteca had almost 40000 less residents.

The home his family lives in today is in a neighborhood near Woodward Park. Not only was the 52-acre community park nothing but a field of weeds but there were less than 100 tract homes south of the 120 Bypass.

Though Singh was not born here he was raised here.

The population of the city has more than doubled since he first stepped foot in a Manteca Unified school classroom.

Singh wants to do what he can to bring people together to make sure they are heard and provide opportunities for people to become immersed in the community.

And with two young sons — a seventh grader at Woodward School and a sophomore at Sierra High — he wants what he cherished about Manteca growing up— as well as others who are long-time residents and those that have moved here — not to slip away.

To do that Singh concedes two points.

Manteca has changed.

And in some ways Manteca hasn’t changed enough.

As a member of the Manteca City Council he believes elected officials have an opportunity to lay the foundation for the growing city to build on long-term “Family City” values as well as make changes needed to make the city more vibrant.

Singh noted many in his graduating class opted to leave Manteca.

It wasn’t because they disliked Manteca but as Singh noted “if you were in your 20s Manteca wasn’t hip or cool.”

Singh said many of his classmates have since returned to Manteca — or nearby towns like Escalon and Ripon — to raise their families.

The mayor-elect believes employment opportunities coupled with more entertainment options — the soon-to-open Deaf Puppy Comedy Club and Brethren Brothers Brewing Co. In downtown are two examples of what is needed.

And while having two young children makes that a bigger personal priority for Singh it dovetails into the council majority.

The current council was the first time in at least 50 years that the majority of the city’s elected leadership were basically raised in Manteca.

Outgoing Mayor Ben Cantu came here as a 5-yar-old. Councilman Dave Breitenbucher was the fourth baby born at Manteca Hospital the forerunner of Doctors Hospital of Manteca.

Charlie Halford was raised in Lathrop and graduated from East Union High.

Even with the departure of Cantu after Singh tales the oath office at 6 p.m. Tuesday during a special me4eting at the Civic center 1001 W. Center St. a majority of the council will have essentially lifelong roots in Manteca.

From a mud hut to

mayor of Manteca

Singh whose first name given at birth is Gurminder hence his American nickname Gary was a toddler in a village of 500 people in northern India when his journey that has led to his election as a mayor of a city of 89000 people started.

His grandfather wanted his son and his young family to have a better life. They were living in a mud hut with no running water. If they needed to go to the bathroom they went out into an adjoining field on their farm where they grew sugar cane and wheat.

The family mortgaged the farm to pay for their son — Singh’s father — to travel to the United States.

At age 28 Singh’s father “Sam” started working as a farm laborer in the lettuce fields of Salinas in the early 1980s. Because he was an agricultural worker and because President Ronald Reagan has implemented the green card program he was able to stay in the United States.

Sam moved from the fields to a restaurant in San Jose. It was there that baking skills he learned while working for a period in Germany allowed him to get promoted to being a cook allowing him to pay to bring his wife and then 3-year-old Gary to California.

Sam started working in various doughnut shops. He saved enough money that he was able to buy a shop with partners in Tracy aptly called the Tracy Doughnut Shop. The family rented a two bedroom apartment where altogether 12 people lived.

Sam labored from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. baking doughnuts and then worked until 2 p.m. selling them. After clean-up he had 5 hours to spend with his young family.

They bought a house in Lathrop for $90000 that was a struggle for them to make payments. Gary went to Lathrop Elementary School while his dad worked and his mom worked at a Stockton cannery. It is a home they still own today.

Sam sold his share in the Tracy Doughnut Shop and bought the liquor store on East Yosemite Avenue in Manteca just west of Austin Road in 1989. Several years later he sold that store and bought Manteca Mart from Bob Miner who also owned the store on West Yosemite Avenue in the Lincoln Center that is anchored by Hafer’s. Miner eventually sold that store to Mike Morowit who was elected in 2016 to the City Council with Singh and who is being sworn in Tuesday as the new District 1 member after two years off the council.

Sam worked in Manteca Mart seven days a week while also working the weekend shift at the Pak-n-Sav bakery that was the forerunner of today’s Manteca Safeway store adjacent to Walmart. Sam would end up working nearly 24 hours non-stop on Saturdays and Sundays.

That allowed Sam to not only keep his business but to eventually acquire two smaller Manteca shopping centers.

Gary learned work ethic

from his parents firsthand

Gary started working in the store as a third grader. He would drop by after school when his mom would bring food to his father.

“It was really the only way I could see my dad because of how hard he had to work” Singh said.

Singh started out dusting and then stocking shelves. He remembers being so short that when he and his sister would stock the walk-in cooler they had to stand on overturned milk crates to reach the top shelves.

After Gary graduated from Sierra High in 2000 he was able to earn merit-based scholarships that covered half of the annual $15000 tuition at the University of Pacific. Because of his family’s assets Gary did not qualify for state financial aid. He — along with his father — paid for the balance.

Gary would complete his classes and labs required for his double major and then do a shift at the store where for four years he could be seen reading textbooks at the counter between customers.

Sixth grade was turning

point for Gary Singh

The sixth grade was a turning point for Singh.

When his family moved from their shared Tracy apartment to the home they bought in Lathrop Singh transferred from McKinley School in Tracy to Lathrop Elementary School.

There his troubles accelerated. Not only was he struggling with English but the move to Lathrop came as the Gulf War broke out.

Because some other students assumed he was Middle Eastern and not Indian he was the spit on challenged to fights called Saddam Hussein and taunted as a “sand n------ (the N-word).”

He was often sent to the office where he was unable to explain his side of incidents to then principal — Mr. Souza — due to his limited English.

He was suspended several times his attendance was spotty and he was piling up failing grades in many of his classes.

Sixth grade was when things finally clicked for Singh who had managed to zero in on math — a subject he was able to understand and excel in.

It started a turnaround. From the sixth grade forward through graduating from Sierra High he never missed a day of school. Singh started pulling down “A”s and maintaining a 4.0 grade point average and Lobo Gold status all the way through Sierra High.

His scholastic achievements were good enough to secure merit-based scholarships that covered half of his college education.

“I don’t mind sharing my story (about grade school) because I believe it may be able to help kids who are struggling today” Singh said in as 2020 interview.

When he was elected in 2016 he became the youngest member on the council at age 36.

Singh credits his parents for instilling in him the importance of a strong work ethic and also investing time in helping others.

Singh noted whenever his dad was struggling with the loss of a job he refused to file for unemployment or seek welfare assistance. Instead he hit the proverbial bricks and found whatever job he could get to support his family.

When Gary’s wife was laid off by Ross Stores in March of 2020 due to the pandemic she declined to file for unemployment benefits.

When he was asked by others why she hadn’t applied for unemployment Singh told people simply “we don’t need it.”

Singh serves as the city’s representative to the San Joaquin Council of Governments as well as the San Joaquin Flood Control Agency.

He is also a Manteca Rotary board member and serves on the San Joaquin Community Foundation boards.

Wexford last Saturday (December 3).

Speaking to Agriland after the sale mart manager Richard Kirwin said “there is a great trade across the board for all the beef cattle”.

Kirwin noticed a definite increase in the level of activity from buyers in Northern Ireland at the sale a trend that he believes will continue for the coming few weeks at very least.

Sample prices from the sale at New Ross mart: This 615kg Charolais heifer sold for €1820 or €2.96/kg This 750kg Limousin cow sold for €1980 or €2.64/kg These Limousin bullocks weighing 715kg each sold for €2130 or €2.98/kg These two Limousin bulls weighing 530kg each sold for €1530 or €2.89/kg This 700kg Charolais heifer sold for €2280 or €3.26/kg This 660kg Angus heifer sold for €1930 or €2.92/kg This Simmental stock bull weighing 1075kg sold for €2300 or €2.14/kg

As well as northern buyers Irish farmers and factory agents alike have more buying power in recent weeks and this being reflected in the increase in the price per kilo being paid for all types of store and beef cattle. This 370kg Limousin heifer sold for €920 or €2.49/kg This 475kg Belgian Blue heifer sold for €1400 or €2.95/kg This 925kg Limousin bullock sold for €2470 These 700kg Limousin bullocks sold for €1750 each or €2.50/kg This Aubrac bull weighing 655kg sold for €1650 or €2.52/kg

Kirwin noted: “One of the standout prices from the sale went to a 700kg Charolais heifer that sold for €2380 or €3.40/kg.”

“The money farmers are giving for stores it seems they are confident on the trade. There’s been a big swing in the past few weeks and everyone knows factory cattle are getting scarce.

While there was a number of other heifers bought at high prices for breeding Kirwin said that “a lot of the heifers are going for feeding”.

Lighter cattle at New Ross

Commenting on the trade for lighter cattle Kirwan said that “a rising tide lifts all ships” and added that while the good-quality stores had held well they are lifting in price now.

“Even the Friesian cattle have picked up again” he said.

“The Friesian bullocks under 500kg had been under pressure for the last good few weeks but they’re starting to come up in price again. That type of cattle is not as plentiful. These 6 Friesian bullocks weighing 660kg sold for €1340 or €2.03/kg

“Traditionally in this part of the country the store Friesian bullocks are sold at around 18-20 months of age and would all be sold between late-September and early November” he added.

The New Ross mart manager said the last sale of 2022 will take place at the mart on Saturday December 17 and the first sale of 2023 will take place on January 7.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdHRvcHBlcnMuY29tL2FsbGFyb3VuZGF1ZHJleS_SASxodHRwczovL2Jlc3R0b3BwZXJzLmNvbS9hbGxhcm91bmRhdWRyZXkvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AllAroundAudrey: YouTuber Age Husband Boyfriend Net Worth !,"AllAroundAudrey is a notable American YouTuber and social media personality.

Royal Caribbean executives and teams families friends travel advisors the cruise line’s partners and more came together on board the world’s largest cruise ship to celebrate the occasion.

In the time-honored role of Godmother Marie bestowed a blessing of safekeeping on Wonder its crew and the millions of families who will make lifelong memories on board in the years to come. On stage with Marie were Royal Caribbean Group President and CEO Jason Liberty Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley and her daughter Allie who nominated her mother for the role as part of a nationwide search started by Royal Caribbean on Mother’s Day.

“Wonder of the Seas exemplifies Royal Caribbean Group’s focus on unparalleled innovation sustainable cruise ship design and our commitment to delivering world-class memorable vacations responsibly” said Jason Liberty president and CEO Royal Caribbean Group. “This milestone represents the culmination of millions of hours of work from the most innovative minds in the industry to deliver the world’s latest wonder.”

To find the Godmother to match Royal Caribbean took to TikTok and launched the #SearchforWonderMom contest which saw 16000 videos posted and 10.6 billion hashtag views.

The search was complete when the cruise line heard Marie’s story one of a devoted mother wife and cancer survivor whose spirit inspired her family and those around her to set out on adventures and enjoy every moment together despite the hardships they faced.

“It was an honor to officially welcome Marie and Wonder of the Seas to the Royal Caribbean family” said Michael Bayley president and CEO Royal Caribbean International. “Marie’s story is one of incredible strength and family memories to last a lifetime and those are the types of memories we’ve committed to creating with our guests and crew on every Royal Caribbean ship for more than 53 years.

From the moment the first Oasis-class ship sailed in 2009 'It was a huge success' according to Bayley 'And they keep getting better ... deliver[ing] from every single dimension. The ratings these ships get are unbelievable.'

He said the 'ability for families to come together and engage and have fun across all these dimensions ... really is a winning formula. It proves itself time and time again. So I'm in love with the whole thing.'

The Mason Jar

Following Bayley's remarks 'I'll be more specific' quipped Jason Liberty president and CEO Royal Caribbean Group choosing new specialty restaurant The Mason Jar.

'It's my kind of food. It's Southern food and I love it' Liberty said adding that he'd spent time in Asheville North Carolina surrounded by great Southern food. In his view the Royal Caribbean team 'did a really exceptional job bringing the recipes to life.'

Sean Treacy's perfect night out

Sean Treacy SVP hotel operations laid out his idea of the perfect night on Wonder of the Seas: It starts with a pre-dinner drink in The Mason Jar Bar with its 'phenomenal country music band' and 'great cocktails. Then dinner in Giovanni's Italian Kitchen his pick for 'the openness of the space the food and the connectivity to Central Park.'

Central Park — home to Giovanni's Italian Kitchen 150 Central Park Chops Grille and more

And a show. 'You can't lose on any of the shows; they're amazing' Treacy said. 'But if you're here with a family ""The Effectors II: Crash & Burn."" It's nonstop energy activity and Royal Caribbean's own superheroes. How can you beat that?'

Vicki Freed's pick? The shows. She singled out the AquaTheater performances for the daring and talent of the Olympics-caliber divers as 'always a hit because it's different.

New ice show '365' captures the seasons in vivid colors

'The other show I love love love' Freed added is '365: The Seasons on Ice' for its World Champion skaters the music the colors and the costumes. For families she also endorsed 'The Effectors.'

When it comes to dining Freed SVP sales and trade support & service favors 150 Central Park the ship's most elegant specialty restaurant. And at the more casual Hooked Seafood she was wowed by 'the whole lobster on a tray. It's like being at The Palm' referring to the legendary US restaurant.

Poke nachos in Playmakers

Another food pick from Andrew Trabosh director operations excellence food & beverage operations Royal Caribbean International: the poke nachos (raw ahi tuna avocado cilantro serrano peppers scallions nori sesame seeds sriracha aïoli truffle sauce and crispy wontons) in Playmakers Sports Bar in the Boardwalk neighborhood.

'Most energy efficient ship in the fleet'

And for Capt. Henrik Loy the standout is that Wonder of the Seas is 'the most energy efficient ship in the fleet benefiting from the latest technology and innovation.'

Loy cited route optimization technology the air lubrication system that generates millions of microbubbles to reduce drag 'so you get more speed for less energy' and waste heat recovery from the engines that powers a turbine to supply 15% of the hotel power load — all 'great features I feel proud of' the captain said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NydWlzZS9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tb2ZmaWNpYWxseS1uYW1lcy13b25kZXItb2YtdGhlLXNlYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean Officially Names Wonder of the Seas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/news/cruise/royal-caribbean-officially-names-wonder-of-the-seas on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NydWlzZS9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tb2ZmaWNpYWxseS1uYW1lcy13b25kZXItb2YtdGhlLXNlYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The actress who played Major Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan on the hit series from 1972 to 1983 opened up about her deep connection with Farr who portrayed Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger 41 years after the show's wrap.

""[Jamie] still makes me laugh and keeps me connected to that piece of my heart that brought so much joy to millions of viewers"" she said in a new interview with First for Women. The two friends still often participate in autograph signings throughout the country.

Reflecting on the show's major success Swit credits it to the cast's on- and off-screen chemistry.

""Everyone liked coming to work"" she said. ""The camaraderie was unlike anything I ever experienced because we were all connected deeply. The chemistry was real and the energy everyone brought to the set was off the charts which was a part of the reason the show developed a huge/loyal fan base.""

Laughter was also important for the show.

""Laughter and humor were our defense against standing in blood and working on bodies that were young enough to be in school"" she said. ""You needed the funniest people in the world to make this believable and this cast exceeded that and more.""

""M*A*S*H"" which followed a team of doctors stationed in Korea during the Korean War won 14 Emmy Awards throughout its 11-season run.

""Initially when we started out everyone wondered how we were going to be able to pull off a comedy about the war but we did"" Swit said.

In 2023 Swit opened up to Fox News Digital about how her character's nickname ""Hot Lips"" has since stuck with her all these years.

""I understand nicknames come with great love and admiration for a character"" the star explained. ""But it was an insult as far as I was concerned. She wasn’t just a piece of anatomy. She was a major in the United States Army and she should not be disrespected.""

""This was a woman who had rank who worked hard and wanted to be good at her job"" Swit shared. ""She was an inspiration. I was proud of her. I was proud to represent all the service women out there. I wanted to make a change.""

Swit said she was also proud of being part of the celebrated show  so much so that she was worried the nickname would overshadow the heroic efforts of real-life service women belittling them to a punchline.

""I didn’t want those women to be disrespected"" the actress reflected. ""Obviously people are going to see it differently. Margaret did not see [the nickname] as a compliment. She saw it as disrespect. So yes I would say it was never a comfort zone.""

These days Swit continues her activism through her charity SwitHeart Animal Alliance  and creating art.

In 2017 she published ""SwitHeart: The Watercolor Artistry & Animal Activism of Loretta Swit"" a book made up of 65 watercolor paintings and 22 photographs that also include personal stories.

On the agenda today:

But first: Ashley Stewart a chief tech correspondent is giving us a behind-the-scenes look at Salesforce's succession crisis.

Over the past week or so at least six top executives from Salesforce and its subsidiaries announced plans to leave Ashley Stewart chief tech correspondent writes.

First Salesforce was blindsided by co-CEO Bret Taylor's resignation less than one year after he took the job. Others soon followed most notably Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield and Tableau CEO Mark Nelson.

Company insiders attribute these departures to co-CEO Marc Benioff exerting increasing control over the company adding that he's driven away his closest lieutenants while dialing up performance pressure on employees.

The departures have created a crisis in leadership at Salesforce. As the company tries repeatedly to make a succession plan for Benioff the cofounder seemingly won't let go — and is increasing his influence as a recession looms.

""Now that the market is tough Marc behaves as if he has complete control"" a person close to Benioff told Insider adding that Benioff was increasingly interfering in the part of the business Taylor was meant to run and putting more pressure on sales teams.

And on to this week's top stories.

The health-insurance upstart went public in June 2021 at a dizzying $11.2 billion valuation. By the time of its first investor day as a public company in December 2021 it had 700000 members across 17 states.







But less than a year later Bright has taken a hatchet to most of its business as it works to stave off a collapse. Its stock price is hovering around $1 and its market value has tumbled to about $600 million — and experts and company insiders blame Bright's pursuit of rapid growth for its undoing.

Insiders describe Bright Health's fall from grace.

Citadel has plenty of reasons to celebrate this year and the hedge-fund giant is doing it in style — with a lavish 20th-anniversary bash at Disney World.

When Elon Musk took over Twitter he dismissed the company's top brass and a boatload of employees and implemented a ""hardcore"" culture for its remaining skeleton crew.

But there's still a key question at hand: How will Musk keep his new acquisition afloat? The answer could lie in the mogul's crown-jewel company: Tesla. That should leave Tesla investors with another important question: Just how far will he go to save the social-media platform?

My Best CRM Stock to Buy and Hold,"Investors appear to have a compelling second chance for outsized gains with this stock.

Few could have predicted the effects Marc Benioff would have on the tech industry when he left Oracle to found Salesforce (CRM 0.55%) the first software-as-a-service (SaaS) company revolving around customer relationship management (CRM).

So successful was Salesforce that it became an industry-leading company that later joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But despite that achievement the CRM industry continues to innovate which leaves plenty of opportunity for investor gains. Given its innovation and size the CRM stock of the future just might be HubSpot (HUBS 1.84%).

HubSpot and CRM

CRM connects departments such as marketing sales and customer service. Under this cohesive system departments could work together more easily and avoid redundant tasks significantly increasing operational efficiency.

To be sure Salesforce is a tough competitor and its tool stands out for its granular forecasting. And HubSpot's $14 billion market cap is slightly above one-tenth of Salesforce's a situation that could leave HubSpot vulnerable without a meaningful competitive advantage.

Fortunately HubSpot has the attention of small and medium-sized businesses. It attracted this cohort with its ""freemium"" pricing model. Unlike Salesforce it offers a level of service at no charge bringing these clients into the HubSpot ecosystem. From there it sells a premium package that adds functionality and drives revenue for the company.

Additionally for marketing automation HubSpot is the industry leader. According to Datanyze it claims a 39% market share in marketing automation software. All other peers -- including Salesforce and Oracle -- had market shares in the single digits.

As of the end of the third quarter HubSpot claimed almost 159000 customers a 24% increase year over year. Customers are also spending more on the platform increasing their average subscription by 7% over the same period to more than $11200.

HubSpot by the numbers

That increased use along with the growing customer base significantly boosted HubSpot's financials. In the first nine months of 2022 revenue came in at almost $1.3 billion rising 35% compared with the same period in 2021. Still both the cost of revenue and operating expenses increased at a faster rate than revenue leading to a loss of $97 million in the first three quarters of 2022. In comparison HubSpot lost $61 million during the same timeframe in 2021.

HubSpot also remains in the clutches of the bear market. Its stock dropped by close to 65% over the last year.

However its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio now sits around 8. While that comes in significantly higher than Salesforce at 4 times sales it is also the lowest sales multiple since the March 2020 sell-off in stocks. Such a move could indicate limited near-term downside for the CRM stock.

Consider HubSpot

With that historically low valuation investors may want to buy hand over fist. Even though Salesforce may outperform HubSpot on granularity the freemium approach did not impede paid subscription growth. HubSpot's lead in market automation should also hold it in good stead.

Moreover investors should pay close attention to its growth potential. The smaller market cap implies more possible upside increasing the likelihood of outsized investor profits over time.",https://news.google.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_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce Presents AI Summarist: A Conversational AI Tool That Helps User Manage Their Information Consumption As Per Their Work Preferences,"Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 Shares

Slack is an effective productivity tool used by professionals and teams worldwide to stay in touch and update on the latest work-related information in an asynchronous fashion. But as the number (and types) of conversations in Slack that a user follows grows so does their overall information intake. This may cause users to experience an ever-increasing cognitive burden which can be distracting and impede deep work.

The cognitive load of a user can often increase when they are actively participating in several Slack channels throughout the day while also managing their business.

To assist users in effectively processing the constant stream of content updates from various channels DMs and threads on Slack Salesforce has developed new work using cutting-edge conversational AI. By reading summaries to catch up on information users of their service dubbed AI Summarist can tailor their information consumption and (indirectly) manage their notifications on Slack channels.

The benefits of AI Summarist are mentioned below:

Enhancing information: Users can receive automated summaries from channels that are less directly relevant to their day-to-day job while still keeping up with the most important channels.

Personalizing Information Consumption: Users can tailor how and where they get their work-related information. They may customize how often and when to receive summaries using AI Summarist.

Users can discover new (and more) channels to follow by reading overviews of recently discovered or suggested channels.

If a user has been away from work for a few days they can rapidly catch up on messages by reading channel summaries from which they can choose to delve deeper (read full content) if they deem it necessary.

Try to pick out the main ideas: When an AI Summarist is tasked with summarising a vast volume of discussions it uses the reactions and replies to determine which topics are most significant.

End-to-end impromptu operation of the summarising process. The following procedures are carried out when a summary request is made using AI Summarist:

Messages can be sent via API: Calls are made to the Slack API to retrieve all conversation threads from the requested time frame. Conversing in a less tangled fashion: Artificial intelligence summary software can pick out individual talks from a large group of communications. Artificial intelligence is the wizard: A summary of the discussions is generated using an AI algorithm. Conveyed Synopsis: A private summary prioritized for the requesting user is delivered after time has elapsed.

Since AI Summarist understands that the contents of a user’s Slack messages are private and confidential it takes great care when processing user data and reading private communications. Neither the raw conversation logs nor the summarised version is stored. Everything is done on an as-needed basis whenever the user makes a request. The fact that AI Summarist does not save any of the data it summarises gives customers peace of mind when utilizing it for private and sensitive topics on Slack.

Users can provide critical comments on the created summary and AI Summarist only retains metadata relating to the functions invoked by the users. AI Summarist’s dialogue summarising capabilities can be enhanced by learning more about where it falls short concerning user expectations which can be gleaned from this feedback. Users are urged to use caution when providing feedback that could be interpreted as personally identifiable information.

An employee said that ""people are afraid it (layoffs) could come at any point"" reports Business Insider.

A person familiar with the matter said that the firm has pushed for cost-cutting measures since first approaching the company this summer according to the report.

Back in November the company laid off hundreds of employees as Big Tech firms navigate through an economic slowdown.

Protocol first reported that Salesforce was preparing for a major round of layoffs that could affect as many as 2500 employees.

The company however told media publications that the job cuts affected ""less than a thousand"" employees.

The company had 73541 people on its payroll earlier this year.

Earlier this month the company announced that Bret Taylor will step down as Vice Chair and Co-CEO effective January 31 2023.

Marc Benioff will be the new Chair and CEO of the company.

""I am grateful for six fantastic years at Salesforce. After a lot of reflection I've decided to return to my entrepreneurial roots"" Taylor said in a statement.

Eiman Ebrahimi CEO at Protopia AI

Protopia AI based in Austin announced it has closed on a $6 million seed round of funding led by ATX Venture Partners.

The company has developed a software solution that allows big companies to tap into key data by using artificial intelligence and machine learning to extract insights without exposing sensitive information.

Protopia cites a Gartner report on AI which found that CEOs major problem in using AI is data accessibility.

Other investors in the round included Galaxy Interactive Silverton Partners and DNX Ventures. Protopia has raised a total of $8 million which includes an initial $2 million pre-seed round. All existing investors extended their commitment by participating in the new round.

Protopia AI’s core technology is based on inventions by Professor Hadi Esmaeilzadeh endowed chair of computer architecture at the University of California San Diego. He is also Protopia AI’s co-founder and chief technology officer.

“We are at an inflection point where AI has unprecedented capabilities — but at the cost of losing the control and ownership of data” Esmaeilzadeh said in a news release. “Protopia AI is the vision to enable practical AI without losing the control/ownership of data.”

Portopia.AI plans to use the funds raised to hire engineers and on product development. It is currently in beta-testing with customers in financial services government and health care.

Funds raised from the round will be used to build out engineering teams and advance the product. The company is currently beta-testing its product across industries where data sensitivity causes the most operational slowdowns including financial services government and health care.

“Protopia AI empowers enterprises to extract maximal value using AI and machine learning from their data by providing the governance and protection that is necessary” Eiman Ebrahimi Protopia AI co-founder and CEO said in a news release.

“Today companies are looking to create real value from their data using artificial intelligence and machine learning according to Protopia AI. “They frequently are blocked or slowed down by data-sensitivity issues. According to a Seagate Technology and IDC survey respondents estimated their organizations collect only 56% of their operational data. Out of that 56% 43% of data remains unused. Protopia AI solves this dilemma with its easy-to-use Stained Glass Transform™ that enables the operation of AI and ML while removing the need to access the company’s data in identifiable form.”

“Data-centric AI is the future and Protopia is positioned to emerge as an industry innovator and market leader” Chris Shonk ATX Venture Partners managing partner said in a news release. “No other software company in the market is offering a solution with privacy in mind at all stages of the ML lifecycle including deployment in mind from inception. We have a shared vision for maximal data protection and are pleased to fund the company at this critical growth stage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvcWEtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1lbnRlcnByaXNlLWxhYnMtZGlyZWN0b3ItdGFsa3MtbW4tbGlmZS1zY2llbmNlLXN0YXJ0LXVwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Q&A: University Enterprise Labs outgoing director talks MN life science start-ups,"Situated toward the westernmost corner of St. Paul bordering Minnesota 280 a sizable glass-paneled building has become an incubator of sorts for emerging life science companies with efforts ranging from clinical trials of experimental drugs to new lab-based bio-technology start-ups about a third of them launched by faculty from the University of Minnesota.

University Enterprise Labs which opened in 2005 is neither funded by nor officially affiliated with the University but the 60 start-ups gestating in its labs and offices on Westgate Drive draw talent and inspiration from their proximity.

The structure which spans 144000 square feet includes 33 full-size wet labs with fume hoods and about 20 dry labs without fume hoods in addition to conference rooms office and common spaces. A $6.4 million addition which includes shared group lab space opened in 2019.

Within the health sciences Minnesota which is home to 18 Fortune 500 companies already has a strong profile when it comes to medical device manufacturing academic research direct patient care and retail delivery of health goods. As private corporate ventures go the life science and bio-tech industries have a much less established footprint.

After five years as executive director and chief executive officer of UEL Diane Rucker stepped down this month to focus on family. Rucker an engineer who trained at MIT and the University of Michigan returned to MIT in 2012 for her executive master’s of business administration.

Among her professional titles she spent 16 years with Seagate Technology in Minnesota and five years with General Motors in Michigan as well as holding roles with Carrot Health a Minnesota start-up and an entrepreneurship accelerator run by MIT and Harvard.

Interim executive director Mike Berthelsen formerly a vice president of University Services with the U of M will lead UEL until Rucker’s permanent replacement is chosen by UEL’s 12-member board.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: What kinds of changes have you seen over the past five years?

A: What I’ve actually seen is a stronger start-up pool more companies that have solid funding — less of the idea-stage companies and more companies that are ready to scale. The pool is getting larger. It’s a very cool thing for Minnesota.

Q: How do you account for that? What are some of the drivers?

A: I’d point to efforts like Launch Minnesota through the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development which has funded more than 25 of our UEL companies from $25000 to $35000. It’s actually not very much especially for a bio-tech company but it’s enough to get them to the next level where they can start raising money. Most of our start-ups have two to three founders. Think of it as organization building not whether your technology works but what you need to start building a business around that. That’s understanding visibility marketing supply chain management and scale and manufacturing.

Q: How would you describe the start-up climate in Minnesota and what role does UEL play?

A: We saw the need for connective tissue across the start-up eco-system. You have start-ups risk capital or funding education like marketplace awareness and start-up support organizations and university courses government and corporations — do they support or suppress start-ups from entering the market?

Amgen plows ahead with costly highly toxic cancer dosing despite FDA challenge Business | Black homeowners start to close gap in property values The five elements here in Minnesota are individually strong but the connections across the ecosystem were not. A government can make it easier or harder to start a business which is why many businesses incorporate in different states than where they run their business.

What’s happened in the last five to seven years we’ve started to see those connections grow across the ecosystem. We’ve seen more funding. We’ve seen phenomenal growth in Twin Cities Startup Week which started as just a weekend. We’ve seen more of those interactions across the state which means when you start a company you don’t start it in isolation. You have a network of entrepreneurs and funders and mentors to draw from.

The five-year start-up survival rate in Minnesota really varies between first and fourth in the nation. One of the reasons is people really think about it ahead of time. They don’t just jump into the marketplace. They really take their time to prepare.

Q: Can you give me an example of a start-up success story that has grown out of UEL labs?

A: CoreBiome which does micro-biome analysis of your genetic make-up to understand your disease profile started around 2016. They were acquired in 2019 by OraSure Technologies and spun off into a separate division of the company called Diversigen. They stayed with us for about another nine months after their acquisition. We wanted them to stay longer but we didn’t have enough space for them for what they planned to do for the next five years.

Q: Lab space has been a challenge nationally I hear. You can’t just retrofit an old law office and call it a genetics lab.

A: Honestly that’s a common problem with companies that incubate at UEL. As they grow we don’t have enough places in Minnesota to send them next. Within the building our labs are completely full. We don’t have an extra 5000 to 10000 square feet available. I wish we did.

A full-size lab is about 1000 square feet. As companies come to us they’ll usually want a full-size lab a portion of a full-size lab or one to two labs to start. There’s some pretty stringent heating ventilation and air conditioning requirements and bio-safety requirements. Zepto Life Technology has the second floor of our new addition and is close to 8000 square feet.

Q: What does the future hold for UEL and life science start-ups in Minnesota?

A: This is a good time for the board to get more involved in strategic planning and think about what it wants to be in the start-up community and what it could do in the next 5 to 10 years. A big question is what does the community need from us? … In the Twin Cities and also greater Minnesota what do we need to be to make Minnesota a place that is really strong in the life sciences world?

We’re already really strong in med-tech. We’re good at insurance with companies like UnitedHealth group we’re good at retail with companies like Target and Best Buy we’re good at logistics if you look at CHS. We have a decent amount of movement with people across industry. What do we do really well and what’s applicable to life science and bio-tech? Target and Best Buy have survived by figuring out how the customer thinks. The retail industry has absolutely mastered that.",,,,,,,,,

What’s going to happen to the giant crystal chandelier?

For shopping’s strongest quarter of the year the Crystal Mall has gamely strung Christmas lights and its retailer remnant is giving it their best season-of-magic try. A few smiling employees staff brightly lit stores that are still open if you need a diamond or a new pair of glasses. Or maybe someone on your list can use a load of store fixtures from the lingering Bed Bath & Beyond.

Over it all hangs the Waterford Crystal chandelier awaiting its fate.

It’s been crystal clear (not sorry) for years that the mall’s days are numbered but what will happen to the property next is still unknown. For now the contrast with the thronged hallways of the ’80s through the ’00s is so melodramatic it could make a Hallmark movie. The heroine comes home for the holidays from her big city marketing job only to discover that the mall where she used to tell Santa what she wanted for Christmas and later worked her first real job now needs her to rescue it.

Well she’d have to give up and go back to Gotham. The owner of most of the Waterford mall’s square footage since 2012 Simon Property Group stopped payment on a $95 million loan and transferred the title back to the lender. All but one of the anchor stores has long since closed.

When the Crystal Mall finally goes dark that will be one last milestone for a commercial entity that personified the region’s change of emphasis from homegrown retailing to nationally branded stores. Its advent attracted shoppers by bringing in department store fashion but the mall also hastened the inevitable for downtown New London Groton Norwich and smaller Main Street districts. A few local businesses moved to the mall; others stuck it out downtown until they expired. Now the circle may close with a share of the market reverting to the locals as an alternative to the dominance of impersonal online shopping.

The beginning was exciting though. Mall developers introduced their shiny new property in 1984 with a dressy party for local dignitaries and seemingly everyone in Waterford. It was an opulent affair for a party held on tiled floors between shop windows. One unforgettable sight was a well-known elementary school principal strolling away from the raw bar with crab legs sticking out of his jacket pockets. There was a contest to guess how many crystals were in the chandelier.

In its glory years the mall’s management saw fit to be a benefactor to the wider community than just the Waterford tax base. There were various fundraisers and the Simon company sponsored scholarships open to local kids. The mall doors would open before the stores so that morning fitness walkers could use the walkways away from the weather outside. The most significant win-win came from the entry-level positions that gave local high school kids their first jobs teaching the invaluable lessons of dealing with the public.

That was then before the decline of indoor-style malls the rise of internet shopping and that killer of so many last chances COVID-19. The near-emptiness of a huge structure and its acres of parking space is now. Whatever is next will not come easily as different investors own different parts of the property with potentially only one common interest: profit.

Developers are conditioned to expect a long game; their proposals routinely have to win an OK from many levels of government representing the competing interests of taxpayers the environment and residents concerned about quality of life in the neighborhood.

In February 2021 a Day editorial raised the issue of what uses a closed mall might have. Day Staff Writer Brian Hallenbeck has kept readers updated on financial developments that could affect the options. Around that time Waterford began steps to create an advisory body that would presumably ready the town for a seat at the table. The initial committee was composed of several town officials; members of the local legislative delegation; the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut; the Southeastern Connecticut Enterprise Region; the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments; AdvanceCT and the state Department of Economic and Community Development. The town’s website does not list current activities for such a body and a call to the first selectman’s office was not returned.

The pace of defining the mall’s future looks like it could be wait wait hurry up. It is important to be ready when the gears shift. Waterford has a primary interest as the host town but the region and the state have an economic stake in what happens at the site. A regional economic development conversation is in order.

Maybe Waterford could get first dibs on the chandelier.

Construction is finally set to begin on a set of luxury apartments in the vicinity of the Oxford Valley Mall a long-awaited project for many. Peg Quann wrote about the upcoming construction for the Bucks County Courier Times.

About 600 apartments are set to be built at the former location of Boscov’s which is connected to the popular Bucks County mall. CornerstoneTracy LLC a Villanova-based development and real estate firm has been working with the mall’s parent company Simon on the details of this plan since the fall of 2019.

Contractors are expecting the vast majority of future residents to be either young professionals or older adults. Being in a business-oriented area the former group is expected to make up a large percentage of those living in the upcoming apartments. The buildings that will be constructed are expected to be four stories high.

As construction begins Simon has started to warn shoppers to be careful when near the construction zone.

Hours before the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns kicked off there was a big move in the betting market for that game.

The Bengals who were 6-point favorites most of the week were suddenly just 4-point favorites at BetMGM on Sunday morning. Line moves like that happen on the day of an NFL game without news of an injury but it's fairly rare. Lamarr Mitchell the director of the race and sports book at MGM Grand said a lot of sharp money came in on the Browns. That caused the change.

Maybe it's just a coincidence that Bengals receiver Tee Higgins played one snap on Sunday with a hamstring injury. But it was a little strange. It was horrible for fantasy players who had Higgins and needed to win in Week 14 to make the playoffs.

The Bengals won anyway 23-10. They covered the spread whether bettors had them at -6 or -4. It still led to questions over why Higgins was practically inactive despite not being on the team's injury report (he was listed as limited with a hamstring injury in Thursday and Friday's practice but had no injury designation for the game).

Bengals coach Zac Taylor said Higgins who has 861 yards this season and is one of the NFL's best receivers was injured in warmups. Taylor said Higgins snuck on the field for the first snap. He didn't play after that.

Zac Taylor added that they did not want Tee Higgins on the field at all but he managed to find his way on to the field for the first snap from scrimmage his only play of the game. — Ben Baby (@Ben_Baby) December 11 2022

Tee Higgins felt his hamstring tweaked in pregame. He wanted to play  but coaches said no. Boyd has dislocated finger. No timeline on either guy — Geoff Hobson (@GeoffHobsonCin) December 11 2022

It was a nightmare for fantasy managers who submitted lineups not realizing Higgins would put up a zero. There was no announcement before the game and reporters at the game were as curious as anyone when Higgins wasn't on the field after the first play.

Whatever happened the NFL will probably make a call and make sure there were no injury report shenanigans going on. Not that it will help fantasy managers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0a3IuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9pbmp1cmVkLWphbWVzLXRha2VzLWZpbmFsLXNuYXAtb2YtcGhvZWJ1cy10aXRsZS1nYW1l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Injured James takes final snap of Phoebus title game,"LYNCHBURG VA (WTKR)- Nolan James was set to be out for Phoebus’s state title game but despite a season-ending injury still got onto the field.

While they’re not all arriving at the same time Ben Brode’s earlier tease of weekly card drops is already coming to fruition as these bonus cards are staggered across the month of December.

So before you get your hands on them either through luck in the Collection Level rewards track or manually through the Token Shop here’s a rundown on some of the strongest decks to maximize their potential in Marvel Snap.

Best Knull decks in Marvel Snap

Knull drops into Marvel Snap on December 13 as a devastating 6 Cost | 0 Power card with a unique Ongoing effect. This card has the combined Power of all cards destroyed this game. Of note the text doesn’t specify your cards only. Meaning if the enemy destroyed cards too they add to Knull’s collective Power.

Marvel / Second Dinner

Knull Deck 1: Death & Destruction

First up to synergize with Knull our goal is to wreak as much havoc as possible by destroying as many cards as possible. That means key Destroy picks like Carnage Bucky Barnes and Killmonger are all still essential here. However we’ve added the likes of Yondu as a solid drop on any turn. Not only can he remove a powerful enemy card but in doing so that card’s stats are added to Knull.

In an ideal situation you would have cleared out enough targets to have Death down to 0 Cost. On turn 6 you can theoretically drop 12 Power into one Location for free then Knull into any other Location with a huge amount of Power to seal the win. If you haven’t quite managed to draw the right cards though Aero always works as a great final play to disrupt enemy combos.

Knull Deck 2: Galactus wombo

If you’re an experienced player with ample Pool 3/4/5 cards at your disposal this Knull & Galactus deck could be for you. You’ve probably seen plenty of Galactus at the higher ranks already but with Knull in effect the wombo combo is set to become even more devastating.

Early-game plays with this deck aren’t too critical so long as you’re keeping one Location clear and focusing on destroying some cheaper cards. As the match progresses your goal is to try and activate Galactus prior to turn-six by any means. This can be achieved through Wave or Psylocke.

By dropping Galactus onto the board you’re wiping out almost every other card leading to an extraordinary final turn if you’ve drawn the right cards. In an optimal situation you can theoretically drop Death and Knull on the one remaining Location to overwhelm any opposing turn-six combo.

Best Sentry decks in Marvel Snap

The Sentry card arrives in Marvel Snap on December 20 as a 4 Cost | 8 Power card. However these stats come with some caveats. This card cannot be played at the right Location and On Reveal it adds a -8 Power Void to the right Location.

In essence if you’re running this card you’re largely sacrificing your right lane though that’s not to say there aren’t a few effective workarounds to this negative effect.

Marvel / Second Dinner

Sentry Deck 1: No fun for you

Obviously having a -8 Power card on your side of the board isn’t ideal. So the goal here is to simply hand that over to your enemy and let it be their problem. In order to achieve this Viper is an absolute must-have in order to follow up on turn five and transfer the -8 card across the board.

Article continues after ad

In the meantime the rest of the deck is designed around limiting plays and clogging enemy Locations with useless or negative cards. Green Goblin Debrii Sentry and Hobgoblin are all perfect to oppress your opponent while limiting the space in which they can counter the negative Power.

If you’re anticipating a big turn-six drop from them you can counter with Aero by dragging their strongest cards into the weakest lanes.

Marvel / Second Dinner

Sentry Deck 2: Destroy the Void

With a similar objective in mind the goal here is to wipe out the negative effect from playing Sentry. By having a -8 Power card in the right Location you’re setting yourself up to lose. So that’s where Destroy cards come into play as you wipe the Void from the board.

Article continues after ad

Obviously this can be done in many ways thanks to the likes of Carnage and Deathlok. Though perhaps the optimal pick is Destroyer. Through the early turns the ideal strategy is to build up one particular lane safeguarded with Armor. After playing Sentry in this protected lane you can then follow up with Destroyed in the right Location to erase the -8 Power and overwhelm with a surprise +15 Power.

Marvel / Second Dinner

Best Darkhawk decks in Marvel Snap

The Darkhawk card drops into Marvel Snap on December 20 as a 4 Cost | 1 Power card. Though through its unique Ongoing effect it gains +2 Power for each card in your opponent’s deck.

With only a few ways to interact with your opponent’s deck Darkhawk is one of the more challenging Pool 5 cards to excel with. But through the right builds this can be an extremely powerful four-cost in no time.

Marvel / Second Dinner

Darkhawk Deck 1: Full Hand Full Power

The goal with this deck is to keep your opponent’s hand as full as possible. While there’s obviously no predicting what you’ll encounter in each game limiting the number of cards they can play draw and interact with often gives you the upper hand.

The likes of Iceman Black Widow Baron Mordo Wave Maximus and Sandman all work towards that common objective. By increasing card costs adding useless cards to their hand and allowing just one card to be played per turn you’re directly buffing your Darkhawk drop.

Not only that but Darkhawk is also identical in its effect to Ronan. By dropping both onto the board and following up with Spectrum your odds of success are certainly high.

Marvel / Second Dinner

Darkhawk Deck 2: Wongers

Next up comes a more combo-heavy deck as not only do we look to fill the opponent’s hand but also build up some hefty stats on our side of the board. This is done through cards like Black Widow Angela Baron Mordo and Maximus.

One particularly strong card here is Beast as this 2 drop can recycle your most annoying early-game cards allowing you to double up and once again clog the enemy’s hand with Black Widow or Baron Mordo. Better yet combining these effects with Wong can lead to some devastating late-game plays especially with Absorbing Man there to add further insult to injury.

Mosley had easily funniest offsides penalty against Bills,"Even when the New York Jets manage to put together a successful season they still find ways to remind everyone that they’re the Jets.

The Jets defense had themselves a dominant first half against Josh Allen and the Bills on Sunday holding Buffalo scoreless until the final drive of the half. And really the Jets had an opportunity to stop the Bills on fourth down. But C.J. Mosley just couldn’t help himself — the Jets in him took over.

In a pre-snap play that was almost certainly designed to draw a defender offsides Bills tight end Dawson Knox went under center. And Mosley seemed certain he had a read on the snap count. About that …

Mosley went soaring over the line of scrimmage and took out Knox who had not taken the snap. Knox’s reaction told the whole story. He knew that they were never going to run a play there and he was fired up that Mosley fell for it so badly.

The Bills ended up scoring on the drive to take a seven-point lead into halftime. Fans of course had jokes about the objectively hilarious offsides penalty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay90dmFuZHNob3diaXovMjA3MjE4NzkvbG92ZS1pc2xhbmRzLWdlb3JnaWEtc3RlZWwtcmFyZS1zbmFwLWxvb2thbGlrZS1tdW0v0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL3R2YW5kc2hvd2Jpei8yMDcyMTg3OS9sb3ZlLWlzbGFuZHMtZ2VvcmdpYS1zdGVlbC1yYXJlLXNuYXAtbG9va2FsaWtlLW11bS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Love Island’s Georgia Steel shares snap with rarely-seen lookalike mum...,"LOVE Island's Georgie Steel has shared a snap of her rarely-seen lookalike mum on her social media.

The duo wowed with their glowy make-up and matching nude lipsticks.

Georgia's mum even mirrored her influencer daughter's fringe hair style and lose waves that she's been sporting these days.

The pair looked classy and elegant as they both stunned in matching outfits.

Georgia wore a black tailored suit while mum Sharon wore a stylish maroon coloured blouse with tailored black trousers.

Taking to her Instagram stories Georgia wrote: ""Can't get enough of each other at the minute @Sharonsteel13"" following a heart emoji.

The former Love Island star's mum is rarely seen on Georgia's social media and there's not much information about her.

But in 2018 Sharon appeared on ITV's This Morning to talk about her daughter after coming out of the Love Island villa.

The ""very proud"" mother stressed the importance of ""loyalty"" to hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes.

She said: ""I’m the proudest mum’ Sharon beamed. ‘The most important thing in life is friendship and loyalty.""

Which is funny because Georgia's most used phrase during her time on Love Island became the word ""loyal"" .

The star quickly became known for her use of the word and it suddenly became a social media trend."

Iowa Capital Dispatch

Is a store that sells gasoline to an arsonist liable for damages that result from the sale?

That’s one of the central questions raised in a case that pits an insurance company against a Des Moines QuikTrip store and its parent corporation.

State Auto Property and Casualty Insurance Co. the insurance company for the Southern Knolls apartment complex in Des Moines is suing QuikTrip Corp. of Tulsa Oklahoma in federal court alleging gross negligence.

According to court records Giovannte Curtis entered the QuikTrip gas station and convenience store at 3941 S.E. 14th St. in Des Moines shortly after 6 p.m. on April 7 2021. Curtis purchased several plastic soda-fountain cups then took the cups outside to the gas pumps and tried to fill them with $2 worth of gasoline.

A QuikTrip employee stopped the pump to prevent the sale and explained to Curtis that plastic beverage cups were not appropriate containers to transport gasoline.

Curtis left the store and returned about 10 minutes later with an appropriate gas container. He encountered the store’s assistant manager Solonia Gene introduced himself to her and then made several comments indicating that he intended to use the gas he was about to purchase for some sort of “nefarious and/or criminal purposes” according to the insurer.

Curtis allegedly told Gene “You going to get to know me real well” and said he was “going to handle a situation” that was “going to be broadcast” according to the lawsuit.

Despite those statements QuikTrip sold Curtis several dollars’ worth of gas the lawsuit claims. He then took his partially filled gas can and immediately walked across the street to the Southern Knolls apartment building where he poured the gasoline on the floors and walls and ignited it with a lighter.

The fire quickly spread and caused significant damage to the building although no injuries were reported. Curtis was later arrested and convicted of second-degree arson.

According to the lawsuit Gene admitted she was worried about selling gas to Curtis because she believed he was going to use it to start a fire. She also is alleged to have said that she did not have time to intervene or call 911 because it was a busy time of night with a number of customers in the store adding that she prayed that night because she was worried Curtis was going to cause damage or harm someone.

State Auto Property and Casualty alleges it paid more than $1 million to the owner of Southern Knolls as compensation for damages and lost rental income. The lawsuit seeks recovery of those payments.

Did QuikTrip have a duty to deny the sale?

QuikTrip has denied any wrongdoing and earlier this year it argued for a dismissal claiming it wasn’t responsible “for the actions of Curtis Giovannte.” (In virtually all of the civil court records Curtis’ first and last names are mistakenly reversed.) The retailer also claimed that a business’ duty to protect against harm caused by others is “limited to those lawfully on the business’ land.”

The retailer said that “whatever duty QuikTrip may have had to control” Curtis or his actions ended once Curtis “left QuikTrip’s property.”

U.S. District Court Senior Judge James E. Gritzner ruled otherwise and denied the company’s motion for a dismissal.

In his ruling Gritzner said there appeared to be no Iowa precedent as to whether an ordinary “duty of care” extends between the seller of a non-defective product and members of the general public who are harmed by a so-called “defective customer.”

The judge noted the New Mexico Supreme Court once addressed the question of whether a retailer had a duty to refuse the sale of gasoline to an intoxicated driver. In that case a store was sued after selling fuel to a drunk customer who then caused an accident that claimed the life of another driver. The New Mexico court held that gasoline retailers have a duty to refrain from supplying fuel to “a driver the vendor knows or has reason to know is intoxicated.”

Gritzner stated that in the QuikTrip case Curtis is alleged to have said he intended to “handle a situation” and that he would be “broadcast.” Also the judge noted Curtis first attempted to buy gas using plastic fountain cups suggesting his intent was not to fill a fuel tank. That act also demonstrated a “disregard for the inherent dangers” of gasoline the judge found.

“Together these facts create a plausible inference that QuikTrip employees knew or had reason to know (Curtis) planned to cause harm at the time they sold him gasoline” Gritzner ruled in denying the motion to dismiss. “QuikTrip controlled the sale of gasoline at its store. Indeed it turned (Curtis) away once only allowing him to buy gas upon his return to the store.”

A trial in the case is scheduled for Aug. 21 2023.

QuikTrip has filed a third-party complaint against Curtis seeking compensation for any amount the company must pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement against its insurer.

That same year at Tampa-based Heritage Insurance Holdings one of numerous small Florida-based homeowners insurance companies its CEO made $27.3 million — despite overseeing 0.3% of the number of policies and accounts of State Farm.

Florida-based insurance companies have been going out of business the last few years or raising rates by double-digits. Industry groups and Gov. Ron DeSantis have blamed excessive litigation and Republican legislators are poised this week to limit the incentives to sue insurers.

But state lawmakers have largely ignored an issue that has been directly blamed for numerous past company failures — and allowed some executives to make eye-popping sums of money over the last decade when companies were wildly profitable thanks to years without a storm.

Between 2014 and 2018 the CEO for Fort Lauderdale-based Universal Insurance Holdings made between $14 million and $25 million each year corporate filings show. The company has reduced its policies in Florida over the last year.

At St. Petersburg-based United Insurance Holdings whose insurance arm fell under state supervision last week the company awarded millions of dollars in stock dividends most of which went to company officers and directors even while its profits shrank according to corporate filings.

The payouts are legal under Florida law — and necessary some say. While insurance companies in Florida are closely regulated with caps on payouts and profits their parent and sister companies are largely unregulated.

That makes the small domestic companies that dominate Florida’s market more lucrative to investors.

State regulators have long been aware of the dangers of outsized arrangements between insurers and their sister and parent companies.

Large payouts to executives were at the heart of the biggest insurer collapse in the state’s history: the 2008 failure of the Tampa-based Poe Insurance Group which left Floridians on the hook paying roughly $850 million in outstanding claims from the 2004 and 2005 storms. The state sued to recoup $143.5 million in dividends the company paid to owners and their family members between 2004 and 2005.

Since then excessive payouts have been a consistent theme among the graveyard of companies that have failed. Financial autopsies on companies that went insolvent between 2011 and 2018 have repeatedly blamed high salaries and fees to affiliated companies. In one case the autopsy said one insurer’s officers were “stripping (their) company of cash.”

How much such payouts could be to blame for the current wave of failures — six companies in the last year — is unknown.

In 2020 when Florida’s insurance industry began deteriorating after 12 years without a named hurricane hitting the state the Office of Insurance Regulation launched a review of dozens of domestic insurers and their affiliates.

The office has not released the results since the review is ongoing and the responses are confidential under state law an office spokesperson said.

State lawmakers are considering this week expanding regulators’ ability to examine affiliate companies but only after hurricanes. Legislators’ special session begins Monday.

Doug Quinn executive director of the watchdog American Policyholder Association said his group has done its own research on executive compensation. Florida’s history of failures indicates the state’s current policies aren’t working he said.

“If I pick a state and I say ‘We’re going to allow you to come in and start a business and bilk people out of premiums’ Yes you’ll attract a lot of people to start insurance companies” he said.

Lessons from Poe

Between 2004 and 2005 Florida was struck by eight hurricanes the worst stretch in modern history.

Florida’s insurance market was devastated.

Since 1992′s Hurricane Andrew the state has relied on dozens of small Florida-based insurance companies to insure most homes. At the time the largest was the Poe Insurance Group created by former Tampa Mayor Bill Poe which oversaw three different insurers and about 320000 homeowners’ policies.

The 2004 and 2005 storms were devastating to the bottom lines of these firms which saw $2.5 billion in losses. By 2006 all three companies were insolvent and the state levied a 2% assessment on every Floridian’s insurance policy to pay out the companies’ $850 million in outstanding claims.

When state regulators took over the companies they discovered that each one had entered into an agreement with a sister company in January 2004.

The sister company called Poe Insurance Managers provided policy issuance and underwriting services for the three insurance companies in exchange for fees of anywhere between 22.5% to 26.5% of the insurers’ gross written premiums.

The profits of Poe Insurance Managers were then distributed to shareholders through dividends — and they were considerable. Between 2004 and 2005 it paid $143.5 million to company shareholders even though the company was in dire financial condition. Poe himself collected $25 million.

Once the money moves from the insurance company to the affiliate it’s no longer available to pay claims. In 2008 the state sued to recoup the money claiming it was “an intentional and financially reckless scheme to drain and divert the assets of the insolvent insurers for the sole purpose of eliminating their own potential financial exposure and increasing their personal wealth.”

Poe denied the claims and said the family put in over $70 million to try to save the companies.

Although Poe’s collapse was the largest insurance company failure in Florida history state lawmakers did not enhance their scrutiny of companies affiliated with insurers.

These affiliates can still charge the insurance company up to $25 per policy as well as a percentage fee for providing services to the insurer. That fee commonly between 20% and 30% and approved by regulators is often tied to policyholder rates. When rates go up so does the fee.

Large insurers usually have their own in-house employees write policies and provide underwriting. Others might pay an independent third-party company for the services.

Florida’s market is instead dominated by insurance companies that pay their affiliated companies for the work said Jack Nicholson who led Florida’s Hurricane Catastrophe Fund for decades.

Experts say there’s a reason why many Florida insurance companies are set up like this. After Hurricane Andrew national insurance companies dramatically reduced their risk in Florida especially along the coast.

State regulators and lawmakers encouraged new Florida-based insurance companies to operate but those companies needed to raise tens of millions of dollars to get off the ground.

“How do you incentivize investors to do something like that?” said Florida State University College of Business professor Chuck Nyce. “That’s why you see that structure in Florida.”

A long-running trend

An insurance company’s relationship with its affiliated companies can turn a loss into a profit the Sarasota Herald-Tribune found during its 2011 Pulitzer Prize-winning series on Florida’s insurance market.

Homeowners Choice Inc. reported 2009 losses of $650000 for the regulated insurance company and a 2009 profit of $11 million profit for the holding company the newspaper found. That was in part because the insurance company paid an affiliated management firm $24 million for management services that cost $15.4 million.

In 2008 alone investors and executives moved a collective $1.9 billion in policyholder money out of Florida insurers to their affiliated companies the newspaper found.

Since Poe’s collapse state regulators have repeatedly tied insurance company failures to excessive or unusual payouts to affiliated companies state reports show:

After the 2009 failure of First Commercial Insurance Co. and one of its affiliates auditors wrote that its “officers appear to have been stripping the company of cash.”

out more than $1 million in dividends to its investors which included current and former officers of the company Magnolia Insurance Co. existed for two years and still managed to payout more than $1 million in dividends to its investors which included current and former officers of the company auditors wrote

At Seminole Casualty Insurance Co. which mostly offered automobile coverage auditors cited “excessive and unreasonable” fees paid to “related parties” for its 2011 demise.

After the 2011 failure of Aequicap Insurance Co. auditors noted the company “paid commissions claims servicing and management fees to various related parties” but the company didn’t keep enough records for auditors to know if the agreements should have been approved by state regulators.

After Homewise Insurance Co. and one of its affiliates went insolvent in 2011 auditors wrote that in both cases the fault “appears to be the result of an excessive outflow of cash from the company to Homewise Management Company” its parent company.

final years at workers’ compensation underwriter Insurance Company of the Americas the company funded “questionable payments to other … companies” It folded in 2018. During thefinal years at workers’ compensation underwriterInsurance Company of the Americas the company funded “questionable payments to other … companies” auditors wrote It folded in 2018.

At Sunshine State Insurance Co. auditors found the company was paying affiliates for “overlapping services” including some that were not approved by state regulators before its 2014 collapse.

Under state law the Department of Financial Services is required to report the causes behind each insurance company’s insolvency. None of these reports about the seven companies that have gone insolvent for the last two years have been released.

When an insurance company fails it falls into receivership with the department. Agency spokesperson Devin Galetta said that under state law the department can’t release an insolvency report until “the end of the lifetime of the estate.” The estates can last five to seven years he said.

Of the reports for the companies that have gone insolvent between 2008 and 2018 none cite litigation as a reason for the companies’ demise.

Big paydays

Some of the companies that are now struggling awarded big payouts to their CEOs during Florida’s storm-free years.

When Heritage Insurance Cos. was starting up in 2013 the state-run Citizens Property Insurance Board of Governors made the unusual decision to pay the company up to $52 million to take out policies.

Republican lawmakers raised concerns about the deal and questions revolved around the $110000 the company donated to then-Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign account the Palm Beach Post reported at the time.

The company became highly profitable. In 2015 the CEO of Heritage’s parent company Bruce Lucas was awarded more than $11 million in cash and another $16 million in stock. That same year Heritage’s insurance company asked Florida regulators for permission to raise rates on some customers by up to 25% the Palm Beach Post reported. (In 2015 he sold nearly $19 million in stock according to federal filings.)

Lucas’ wife who was also a director of Heritage’s insurance company with a $150000 salary was also paid as a $400-per-hour consultant in 2017 earning an additional $440000 that year corporate filings show.

Since Lucas left the company has reported steady losses and is limiting its exposure in Florida.

In 2017 Universal’s CEO Sean Downes was the highest-paid property and casualty insurance company executive in the nation according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. At $19.3 million Downes was paid more than the CEOs of Allstate ($17.1 million) Travelers ($14.8 million) and Progressive ($9.3 million).

Between 2013 and 2019 Downes earned between $9 million and $25 million each year federal filings show.

Universal Florida’s largest domestic insurer with about 872000 policies has shed about 100000 policies in the state over the last year although it remains healthier than most other domestic insurers.

Since 2019 the company’s executive compensation has changed considerably Chief Strategy Officer Arash Soleimani said in a statement.

“Since that time we have meaningfully restructured and reduced executive compensation including major reductions to salaries cash bonuses and equity grants” Soleimani said adding that more than 90% of its shareholders voted in favor of the compensation plan at its most recent meeting.

CEOs at other domestic companies routinely made over $1 million and family members also benefitted public filings show.

At United Insurance Holdings the parent company of United Property & Casualty which fell under state supervision last week after heavy losses CEO Daniel Peed regularly earned more than $4 million a year in stock dividends. (The quarterly dividend payments ended in this year’s second quarter.)

The executive compensation at the companies has fallen sharply in the last few years and executives who didn’t sell their company stock have lost millions of dollars in net worth noted Paul Handerhan president of the consumer-oriented Federal Association for Insurance Reform based in Fort Lauderdale. The current CEO of Universal for example reported $3.5 million in compensation last year.

“When we had no storms all the insurance companies were making money and they were all making great income” Handerhan said. “From 2017 on all their executive compensation has taken a nosedive.”

Last year state lawmakers — at the urging of regulators — allowed for more oversight of sister and parent companies of insurance providers.

The Office of Insurance Regulation said that it “routinely reviews” the agreements between insurers and affiliates. In 2010 the office ordered Southern Oak Insurance to reduce the commissions it was paying to one of its affiliates.

In its 2020 request for information to insurance companies the agency asked them to disclose how much money their affiliates made from providing their services about any physical office space insurers gave to their affiliates without charge and about any loans the insurers received and from whom.

Legislation introduced for this week’s special session would allow state regulators to examine insurers after hurricanes if they have “made significant payments” to their affiliate companies in the storm’s aftermath.

Otherwise lawmakers are proposing to leave insurers’ affiliates untouched.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaW50aGVzZXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2xvdWlzaWFuYS1sYW5kLWxvc3MtZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWxzLXJlcGFyYXRpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil Companies Have Plundered Louisiana's Coast.

And this is just the beginning. Recently a federal court ordered a nine-year-old lawsuit to return to state court. The suit was filed against Chevron USA Exxon Mobil Corp. ConocoPhillips Co. and BP America. Over 40 similar legal challenges may follow against the oil and gas companies that have caused and are causing Louisiana’s wetlands to disappear at an alarming rate. These lawsuits could win billions of dollars in damages.

Companies dredged thousands of miles of canals through the marsh to get to and from oil and gas wells carving up Native bayou communities. These canals directly destroy wetlands disrupt wetland hydrology and act as avenues for salt water intrusion causing the coastal marshes our necessary and natural barriers to hurricanes to rapidly erode.

Oil and gas companies have long opposed Indigenous tribes in Southern Louisiana achieving federal recognition. They fear that Native people will reclaim the oil-rich ocean-accessible lands that fossil fuel corporations have been ruining for nearly a century.

Southern Louisiana is home to large Native communities including my own the Houma. While many Houma still live on our ancestral lands it is the fastest disappearing region in the country. Our lands are unprotected because no Indigenous tribe in the southernmost regions of Louisiana has federal recognition and the state of Louisiana is heavily invested in fossil fuels.

Likewise historically Black communities such as Ironton a freedmen’s town located in Plaquemines Parish continue to resist displacement. After hurricanes Katrina and Isaac only about 50 families remain in the community. In 2021 Hurricane Ida scattered dozens of unearthed coffins from Ironton’s community cemetery and left few houses unscathed; recovery is ongoing. It is not incidental that Ironton is surrounded by polluting infrastructure including the 2400-acre Phillips 66 Alliance oil refinery a grain terminal and two coal export terminals. Not far from Ironton a company called Venture Global is preparing to construct a pipeline and an export terminal Plaquemines LNG for liquified natural gas.

Oil and gas companies argue that they are legally allowed to destroy wetlands under state and federal rules put in place decades ago. Over time the fossil fuel industry has ramped up destructive practices despite knowing the severe environmental consequences; it has become a wealthy and powerful machine that can manipulate laws in its favor.

At the same time oil and gas wells and canals are sinking the Louisiana coast sea levels are rising due to climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has removed the names of 31 bodies of water from their maps of Louisiana as bayou and bay borders disappear and become open water. The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act will add another layer to these injuries by reinstating $190 million in bids from fossil fuel companies to drill in the Gulf.

At the recent COP27 climate conference one of the primary points of discussion was sourcing funding for ​“loss and damages” from climate change. Environmental leaders from across the world called on colonizing countries such as the United States and European countries to reinstate their extracted wealth to countries in the Global South who have contributed the least to climate change but are experiencing the worst impacts.

Likewise our conversations around loss and damages here in the United States must include accountability for the rich extractive polluting industry that has torn up the Louisiana coast while emphasizing a just transition. In a an essay calling for reparations from oil and gas corporations New Orleanian artist and researcher Imani Jacqueline Brown invoked the doctrine of ​“unjust enrichment:” If an entity profits by impoverishing another then these profits are unjust and must be reinstated.

In October Shell reported its second highest quarterly profit ever at $9.5 billion. Chevron made $11.2 billion and Exxon made $19.7 billion. Despite being an oil and gas state — which is supposed to mean jobs and prosperity according to fossil fuel corporations — Louisiana is the second poorest state in the United States with one of the highest racial wealth divides.

I can’t tell you in numbers the cost of a dying delta: It is invaluable and irreplaceable. I can tell you that since 1970 the oil and gas industry has raked in $52 trillion in profits or nearly $3 billion per day for the last 50 years.

The solution: It’s time for oil and gas to pay the costs. These companies owe reparations and need to forfeit their wealth.

It must be acknowledged that successful litigation and money gifts while necessary only slow or reframe the problem — they do not change the system that allowed the harm in the first place or guarantee protections from more legal extraction. Our impacted communities need financial reparations to recover from past abuse and brace for future loss and damages as we fight for systemic change. And we should treat those reparations as a means by which to end to the extractive industry once and for all. It’s too cheap for them to exploit us and even after major environmental victories they are set up to do it again.

We need true systemic change. We need Pachamama—inalienable rights of nature that safeguard our natural environments from living creatures to our water and air. And ultimately the government needs to give land back to Indigenous people so that Native communities like the Houma can protect their ancestral lands from companies that would plunder them for profit. Our future generations deserve to live on the lands of their elders and ancestors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd25jbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvcmljaG1vbmQlRTIlODAlOTlzX3RpbWVfaGFzX2NvbWUlRTIlODAlQTZhZ2FpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richmond’s Time Has Come…Again : The reimagined and revitalized Southern metropolis of our northern neighbor,"A dynamic metropolis is evolving in the former capital of the Confederacy. While there are many historic cities throughout the South Richmond in particular seems far more interested in the progressive future it’s rushing to embrace.

That was not the Richmond I knew as a high school and college student stifling in the city’s contentious racial climate and insufferable heat. I couldn’t wait to leave.

But after decades cooling off on the north slope of Grandfather Mountain return trips to see family yield a new view of Richmond. I’ve begun to enjoy my urban escapes here as much as trips to Charleston or Boston—with a distinctive best-kept secret cachet.

Derelict parts of downtown have morphed into vibrant neighborhoods with great shops galleries and breweries. Restaurants have cropped up everywhere many featuring local farm fare fresh oysters and delectable Rockfish from nearby Chesapeake Bay estuaries. Richmond has risen from the confines of old-school regionalism to a diverse and dynamic present.

Like other historic travel hotspots Richmond's culture is the main draw with far less focus on the “Lost Cause” of the Confederacy. That starts on cobblestoned Monument Avenue once so punctuated by “heroic” equestrian statues of slavery-supporting generals that in 1924 British historian John Buchanan called it “the most impressive thing I saw on the American continent.” Today those controversial gray ghosts are gone swept away after the murder of George Floyd.

Nevertheless in Richmond you’d expect to discover that virtually all of Stephen Spielberg’s 2012 biopic Lincoln was filmed there (it was) and that the lavish staircase dominating the lobby of the city’s landmark Jefferson Hotel was the inspiration for the staircase on which Clark Gable carried Vivien Leigh in the movie “Gone With the Wind.” Actually it wasn’t—but the story remains a staple of local lore.

Culture Connection

Last summer’s grand reopening of the Virginia Museum of History and Culture (VMHC) is big news. The $30 million two-year transformation reinvented what was once the Battle Abbey headquarters of the Virginia Historical Society. In its nearly 200 years the country’s oldest historical institution has evolved from a former Confederate soldiers home to one of the nation’s best history museums.

New state-of-the-art exhibits showcase one of the nation’s most historic states eclipsing its former role as a monument to the “Lost Cause.” You’ll still see the century-old recently restored memorial murals The Four Seasons of the Confederacy but now they’re insightfully interpreted.

Feet away a massive mansion beside the VMHC serves as Richmond’s newest city museum. And just beyond the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA) is one of the nation’s largest comprehensive displays. It was the first state-owned art museum in the country when it debuted in 1936 the year Washington’s National Gallery of Art opened. The VFMA’s global art collection encompasses the largest public trove of Fabergé eggs and objects outside of Russia the finest collection of Art Nouveau outside of Paris and one of the strongest assemblies of American art in the nation. A four-acre Sculpture Garden lies just below the museum's dining and drink venue Amuse.

Visitors may want to see this winter’s exhibit “Storied Strings: The Guitar in American Art” through March 19 2023 curated by Dr. Leo Mazow.

Blocks away Carytown is a district of shops restaurants (including local favorite Can Can Brasserie) and the Byrd Theater a nearly century-old landmark for movies and concerts on a massive Wurlitzer organ.

Head Downtown

Named for the fan-shaped splay of its shady townhouse-lined streets the Fan District ushers Monument Avenue into downtown past two of the city’s top lodging choices.

The 1895 Jefferson Hotel holds a towering lobby statue of Thomas Jefferson and those famous “Gone with the Wind” stairs. I can't believe I presented my first graduate school research at a symposium in the hotel just before it closed many thought forever. Today’s 5-star Historic Hotel of America defied the wrecking ball and is still home to LeMaire a cherished local restaurant (named after Étienne Lemaire Jefferson’s chef and butler).

Just past nearby magnolia sheltered mansions the Linden Row Inn is a block of imposing nineteenth century Greek Revival row houses built between 1847 and 1853. Rooms and period parlor suites flank courtyard accommodations. A raven logo adorns the Inn’s cozy eatery Parterre a nod at longtime Richmond habitué Edgar Allan Poe who lived nearby as a child and played among linden trees and roses in a garden on the property that legend has it he immortalized as “the enchanted garden” in his poem “To Helen.”

Just outside one of RVA’s many electric bike rental stations feed the city’s bike lanes. If you pedal east the street leads you just a few blocks to Virginia’s State Capitol. Lincoln visited in April 1865 while the city still smoldered from Union attacks. Start your visit to Jefferson’s imposing edifice which doubled for the US Capitol in Spielberg's movie in the underground visitor’s center. Houdin’s rotunda statue of Washington is the only one he posed for.

The once-lonely downtown strip of adjacent Broad Street no longer houses empty storefronts. Today this busy arts district is popular for its galleries the hip Quirk Hotel and streetside eateries such as Rappahannock. This gourmet regional oyster company has fresh seafood venues here on the Chesapeake in northern Virginia Charleston South Carolina and Los Angeles California.

Slip Sliding Away

Downtown dips to Richmond’s oldest cobblestone quarters with the descent from Shockoe Slip to riverside Shockoe Bottom. For hundreds of years Richmonders have stood on surrounding heights and watched floods repeatedly inundate the district. Today the river is a giver tamed by massive flood walls on both sides of the still wild roller coaster of rapids formed by the fall line of the rock studded James.

Outfitters offer kayak and raft trips but it’s the locals and visitors that make this the heart of a city immersed in water sports. Miles of hiking and mountain biking trails flank or cross the rapids on pedestrian bridges one even caps a flood wall where Legend Brewing has literally surveyed the inspiring scene since launching Virginia's microbrew industry. Raise Legend’s Raging James pilsner to salute the 2022 50th anniversary of the city’s James River Park System and support one of the country’s great urban recreation preserves.

The now-permanently dry dining and nightlife districts Shockoe Slip and Bottom are anchored by one of the country’s oldest continuous farmers markets and the city’s gingerbread Main Street train station with expanding service to Washington D.C.

Two Historic Wars…Nevermore

Looking for a place to hike and bike? One parking area near Shockoe Bottom’s warehouse loft residences beside Bookbinder’s Seafood and Steakhouse (one of RVA’s top restaurants) is the trailhead for the Virginia Capital Greenway a 50-mile jaunt to Colonial Williamsburg. On the way it passes historic riverside plantations wineries B&Bs and the Boathouse at Rockett’s Landing a popular seafood restaurant with skyline river views on the very spot where Lincoln stepped ashore to tour the defeated city and visit Jefferson Davis’s “White House of the Confederacy.”

Davis’s imposing mansion is a favorite historic stop. It's now allied with the nearby American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar. Built in the heart of Richmond’s River District on the site of a major Confederate munitions factory the Center is the nation’s premier Civil War museum. Tredegar’s exhibits fuse enslaved Confederate and Union perspectives. Also here the National Park Service’s main visitor center interprets the countless battlefields that ring Richmond. A pedestrian bridge leads to bike and hike trails on Belle Isle site of a Union prison camp during the war.

Shockoe Bottom’s wonderful Poe Museum anchors RVA’s claim to being Edgar Allan Poe’s hometown. Housed in the city’s 1736 oldest structure and a century old in 2022 the museum preserves the nation’s biggest collection of Poe memorabilia and chronicles the writer’s early life and fame—all experienced as a Richmonder. Though born in Boston in 1809 he was orphaned here in 1811 grew up worked at the Southern Literary Messenger married and gained national renown in the city. Exhibits include an 1841 copy of “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” the first detective story and the famous poem that begins “Once upon a midnight dreary.”

Just above Shockoe Bottom in the Church Hill neighborhood Patrick Henry delivered his “liberty or death” speech at Saint John’s Episcopal Church. Lincoln star Daniel Day-Lewis was fond of the informal Hill Cafe and nearby Alewife is among RVA’s best seafood spots. Richmond is a foodie’s dream and the local popularity of Happy Hour drink and dining specials can make even pricey restaurants affordable. The Poe Museum offers the discounts too but there of course they’re known as “Unhappy Hours.”

I wasn’t born in Richmond but like Poe the new RVA has become a kind of hometown for me. It’s still hot in the summer but I admit I’m proud of how cool my “hometown” has become. Back on Monument Avenue nothing has yet taken the places of the iconic horsemen who brought us “the late unpleasantness.” After years of increasingly inclusive interpretation of Richmond’s divisive past and a skyline now free of the Confederate “heroes” I grew up with my city has a new fresh feel that I like. Richmond also has a once in a century opportunity to reimagine what once was and will again surely be the grandest boulevard in the South. I’m betting it will be great."

DALLAS — Real life Homeward Bound?

That's what seems to have happened for one cute fluffy stuffed animal named Dog Dog who was dearly-missed by a young girl named Luna.

Southwest Airlines shared Dog Dog's incredible journey to be reunited with Luna who realized on a return trip home from Dallas that the furry friend was left behind. Luna's mom Jessica got in touch with Southwest Airlines and let them know Dog Dog was left in the rental car they used. A Southwest Ops Agent Christina at Dallas Love Field drove over to the rental car company and found Dog Dog so that the beloved animal wouldn't be forever lost.

Christina held onto Dog Dog and took the stuffed animal on a number of adventures keeping Dog Dog safe and sound until Luna and Jessica returned to Dallas nearly a month later to pick it up.

Christina captured Dog Dog's journey along the way with numerous photos which were shared on social media Thursday.

For weeks in 2007 he stewed about it.

At the time Mr. Schultz hadn’t been in charge of Starbucks for years and he couldn’t shake the feeling that the company was adrift. Starbucks which had long sought to bring an authentic Italian coffee experience to the masses was in his view becoming watered down and warmed over. And no feature better epitomized the decline than its breakfast sandwiches — specifically the odor they gave off when heated.

“Whatever rich hearty coffee aroma remained in the store was overwhelmed by singed Monterey Jack mozzarella and most offensively cheddar” Mr. Schultz wrote in “Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul” the second of his three memoirs. He added: “As far as I was concerned nothing could be further from the romance of the Italian espresso bar. I could not stand it.”

The following year Mr. Schultz was back and the sandwiches were on their way out. It would not be the last time Mr. Schultz came back to fix a problem at Starbucks he thought no one else could. Since then he has left and come back again for a remarkable third turn in the C.E.O.’s chair.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaW9ucHJvZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTEvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXdvcmtlcnMtZmluZC1ob3BlLWFuZC11bml0eS1pbi1hLWRpdmVyc2Utb3JnYW5pemluZy1lZmZvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks workers find hope and unity in a diverse organizing effort,"In the summer of 2017 Jimmy Greene drove westbound on one of those long stretches of Route 22 where only a few lighted road signs illuminate the darkness. It was around 4 a.m. Greene had been on the road for hours listening to music on Spotify as he returned to Pittsburgh from a wedding in Williamsport.

Somewhere along the four-lane road in a rural area in either Indiana or Westmoreland county he pulled to a stop at a red light. On the cross street he saw a small gas station with only a few pumps. Greene a Black man who identifies as queer recognized it as a place he’d never stop. He simply wouldn’t feel comfortable or safe there.

At that moment a pickup truck rolled to a stop beside him. Greene looked over. Two white men inside the truck were yelling and gesturing at him. Anger twisted the men’s faces.

Greene knew this was trouble.

• • •

During his nearly five years as a Starbucks barista Greene 36 sometimes received looks and heard comments from customers signaling that he was one of the “others” — those who don’t belong to what they consider the normal world.

He wondered what would happen if things got ugly. Would the company support him?

Greene recalls a time when a female customer made homophobic remarks to one of his co-workers. Local management banned the customer from the store but then higher management stepped in and required the local boss to apologize to the customer and extend an invitation to return.

“They threw the barista under the bus” Greene said.

Greene last worked at a Wilkins store where baristas voted in April to unionize. He and his colleagues are part of a nationwide resurgence in union activity and interest — a 2021 Gallup poll showed that 68% of Americans approve of unions. Starbucks workers are getting a lot of attention for their efforts and they’ve racked up an impressive number of wins. More than 200 stores nationwide are now unionized.

Greene spoke at a rally on Friday at the store on Downtown’s Market Square.

He took part in bargaining sessions that followed his union’s victory and was subsequently fired over a scheduling dispute. He said he was asked to work a schedule similar to the one he’d worked before experiencing health issues that caused him to take a leave of absence.

“The amount I was working is what played a role in making me take medical leave” he said. “It felt like they were trying to make me quit. I explicitly said I wasn’t quitting.”

Union organizers say dismissals over scheduling are part of a company strategy designed to stymie their efforts. Starbucks has denied charges of union-busting.

At the stoplight on Route 22 Greene tried to ignore the men directing their anger at him. He turned his head looked straight ahead and waited for the light to turn green. When it did Greene pulled away from the intersection hoping the incident would end.

It didn’t.

The driver of the pickup truck accelerated and tried to run his much smaller Honda Fit off the road. Greene pushed his gas pedal to the floor.

“It was fight or flight and I just went into flight mode” he said. “I wasn’t thinking or processing I was just going.”

He didn’t slow down until he reached the safety of Monroeville.

Greene later told his friends about the incident. “Oh that’s so terrible” they said. But then the conversation pivoted to other subjects. It seemed they didn’t perceive the threat as serious or perhaps they simply considered it an odd and isolated event. “There was a lack of urgency in their responses” Greene said.

He’s often felt as though he lived in a universe separate from everyone else. He’d hear phrases like “parental rights” and “open borders” and “low-income housing” and recognize the whispered messages meant to dehumanize entire populations to inflame others to hate.

He knew these words could eventually lead to violence. Why was no one else alarmed? Greene wondered if perhaps he was overly sensitive. “Am I crazy?” he asked.

When the killing in 2016 of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando Fla. and nine African American worshippers at a Charleston S.C. church in 2015 were described as “mass shootings” he thought no they’re terrorist attacks. People simply weren’t taking seriously the dangers of the nation’s hate-fueled far-right movement and the language it utilized to dehumanize others.

He saw that attitude change after the Jan. 6 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol. More people suddenly began taking the threat of far-right extremism seriously. “Only now do I feel people are properly responding to hatred” he said.

And he’s looking for allies especially among those who don’t have to deal with menacing stares and comments and with situations like the one he experienced on Route 22.

“People without that burden on their minds should be swooping in now to help out” he said “those who don’t have to deal with whether it’s safe to go to a drag show or to Shabbat.”

He’s found support and hope among those involved in the effort to organize Starbucks workers. It’s a young and diverse crowd and it’s taking on issues important to its members.

“Everyone fired in the Pittsburgh area is queer” he said. “Our labor trouble is also a gender equality issue. They’re all tied together.”

“It gives me a sense that there are solutions to problems even outside of Starbucks” he added. “A union is a counter to the rightward move of the country the stuff I’ve experienced. … It’s less of a burden on me. I’m defended. I have comrades now.”

Andi Boone had just started a 10-minute break from her job at a Starbucks in Cranberry in June 2020 when she received a life-changing text message. Boone learned her German shepherd Allie-bell had just given birth to a litter of pups. The news came as a shock — she was unaware of the pregnancy.

“What on earth?” she thought. “I’m a grandma.”

A friend and longtime customer named Jess had just walked out of the store so Boone ran outside to tell her the news. Jess had been trying to acquire a service dog for her daughter who struggles with autism but the cost was too high. “I’d love to have a dog like that for my daughter” Jess said.

A few days later Jess and her daughter visited Boone and met the pups. After several more visits they selected a puppy and began the process of training it as a service dog.

“I feel like I’ve made some really great connections with people” Boone said. “I see them every day sometimes multiple times a day. I get to know their lives. I’m the first person they tell their good news to.”

Boone 34 is now a shift supervisor at the Starbucks on southbound McKnight Road in Ross. She and several co-workers went on strike Oct. 24. Managers had been tipped off to the action and closed the store for the day so Boone and her co-workers stood in front of the darkened store holding signs reading “This is the last straw” and “Change is brewing.”

A key issue at the McKnight store is inadequate staffing Boone said.

“On Saturday it was bonkers” she said recently. “We were down five people. There were only two of us.”

She and a co-worker were so busy filling orders they were unable to complete the cleaning and restocking chores they normally attend to during their shifts. That work had to be done after they’d accounted for the day’s money.

“We closed at seven o’clock. At 11:15 we were still there” Boone said. “We just said we’re going to call it. We stopped. We’d been there all night.”

The October strike was a way of letting the company know such treatment of its workers is unacceptable she said.

“They might think that we’re weak and we don’t really have any power but we’re here and we’re united” Boone said. “If we just let them exploit us nothing’s going to change. So it’s just showing them that we’re not afraid to rock the boat a little bit to try to get what we want.”

Brett Taborelli a 29-year-old Starbucks worker fired after the organizing campaign in Wilkins joined Boone and her co-workers on the McKnight Road picket line. He worked for the company for eight years before being terminated. Starbucks cited issues with scheduling.

Like Boone Taborelli treasured those who came to buy coffee.

“We love our customers to an extent that’s crazy” he said. “I don’t have a huge family presence being that I’m queer. I struggled growing up with my family.”

His job gave him opportunities to feel welcomed in the families of others. Customers invited him to Christmas holidays Thanksgiving dinners and even funerals.

“I started here because as a queer person it’s really hard to find a safe environment to work in” and Starbucks felt like a safe place Taborelli said. “When you go into a Starbucks you see so many different demographics of people. And that was so inviting for me.”

“We see ourselves in the people we work with. We hold that really close and dear. That sense of creating a community within a community is really important to us because a lot of us didn’t have that” he continued. “And so when we see it and we feel it when we hold it so dear and we try to bring things up like safety concerns and the company refuses to acknowledge it that’s hurtful.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTEzMzM4My93aGF0LW1ha2VzLXRoZS1zdGFyYnVja3MtcmVzZXJ2ZS1sYXR0ZS1kaWZmZXJlbnQtZnJvbS1hLXJlZ3VsYXItb25lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Makes The Starbucks Reserve Latte Different From A Regular One?,"What Makes The Starbucks Reserve Latte Different From A Regular One?

Starbucks fans flock to stores over and over again for its unique lineup of hot drinks. But the coffee giant offers one particularly unique line and there's a chance you might not have heard of it before. Introducing Starbucks Reserve: The line that's specially designed to be a high-end java iconoclast. CEO Howard Schultz introduced the ""Roastery"" concept in 2017 then opened the doors to the first brick-and-mortar location in 2018 says NBC News.

Today Starbucks has dedicated Reserve Roasteries in operation in six major cities around the world: New York City Seattle Chicago Tokyo Shanghai and Milan. But according to the Starbucks Reserve website select beverages made with Reserve espresso are also sold at over 1500 regular Starbucks locations.

When beans arrive at Starbucks Reserve Roasteries they're still green — totally unroasted. In fact the NYC Roastery located in Manhattan's Chelsea Market is home to a 30-foot hammered copper roasting cask. It cranks out more than 1.5 million pounds of beans every single year making it the largest coffee roasting plant in Manhattan — and every Starbucks Roastery location is outfitted with a custom roasting cask. But what makes Reserve different from normal espresso? And what makes the Starbucks Reserve latte different from a regular one?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWJhcmlzdGFzLWN1c3RvbWVyLWhhYml0cy1hbm5veS1wZXQtcGVldmVzLWhvbGlkYXlzLTIwMjItMTLSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3N0YXJidWNrcy1iYXJpc3Rhcy1jdXN0b21lci1oYWJpdHMtYW5ub3ktcGV0LXBlZXZlcy1ob2xpZGF5cy0yMDIyLTEyP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks baristas share their biggest customer pet peeves,"It's red-cup season. While many customers are cheerful and respectful this time of year some are guilty of these pet peeves. Starbucks

Insider asked current and former Starbucks baristas what annoys them the most on the job.

They shared five customer pet peeves including not cleaning up your cups or utensils.

Another pet peeve is blaming product shortages on the barista when they can't control it.

Red-cup season at Starbucks is well underway and holiday cheer has begun to fire on all cylinders. The signature reusable cup started out as a marketing tool and now nearly everyone on the planet looks forward to its release as the mark of the start of the holiday season — even baristas.

""Love red-cup season"" Tayla a former Starbucks barista who's based in the UK told Insider. ""Festive drinks are all super simple to make and spirits are lifted.""

While many memories from seasons past are holly and jolly for baristas some are a bit grinchy — and they don't have to be. Insider spoke with three current and former Starbucks baristas about their biggest customer pet peeves and what customers can do to make the holiday season more cheerful. (The baristas asked to omit their last names for privacy and professional reasons but Insider has verified their identities and employment with documentation.)

1. Blaming your barista for shortages

It's super frustrating when your favorite item is amiss as a result of supply-chain issues. But some customers direct those strong feelings toward their baristas.

Tayla said that product shortages tend to bring out the sensitive and aggressive side of customers. ""We'd once ran out of a particular bagel"" she said. ""One woman was very unhappy about the situation. She tried to get her order for free as a result but fortunately I was able to hand her over to my manager.""

When customer frustrations reach a boiling point baristas said they're trained to roll with the situation and offer alternative beverage suggestions or explain to the customer how supply-chain problems continue to be an issue. Rather than having a pout or tossing around complaints about missing menu items baristas ask that customers navigate the scenario with a bit of grace.

2. Ignoring the tip jar

If a server or barista goes the extra mile it seems like a common courtesy to offer something on top of that $5 cup of coffee. Unfortunately some baristas have found that tipping at Starbucks is a courtesy that's not so common.

""Sometimes a customer buys $15 worth of drinks pays with a $20 and tells us to keep the change"" Jack an Indiana-based barista told Insider. ""The customer calls it doing his part.""

Baristas also have the ability to try and sway some extra tips their way by placing clever voting-themed tip jars out on the coffee counter. Some folks who stumble upon these tip jars laugh and throw a bit of extra change their way but for the most part Jack said these jars go unnoticed.

3. Ordering something complicated then not picking it up right away

Two baristas said that customers ordering complicated drinks is a big pet peeve.

""People that order all kinds of amendments to their drinks where the beverage doesn't even resemble the starting drink are not ideal"" Meg a former barista from downtown Indianapolis said.

""Any hot day sun's out Frappuccino's out"" Tayla added. ""Frappuccinos take so long to make and you usually get soaked in the process."" If you're ordering something complicated they said be ready to hear your name called and pick it up — no one likes to see a hot drink go lukewarm at the end of the coffee bar especially a barista.







4. Correcting the spelling of your name

Speaking of your name Tayla said don't correct the spelling if a barista gets it wrong on your cup. ""It's all part of the fun.""

5. Not cleaning up your mess

Tayla said messy customers are a pain — for example if they stick a muffin in their coffee cup and leave it out for a store worker to pick up. ""They are horrific to clean"" she said.

""Just be nice. Clean up your trash"" Meg added. ""Don't leave your cups for others to discard and don't leave your wrappers napkins and stir sticks to be your barista's problem. If you have difficulty locating the trash feel free to ask your barista.""

All of the baristas that spoke with Insider agreed that mean customers were few and far between when compared to the kind ones. They also said that at the end of the day they enjoyed their jobs.

""I did love working at Starbucks"" Tayla said. ""The community behind the bar was always lovely and in my experience so were most of the customers."""

The victory gave Minnesota (14-3-2 13-1-2 WCHA) a two-game sweep of the home-and-home series against the Huskies (11-10-0 6-10-0).

The Gophers stretched their winning streak to four games.

For months Republicans have been attacking ESG the financial shorthand for how some companies consider all the ways the environment social issues and corporate governance impact their bottom line. One of the GOP’s recent targets is BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager which oversees some $8 trillion in assets as a symbol of the financial community’s growing recognition that climate change is too big to ignore.

Republican leaders call the business world’s recognition of climate science a symptom of “wokeism.” In a white paper released this week the Republican minority on the Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs recently called out the “big three” firms BlackRock Vanguard and States Street “as our new emperors” taking issue with their involvement in a non-binding coalition that supports reaching a portfolio of net-zero emissions by 2050.

“The conclusions are built on flawed premises and risk harming millions of everyday investors that rely on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to help them retire with dignity” BlackRock said in response to the GOP’s report.

ESG may be the right’s new boogeyman but it’s a misunderstood concept that has been around for a long time; in 2004 the UN secretary-general challenged financial institutions to better account for environmental social and corporate governance issues. But ESG gained visibility in the past few years especially after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink penned a letter to CEOs in 2021 urging ESG as the future.

ESG is not a regulation or a set of rules and it does not require any real action from a corporation. It’s mostly used as a catch-all term for any investment that considers social and environmental responsibility. In fact what counts as ESG is so ill-defined and malleable it has been criticized as a way to “greenwash” corporate actions.

One of the defining ideas of ESG is that a company is better off accounting and reporting environmental and social risks to investors and clients rather than being willfully blind to the world around it. This can include a broad swath of issues such as a company’s reliance on oil gas and coal or exposure to sea-level rise in coastal operations human rights violations of the countries it operates in and lack of board diversity and CEO transparency. A big part of the ESG movement at least right now is largely about disclosure of these potential bottom-line risks in the future not necessarily doing anything differently in the present.

But Republican officials in West Virginia Texas Louisiana Missouri and now Florida have withdrawn billions of dollars from BlackRock’s management. Proponents are planning to introduce a slew of bills in at least 15 states next year to divest pensions and boycott companies for considering sustainability as an aim. At the federal level House GOP lawmakers are preparing antitrust investigations.

To get to the bottom of what is driving this I spoke to one of the state officials leading the attack on ESG Riley Moore state treasurer of West Virginia. The way he sees it “banks are coercing capital away” from coal gas and oil industries. He explains he doesn’t want the coal- and gas-reliant state to contract its financial services with a company that is “trying to diminish those dollars. They want less coal mining they want less fracking.”

This is getting much bigger than BlackRock State Street and Vanguard companies that used to be solidly at the right of corporate America. There are real stakes for pensioners red-state taxpayers and the wider economy if the GOP succeeds in scaring off financial institutions from pursuing climate targets.

ESG isn’t woke but it is evidence of the free market at work

The backlash began early in 2021 when three events sent the signal that ESG was here to stay. The first was Larry Fink’s embrace of ESG noting in his 2021 letter that “No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients’ lists of priorities. They ask us about it nearly every day.” The second came in March when the Biden administration proposed a regulation to require climate risk disclosure from publicly traded companies parallel to rules being adopted by the European Union. The third and final was an unlikely coup staged at the annual Exxon shareholder board meeting.

Last year Engine No. 1 a small hedge fund earned enough votes to gain three Exxon board seats despite the company’s recommendation against it. It wouldn’t have been possible without the support of Exxon’s three largest shareholders BlackRock Vanguard and State Street voting representing 20 percent of the voting share. The new board members’ mission was focused on understanding the risks climate change and regulation will pose to the company.

The win was the clearest sign yet that there was a realignment happening in financial markets and that even the fossil fuel industry couldn’t ignore the effects of climate change. Investors as the Engine No. 1 win showed are already clamoring for this kind of information. The assets BlackRock handles far outnumber what Republicans could divest. For example two-thirds of BlackRock’s largest clients in its strategic partner program representing assets over $3 trillion support the energy transition according to BlackRock. ESG isn’t going away — by 2025 global ESG assets are expected to make up a third of all projected assets under management — and it keeps growing. ESG funds are also now packaged for retail use like for retirement savings.

On the left ESG has for years come under criticism as a form of greenwashing and ESG disclosure isn’t the same thing as corporate behavior. As Harvard Business Review noted the funding in ESG is “dedicated to assuring returns for shareholders not delivering positive planetary impact.” Many environmentalists think ESG is a distraction from the main issue they’d like to see traction on: companies disclosing the impact their products and investments have on the world around them and accounting for that in decisions.

ESG doesn’t go this far. In no way will disclosure be enough to save the planet from climate change. There are no binding requirements either. But what Republican critics of ESG really fear is that the financial world will realign with climate science and no longer see new coal plants and offshore drilling as viable projects to finance.

Many of the Republican attacks on ESG stem from a misrepresentation of what it actually means. It’s not always motivated by an altruistic climate or social agenda. ESG also helps banks and public companies meet their one goal by screening investments for various risks. “They’ve got a fiduciary duty to generate returns. So they’re not going to impose some agenda whether it’s climate or social agenda that’s going to get in the way of returns” said University of Oxford business expert Robert Eccles.

As baseless as the attacks have been the pressure could still work. Vanguard on Wednesday announced it is withdrawing from the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition in which companies voluntarily committed to reaching net-zero emissions in their portfolios by 2050. In an apparent nod to the ongoing GOP’s investigations Vanguard said it withdrew “so that we can provide the clarity our investors desire about the role of index funds and about how we think about material risks including climate-related risks — and to make clear that Vanguard speaks independently on matters of importance to our investors.”

The right’s baffling one-year campaign against ESG

After Engine No. 1’s coup the attacks started to crystallize from the right spearheaded by conservative advocacy circles. There have been two groups at the center of these attacks both supported by the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo who led the right’s legal strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade. Those groups Consumers Research and State Financial Officers Foundation are conservative nonprofits also funded by groups with anonymous funding.

These groups’ involvement suggests a deep-pocketed campaign. “This is an artificially created conversation topic that’s not being led by financial stakeholders. It’s political stakeholders that are driving this forward” said Jacey Bingler senior communications campaigner of the climate finance advocacy group Sunrise Project.

There have been four main prongs to the right’s strategy. Republicans plan to undertake antitrust investigations next year at the state and federal levels against these giant corporations. Just before the election Senate Republicans sent a letter to top law firms warning of investigations around ESG claiming they suspect collusion. The second is what states like West Virginia and Florida have already done: pulling their state operating funds from BlackRock and other banks’ management.

The final two prongs are considered potentially the most damaging to taxpayers and pensioners in red states. One is the model bill that is circulating in red states called the State Government Employee Retirement Protection Act. It divests teachers police officers state-employed nurses and other employees’ pensions from companies that are on a boycott list. Eventually experts worry this ban could mean the pensions are overweighted in fossil fuels and less diverse leaving the people depending on their retirement subject to more market volatility.

The final tactic is a boycott list where the state only seeks contracts with financing from companies that do not consider climate change in their calculations. Practically speaking that means if a state wants to build a highway and needs financing it could wind up being charged higher fees because there is less need for those banks to compete with better deals.

The ESG backlash is an extension of the right’s ideological schism on climate change

It’s not clear what’s motivating this new front in the GOP’s culture wars. It’s not a winning political issue given that most voters aren’t familiar with terms like ESG nor is ESG a top priority of the climate movement.

There’s another theory though. “It’s intended to delay climate action without having to admit that that’s what they’re attempting to do” Sunrise’s Bingler said. “Republicans have essentially created a new installment in this culture war where they tend to pick relatively niche topics that don’t necessarily resonate with large parts of society without this artificial attempt to continue to fan the flames.”

For over a decade the main plank of the GOP has ignored climate science cycling through various excuses not to take action on greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the electorate thinks climate change is real and is concerned to some degree about it and rising extreme weather is making it more undeniable.

But many Republican leaders don’t recognize that science. West Virginia’s treasurer Moore is one of them.

“You’re talking about climate changing you know in 100 years” he said. “I mean these folks are hedging on what the climate might look like in 100 years. Tell me exactly for a pension beneficiary who is going to retire in the next 10 years how carbon emissions is going to affect the financial outcomes and vitality of a given publicly traded company.”

“So what you’re telling me is you’re going to have sea levels rise by X amount of centimeters in 100 years and that somehow is going to affect the profitability of a company?” he continued. “Not sure I follow that.”

Climate activists — and even some investors — have said that the GOP pushback against ESG is a political issue not primarily an economic one. There’s also no clear anti-ESG consensus among typical allies of Republicans; the Kentucky Bankers Association in November sued the state attorney general for overstepping his authority by demanding documents related to ESG.

So the issue’s salience in the next two years will depend entirely on how it resonates with voters and potentially factors into the presidential election. Many experts were skeptical it could ever gain political relevance but still worry what the endgame is. Does this mean a future of “blue banks” and “red banks”? Will financial behemoths be frightened into weakening already-weak climate targets? It’s too early to say.

But the right’s war on banks won’t necessarily drive a back-pedaling on climate goals. BlackRock has tempered its interest in climate publicly since the ESG attacks began but other institutions have pushed ahead.

“Market participants will continue to demand ESG data and incorporate it in risk models” said Ivan Frishberg chief sustainability officer of Amalgamated Bank a bank with a socially responsible mission. “That is capitalism doing what it does best: seeking more data for better client responsiveness and a more systemic view. The pushback on ESG is essentially a denial of capitalism. Ultimately our clients are going to drive the products and approaches we take and guide how we respond as a firm.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYm9iZWNjbGVzLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvYS1zdWdnZXN0ZWQtdGFyZ2V0LWZvci1ob3VzZS1oZWFyaW5ncy1vbi1lc2ctbmV4dGVyYS1lbmVyZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Suggested Corporate Target For House Hearings On ESG: NextEra Energy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobeccles/2022/12/10/a-suggested-target-for-house-hearings-on-esg-nextera-energy/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYm9iZWNjbGVzLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvYS1zdWdnZXN0ZWQtdGFyZ2V0LWZvci1ob3VzZS1oZWFyaW5ncy1vbi1lc2ctbmV4dGVyYS1lbmVyZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

WAFB reported that an in-flight malfunction required an emergency landing at the base located near Knob Noster.

Upon landing a fire broke out on the B-2 prompting the WAFB fire department to respond and extinguish the blaze.

No injuries were reported during the incident but the aircraft was reportedly damaged.

Whiteman issued a ""NOTAM"" Saturday night at 11 p.m.

The emergency landing caused damage to Runway 1/19 and remains closed until Dec. 16.

An investigation is on-going.

The 509th Bomb Wing Public Affairs office issued the following statement:

""A U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit experienced an in-flight malfunction during routine operations today and was damaged on the runway at Whiteman Air Force Base after it successfully completed an emergency landing. There were no personnel injuries. There was a fire associated with the aircraft after landing and the base fire department extinguished the fire. The incident is under investigation.""

Whiteman produced a video released Nov. 7 showcasing the readiness of the 20-bomber fleet and the airmen who are responsible for the program which first arrived at the mid-Missouri base Dec. 17 1993.

The U.S. Air Force on Dec. 2 publicly unveiled the B-21 Raider the first new long-range strike bomber in a generation and an aircraft specifically designed to be the multifunctional backbone of the modernized bomber fleet according to WAFB.

The next-generation stealth plane looks very similar to the B-2 but will reportedly be capable of flying without a crew on board.

While the B-21 isn’t expected to be operational and introduced into service for several more years the formal unveiling ceremony hosted by Northrop Grumman Corporation at its production facilities in California is a significant milestone in the Air Force’s effort to modernize combat capabilities Whiteman said.

The B-21 is designed to be a more capable and adaptable state-of-the-art aircraft that will gradually replace the aging B-1 Lancer and B-2 Spirit bombers now in service.

While the precise date when the B-21 will enter service is unknown basing decisions have been made. Ellsworth AFB South Dakota will become the first Main Operating Base and formal training unit for the B-21.

Whiteman AFB Missouri and Dyess AFB Texas are the preferred locations for the remaining home bases. Each will receive aircraft as they become available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd2Nyei5jb20vcmVudC1pbmRvb3Itc2FsdHdhdGVyLXBvb2wtYnVydG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Escape the Winter Blues Renting This Burton Indoor Pool Oasis,"As the temperatures drop most of us start dreaming once again of those warm summer days relaxing by the pool.

The Dell PowerEdge XE9680 finally allows the company to offer a legitimate high-end AI training platform to its customers. In a blue-lit corner of SC22 the huge system was on display for all to see.

Dell PowerEdge XE9680 8x NVIDIA H100 Drops EMC and Finally Covers AI

Here is the 6U server from Dell. One can see that we have the main server on the top of the chassis. This system has dual 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and 16x DDR5 DIMMs/ CPU for 32 total. One can also see the 10x front PCIe Gen5 slots.

This side view is interesting for two reasons. First we can clearly see Dell continue its design of offering what is essentially an integrated disaggregated chassis. Most other vendors in the market square off chassis for this class of device. Dell shows that it has a server and a PCIe/ accelerator portion of the server by making the chassis depth different depending on which portion you are looking at. Dell has effectively taken a disaggregated server and an acceleration box and integrated the two. Just based on industry trends and the strange chassis design this is fun to see Dell do something different. At the same time it is similar to the Dell EMC PowerEdge XE8545 we reviewed.

The other great thing that we see is that this is the “Dell PowerEdge XE9680” not the “Dell EMC PowerEdge XE9680.” Dell is finally after six years dropping the “EMC” from its naming convention.

The rear of the system is full of fan modules both from the 10x fan modules on the bottom to the 6x PSUs on the top of the chassis.

Atop the system is the 8x NVIDIA H100 board. In the previous generation A100 series also supported by this platform we called this the “Delta” platform while the 4x A100 assembly was the “Redstone” platform. In the H100 generation these are now called Delta-Next and Redstone-Next. The XE9680 supports both Delta and Delta-Next using air cooling at up to 500W for the A100 and 700W for the H100.

Dell is going to continue supporting Redstone-Next but it was great to see the Delta-Next H100 platform.

Final Words

This server may not seem like a huge deal to many of our readers. Afterall we have reviewed several 8x A100 “Delta” platforms over the years and seen many H100 Delta-Next platforms already launched. The reason the PowerEdge XE9680 is such an important moment in the market is that Dell has finally decided it is time to compete in the high-end AI market. Along with NVIDIA’s enterprise software push Dell can now sell additional software and support along with the AI training hardware to higher-margin customers. Many companies that utilize a lot of AI compute find that it is much less expensive to house clusters in a colocation facility than use cloud resources. Now Dell’s customers do not need to buy Supermicro NVIDIA DGX or another brand of training server for AI workload they can instead just buy PowerEdge.

Most server vendors tell us that they are expecting the PCIe to OAM/SXM mix to be around 50-50 soon so Dell needed this product line. It is great to see Dell finally start offering high-end AI training servers. Now we just want to see the company’s OAM platforms since that is becoming an industry trend and companies like HPE Lenovo Inspur and Supermicro already are selling OAM-based solutions.

While this has pulled back recently - it reminds me of a lesson from the great trader William O'Neil and his lesson for the ""WALL OF BLUE"" 🟦



Not many know this rule so hope you like it!



Wall of blue rule states that when you have 4+ weeks of blue volume bars (blue volume bars = volume when the week close up hence up weeks) then this is a buy signal of itself.



In the case of $SMCI we also have above average volume - which is additional strength and confirmation.

This is a signal that the stock is under heavy accumulation from institutions and hence why it made +83% advancement.



Now it is pulling back and it is extended from any base - so I would not touch it here but it is a good example to illustrate the rule",,,,,,,,,

Why it matters ISPs are perpetually among the industries that US consumers complain about most. Increased competition and more options mean better choices for you.

T-Mobile released a new study on Wednesday that touts the progress of its T-Mobile Home Internet with consumers but also speaks to the greater impact of 5G fixed wireless (including competitor Verizon 5G Home Internet) on getting more people connected across the US.

Leaning on its proprietary data and info from OpenVault and Leichtman Research T-Mobile said that its home internet service has already garnered more than 2 million customers. In the last year 78% of the 3.28 million US broadband net adds belong to T-Mobile and Verizon.

It's not shocking that customers would flock to newer options. We noted over the summer that when the American Customer Satisfaction Index released its 2022 report on ISPs the industry had dropped to dead last among all US fields with ISPs falling beneath even gas stations and social media.

Locating local internet providers

Poor customer satisfaction is a big driver for T-Mobile's aggressive courting of customers. One of its taglines is ""Take a bite out of Big Internet."" But T-Mobile also asked its customers for specific reasons why they switched to 5G internet. Over 58% listed a lower price as the main driver while 41% liked that there's no annual contract obligation. Perhaps most interestingly over a third of its customers said that simply having a new option available was a key driver in their decision to switch.

T-Mobile's study shows that 51% of its more than 2 million Home Internet customers are ditching cable internet providers. T-Mobile

All this comes less than a month after Consumer Reports released a year-long broadband costs study. The conclusion was that more competition is necessary to give US consumers adequate choices and options for internet access. Now the arrival of this T-Mobile study essentially drills the point home.

Locating local internet providers

""Fixed wireless is disrupting a historically broken broadband industry offering choice and competition at a time when consumers need it most"" Mike Katz chief marketing officer at T-Mobile said in a statement.

T-Mobile's report also highlights the expectation that 5G fixed wireless consumption will continue to expand with T-Mobile and Verizon expected to garner between 11 million to 13 million customers by 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY3JhY2tiZXJyeS5jb20vbWludC1tb2JpbGUtYmVzdC1jZWxsdWxhci1wcm92aWRlci0yMDIyLW93bmVkLXJ5YW4tcmV5bm9sZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mint Mobile is the best cellular provider of 2022 — this is why,"We may earn a commission for purchases using our links. Learn more. I'm a HUGE fan of the actor and Canadian national treasure Ryan Reynolds a.k.a. @VanCityReynolds. If you don't like Ryan Reynolds honestly there's probably something wrong with you and you should get checked out by a head doctor. He's just so damn likable. Not liking Ryan Reynolds would be like saying you don't like puppies or kittens. (He's a handsome devil too.) I think one of the reasons I like Ryan Reynolds so much is because he reminds me of … me! I mean CrackBerry Kevin is basically the Winnipeg version of Vancouver's hometown boy Reynolds … you know just not as talented not as good looking or charismatic definitely not as funny or witty not as rich not as successful of an entrepreneur … oh wait. Yeah maybe scratch that last part ...

CrackBerry Kevin and Ryan Reynolds are basically brothers from another mother ... right?!

Well there are two areas where I actually kind of am like Ryan Reynolds. For one my wife is also gorgeous — I'm still not sure how I pulled that off. And two while Ryan Reynolds now owns Mint Mobile I feel like I played a meaningful part in the company becoming something Reynolds wanted to buy and own (true story!). Between that and watching Ryan as a teenage actor in the CBC kids' show ""The Odyssey"" every week (I only had three channels to watch growing up in a rural town) I think that kinda makes us like brothers from another mother. Right?! Right. So while Mint Mobile truly deserves to be named one of CrackBerry's Top 22 Favorite Tech Things of 2022 due to the awesome value it continues to bring customers for premium wireless coverage the other reason the company earned this accolade is that I'm hoping Ryan or somebody from his team reads this and decides they should attend our CrackBerry relaunch party in Vegas at CES this coming January. Or if he can't make it in person maybe he'll cut us a sponsorship cheque (that's Canadian for check which Ryan will appreciate) and we'll ring in the New Year and our CrackBerry relaunch with a thank you to Sir Reynolds (I'm sure he'll get knighted once Wrexham AFC wins a championship). Joking aside I do love Mint Mobile. And whenever I head to the U.S. for longer trips I get a Mint Mobile plan and toss the SIM in one of my phones. The day Mint Mobile gets to Canada I'll ditch Rogers. Canada's wireless game is a bit of a high-priced sham though so it'll be a while before that happens. If you're Canadian and want Mint Mobile in Canada head to MintMobile.ca to find the details to contact the politicians you need to start harassing. Seriously. Do it!

Mint Mobile has always offered amazing value

Mint Mobile is known as an MVNO or mobile virtual network operator which means the company doesn't actually own the cell towers and network it runs on but rather it bulk-buys excess network capacity and then sells it to its own customers. In the case of Mint Mobile's network it runs on the back of T-Mobile's nationwide network in the U.S. What's always made Mint Mobile amazing — outside of their cute fox mascot and Ryan Reynolds — has been its approach which is ultra clever. Mint Mobile combines a few basic business and marketing concepts to offer low-cost data plans with unlimited talk and text. Those concepts include: 1. Mint is online-only With no physical stores to operate the company saves on overhead which helps them keep costs down. 2. You can bring your own phone While you can buy new phones through Mint Mobile you don't have to. They're happy to just send you the SIM card to toss into your existing smartphone. 3. Like Costco they get you to buy data in bulk The savings go up as you buy more data. 4. They get you to prepay Prepay for six or even 12 months at a time and your monthly average cost gets driven way down. Right now Mint has a holiday promotion that's pretty much a no-brainer where you can get a six-month plan for the cost of three months.

The CrackBerry / Mint Mobile connection While Ryan Reynolds became an owner of Mint Mobile in November 2019 Mobile Nations (my former company that owned CrackBerry Android Central iMore and Windows Central) started talking to Mint Mobile in 2016 and we began working with them in 2017 when we were the company's first digital content marketing partner. We got along great with Mint Mobile's chief marketing officer and team and we put a ton of effort into driving awareness and education around their offerings which worked out well for both parties. Mint Mobile was an important partner to us and we could see that a lot of our audience became loyal customers so it was a good fit. The only bummer is that Ryan Reynolds only started to get involved with Mint Mobile as I left Future PLC (the company that bought Mobile Nations) in early 2020 so I didn't get to meet or work with Ryan which would have been awesome! Maybe we would have even been besties by this point ... Mint Mobile always has fun ads I'm just going to embed some Mint Mobile ads here because they're so fun and worth watching.

Help Ryan Reynolds buy the Ottawa Senators NHL team Ryan Reynolds wants to buy a hockey team. Specifically he wants to buy the Ottawa Senators. This makes this whole Canada/CrackBerry/BlackBerry/Mint Mobile story come full circle. Funny enough the last Canadian mobile entrepreneur who made headlines for wanting to buy a hockey team was BlackBerry's Co-CEO Jim Balsillie! In that case Jim was a bit of a possessed outlaw who wanted to buy the Phoenix Coyotes and move them to Hamilton Ontario.

On Dec. 8 the carrier began offering a ""very limited time"" deal through which existing T-Mobile users can add its 5G Home Internet service for $25 per month the carrier has confirmed to CNET. The deal will be available to all T-Mobile customers with at least one voice line so long as they don't already have or haven't recently had Home Internet service.

In May T-Mobile introduced a bundle of its Home Internet offering and premium Magenta Max plan that when combined would lower the Home Internet price from $50 per month to $30 per month so long as you had at least two voice lines. This new deal not only does not require Magenta Max or two voice lines but would also be even cheaper at $25 per month.

As with T-Mobile's existing Home Internet service those who sign up for the $25 rate won't be beholden to data caps contracts or additional taxes or fees. That $25 price would also fall under T-Mobile's ""Price Lock"" promise which protects against rate hikes.

Locating local internet providers

If you are stuck in a contract with a different internet provider T-Mobile is willing to give you up to $750 in early termination fees to help you cover the costs of switching to them up from the carrier's previous offer of ""up to $500."" The carrier offers a ""Test Drive"" for the Home Internet service that lets you try it out for 15 days and if you are not happy with it get your money back.

Existing T-Mobile Home Internet customers including those on the Magenta Max bundle are not eligible for this deal. Those looking to take advantage of the offer also would need to have not had T-Mobile Home Internet for at least 30 days.

Locating local internet providers

Those interested in T-Mobile Home Internet can enter their address at the carrier's website to see if it is available in your area.

After earlier telling CNET that multiple lines on an account could sign up for the offer -- such as a family plan where not everyone still lives together -- the carrier said on Wednesday that the deal will be limited to one Home Internet line per account.

The new deal is the latest play by the carrier to build on its Home Internet business. T-Mobile has made the service a focal point of its 2022 offerings including a Super Bowl ad in February and an expansion to 40 million households in September. The moves appear to have been working as the carrier revealed in October that it added around half a million Home Internet customers in its most recent quarter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvYmxhY2hvd2ljenMtdWZjLXRpdGxlLWJvdXQtd2l0aC1hbmthbGFldi1lbmRzLXNwbGl0LWRyYXctMjAyMi0xMi0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Light heavyweight title bout at UFC 282 ends in split draw,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/blachowiczs-ufc-title-bout-with-ankalaev-ends-split-draw-2022-12-11/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvYmxhY2hvd2ljenMtdWZjLXRpdGxlLWJvdXQtd2l0aC1hbmthbGFldi1lbmRzLXNwbGl0LWRyYXctMjAyMi0xMi0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbW1hanVua2llLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2phbi1ibGFjaG93aWN6LXZzLW1hZ29tZWQtYW5rYWxhZXYtYXQtdWZjLTI4Mi1iZXN0LXBob3Rvc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UFC 282 photo gallery: Jan Blachowicz vs. Magomed Ankalaev,"Want the latest news and insights in MMA?

Worried about a recession in 2023? No wonder. The ""R"" word has been pumped on media outlets as 2022 draws to a close. With inflation still running hot there's worry that what has been a resilient consumer up to this point could finally tighten up on spending and induce an economic downturn.

But even among consumer goods stocks there's a way to play defense: luxury brands. Realistically recessions have a much lower impact on wealthy households so popular high-end goods tend to continue performing pretty well -- especially if the recession is mild as is broadly expected next year. If you're looking to play defense with your consumer discretionary stocks you can put the rich to work in your portfolio and profit.

With that in mind LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY -0.35%) Tapestry (TPR -0.74%) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU 0.00%) are three luxury stocks that could thrive even if a recession strikes in 2023.

LVMH: Good news for the world's largest house of luxury brands

The world's largest luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton was already having a pretty decent 2022. Through the first nine months of the year revenue across all five of its segments (wine and spirits fashion and leather perfumes and cosmetics watches and jewelry and selective retailing) grew at a strong double-digit pace. Overall sales jumped 28% compared to 2021 to 56.5 billion euros a new record as LVMH's 75 ""maisons"" fully recovered from pandemic lockdowns and then some.

In a sign of just how well things have been going LVMH co-founder and CEO Bernard Arnault and family have retaken the ""world's richest person"" spot from Elon Musk according to the Forbe's Billionaire List.

Will the good times keep strutting down the runway for LVMH though? It seems they certainly could in part because of a development in Asia. After social unrest China is ending parts of its ""zero-COVID"" policy a strict set of rules that have sunk the most populous country's economy. Not incidentally China is the second-largest market for luxury goods accounting for tens of billions of dollars in spending in normal times. There's optimism that some normalcy might be coming back.

As of this writing LVMH stock trades for 26 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. If double-digit sales and earnings growth continue -- and according to management's commentary they could -- it isn't an unreasonable price tag.

Tapestry: An American luxury icon making a comeback

I'll admit I used to follow Tapestry -- the parent organization of Coach Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman -- much more closely. But it fell off my radar as Coach (the original corporate name before the rebrand to Tapestry) had a messy go of things integrating its acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman (2015) and Kate Spade (2017). Shares have underperformed the market as a result.

Tapestry has rebounded nicely from an early pandemic slump though and sales are actually at all-time highs. For fiscal 2023 management is expecting a slight decline off of these highs due to a record run-up in the U.S. dollar (which lowers the value of international sales when converted back into dollars for financial reporting).

However in spite of this challenge earnings per share are expected to rise in the mid-single-digit percentage range this year helped by an estimated $700 million in share repurchases. And much like LVMH Coach will also see some lift if China's zero-COVID policies help the economy recover again.

In all this iconic American leather designer is in decent shape right now. And while earnings growth may not be much to show off to your friends Tapestry stock looks cheap at less than 12 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. Who knew a leather handbag (stock) could be so affordable? If you're looking for a solid luxury retailer to help weather challenging times Tapestry could be your ticket.

Lululemon: Part luxury part everyday comfort for the active enthusiast

Perhaps Lululemon doesn't spring to mind as a house of ""luxury."" Yet I'd argue luxury is more than price (though a pair of women's yoga leggings are easily over $100 but I digress). Luxury is about comfort as much as it is a symbol of how much money can be blown on superfluous items. And in that department Lululemon excels.

The blend of high-end activewear and comfort is clearly winning over fans. To wit Lululemon just released Q3 2022 earnings and revenue was up a sizzling 28% year-over-year driven by an impressive 22% increase in comparable sales (a blend of foot and web traffic and average customer ticket). International revenue jumped 41% in the quarter as Lululemon stretches its reach outside of its core North American market. China's reopening could help this metric continue running hot too.

One of my favorite things about Lululemon's business model though is its robust profit margins. Its Q3 operating margin was 19%. A typical clothing retailer is doing well if it puts up high-single-digit or low-teens operating margins. Often running close to or over 20% in recent years Lululemon's lucrative profitability is further proof this is a luxury brand at heart -- but one finding more mass appeal.

The shares did take a slight dip after the last earnings update due to weaker-than-expected Q4 guidance. Management thinks revenue will increase ""only"" 25% year-over-year. This is likely just a cool down as the stock has rallied more than 20% the last couple of months. Lululemon currently trades for 37 times expected adjusted earnings per share for 2022 a premium price tag. But for a company that has consistently grown as fast as this one the last few years it could be a worthwhile purchase here.

Recession or not Lululemon is clearly doing something right that's resonating with its patrons.",,,,,,,,,,,,

These measures significantly expand the ability of BIS to curtail technology transfer by end-use to China.

Markets responded in kind with billions of dollars wiped from equities in integrated circuits (IC) and wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) — a segment dominated by US companies like Applied Materials KLA and Lam Research. BIS scrambled to clarify various legal ambiguities and it is increasingly clear that the fabs manufacturing less sophisticated ‘legacy nodes’ are relatively unaffected. US Korean and Taiwanese firms with chip manufacturing facilities in China have also secured temporary one-year licenses to use US technologies at these sites.

But the respite may be temporary. In mid-November US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dispatched her undersecretary to the Netherlands and Japan to urge them to take further action. It is unknown whether these countries — specialists in the lithography process a crucial step in IC production — will agree to US requests.

It is difficult to ascertain what more the Biden administration can demand from its allies. Their dual-use lists already include relevant lithography equipment. Export controls are already subject to treaty commitments and close coordination between the United States Japan and European Union (EU) member states. The Netherlands also denies export licences on any Extreme UV (EUV) that is used for scale production of very miniaturised chipsets.

While market valuations have stabilised October’s developments should not be underestimated. These measures are a departure from the ‘sliding scale’ approach that had kept the United States and its allies one or two generations ahead in key technologies. As US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan declared – the latest export controls are designed to foster ’as large of a lead as possible’.

It is striking how the US government has mirrored China’s state-run regime by wrestling control of the free market. Under the foreign direct product rule BIS’s controls apply extraterritorially due to a global reliance on US patents and talent. The US Department of Commerce can issue export licenses to whichever entities it wants and block sales deemed contrary to US commercial or strategic interests.

Such power naturally causes unease among US allies. Even Japanese trade officials — known for their measured demeanour — were ’bemused by how Japan’s sovereignty could be so disregarded’. However US diplomats and lobbyists are keen to ensure that Dutch and Japanese firms are equally unable to serve the world’s largest chip market.

This focus on ‘Burden Sharing’ is conveniently timed. Prior to October US export controls targeted lithography equipment but remained laissez-faire on half a dozen critical production steps where US companies happened to dominate. China broke the 7 nanometre-chip barrier not by using Dutch EUV equipment but ‘deposition and etching’ — an alternative process that relied on US tools. Some analysts suggest that the world’s three largest WFEs — which are all American — have increased their Chinese sales by US$5.4 billion since 2019 significantly displacing foreign competition.

The two largest national economies now impose similar state controls over an industry that once epitomised free trade and most-favoured nation principles and there is little scope for future moderation. While Chinese firms have been removed from the BIS’ Entity List before the odds of October’s controls being relaxed are as unlikely as Beijing abandoning its pursuit of military–civil fusion. Escalation looks more probable as both US Republican and Democratic parties continue to frame technological rivalry as existential. Further US restrictions have already been mooted on related investments.

Market intervention comes at a price — production silos are rarely economically efficient. US industry losses are measured in billions. Firms in Taiwan Japan South Korea and Europe must also restructure their organisations to stay onside. Even when BIS issues export licenses the procedural opacity stokes hysteria about favouritism or US protectionism. For the EU the disproportionate focus on lithography was just another example of successive US administrations using China as a pretext to neutralise Europe’s lead. Similar suspicions were also raised over US attempts to enter the 5G race.

Public funding through various ‘Chip Acts’ is hardly an adequate substitute to drive innovation — not least in China’s quest for semiconductor autonomy. Beijing has thrown US$50 billion at its own ‘Big Fund’ with mixed results. Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp a top recipient has become a competitive force in producing NAND flash memory chips but state aid has been overly focused on fabrication and has neglected semiconductor design and manufacturing equipment.

Yet China has been reluctant to respond to US export controls. Beijing could have retaliated by imposing restrictions on access to critical raw materials or on US companies operating within its jurisdiction. But in reality exacerbation of this problem goes against its short-term instincts and interests. Beijing still thinks and acts like a rule-taker — and state control is an amendment to the rulebook it will accept.

Export controls are not insurmountable in the medium term. In the past much less resourceful nations than China have circumvented stricter embargoes and non-proliferation treaties for weapons of mass destruction. Elsewhere the first Chinese 7-nanometre chip was manufactured by the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — a state-owned enterprise that BIS has sanctioned since December 2020.

Beijing — the ultimate savant of power-based statecraft — can simply bide its time. And time as always is on China’s side.

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see 5 Most Trusted Companies in the World.

Companies are created not just to provide solutions that previously did not exist but also to provide returns to shareholders in the form of profits. This is one of the reasons why companies have a strong focus on growth in both revenue and profits. The issue is often times corporations in their bid to achieve new highs forget about customers or consumers and engage in unethical activities which can breach the trust placed in them. Sometimes the mistrust is unfounded such as coining the term ""Big Pharma"" which alludes to major pharmaceutical companies colluding to achieve sinister purposes such as coming up with the cure for cancer but not making it public among other implausible suggestions. However sometimes they are right and corporations engage in both unethical and illegal behavior to maximize profits. This is how major companies established for decades folded such as Enron and WorldCom where both companies engaged in deceptive accounting practices to overstate profits and upon discovery ended up filing for bankruptcy. Their audit firm Arthur Anderson at the time one of the largest audit firms in the world collapsed after details of its misleading accounting practices for the two aforementioned companies were made public.

The scandals associated with the above companies which had billions of dollars worth of assets shook public confidence and even led to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which mandates some practices in financial accounting and record keeping. However if you expected the situation to improve it is likely worse than it has ever been before. In an era of false information being spread like the gospel and the gap between the rich and the poor increasing the scrutiny and lack of trust faced by corporations is a real concern. According to research by PwC in 2016 more than half the CEOs surveyed stated that the lack of trust is a significant threat for an organization to grow. Meanwhile according to the Edelman Trust Barometer in 2019 73% of respondents globally expressed concern about false information being used as a weapon something which can further sew discontent and mistrust. According to a Harvard Business Review analysis nearly two-thirds of global senior executives believed that trust among people and businesses was declining. Some of the reasons behind this mistrust pertains to cybersecurity exploits which lead to the leaking of personal data of people. Most will remember the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal where Cambridge Analytica would collect the data of millions of Facebook users without any permission from them which was then used for political advertising mainly. The data's misuse was exposed in 2018 and reports suggest that between Cambridge Analytica gathered data from between 50 million to 87 million profiles.

15 most trustworthy companies in the world

Speaking of Facebook its parent company Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is among the least trusted companies in the world. Meta Platforms Inc. (META) was initially hailed as the biggest social media company in the world by far and in fact was influential in ushering in the dawn of social media only to now be derided for its many controversies. One of the primary controversies surrounding Meta Platforms Inc. (META) is the spread of fake news and how easy it is allowing incidents such as Russian bots attempting to influence the American Presidential elections or simply the spread of fake news. According to Business Insider in September 2020 Facebook ranked last in digital trust among consumers showing how the mighty giant has fallen in recent times something reflected in its nosediving share price too.

When the pandemic hit in 2020 many companies and businesses suffered across the globe as most countries went into lockdowns to avoid the spread of disease. However in many countries and especially in the United States companies were given huge loans ostensibly to pay employees and ensure they didn't go under but many such loans were made to millionaire or major companies which laid off employees. A lot of these loans were then forgiven after just submitting a one page form instead of any robust review. In fact according to NPR 91% of all such loans were either partially or completely forgiven while many people struggled to even afford proper meals. Corporations laid off millions of people leading to record unemployment in several countries including the U.S. even as the profits of such companies did not drop as much. In fact many companies have since reported record profits in 2021 as the pandemic eased and none of these profits or benefits have been passed on to employees or even consumers who have had to pay higher prices in an era where a recession is imminent and inflation has reached levels rarely seen before. The juxtaposition of companies enjoying record profits while people struggle to make ends meet because of high levels of inflations has furthered the mistrust in corporations which is at an all-time high right now.

Of course that's not to say that companies aren't trusted at all. The most trusted companies in the world have worked hard to ensure that they are seen as shining lights in an era where the default assumption is that corporations are only looking out for themselves. These companies are generally multinationals with operations in several countries and are often household names as well. Trust is a complex and subjective concept and different people and organizations may have different opinions about which companies are the most trustworthy. Additionally trust can change over time based on a variety of factors such as a company's financial performance its treatment of employees and its reputation for ethical behavior. As a result it is difficult to definitively identify the most trusted companies in the world. To determine the most trusted companies in the world we looked at various lists and gave the highest rankings to companies which appeared on the greatest number of lists. So without further ado let's take a look at some of the companies which have earnt the trust of consumers starting with number 15:

Climbing in through smashed windows activists began to thoroughly dismantle the factory of the American-owned firm forcing closure of a site used to supply military hardware to Israel. Activists have taken apart offices broken computers and have begun occupation of the roof to ensure that the factory remains inoperable. The group took over the Teledyne factory at 7.30am on Thursday morning and vow to continue this action for as long as possible to stop the manufacture or shipment of Israel’s drone technologies and military gear.

Teledyne Technologies and its subsidiary E2V Technologies hold weapons export licences for both Israel and India where their surveillance and targeting systems are used in the repression and killing of Palestinian and Kashmiri civilians. Teledyne produces image sensors for military applications as well as high-resolution surveillance technology for Israel’s illegal apartheid wall. Israel’s armed drone fleet deployed in successive assaults on Gaza since the 51-day attack in 2014 are also outfitted with Teledyne targeting systems which enables Israel to precision target children and schools. Teledyne Technologies’ products are therefore directly attributable to the surveillance and murder of thousands of Palestinians.

In today’s action against Teledyne Palestine Action have broken another link in the chain between British-based weapons manufacturers and the colonisation of Palestine. For over two years Palestine Action’s campaign has primarily focussed on Elbit Systems – Israel’s largest arms firm – and has seen two of their sites forced to close permanently. But the group are clear: any firm which works to supply of weaponry to Israel will be shut down. This campaign will end British complicity in the colonisation of Palestine – any firm contributing to that will be a target. The group has said:

“Britain is now a hostile environment for all companies involved in the brutalisation and murder of Palestinians. Elbit Systems is one such company but Teledyne Technologies are another major player. They supply surveillance equipment for Israel’s apartheid wall and targetting systems for their fleet of combat drones. Tackling the imperialist hydra means cutting off all its the heads so we will shut down each and every company complicit in the ongoing colonisation of Palestine.”

This action and rooftop occupation comes after the group disrupted the techUK Defence Winter Dinner only last night. Five activists entered London’s Landmark Hotel and seized the microphone calling out attendees including Elbit Systems for their culpability in the crimes against humanity committed by Israel. The dinner was attended by British government civil service and military leaders as well as representatives of most major arms firms operating in the country. Elbit likely looked to the event as an opportunity to affirm their relationships and reputation after a string of embarrassing defeats by Palestine Action these activists had other ideas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIyMTQ1MTEvd29ybGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palestine Action members smash into weapons factory linked to Israel in Wales,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.arabnews.com/node/2214511/world on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIyMTQ1MTEvd29ybGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC53YWZhLnBzL1BhZ2VzL0RldGFpbHMvMTMyMjkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palestine Action activists storm factory in Wales suppling weapons to Israel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/132291 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC53YWZhLnBzL1BhZ2VzL0RldGFpbHMvMTMyMjkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50eXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMjMxODMzOTcucGFsZXN0aW5lLXByb3Rlc3RvcnMtY29uZGVtbmVkLXJlc2lkZW50cy1wb3d5cy10b3duL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palestine protestors who destroyed building condemned by residents of Powys town,"Members of Palestine Action who describe themselves as being opposed to the occupation of Palestine by Israel attacked Teledyne Labtech Ltd an American-owned weapons plant based on Presteigne’s Broadaxe Business Park early on Friday.

Protestors smashed their way in at around 7.30am. Armed with sledgehammers and wearing balaclavas they broke windows and doused the outside of the building in red paint before gaining access to the building and destroying computers.

Two protestors took to the roof but were eventually talked down by police around 11am with Dyfed Powys Police confirming a 34-year-old man and 39-year-old woman were arrested after leaving the roof.

They remain in police custody with the force stating that four arrests were made in total.

John Beddoes School on nearby Broadaxe Lane was locked down during the incident with pupils eventually sent home for the day while Joe Deakins Road which runs outside the business park was shut with police and firefighters a heavy presence throughout the day.

Palestine Action released a statement saying the protest was a result of Labtech’s involvement in supplying military hardware to Israel – but Presteigne residents were left unimpressed.

One man who lives near to the factory said: “It’s ridiculous and pathetic. How will this help them?”

Another man who wished to remain anonymous told us: “I know the company makes circuit boards but it’s stupid I don’t agree with what they’re doing at all. It will upset our friends who’ve got kids at the school.

“They have a cause but I think the action is pointless. The Israelis need the radar to spot the rockets they keep launching into Israel so I’d say it’s a worthy cause (the work done at Labtech). Apparently they didn’t even attack the part of the factory that makes the chips for radar.

“It’s local people that are worst affected the number of good employers around here is few and far between.”

A woman who also lives nearby and was left wondering if she would be able to return home asked: “Why couldn’t they have a clear protest why did they have to cause all that damage?

“I don’t understand them and I’m not interested (in their cause). There’s more things going wrong in this country.

“I don’t believe in what they’re doing. It’s a free country and I believe in protesting but there’s no need for causing damage. It’s the local workers who will be worst affected.”

The secondary school was deserted around midday with one remaining member of staff confirming that staff and pupils had been sent home for security reasons. “We did what we were told by the authorities” they said.

“All the children were safe and everyone was fine. We know there were armed police and a helicopter (on the scene). To put our school children in any form of danger is what I don’t agree with.”

“Palestine Action vow to continue this action for as long as possible to stop the manufacture or shipment of Israel’s drone technologies and military gear” the group said in a statement on its website.

“Teledyne Technologies and its subsidiary E2V Technologies hold weapons export licences for both Israel and India where their surveillance and targeting systems are used in the repression and killing of Palestinian and Kashmiri civilians.

Dyfed Powys Police revealed in an updated statement on Friday afternoon that they had been called to the premises following reports of a burglary: “We were called to reports of a burglary at a property in Broadaxe Business Park at around 6.35am” said the force.

“Officers attended and promptly arrested two women aged 65 and 41 on suspicion of burglary when it was established they were part of a protest group.

Pro-Palestine protesters wielding sledgehammers smashed their way into a weapons plant in Wales that they say is tied to Israel.

Four Welsh members of Palestine Action a UK-based direct-action network broke into Teledyne Technologies’ industrial site in Presteigne Powys Friday morning.

Demonstrators ripped through the plant’s offices smashing computers splashing the building in red paint and taking to the roof to bring production to a standstill.

The group claimed that the American firm and its English subsidiary defence and medical electricals maker Teledyne e2V supply military hardware to Israel.

Palestine Action seized Teledyne Labtech at around 7:30am with Dyfed Powys Police quickly blocking roads in and out of the site in Broadaxe Business Park.

Two protesters aged 34 and 39 rushed the roof before being talked down by police by the early afternoon.

Four people including a 69-year-old woman were arrested.

In a tweet Dyfed-Powys Police said: ‘We were called to reports of a burglary at a property in Broadaxe Business Park Presteigne at around 6.35am.

‘Officers attended and promptly arrested two women aged 65 and 41 on suspicion of burglary when it was established they were part of a protest group. Two of the group had made their way to the roof of the property.

Teledyne Labtech according to the company’s website makes ‘complex RF/Microwave printed circuit boards’. These boards are often used in smartphones and military radars.

Palestine Action describes itself as a network of groups and individuals aiming to shut down properties owned by Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems.

Teledyne the group says is another ‘major player’ in the ‘brutalisation and murder of Palestinians’.

In a statement to Metro.co.uk Palestine Action said: ‘Protests petitions and lobbying the British government to end its complicity have failed to create meaningful change proving that appealing to the oppressors is pointless.

‘Weapons continue to be built in our backyards which are often “battle-tested” on the captive population of Gaza and used to further surveil and attack the indigenous population of Palestine.’

‘Taking direct action to disrupt Israel’s military supply chain is a necessary act. The consequences of risking arrest to do so pale in comparison to the consequences of not taking action.’

It comes after Palestine Action members disrupted the techUK Defence Winter Dinner on Thursday night.

Protests swept the stage at the event in London’s Landmark Hotel attended by government and army officials as well as weapons industry representatives.

Elbit Systems UK the British subsidiary of Elbit Systems is a member of the trade association techUK.

Metro.co.uk contacted Teledyne Labtech and Elbit Systems for comment.

However they also have a reputation for being costly. Budget-conscious electric vehicle buyers often want to know the answer to these questions: what is the cheapest Tesla? And how much does it cost? Let’s find out.

Tesla Model 3 - The Cheapest Tesla - Find the best Tesla deals!

The Tesla Model 3 is the most affordable Tesla on the market. However a word of caution here. The fact that it is the cheapest Tesla doesn’t change the fact that it still costs a lot and especially after the economic slowdown of the past two years.

When the Model 3 came out six years ago it used to cost $35000 but that was for a short time. The price of Model 3 has fluctuated due to the upgrades and downgrades. However the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive is still the only Tesla available under $50000.

When discussing downgrades it is essential to mention the RWD trim which is now half a second slower than the older model. This delay is due to the LFP (Lithium-ion Phosphate Battery) batteries in the RWD Models.

The total price of the Model 3 with upgrades encompassing black and white interiors sports wheels red paint and self-driving capacity can be as $63490.

You can also opt for the Long Range Model 3. It starts at $55990 and goes up to $72490 after the modifications.

And if you still want more options you can go for the performance version of Model 3 at a base price of $62990. With modifications like full-self-driving capacity modified interiors and 20” Uberturbine wheels it can go up to $77990.

It seems like the cheapest Tesla is not that cheap after all!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tL3ZpZGVvL3Rlc2xhLXdvbi10LWJ1eS1sdWNpZC1tb3RvcnMtaXQtd291bGQtcHJvYmFibHktaGF2ZS1iZS1ub24tdXMtY29tcGFuedIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tL3ZpZGVvL3Rlc2xhLXdvbi10LWJ1eS1sdWNpZC1tb3RvcnMtaXQtd291bGQtcHJvYmFibHktaGF2ZS1iZS1ub24tdXMtY29tcGFueS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Won’t Buy Lucid Motors It Would Probably Have To Be a Non-US Company,"Some people may think that Tesla may use the opportunity and buy out Lucid Motors. But first I am not sure if Lucid Motors will be bought out second I agree with the notion that if Lucid were to be bought out it would probably have to be from a non-US company that does not currently sell in the US.

Yesterday Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that Lucid Motors an electric vehicle startup that spun out of Tesla might be about to die and wrote “They are not long for this world” which is an idiom that means that Lucid Motors will not have long to live. I titled my coverage that someone will probably buy Lucid Motors meaning another car company or a major tech company may eventually buy out Lucid Motors as that’s what usually happens with companies that struggle to increase production and sales. However I also stressed that Lucid may be able to turn things around in 2023 and only the time will show.

Now if Lucid were to be bought out who would buy this electric vehicle maker? There is a very interesting company under my yesterday’s coverage which I want to share with you and ask your thoughts. The comenter argues that it will not be a US company but rather a non-US company.

A user THX 1138 wrote ""Lucid's biggest problems are they are non-UAW and they manufacture in California. California is the most hostile environment in the world to manufacture in and the UAW will simply not tolerate any company they have a contract with buying Lucid. If Lucid were to be bought out it would probably have to be from a non-US company that does not currently sell in the US. Kinda like how Fiat bought Chrysler when it went bankrupt.""

Another user named Indigenous Earthling writes that he thinks EV OEMs that are putting product on the streets will survive the current macro environment and looming recession in 2023. Some will likely go bankrupt but many of these will likely be bought out or restructured with government assistance in the USA and China similar to General Motors and Chrysler during the 2008-2009 recession. There will also likely be more consolidation as the EV market matures.”

In any case in my opinion Lucid Motors will survive in one form or another as long as they keep scaling production of compelling electric vehicles and keep lowering manufacturing costs. Many well-heeled electric car buyers are probably looking for an alternative to Tesla.

Tesla reservations for its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles have been skyrocketing in Thailand. Tesla has received more than 5000 Model 3 and Model Y orders since launching in Thailand.

Last Wednesday Tesla Thailand started accepting online reservations for the Model 3 and Model Y. It aims to deliver the vehicles by Q1 2023. Tesla’s Model 3 starting price in Thailand is 1.76 million baht ($50545). The base Model Y costs 1.96 million baht ($56289).

As Tesla’s main export hub Giga Shanghai will be exporting Model Y and Model 3 vehicles to Thailand. Tesla China gets a 0% import tax on EVs thanks to a bilateral agreement between Bangkok and Beijing. The demand in Thailand hints that Giga Shanghai will have more work despite rumors of production cuts.

The Thai government also cut import taxes on electric vehicles from foreign automakers who decide to produce electric vehicles in Thailand. Mercedez-Benz plans to produce the EQS in Thailand. Chinese automakers Great Wall Motor and BYD also have plans to make EVs in Thailand within the next three years.

So there is a lot of EV competition in Thailand. Tesla is starting off strong entering the Thai market during a peak season for auto sales.

Tesla started posting job openings for Thailand in September. Thailand is the second Southeast Asian market Tesla has entered the first being Singapore. Tesla plans to launch at least 10 Supercharging stations in Thailand in 2023 to service owners in the country.

As for the article it is needlessly sensationalised. Yes this is a potential serious fault with the car but trapped? Really?



https://youtu.be/0uMOv5gwBJs?t=256



Basically cars with frameless doors will have their window very quickly roll down a bit when you open the doors. And they will roll back up when you close them to create a tight seal. This is controlled by the ECU and needs electrical power to work. In case of disconnected battery or the car's computers screwing up manually forcing the door open will lead to the window breaking since the computer isn't rolling it down.





This not exclusive to a tesla all cars with frameless doors like the Mercedes CLS bmw 2 series etc all have this same feature. Here is a video where you can see this mechanism in person.

Megapack projects have been popping up left and right lately.

Tesla’s biggest energy storage product has quickly emerged as the leading battery system for large utility-scale energy storage systems. It enables electric utilities to make better use of renewable energy like solar and stabilize the grid.

Megapack helped Tesla’s energy division accelerate storage deployment and the company has now built an impressive backlog of orders.

But Tesla is now working faster than ever through its backlog with 42 Megapacks per week produced at Gigafactory Nevada in addition to the new Megafactory in California recently coming online and trying to ramp up to an ambitious capacity of 40 GWh of Megapacks per year.

Last night Tesla unveiled a new Megapack project in Lessines Belgium:

In Lessines Belgium a World War II turbojet generator had been providing energy support to the community since the 1950s. To provide cleaner energy storage and add more renewable energy to the grid the Deux-Acren project installed 40 Tesla Megapacks making it one of the largest storage systems in Europe.

The company released a video about the project:

Tesla confirmed that the Megapack system will be used for “energy shifting and stabilizing services.”

With 40 Megapacks the Lessines battery system has 50 MW of power and 100 MWh of energy capacity.

The company noted that it is the biggest battery system in continental Europe.

We reported last month on an even bigger Megapack project that Tesla recently deployed in the UK.

Tesla’s energy storage business has been on fire lately.

Last quarter Tesla deployed a record high of 2.1 GWh in battery capacity – mostly driven by Megapack growth. The record is expected to be broken again shortly thanks to the new capacity at the Megafactory allowing the company to work through its large backlog.

Tesla has also ramped up Powerwall production contributing to that record energy storage deployment.

While Tesla doesn’t break down its energy storage deployment by product the Megapack is believed to account for the majority of deployment as a much bigger utility-scale product."

Benjamin F. Tatum (Biff) 88 passed away on November 29 2022 at his home in Austin Texas. He was born November 21 1934 in Stella Missouri to parents Floyd B. Tatum and Vita Whittington. Biff and his wife Sue were married in 1983 and have lived in Austin for forty years.

Biff lived his early childhood in Newtonia Missouri a very small community. He was an only child but had a large extended family there. His Father died when he was six years old and at the age of twelve he and his Mother moved to Tulsa Oklahoma.

Biff graduated from Will Rogers High School and entered Oklahoma State for the next three years. He left college to enter the Army. After being discharged he moved to Dallas and began his career at Texas Instruments in manufacturing and soon moved into sales and marketing. He left TI to continue college and obtained a degree in Industrial Engineering. The last twenty years of his career he was an independent rep selling into semiconductor manufacturers.

After retirement he was able to do things he loved. Four days a week you could find his group at Balcones Country Club teeing off at first light. Next came hunting season where he spent weekends at his lease in Comfort Texas. Then came snow skiing and would get in about three trips a year. He found joy in everything but these were his passions.

Biff is survived by a large and loving family: wife Sue Tatum; sonDerrick Tatum granddaughter Ashley Steczkowski (Shane) great grandchildren Joleen and Newton; son Kurt Tatum (Destinee) grandchildren Johanna Spencer Marly and Jesse. Step Children Dennis English (Jennifer) grand children Tiffini Fagan (Lance) Blayne Dorr (Rachael) great grand daughters Emma and Sydney; Kelly English and Adam English (Sharon) granddaughters Tatum and Addie.

Investing isn't about looking at the past; it is about evaluating what will happen in the future. In 2022 the future is unfolding at a rapid pace with technological advances coming in areas like energy biotechnology and artificial intelligence. As an investor if you can find the right companies and get in early on these multidecade trends there are huge potential gains to be had.

But what are the right stocks to buy on the cutting edge of innovation? Here are three technology stocks helping to build a more abundant future that you can consider for your portfolio today.

1. NuScale Power: The resurgence of nuclear energy

My first pick is NuScale Power (SMR 7.17%) an innovator in the nuclear energy space. With the energy crisis around the globe due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine (among other things) governments corporations and individuals are looking for faster ways to decarbonize their economies. Nuclear power along with other renewable energy resources looks to be a great candidate to do this.

NuScale was the first company to obtain approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the design of a small modular reactor (SMR). These reactors as the name suggests can be built quicker and with fewer materials than the huge nuclear reactors we are all accustomed to. That gives an SMR more flexibility for energy generation while still providing carbon-free electricity for customers. NuScale plans to make money by selling these reactors to power plants servicing the SMRs and refueling the reactors. As of this writing its first plant is set to come online in 2029 seven years from now.

The big concern with NuScale is that it is essentially pre-revenue and will be for many years until these nuclear sites get up and operational. However if you are an investor with an extremely long time horizon and believe nuclear energy is the future this could be a great stock to stash away in your portfolio at its current market cap of $2.5 billion.

2. Texas Instruments: A backbone for IoT and electrification

Texas Instruments (TXN 0.93%) unlike the other two companies on this list is a low-risk investment. The company has been a leader in the semiconductor space for decades servicing industrial and automotive customers with a huge assortment of computer chips.

Computer chips like the ones sold at Texas Instruments are key for electrifying and digitizing global industry. For example a battery electric vehicle -- which the global economy is transitioning to -- uses more than twice as many semiconductors as a gas-powered vehicle. The same can be true for the Internet of Things (IoT) across factory floors as industrial companies look to increase efficiency with their manufacturing processes. Texas Instruments has and should continue to grow because of these trends.

Texas Instruments is highly profitable generating $10.7 billion in operating income and $5.9 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months. With the growth of electric vehicles and internet-connected devices across the globe the company is poised to grow its earnings power in the future as well. From my seat that makes the stock an easy buy at these prices.

3. Rocket Lab: Building the space economy

My last stock is Rocket Lab (RKLB -3.52%). The company -- as its name implies -- is building capabilities for the burgeoning commercial space economy that is projected to hit over $1 trillion in annual revenue by 2030. Rocket Lab plans to be an end-to-end solution for companies that want to launch and monitor things in space. Its two revenue lines are space systems (64% of revenue last quarter) and launch services (36% of revenue). In 2024 it hopes to start flying its gargantuan Neutron rocket which can bring even bigger payloads for customers. This in turn should drive even more revenue growth for the company.

Rocket Lab looks set to grow but what makes the company risky is its lack of profitability. Over the last 12 months the company has lost almost $100 million on just $186.7 million in revenue. These losses will hopefully reverse over the next few years as Rocket Lab scales up its launching and space operations (revenue is up 234% in the past year or so) but there is no certainty that this will happen. Launching things into space is expensive and capital-intensive and Rocket Lab will likely need to reach a large scale before it becomes profitable for shareholders.

Texas Instruments is a low-risk investment. Both NuScale Power and Rocket Lab are on the opposite end of the risk spectrum due to how early stage their businesses are. If you are considering buying them for your portfolio that should mean taking a cautious approach by making the stocks a small sub-1% position of your wealth and buying shares consistently over time taking advantage of market volatility. If you use this strategy that will help you take advantage of the immense potential upside for these companies will minimizing your downside risk if things go wrong.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmludGVkZWxlY3Ryb25pY3Nub3cuY29tL2NvbnRlbnRzL3ZpZXdfYnJlYWtpbmctbmV3cy8yMDIyLTEwLTEyL2dsb2JhbC0zMDBtbS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9ycy1mYWItY2FwYWNpdHktcHJvamVjdGVkLXRvLXJlYWNoLW5ldy1oaWdoLWluLTIwMjUtc2VtaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global 300mm Semiconductors Fab Capacity Projected to Reach New High in 2025: SEMI,"Regional Outlook

Projected Capacity Growth Rates by Product Type

Semiconductor manufacturers worldwide are forecast to expand 300mm fab capacity at a nearly 10% compound average growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2025 reaching an all-time high of 9.2 million wafers per month (wpm) SEMI announced today in its 300mm Fab Outlook to 2025 report.Strong demand for automotive semiconductors and new government funding and incentive programs in multiple regions are driving much of the growth.New fabs announced by companies including GlobalFoundries Intel Micron Samsung SkyWater Technology TSMC and Texas Instruments are ramping in 2024 or 2025 to help meet the growth in demand.“While shortages of some chips have eased and supply of others has remained tight the semiconductor industry is laying the groundwork to meet longer-term demand for a broad range of emerging applications as it expands 300mm fab capacity” said Ajit Manocha SEMI president and CEO. “SEMI is currently tracking 67 new 300mm fabs or major additions of new lines expected to start construction from 2022 to 2025.”China is projected to increase its global share of 300mm front-end fab capacity from 19% in 2021 to 23% in 2025 reaching 2.3 million wpm a rise driven by factors including growing government investments in the domestic chip industry. With the growth China is nearing global leader Korea in 300mm fab capacity and expected to overtake Taiwan now in second place next year.Taiwan’s worldwide capacity share is expected to slip 1% to 21% from 2021 to 2025 while Korea’s share is also projected to edge lower 1% to 24% during the same period. Japan’s share of worldwide 300mm fab capacity is on a path to fall from 15% in 2021 to 12% in 2025 as competition with other regions increases.The Americas’ global share of 300mm fab capacity is forecast to rise from 8% in 2021 to 9% in 2025 driven partly by U.S. CHIPS Act funding and incentives.

Southeast Asia is expected to maintain its 5% share of 300mm front-end fab capacity during the forecast period.From 2021 to 2025 the 300mm Fab Outlook to 2025 shows Power-related capacity with the strongest growth at a 39% CAGR followed by Analog at 37% Foundry at 14% Opto at 7% and Memory at 5%.The latest update of the SEMI 300mm Fab Outlook to 2025 report tracks 356 current and future fabs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpZ3BpY3R1cmViaWdzb3VuZC5jb20vQmVzdC1VU1QtUHJvamVjdG9ycy1Db21wZXRlLTIwMjItUHJvamVjdG9yLVNob290b3V0LVJlc3VsdHMuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best UST Projectors Compete at 2022 Projector Shootout. Here are the Results,"Best UST Projectors Compete at 2022 Projector Shootout. Here are the Results By Chris Boylan

If you're in the market for a UST (Ultra Short Throw) projector you'll be interested in the results of this weekend's 2022 Projector Shootout. Day one of the event included five of the top UST projectors and was held today (Saturday December 10) at The Company building in Manhattan.

Robert Zohn of Value Electronics first started hosting TV shootouts at his shop in Westchester NY in 2004 and has been holding the event every year since. The event expanded to UST projectors last year and will also include long throw projectors in Day Two of the event this year (tomorrow). If you are not familiar with UST projectors and how they differ from traditional long throw projectors check out this article:

The projector shootout is co-hosted by electronics retailer Value Electronics and B2B Tech publication Dealerscope. The event is designed to reveal the video performance of the best UST projectors by setting them all up in the same room on identical screens (Seymour Screens ""Radiant White"") fed by identical content. Content included test patterns video clips and stills each selected to highlight specific areas of video performance: color accuracy contrast motion resolution luminance and detail/sharpness in both bright and dark scenes.Content varied from 480i legacy interlaced videos to SDR (standard dynamic range) HD and 4K content and full Ultra HD 4K content with HDR (Digh Dynamic Range).

Prices ranged from $3500 to $6500 and five different manufacturers were represented.

pixel shifting to generate their 4K (or 4Ke) image. The LG and Samsung projectors use Texas Instruments' larger high resolution 0.66"" chip so they only need to pixel shift once in order to generate a 4K image. The Epson also does a single pixel shift to create double the resolution of 1080p (but half the resolution of 4K). The AWOL Vision and HiSense projectors use TI's 0.47"" 1080p DLP device with 4X pixel shifting to reproduce full 4K resolution. Four projectors feature triple laser lighting and DLP imaging chips. The Epson LS800 features a single laser 3-Chip LCD imaging engine. All UST projectors in the competition use some form ofto generate their 4K (or 4Ke) image. The LG and Samsung projectors use Texas Instruments' larger high resolution 0.66"" chip so they only need to pixel shift once in order to generate a 4K image.

Of the projectors at the 2022 UST Projector shootout the LG and Samsung projectors use TI's 0.66 inch chip while the Hisense and AWOL use the smaller 0.47 inch DMD device.

Master of Ceremonies for the 2022 event was industry expert Philip Jones of Projector Reviews and Sound United. Mr. Jones is the publisher technical editor and lead reviewer of ProjectorReviews.com. Jason Dustal ISF Instructor and Engineer with Murideo led testing operations during the Shootout event.

Rather than professionally calibrate each projector the event hosts chose to set each TV to the picture preset that was most accurate in color reproduction then set color temperature to the most accurate color of white (closest to ""D65"" or 6500 degrees Kelvin). The rationale was that buyers of this type of projector are less likely to pay for a professional calibration than buyers of more expensive long throw projectors. If an owner of one of these projectors does hire a professional calibrator they will be likely to get even higher performance from their display.

Skin tone tests like this one helped the judges rate each projector's color accuracy.

On the AWOL projector they used the ""Movie"" picture mode for SDR content and color temperature was set to ""Standard."" For HDR content on the AWOL they switched to ""Sport"" mode color temperature was still ""Standard."" The Epson was set to its ""Natural"" preset for both HDR and SDR content and color temperature was set to ""7"" for HDR and SDR. The Hisense projector was set to ""Theater Day"" for SDR and ""Standard"" mode for SDR. Color temperature was set to Low on both. On the LG projector ""Expert Bright"" picture mode was used for HDR content and ""Cinema Home"" was used for SDR content. Color temperature was set to ""Warm"" for both SDR and HDR. On the Samsung projector picture mode of ""Movie"" and color temperature of ""Warm 1"" was used for both SDR and HDR content.

AVProStore provided switching distribution and test equipment while MetraAV provided HDMI cables (48Gbs/HDMI 2.1-compliant).

Expert judges from the video and film industries were on hand to rank each projector on their performance on these tests. All of the projectors had their strong points and prospective buyers should check out the scorecard below to see how each projector scored in each testing category. Based on your personal preferences (e.g. viewing in a dark room vs. bright room viewing movies vs. sports) and your budget one of the projectors with a lower overall performance score may actually be a better option for you.

After the judging was over results were tabulated for all categories and a new ""King"" was crowned for UST projectors. Winning the highest scores in both the SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) and HDR (High Dynamic Mode) categories was the LG HU915QB. So it follows that the new ""King of UST Projectors"" for 2022 is the LG HU915QB.

Composite scorecard with the average scores for each projector in the 2022 UST Projector Shootout.

In second place was the AWOL Vision LTV-3500 and in third place overall was the Epson LS800. Although the LG took first place in nine of the fifteen test categories it was not rated the best projector for bright content. The AWOL Vision LTV-3500 produced the brightest overall image which may make it the best choice for bright room viewing. And the least expensive projector in the bunch the Epson LS800 nabbed the top scores for motion resolution and HDR tone mapping which means it should look particularly good with fast-moving action-oriented films in Ultra HD with HDR.

The overall scores for the top three projectors (ranked out of a possible 10 points) were:

LG HU915QB: 8.56 Overall Score (8.55 for SDR content 8.57 for HDR)

(8.55 for SDR content 8.57 for HDR) AWOL Vision LTV-3500: 7.86 Overall Score (7.75 for SDR content 7.96 for HDR)



(7.75 for SDR content 7.96 for HDR) Epson LS800: 7.44 Overall Score (7.63 for SDR content 7.25 for HDR)

As noted by the company on Dec. 1 Textron delivered the Cottonmouth ARV to the Marine Corps customer at the Nevada Automotive Test Center.

“The prototype vehicle is now in its formal government evaluation phase expected to last throughout 2023” Textron said on Twitter.

Created to serve as a Naval Sensor Node supporting expeditionary operations the Cottonmouth vehicle provides lightweight multi-modal capability for the Marines consistent with the service’s Force Design 2030 vision. A multi-domain command and control suite integrated into the vehicle as part of the C4UAS Mission Role Variant allows it to coordinate data and serve as the quarterback or battlefield manager for the modern battlefield. The amphibious 6×6 platform is equipped for sustained reconnaissance with organic unmanned systems capabilities and multi-spectrum sensors which provide seamless communication between the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

The Cottonmouth vehicle’s smaller footprint allows rapid transport of four vehicles on a Ship-to-Shore Connector (LCAC-100). Supporting the mission of a mobile scout vehicle the easy-to-deploy platform swims in open ocean and navigates littoral water obstacles such as bays estuaries rivers light surf and handles any terrain.

“Our Cottonmouth vehicle is a completely clean-sheet design that provides transformative reconnaissance capabilities and meets Marine Corps requirements” said David Phillips Senior Vice President Land and Sea Systems. “The vehicle was designed from its inception by listening to customer requirements. Because of its smaller size the Marines can quickly deploy next generational combat power to the fight and lets commanders meet any mission anywhere.”

The prototype is the second iteration of the vehicle informed by lessons learned from an original Alpha prototype vehicle and approximately 3000 miles of testing. Textron Systems’ Cottonmouth vehicle has completed contractor verification testing of its mobility swim capability vetronics integration and C4UAS mission capabilities. In addition to delivery of the fully integrated ARV platform the company also delivered a blast hull to the Aberdeen Test Center and a systems integration lab (SIL) to the Naval Information Warfare Center-Atlantic both of which have been undergoing government evaluation and testing. The prototype vehicle now enters its formal government evaluation phase expected to last through 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3D reconstruction showed the highest resolution of a giant virus larger than 200 nm without utilising the block-based reconstruction technique38 or similar methods16. However the current resolution of 7.7 Å of tokyovirus has not reached the theoretical maximum of 4.0 Å for ~ 250 nm particles (red curve in Fig. 1). In practice many factors affect the ability to achieve a given resolution beyond the accelerating voltage. Therefore before studying the biological specimen the performance of the microscope system was confirmed with Thon rings of a Pt-Ir standard film extending beyond 2 Å (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that the microscope or electron source would not be a limiting factor in resolutions achieved with the giant virus particles even though it does not have a field emission electron source and is using a less coherent LaB 6 source.

Although there were many factors that limited the resolution of tokyovirus to 7.7 Å the main limiting factor for current resolution is likely the amount of data that can be collected. Cryo-HVEM requires the manual collection of micrographs. The 1182 particles from 160 micrographs used in total were an extremely small number compared to other reported SPA of giant viruses using 300 kV microscopes. PBCV-1 with a maximum diameter of 190 nm was reconstructed with ~ 13000 particles from 5624 images at 4.4 Å reconstruction15 and ASFV with a 250 nm maximum diameter of the outer capsid were reconstructed with 16266 particles from 17135 micrographs at 14.1 Å reconstruction62 and with 63348 particles from 64852 micrographs at 8.8 Å reconstruction16. The size of the virus imposes limits which require careful balance between a lower magnification to increase particles imaged per micrograph and a high enough magnification to achieve worthwhile resolutions in reconstructions. Tokyovirus with a maximum diameter of 250 nm is so large that even at relatively low magnifications there were at best around 12 virus particles per micrograph (often ~ 6 virus particles e.g. in Fig. S6A) which can be utilised for 2D classification. In this case the “super resolution” mode (7420 × 6780 detector dimensions) in the K2 Summit camera was used for data acquisition keeping the pixel spacing less than 1.5 Å/pixel (Table 1). Automated acquisition of micrographs which is now near ubiquitous in the mainstream cryo-EM would greatly increase the quantity of data which can be acquired in any given timeframe. However we selected “super resolution” mode for manual-operated cryo-HVEM to maintain a better particle count (per micrograph) while maintaining a higher sampling frequency though the detector performance suffers slightly (Fig. S1). This probably imposes further limitation on the attainable resolution in this experiment.

Another limitation on the attainable resolution lies in the software. Some elements of general-purpose cryo-EM SPA image processing do not support HVEM accelerating voltages. Gctf63 was not used as it does not support 1 MV data and likewise dose weighting of 1 MV data is unsupported in both MotionCor264 and the RELION implementation65 as there are currently no parameters for radiation damage at 1 MV. Fortunately CTFFIND66 does support 1 MV data for contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation so we used it in this study. We were unable to use dose weighting although this is somewhat offset by higher acceleration voltages which reduces radical damage67. Particle polishing in RELION65 also provides little benefit which may be caused by the large size of the viruses on the micrograph where distortions across the micrograph potentially cause virus deformation variation per frame. Ewald sphere correction of whole particles recently implemented in the RELION software suite65 has also shown to improve reconstructions from 300 kV microscopes across a range of diameters. We tested Ewald sphere correction for our tokyovirus reconstruction taken with the 1 MV cryo-HVEM and found no improvement. This may be because the 7.7 Å reconstruction of tokyovirus is not high enough resolution to benefit. The software support mentioned above particularly dose weighting will be needed for high resolution SPA of giant viruses using 1 MV microscopes in the future.

Ultimately using cryo-HVEM provides benefits for larger particles. The decreased defocus gradient across a particle aids high resolution whole particle reconstruction. Sample damage from the electron beam is also decreased which is of particular importance with biological samples. Furthermore increased beam penetration permits improved visualisation of internal structure as used in cryo-electron tomography with pithovirus an amphora-shaped giant virus having ~ 800 nm thickness8. Beyond the more widely available 300 kV cryo-EM it permits study of finer details of even larger viruses which lower acceleration voltages are unable to penetrate. Finally the reconstruction methodology is simpler than that of block-based reconstruction. Block-based reconstruction is a powerful technique but as the name implies it breaks the whole structure down into blocks. Stitching these back together is called a composite map and while these are gaining in popularity do have some inherent dangers. For example FSC calculations cannot be performed on composite maps without artefacting and sharpening can reveal overlap artefacts between maps. We tested block-based reconstruction on data sets from cryo-HVEM but it did not improve attained resolution. Although the exact reasons are unknown our working hypothesis is that the relatively low number of particles in the final reconstruction and the lower curvature of the Ewald sphere at 1 MV (when compared to 300 kV) decreases the effectiveness of block-based reconstruction. However block-based reconstruction methods may have some advantages in cryo-HVEM given sufficient particle numbers. This is because it can overcome minor distortions of very large symmetric particles yielding improved resolutions. For objects with low symmetry the direct method using higher accelerating electrons is still needed.

The 7.7 Å capsid structure of tokyovirus represents a new capsid network of NCLDV. The trapezoidal arrays of LtCs in tokyovirus do not form a single underlayer beneath the MCP like the mCPs of PBCV-115 or ASFV16 instead relying on another CmC which connect the three rotated trapezoids within the trisymmetron (Figs. 5 S7). Two protein components of GlC and ZpC are present at the trisymmetron interfaces rather than a single protein (P11) as in PBCV-1. SuC also interacts with each trapezoidal lattice on the interior surface and further forms a connection with ScPCs which does not appear to be present in the reconstructions from PBCV-1 and ASFV.

The T = 309 (h = 7 k = 13) capsid is clearly displayed in the 3D reconstruction (Fig. 3). With this structure we can newly identify an intermediate “scaffold” protein component (ScPC) array between the capsid and the internal membrane (yellow in Figs. 4 and 5). Anti-parallel pairs of ScPCs run along the trisymmetron interface and connects with each pentasymmetron via the pentasymmetron components. These features are quite analogous to the “tape-measure” proteins40 reported in PBCV-1 and ASFV cryo-EM maps1516 which is the long filamentous mCP named P2 in PBCV-1 and M1249L in ASFV. This suggests that tokyovirus capsid construction may occurs through a different mechanism. The presence of this scaffold network may indicate that the scaffold is responsible for imposing restraints on the capsid dimensions. Greater clarity of these flexible ScPCs will be required to further elucidate their interactions in more detail and perhaps shed more light on their potential role in construction.

To build the MCP homology model we extracted the central MCP trimer from a trisymmetron and the homology model was rigid-body-fitted into the density. Regions of the homology model which fit the density poorly were manually fixed using COOT58 and energetically refined with PHENIX59 software (Fig. 6B). An empty “cap” region was present on each MCP trimer density when the MCP homology model was fitted to it although thus far we have been unable to clarify this region sufficiently for model fitting. As such we were initially unsure whether this density is caused by other smaller proteins interacting with the MCP or post-translational modification of the MCP. We identified a candidate of the small “cap” protein as Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining61 was used on SDS-PAGE of purified tokyovirus particles to identify potential glycoproteins. This showed a protein running at ~ 14 kDa (Fig. S5B). However the band is weak compared to that of MCP in the Coomassie stained gel (Fig. S5A). The cap density may not be present for all MCP trimers so called “partial occupancy” and the icosahedral averaging will affect their clarity as a result. In the case of PBCV-1 sugar chains are directly bound to the MCP53 while in the case of ASFV there is a second membrane external of the capsid itself16 so additional capsid glycosylation is less important. We previously found that some species in the Marseilleviridae family induce a bunch formation in host amoeba20. Simultaneously the newly borne viruses adhered to and aligned on the host cell surface in the process. A member of the Mimiviridae tupanvirus has also evidence suggesting this similar mechanism where a mannose-binding protein (MBP) expressed on the amoeba cell membrane was suggested to be involved in intercellular adhesions68. In Marseilleviruses 10 of the 49 identified virion proteins were reported to be glycosylated18. The glycoprotein may play a role in these bunch formation and adhesion to the cell potentially to increase speed of transmission but it needs further study to clarify the precise function.

The tokyovirus and PBCV-1 pentons are similar in depth (Fig. S2AB). As the tokyovirus penton density is fitted with that of the cryo-EM-derived PDB model of PBCV-1 (PDBID: 6NCL) (Fig. S2D) we can find a density present for the penton base protein and an unmodeled lower region level with the mCP layer. The same is evident in PBCV-1 (Fig. S2E). The ASFV penton protein (Fig. S2F) fits the single jelly roll in the same position and orientation as the PBCV-1 penton with the insertion domain on the outer face of the capsid in density for which neither PBCV-1 nor tokyovirus possess clear density. A BLAST search of the tokyovirus genome using both the PBCV-1 penton and the Cafeteriavirus-dependent mavirus penton which was modelled into the ASFV penton structure did not yield any matches so identification and homology modelling of the penton protein has not been possible. Given the low BLAST metrics for the tokyovirus MCP against both PBCV-1 and mavirus (Table 2) this is not necessarily surprising. To clarify the nature of the protein occupying the lower region of the penton we must achieve a higher resolution reconstruction.

Immediately around this small pentamer is a symmetric array of further protein components of PC-α β and γ within the mCP layer which act to support the MCP array in the pentasymmetron as a replacement for the lattice proteins and interact with the internal membrane extrusion via low-density materials (arrows in Figs. 3C and 5A). They may be roughly analogous to the “lantern” proteins in ASFV16. These further extend to the edge of the pentasymmetron and interact with the ScPC array (Fig. 4B). This is a novel structure in NCLDV and likely to play a role in the formation of the internal membrane extrusion.

In conclusion based on the theoretical resolution estimation we applied 1 MV cryo-HVEM to single particle analysis of tokyovirus which is a large virus particle with a maximum diameter of 250 nm. This revealed the 7.7 Å capsid structure with a limited quantity of data without using a block-based reconstruction technique. The cryo-EM map showed the novel capsid network allowing the characteristic internal membrane extrusions under the icosahedral vertices. The advanced ScPC array represents a framework that supports the extruded structure of the internal membrane and also possibly function as a tape measure protein reported in other NCLDVs. The unique PC-α β and γ are also likely to support the membrane extrusions. While it shares many similarities to the structures of PBCV-1 and ASFV regarding MCP structure we found a cap density on top of the MCP that was suggested to contain a glycoprotein. The glycoprotein identified in Marseilleviridae possibly acts to interact with the host cell surface. This in turn may cause the bunch formation of host cells in some species as has been previously demonstrated20. The 1 MV cryo-HVEM installed in Osaka University had sufficient performance to reach the theoretical resolution but the current resolution of tokyovirus capsid was limited to 7.7 Å. One of the major problems was with the limited quantity of data. This will be solved in the future by installing automated data acquisition software. Using a larger format detector or improving the super resolution performance of the Gatan K2 detector when paired with HVEM will also remedy the problem because the significant drop in low frequency signal in super resolution mode at 1 MV may be a limitation of the super resolution estimation algorithm for higher energy electrons in the current K2 detector (Fig. S1). Another major problem is the limited support of software for 1 MV micrographs. If current advanced techniques such as dose weighting during motion correction and Bayesian particle polishing can be used and full CTF parameter refinement can be optimized the combination of all of these should allow the resolution to approach the theoretical value. Further optimizations and detailed analytical evaluations to solve the problems identified in this study will be necessary for cryo-HVEM using a LaB6 electron source to be used for structural analysis of large biological samples. To distinguish the resolution limitations of cryo-HVEM we should also test SPA using well-tested specimens such as apoferritin TMV and/or GroEL. In addition careful comparisons with mainstream 300 kV cryo-EM would help demonstrate the potential of cryo-HVEM in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwNTEyNzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sewage surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 at student campus residences in the Western Cape South Africa,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722051270 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwNTEyNzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0yNTQ1OC140gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EV-A71 induced IL-1β production in THP-1 macrophages is dependent on NLRP3 RIG-I and TLR3 | Scientific Reports,"Caspase-8 is involved in EV-A71-induced inflammasome activation in human macrophages

At first the permissiveness and ability to induce IL-1β production were examined in human monocytes and macrophages using THP-1 and PMA-primed THP-1 cells as cellular models. Our results showed that both cell types are permissive to EV-A71 infection (Supplementary Fig. 1A–C). The production of IL-1β transcripts and proteins was significantly increased in PMA-primed THP-1 compared to untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. 1C and D). Furthermore increased IL-1β release was also observed in human peripheral blood-derived monocytes (PBMCs)-differentiated macrophages upon EV-A71 infection (Supplementary Fig. 1E–G). This result is in concordance with the previous report25.

Many studies have implicated caspase-1 in virus infection-associated inflammasome activation252627. Our results showed that EV-A71 infection increased the expression of cleaved caspase-1 in supernatants collected from infected THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 1A). Furthermore treatment with Ac-YVAD-cmk a caspase-1 inhibitor resulted in more than 80% downregulation of released IL-1β in EV-A71-infected cells (Fig. 1B). A previous study showed that caspase-8 might act as a maturing enzyme to catalyze the production of IL-1β28. To determine whether caspase-8 is involved with EV-A71-induced IL-1β release in macrophages we examined the activation of caspase-8 in virus-infected THP-1 macrophages. Our results revealed that the expression of cleaved caspase-8 was detected in THP-1 macrophages upon EV-A71 infection (Fig. 1C). To understand whether caspase-8 activation is implicated in EV-A71-induced IL-1β production PMA-primed THP-1 cells were treated with Z-IETD-FMK the caspase-8 inhibitor and infected with EV-A71. Interestingly the amounts of secreted IL-1β were drastically decreased in Z-IETD-FMK-treated cells (Fig. 1D). The cytotoxicity assay was performed to confirm that our observed differences did not come from cell death (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus our data showed that caspase-8 activation is essential for EV-A71-promoted inflammasome activation. Furthermore treated cells with Z-IETD-FMK Ac-YVAD-cmk and the combination of Z-IETD-FMK and Ac-YVAD-cmk showed no significant synergistic effect (Fig. 1E) suggesting that caspase-1 and caspase-8 act as components on the same pathway.

Figure 1 EV-A71 infection induced IL-1β secretion is dependent on caspase-1 and caspase-8. (A) PMA-primed THP-1 cells were infected with EV-A71 (2 M.O.I.). The expression levels of cleaved caspase-1 pro-caspase-1 and EV-A71 viral protein VP0 was analyzed by Western blot. β-actin was used as a loading control. (B) THP-1 macrophages were treated with the caspase-1 inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-cmk) at the concentration of 1 μM. The cells were then infected with EV-A71 at the M.O.I. of 2 for 12 h.

(D) THP-1 macrophages were treated with the caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) at the concentration of 20 μM and infected with EV-A71 for 12 h. The secreted IL-1β levels were quantified by ELISA.

Activation of NLRP3 and RIG-I inflammasomes contributes to EV-A71-induced IL-1β production

Various RNA viruses including HCV CVB3 and EV-A71 have been demonstrated to activate multiple types of inflammasomes for IL-1β production20293032. To examine whether NLRP3 is involved in EV-A71-induced inflammasome formation in macrophages PMA-primed THP-1 cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or NLRP3 siRNA and then infected with EV-A71. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm the knockdown efficiency of NLRP3 at the protein level (Fig. 2A). The levels of secreted IL-1β protein were quantified by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2B IL-1β production was decreased in NLRP3-KD cells compared to scrambled siRNA-transfected THP-1 macrophages. These results indicated that EV-A71 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in human mononuclear phagocytes. The results are similar to those of previously published research2324. In addition to examine whether RIG-I is involved in IL-1β production in EV-A71-infected macrophages the specific siRNA target RIG-I was used to suppress RIG-I protein expression. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 2C). The production of mature IL-1β in EV-A71-infected macrophages was significantly reduced in RIG-I-KD cells compared to those transfected with scramble siRNA (Fig. 2D). Together these data suggested that NLRP3 and RIG-I inflammasome were involved in EV-A71-induced IL-1β production. To examine the role of ASC in EV-A71-induced IL-1β production siASCs were transfected into THP-1 macrophages and EV-A71-triggered IL-1β protein release was examined in ASC knockdown and control cells. Immunoblotting was performed to confirm the knockdown efficiency and viral infection (Fig. 2E). ELISA results revealed that EV-A71-induced IL-1β expression was abolished in ASC knockdown cells (Fig. 2F).

Figure 2 NLRP3 and RIG-I are involved with EV-A71 -triggered IL-1β production in THP-1 macrophage. (A B) NLRP3 siRNA (siNLRP3) (100 nM) or scrambled siRNA was transfected into PMA-primed THP-1 cells for 48 h. Then the cells were infected with EV-A71 at an M.O.I. of 2 for 12 h. (A) NLRP3 EV-A71 VP0 and β-actin were analyzed by Western blot. (B) The secretion levels of IL-1β were assessed by ELISA. (C D) PMA-primed THP-1 cells were transfected 100 nM siRNA target RIG-I (siRIG-I) or scrambled siRNA for 48 h and then infected with 2 M.O.I. EV-A71 for 24 h.

(E F) Specific ASC siRNA (siASC) and scrambled siRNA were transfected into PMA-primed THP-1 cells for 48 h. Cells were then infected with EV-A71 at an M.O.I. of 2 for 12 h. (E) The expression levels of ASC EV-A71 VP0 and β-actin were analyzed by Western blot. (F) The supernatants were collected to quantify the released IL-1β protein levels by ELISA.

EV-A71-induced RIG-I inflammasome activation is independent of NLRP3

To further investigate whether RIG-I can affect EV-A71-induced IL-1β release in an NLRP3-independent manner NLRP3 KD THP-1 macrophages were transfected with siRIG-I and then infected with EV-A71. The expression levels of RIG-I NLRP3 and EV-A71 VP0 were confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The supernatants were harvested at 12 h post-infection and subjected to ELISA to determine IL-1β protein expression levels. The data revealed that RIG-I knockdown decreased IL-1β production in EV-A71-infected NLRP3 KD THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 3B). Furthermore a double knockdown experiment was performed to decipher the roles of RIG-I and NLRP3 in EV-A71-triggered IL-1β production. Our results revealed that RIG-I knockdown resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in IL-1β production while NLRP3 KD led to an ~ 85% downregulation of IL-1β secretion. Interestingly EV-A71 infection failed to induce IL-1β release in cells that lacked RIG-I and NLRP3 expression (Fig. 3C). Therefore both NLRP3 and RIG-I can affect inflammasome activation in EV-A71-infected macrophages. Next we sought to determine whether the RIG-I protein directly interacts with ASC the major protein of the inflammasome. An immunoprecipitation assay was performed and the results showed that the RIG-I protein was pulled down with ASC in EV-A71-infected cells in an NLRP3-independent manner (Fig. 3D).

Figure 3 RIG-I contributes to IL-1β production in EV-A71-infected macrophages in an NLRP3-independent manner. (A) The NLRP3 KD THP-1 cells were primed with PMA for 48 h for differentiation. The primed cells were subsequently transfected with siRIG-I and scrambled siRNA for 48 h and then infected with EV-A71 (M.O.I. = 2). The expression levels of NLRP3 RIG-I EV-A71 VP0 and β-actin were examined by Western blot. (B) The supernatants were harvested at 12 h p.i.. The IL-1β levels were determined by ELISA. (C) THP-1 macrophages were transfected with siNLRP3 siRIG-I and siNLRP3 + siRIG-I for 48 h respectively. The transfected cells were subsequently infected with EV-A71 at the M.O.I. of 2. The expression levels of RIG-I NLRP3 EV-A71 VP0 and β-actin were examined by Western blot. IL-1β levels in the supernatants were determined by ELISA. (D) Lysates prepared from mock- or EV-A71-infected PMA-primed THP-1 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ASC or anti-NLRP3 antibodies attached to sepharose. Whole lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-NLRP3 anti-RIG-I and anti-ASC. The expression of β-actin was used as an internal control. Data are expressed as mean value \(\pm\) SD (***p < 0.001 Student’s unpaired T-test). Full size image

Caspase-1 and caspase-8 are implicated in RIG-I agonist-induced IL-1β production in THP-1 macrophages

To further elucidate the role of RIG-I in inflammasome activation the RIG-I agonist 5’ppp-dsRNA was transfected into THP-1 macrophages and the expression of IL-1β protein was examined. The data showed that the amount of released IL-1β was increased by RIG-I engagement. Furthermore transfection of RIG-I siRNA resulted in decreased RIG-I agonist-induced IL-1β production (Fig. 4A). To elucidate the effect of NLRP3 expression on RIG-I agonist-stimulated inflammasome activation 5’ppp-dsRNA was transfected into NLRP3-KD THP-1 macrophages. Our results showed that knockdown NLRP3 decreased IL-1β production in RIG-I agonist-treated macrophagic cells suggesting that NLRP3 could affect RIG-I inflammasome activation even though these two proteins cannot interact with each other (Fig. 4B). To examine whether caspase-1 and caspase-8 are implicated in RIG-I inflammasome formation in macrophages PMA-primed THP-1 cells were transfected with RIG-I agonist and then treated with caspase-1 or caspase-8 inhibitors. Our results showed that both caspase-1 and caspase-8 inhibitors could influence RIG-I engagement-induced IL-1β production suggesting both caspases are implicated with RIG-I inflammasome activation (Fig. 4C). Furthermore caspase-1 and caspase-8 are involved in EV-A71-induced RIG-I inflammasome activation since their inhibitors can significantly decrease the maturation of IL-1β in NLRP3-KD macrophages (Fig. 4D).

TLR3 and TLR8 KD suppresses EV-A71-induced IL-1β production

TLRs are known to be implicated in pathogen-induced IL-1β production31. Among these TLRs evidence suggests that TLR3 and TLR8 play roles in RNA virus-triggered IL-1β maturation143233. To investigate which TLRs are involved in EV-A71-induced IL-1β production in human macrophages siRNAs specific to TLR3 were transfected into THP-1 macrophages subsequently infected with EV-A71. The knockdown efficiency was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). The expression of proteins was measured by ELISA which showed that the knockdown of TLR3 resulted in decreased IL-1β secretion (Fig. 5B). Lentiviral vectors carrying TLR8 shRNAs were transduced into THP-1 cells to select stable TLR8-KD clones. TLR8-KD THP-1 cells were treated with PMA to force their macrophagic differentiation and then infected with EV-A71. The expression levels of TLR8 and the viral protein VP0 were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 5C). The secreted mature IL-1β protein was examined by ELISA which showed that the expression levels of secreted proteins were downregulated in TLR8-KD cells (Fig. 5D). Furthermore to investigate whether TLR3-promote IL-1β secretion is in an NLRP3-dependent manner the wild type and NLRP3-KD THP-1 macrophages were transfected with TLR3 siRNA and then infected by EV-A71. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 5E). Our results show that the suppressive effect of TLR3 knockdown on IL-1β release was less evident in NLRP3 KD cells (Fig. 5F).

Engagement of TLR3 and TLR8 induces IL-1β maturation in THP-1 macrophages

TLR engagement has been demonstrated to be sufficient to promote inflammasome activation in human monocytes. To test the effects of TLR3 and TLR8 engagement in triggering IL-1β production in THP-1 macrophages we stimulated the cells with poly(A:U) the TLR3 agonist or motolimod the TLR8 agonist and analyzed IL-1β release by ELISA. Our results revealed that both poly(A:U) and motolimod-induced IL-1β were released from THP-1 macrophages. (Figs. 6A and C). To confirm the effects of TLR engagement the expression of TLR3 and TLR8 was knocked down by transfecting siTLR3 and transduction of shTLR8 into cells respectively. TLR3 and TLR8 ligands were then added to stimulate macrophages. Our results showed that TLR3 and TLR8 agonist-triggered IL-1β release was diminished in TLR knockdown cells (Figs. 6B and D). The cleaved caspase-8 could be detected in poly(A:U) transfected THP-1 macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 3).To examine the involvement of NLRP3 and RIG-I in TLR engagement-triggered IL-1β production NLRP3-KD and RIG-I-KD THP-1 macrophages were stimulated with TLR3 and TLR8 ligands respectively. Our data showed that the IL-1β production triggered by TLR3 and TLR8 engagements was affected by the expression of NLRP3 and RIG-I. NLRP3 knockdown decreased 75% of TLR3 stimulation-induced IL-1β release while downregulating only approximately 25% of TLR8-triggered IL-1β production (Fig. 6E). In addition the expression of RIG-I also influenced both TLR3- and TLR8-induced IL-1β release (Fig. 6F).

Figure 6 NLRP3 and RIG-I are implicated in TLR3 and TLR8 induced IL-1β release in THP-1 macrophages. (A) THP-1 macrophages were stimulated by poly(A:U) (0.1 1 µg) for 12 and 24 h. The IL-1β protein levels were detected by ELISA. (B) PMA-primed THP-1 were transfected with TLR3 siRNA and scrambled siRNA for 48 h and then stimulated by 1 µg poly(A:U) for 12 h. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by Western blot. The expression levels of IL-1β in the supernatant were analyzed by ELISA. (C) PMA-primed THP-1 cells were treated with TLR8 agonists motolimod (5 10 µM) for 12 and 24 h. The supernatant was collected and the expression of IL-1β was examined by ELISA.

Virus RNA induces IL-1β production by promoting caspase-8 activation

To determine the potential of viral RNAs in triggering IL-1β release different amounts of EV-A71 vRNA were transfected into THP-1 macrophages. The expression levels of vRNA and IL-1β were quantified by RT-qPCR. Our results showed that the expression of vRNA was increased dose-dependently while the IL-1β transcripts were not altered (Fig. 7A). The amounts of mature IL-1β protein were analyzed by ELISA. The released IL-1β levels were up-regulated in vRNA-transfected THP-1 macrophages suggesting that vRNA is sufficient to promote inflammasome activation in macrophages (Fig. 7B). Total RNA extracted from RD cells was used as a control since the EV-A71 virus was propagated in these cells. To determine whether de novo protein synthesis is required for EV-A71-triggered IL-1β production cycloheximide (CHX) was added to suppress viral protein synthesis in EV-A71-infected cells. Western blot showed that the viral protein expression was drastically decreased in CHX-treated cells (Fig. 7C). The obtained data showed that cycloheximide treatment resulted in an approximate 2/3 reduction in secreted IL-1β which suggested that the viral protein was not the only factor that triggers IL-1β production (Fig. 7D). Prior research revealed that caspase-8 is essential in TLR3/4-mediated IL-1β production28. We found that transfection of virus RNA led to the cleavage of caspase-8 in THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 7E). To further assess whether caspase-8 activation was implicated in RNA-triggered IL-1β production macrophages transfected with cellular and viral RNA were treated with Z-IETD-FMK. ELISA showed that the release of IL-1β in response to vRNA transfection was drastically suppressed by Z-IETD-FMK treatment (Fig. 7F). Therefore we revealed a novel mechanism showing that caspase-8 is implicated in EV-A71-mediated IL-1β synthesis in macrophages (Fig. 8).

Figure 7 EV-A71 vRNA-triggered IL-1β release is dependent on active caspase-8. (A) Different amounts of EV-A71 viral RNA (0.5 1 and 2 µg) and 1 µg RD cells RNA were transfected into PMA-primed THP-1 cells for 12 h.

Mouse EHD4 (residues 22-541 EHD4ΔN) and the indicated mutants mouse EHD2 and EHD2ΔN (residues 19-543)22 were expressed from a modified pET28 vector as N-terminal His6-tag fusions followed by a PreScission protease cleavage site. Expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli host strain BL21(DE3)-Rosetta2 (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in TB medium and protein expression was induced at an optical density of 0.5 by the addition of 40 μM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) followed by overnight incubation at 18 °C. Compared to EHD4ΔN full-length EHD4 yields only insoluble protein with this expression approach. Upon centrifugation cells were resuspended in resuspension buffer (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 500 mM NaCl 25 mM imidazole 2 mM MgCl 2 2.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) 1 mM Pefabloc (Carl Roth) 1 µM DNase I (Roche)) and lysed in a microfluidizer. Following centrifugation (30000 g 1 h 4 °C) cleared lysates were applied to a NiNTA column. The column was then extensively washed with washing buffer (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 700 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 2  1 mM ATP 10 mM MgCl 2 10 mM KCl) and afterwards with equilibration buffer (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 500 mM NaCl 25 mM imidazole 2 mM MgCl 2 2.5 mM β-ME). The protein was eluted with elution buffer I (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 500 mM NaCl 2 mM MgCl 2 2.5 mM β-ME and 300 mM imidazole). Following the addition of 150 μg PreScission protease per 5 mg of protein the protein was dialyzed overnight against dialysis buffer (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 500 mM NaCl 1 mM MgCl 2 and 2.5 mM β-ME). Following re-application of the protein to a NiNTA column to remove the His-tag the protein was eluted with elution buffer II (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 500 mM NaCl 2 mM MgCl 2  2.5 mM β-ME and 50 mM imidazole). The cleaved protein was concentrated using 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off concentrators (Amicon) and applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with SEC buffer (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 500 mM NaCl 1 mM MgCl 2  and 2.5 mM β-ME). Fractions containing the EHD4 constructs were pooled concentrated and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The purified protein was nucleotide-free as judged by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis.

Liposome preparation

Liposomes were prepared by adding 50 µL of 50% Folch extract from bovine brain fraction I 40% phosphatidylethanolamine and 10% cholesterol to 200 μL of a chloroform/methanol (1:0.3 v/v) solution which was then dried on a glass surface under an argon stream. Lipids were resuspended in liposome buffer (20 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 150 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM β-ME) sonicated in a water bath for 30 sec and extruded through a 1 μm filter.

Tubulation assay

For membrane tubulation assays 10 μM EHD4ΔN EHD2 or EHD2ΔN in tubulation buffer were incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 1 mg/ml liposomes in the absence or presence of 1 mM of the indicated nucleotide.

ATPase assay

ATP hydrolysis of EHD4ΔN was studied at 30 °C in 20 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) 150 mM NaCl 2.5 mM β-ME and 0.2 mM MgCl 2 using 10 μM protein and 100 μM ATP as a substrate in the presence and absence of 1 mg/ml liposomes (see before). Reactions were started by adding the protein. At any given timepoint aliquots from the reaction were 6 times diluted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Hydrolysis was measured using HPLC measurement. The nucleotides were separated with a reversed-phase column (C18 100 mm × 4.6 mm) and detected by absorption at 254 nm. Quantification was done by integrating the corresponding nucleotide peaks (see Source Data). GraphPad Prism 7.05 was used to plot the curve.

Negative-stain EM

Liposomes at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 10 µM protein in the presence of 1 mM ATP. Samples were applied for 30 sec to carbon-coated formvar films mounted on copper grids excess liquid was removed and the sample stained for 30 sec with 2% uranyl acetate. Four areas on three different grids were monitored on a Talos L120C (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 120 kV equipped with a Ceta Detector to obtain representative images.

Cryo-electron microscopy and image processing

Complexes formed of EHD4ΔN and liposome were diluted with a buffer containing 10 nm colloidal gold. 4 µl of this mixture was applied on a glow-discharged Quantifoil R2/2 grid (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH) and flash-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark II device (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The grids were stored under liquid nitrogen conditions until usage. Initial data was recorded on a Talos L120C microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 120 kV. The final set of 56 tilt series was collected on a Titan Krios G3 electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan Quantum energy filter (slit with 20 eV) and a Gatan K2 detector using SerialEM 4.0 (ref. 56). The nominal magnification was 53000× resulting in a pixel size of 2.628 Å. The data was acquired at a tilt range from −60 to 60 degrees using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme57 at 3° increment. Tilt series were recorded as movies of 12 frames in counting mode and a dose rate of 2.3 e−/Å2 at defocus range of −3 to −6 um resulting in a total dose of 94 e−/Å2 per tilt series. Motion correction was carried out using MotionCor2 1.1.0 (ref. 58). The initial contrast transfer function defocus value for each image of the tilt series was estimated using CTFFind 4.1.10 (ref. 59). CTF correction was carried out by phase flipping using the program ‘ctf phase flip’ of the IMOD 4.11 software package60. Two copies of each tomogram were reconstructed using weighted back projection and seven rounds of the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) in IMOD 4.11 (ref. 60).

For comparison two grids of EHD4ΔN in the apo form were prepared and data collected on a Titan Krios G3i transmission electron microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific Server Version 2.15.3) operated at 300 kV equipped with an extra bright field-emission gun (XFEG) a BioQuantum post-column energy filter (Gatan) and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan Digital Micrograph Version 3.32.2403.0). Images were recorded in low-dose mode as dose-fractionated movies using SerialEM 4.0 in energy-filtered zeroloss (slit width 20 eV) nano-probe mode at a nominal magnification of 53000x (resulting in a calibrated pixel size of 0.84 Å/px on the specimen level) in super-resolution mode with a 70 µM objective aperture.

Subtomogram averaging

The workflow described uses a combination of Dynamo 1.1.157 and bespoke scripts from MATLAB version r2020b. Initial particle picking was done using a filament tracer by assigning the center of each tube. A first round of alignments was performed using SIRT-filtered reconstructed tomograms binned 3 times (7.884 Å/pixel). Particles for each tube were extracted using a box size of 128 pixels randomized along its azimuth averaged and low-pass filtered to 40 Å to generate the initial template for 3 rounds of coarse alignments. Oversampled particles converging onto the same coordinate were removed using Dynamo’s separation in the tomogram parameter. Each tube was aligned individually and sub-boxed along the membrane to generate a section of the tube (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Averaged sections were merged aligned to the template and low-pass filtered to 40 Å. Multi-reference analysis (MRA) was used to eliminate bad particles from the dataset. Next CTF-corrected subtomograms were extracted and aligned to low-pass filtered references and the dataset was further divided into two half datasets even and odd for independent processing. Iterations were carried out starting from binned 3X data using a low-pass filter of 20 Å angular sampling of 12° allowing shifts of 47 Å and refinements were gradually improved by decreasing the binning factor using less stringent low-pass filters and finer angular sampling. Final refinement steps were carried out on unbinned data extracted in 128 voxel boxes using a low-pass filter set at 8 Å angular sampling of 4° and shift limits of 10 Å. A total of 23813 subtomograms (11906 and 11907 for each half) contributed to the final average. Mask-corrected resolution assessment was carried out within the RELION 3.1 (ref. 61) postprocessing framework using a soft-edged mask around the central EHD4 tetramer yielding a resolution of 7.6 Å at the 0.143 FSC cut-off (Supplementary Fig. 4). Local resolution estimation and local filtering were applied using Phenix Local anisotropic sharpening and Phenix Local resolution map in Phenix 1.20 (ref. 62). Figures were prepared using The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System Version 2.5.0 Schrödinger LLC. Chimera 1.14 Chimera X 1.1 (ref. 63) and Blender 3.1 (http://www.blender.org).

Flexible fitting

The fitting procedure is summarized in Supplementary Movie 2. An atomic model consistent with the cryo-EM map was generated using MDfit with Gromacs 4.5.564. MDfit uses the cryo-EM map as an umbrella potential to bias (i.e. deform) an underlying structure-based model (SBM)65 in order to maximize the cross-correlation between the experimental density and the simulated electron density. An SBM is a molecular force field that is explicitly albeit not rigidly biased toward a certain native structure. The SBM for fitting was the EHD2 crystal structure (pdb code 4CID) with the sequence homology modeled by SWISS-MODELL66 to that of EHD4 (residues 22-535). The portion of the SBM for the KPF loop (residue 114-137) which is missing from the EHD2 structure is based on the EHD4 crystal structure (pdb code 5MVF). Building the SBM from the crystal structure ensured that the resulting model was maximally consistent with the crystal conformation. This entailed no significant changes in structure as the sequences are highly similar and included a missing loop in the crystal structure (residues 424–442). A preprocessing step was then necessary to move the EH domains within the dimer into a cis positioning because 4CID placed the EH domains in trans. This involved only the reorientation of the 424–442 loop no other residue positions were changed. We refer to this dimeric structure as EHD4-init. Since the EH domain is missing the SBM for the EH domain is generated from the EHD2 crystal structure (residues 443–538). An SBM using EHD4-init as the input structure was then generated using SMOGv2.3beta65 with the template “SBM_AA” meaning all nonhydrogen atoms were explicitly represented.

The density corresponding to the central two dimers within the cryo-EM map was chosen as the constraint for MDfit since this region had the best resolution. Relaxation of the SBM under the influence of the cryo-EM map is performed by molecular dynamics (MD) and thus requires an initial condition. Two EHD4-init were rigid body fit into the map using the “Fit in Map” tool of Chimera 1.1463. In order to compensate for the missing neighbors on either side of two dimers the translational symmetry of the filament was exploited. Two additional copies of EHD4-init were added positioned on either side placed such that each dimer-dimer interface was identical. Technically this was performed by 1) measuring the transformation X between the two central dimers in Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) 1.9.3 2) duplicating the central dimers and 3) applying X or -X to the duplicates. This four-dimer system served as the initial condition for MD. During MD the duplicates were given strong position restraints while the only constraint on the central dimers was the MDfit umbrella potential based on the cryo-EM map. Every 104 MD steps the duplicate dimers were repositioned. Through this iterative process the structure converged within 3×105 steps. The middle two dimers were taken as the atomic model. Note that even though the filament’s local C2 rotational symmetry was not explicitly enforced by us during MD the fact that the SBM was based on a C2 symmetric structure ensured that this symmetry was included.

Elastic model fitting

The fitted helical angle as a function of radius was defined by

$${{{{{\boldsymbol{\theta }}}}}}\left({{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}\right)\equiv {{{{{\rm{min }}}}}}\left[{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}\left({{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}-{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}_{{{{{{\bf{0}}}}}}}\right)}^{{{{{{\bf{2}}}}}}}+{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}}\left({{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}-{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}}_{{{{{{\bf{0}}}}}}}\right)}^{{{{{{\bf{2}}}}}}}+{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}}\left({{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}-{{{{{{\bf{90}}}}}}}^{\circ }\right)}^{{{{{{\bf{2}}}}}}}\right]$$ (1)

where the bit in brackets is an elastic energy and the min returns \({{{{{\boldsymbol{\theta }}}}}}\) such that the radius is r and elastic energy is minimized. κ is the curvature τ is the twist η is the dimer orientation with respect to the tube axis \({{{{{\boldsymbol{\theta }}}}}}\) is the helix angle and r is the radius of the tube. \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}}\)and \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}}\) are the spontaneous curvature and twist. Figure 5a (see also Source Data) shows the case for \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{}}}}}}\{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}\) where the twist elasticity and the dimer orientation are both negligible compared to filament curvature. Supplementary Fig. 7c shows two alternatives the first with \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{}}}}}}\{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}\) which is typical for continuous filaments and the second with \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{}}}}}}\{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{}}}}}}\{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{.}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{2}}}}}}\) which accounts for a preference for the dimer curvature to align perpendicular to the tube axis. For a constant helix \({{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}\frac{{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\boldsymbol{2}}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{+}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{h}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\boldsymbol{2}}}}}}}}\) and \({{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}\frac{{{{{{\boldsymbol{h}}}}}}}{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\boldsymbol{2}}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{+}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{h}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\boldsymbol{2}}}}}}}}\) and \({{{{{\boldsymbol{\theta }}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{\tan }^{{{{{{\boldsymbol{-}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}}\frac{{{{{{\boldsymbol{h}}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}\) where r is the radius and 2πh is the pitch. In our EHD4 filament the dimer is oriented approximately 30° relative to the helix angle defining \({{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{\theta }}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{+}}}}}}{{{{{{\mathbf{30}}}}}}}\)°. Therefore when \({{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}{=}}}}{{{{{{\mathbf{90}}}}}}}^{\circ }{{\equiv }}\) \({{{{{\boldsymbol{\theta }}}}}}{{=}}{{{{{{\mathbf{60}}}}}}}\)° the dimer’s footprint curvature is optimally oriented with respect to the membrane tube. The two best fits with \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}\) are performed using the Python library scipy.optimize.least_squares 1.7.1 with \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}}\)and \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}}\) as fitting parameters. The curve with \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{.}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{2}}}}}}\) uses \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}\frac{{{{{{\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{68}}}}}}}\{{{\mbox{nm}}}}^{{{{{{\boldsymbol{-}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}}\) and has no free parameters to be fitted. Note that there is an analytic form for the minimum energy line with \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{}}}}}}\{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}\) which is given by

$${{{{{\boldsymbol{\theta }}}}}}\left({{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}\right){{{{{\boldsymbol{=}}}}}}\sqrt{{\left({{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\kappa }}}}}}}_{{{{{{\bf{0}}}}}}}\right)}^{{{{{{\boldsymbol{-}}}}}}{{{{{\bf{1}}}}}}}\{{{{{\boldsymbol{-}}}}}}\{{{{{\bf{1}}}}}}}$$ (2)

The site is near Kenosha and 219th near Tractor Supply.

To many it looks like a construction site with a fence caution tape and signs. It's off a busy road with a business nearby but it's an area that needs some attention.

When the EPA was on-site they say they found Thorium 232 on the seven-acre site. They say it's a naturally occurring element that's slightly radioactive.

David Robertson with the EPA says Broken Arrow trash was disposed of here back in the 70s. Now he says they're putting layers of a clay cap over the site followed by grass seed a fence and a sign to prevent water wind or rain from getting on the site.

2 News spoke with a Broken Arrow resident that lives near the former landfill. He's concerned about what's going on underneath the ground and how it will impact the future.

“Think about resale. How is this going to affect the resale of homes in the future? Are you going to want to buy a house that is on an EPA superfund sight that might turn you green? I don’t know” says Keith Deaver.

Robertson says the land was sold to a private investor in the early 2000s. It will cost the EPA around $1.2 million to cap it but Robertson says that the investor could also be responsible for cleanup.

As long as the weather in the foreseeable future cooperates crews will be out here laying the clap cap. They expect to be done by the end of the week.

HESPERIA Calif. (VVNG.com) — Two conditional use permits have been filed with the City of Hesperia to construct approximately 1.8 million square feet of industrial warehouse space on approximately 97 acres of vacant land south of Target.

The two buildings will be constructed under one project with one being just over 1.1 million square feet and the other just over 740000 square feet.

Building 1 will be located on the east side of Mesa Linda Street immediately west of the I-15 Freeway and approximately 1000 feet south of Main Street with the Tractor Supply store further to the north.

(The green marking is the parcel of building 2 at the corner of Highway 395 and Poplar Street and building 1 is located on the right of it on Mesa Linda Street)

Building 2 will be constructed at the northeast corner of Highway 395 and Poplar Street. To the south of Building 2 is the Stepping Stone commercial/industrial business park followed by vacant land.

Given the size of the project it’s anticipated to support approximately 2309 permanent jobs once constructed according to the report.

(Various view points looking at building 2 from Highway 395. – Hesperia Staff Report)

The applicant for the project is Covington Group who broke a record last year when they completed the largest single acquisition of industrial properties in the Inland Empire totaling $270 million.

The 3.4 million square feet of warehouse and distribution buildings they acquired are at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville and include tenants such as Newell Brands M&M Mars Boeing and Plastipak Packaging.

The future tenants of the two warehouses are not yet known.

Last year a Covington Group affiliate sold 60 acres of its 200-acre portfolio investment of the Hesperia Commerce Center to Exeter Property Group which completed Modway.

According to September sales data compiled by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers total tractor sales dropped 12.8% in September 2022 compared to 2021 figures; year-to-date total tractor sales are even lower suffering a 14.3% drop.

But different tractor categories are experiencing different levels of success thus far. Sales of four-wheel-drive tractors fell 33% year-over-year in September but two-wheel-drive machines over 100 horsepower experienced 9.6% growth in the same month. Year-to-date figures paint a similar picture albeit at lesser amounts; four-wheel-drive sales are down 10.6% while the high horsepower two-wheel-drive tractors are up 11.6%.

“The ag equipment market as with most markets for manufactured goods is turbulent” said AEM’s Curt Blades in a statement. “Farmers want to take advantage of the efficiency gains and technology that new equipment brings to their operations especially with commodity markets being as positive as they are. However supply chain difficulties continue to weigh on our member manufacturers’ deliveries.”

Supply and price of semiconductor chips have been called major factors in the supply chain challenges facing equipment companies. One AEM member (AGCO head Eric Hansotia) recently told Agri-Pulse the company recently paid $1400 per chip – instead of the typical $10-$20 – to complete the building of some pieces of equipment.

Combines are another bright spot in the data with 6.6% year-over-year growth in September and a 3.4% increase in year-to-date sales.

Unaware tourists have reported being charged exorbitant prices for having their photos taken with artists in popular cities such as Las Vegas Paris and New York.

Some harass tourists trick them or go further even snatching the phones out of the hands of their hands refusing to give it back until they take a photo with them and give payment.

Stories of these sneaky tactics came to light when a traveler asked a question in a popular travel group for women: “In Las Vegas. Went to the strip the other day and my boyfriend got a photo with some of the Vegas Showgirls that were out on the sidewalk” she wrote.

“Before the photo was taken they said we work for tips and yes of course. After we took a photo he handed them $5. The girl said they wanted $40 each … for a picture? Am I out to lunch?

“What’s an appropriate tip for the street performers on the strip/freemont for a photo?”

She also expressed her surprise at how rough the people were: “They were pretty aggressive though. Almost ripped the wallet right from my boyfriend’s hands when he had it out.”

There were many responses to her question and it turns out that a lot of tourists had experienced the same thing.

One replied: “We had something similar happen while in NYC. Characters stopped us took my husband’s phone from his hand snapped a pic of my son with them then refused to give his phone back until we paid them.”

And another said her child had been targeted: “One of those class acts tried this and inappropriately grabbed my young child to convince us to take a photograph. Stay far away from them. They have no boundaries!”

While a third commented: “Eek. Just avoid them like the plague. They have people like that everywhere and in some places they will refuse to give your camera/phone back if they’ve taken the photo. Scam.”

And a fourth said: “Of course they don’t tell you what they ‘charge’ until after you’ve taken a photo ha! Total scam it’s so sleazy.”

Meanwhile another wrote: “$40 each?! Like someone else said if they required that much it should be known beforehand! Scam artists everywhere!”

Multiple stories also emerged about similar scams in New York.

4 Characters around Time Square will jump into photos with other characters to demand more money from unsuspecting tourists. Shutterstock

“I had a similarly awful experience in NYC in Times Square” a traveler said. “Stopped to have my daughter take a photo with one of the many dresses up characters roaming around.

“About eight of them jumped in the photo and they all demanded money. I handed a dollar to the one I agreed to a photo with and told the rest where to go. These photos things are some of the worst hustles I’ve seen while traveling.”

Another had a similar experience in the Big Apple: “I had the same exact experience in New York my son wanted to take a picture with Spider-Man and I had a $5 ready to give him cause I get it it’s their hustle and then a bunch of other characters jumped in.

“I grabbed my kid and walked away as they mumbled c–p under their breaths … and walked off.”

Lastly there’s another trick some performers use in some cities including Nashville US where they throw snakes on you.

“Walking away from showgirls and other streetwalkers is pretty easy” one tourist commented. “Imagine a street person that has snakes and tries to throw one on your neck while you are running away and then expect money.

“Yeah they will do anything to anyway walking by. Annoying as heck and amazed how many parents would encourage their very young kids to take pictures with the showgirls.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdGVsZWNvbS92aS1sYXVuY2hlcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJvYW1pbmctcGFja3MtdG8tdGFwLWludG8taG9saWRheS10cmF2ZWxsZXJzL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MTM3NTg2LmNtc9IBkAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdGVsZWNvbS92aS1sYXVuY2hlcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJvYW1pbmctcGFja3MtdG8tdGFwLWludG8taG9saWRheS10cmF2ZWxsZXJzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjEzNzU4Ni5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vi launches International Roaming packs to tap into holiday travelers,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

High School Athletic Association 1A state championship and being named the most valuable player of the championship game Mount Airy junior Tyler Mason received an offer from Virginia Tech.

Mason announced the news on his Twitter page noting that it is his first offer from a Power Five conference school. Mason said the offer came after a discussion with Virginia Tech special teams coordinator and running backs coach Stu Holt.

Mason helped Mount Airy to a 20-7 win over two-time defending state champion Tarboro on Saturday afternoon at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh. In the game Mason rushed for 139 yards and three touchdowns on 23 carries — scoring all three touchdowns for the Granite Bears.

For the season Mason has recorded 2299 yards and 49 touchdowns on 173 carries.

Mason a member of the Class of 2024 stands at 6-foot and 185 pounds.

Virginia Tech is just the third team to offer Mason joining Campbell and Appalachian State. His offer from the Mountaineers came just days ago following a five touchdown performance against Draughn in the 1A western regional championship game.

Notes/Observations: Solid opening win for the U.S. men. Biggest highlight came right away when Richards rolled up Zandanbud a 2022 world bronze medalist 10-0 to open the dual. Locked up a cradle for an exposure after an early takedown too. Only real hiccups came at 65-kg and 74-kg. At 65 Yianni never looked comfortable in 10-3 loss. Tumur Ochir a 2021 world bronze medalist did well controlling ties. Scored an early takedown and turn to lead 4-0 then iced the match with a 4-point arm-spin. At 74 Zandanbud never let Vincenzo find a rhythm rolling to an 8-0 lead. Mongolia closed the dual with Munkhtur a 2022 world silver medalist beating Zillmer 3-1. A 'Go Big Red' chant broke out for Berger and Burroughs who are both Nebraska alumni. Burroughs took a selfie with the Mongolia coach after his win which was fun. USA gets a tough Georgia team next.

Notes/Observations: Clean sweep for USA men's freestyle to polish off a perfect 2-0 day. They advance to the men's freestyle World Cup final on Sunday evening. Yianni bounced back with a fast-and-furious technical fall over Lomtadze a 2019 world champ securing an 11-0 win in just 1:21. Burroughs officially clinched the dual with a come-from-behind 5-3 win over Gamkrelidze a U23 world champ. And Zillmer capped off the perfect performance with yet another rally turning a 5-0 deficit into an 8-7 win to complete the sweep.

: Amit Elor (USA) over Qiandegenchagan (CHN) 5-0 76-kg: Dymond Guilford (USA) over Juan Wang (CHN) 7-2

Notes/Observations: Rough start here for the U.S. women. China came to wrestle and USA didn't match their intensity. USA failed to score a single match point in the first five matches and scored just 24 points total across all 10 weights. Elor and Guilford gave Team USA wins at the end but a tough all-around showing. Miracle and Velte both led their matches at one point — Miracle led 2-2 on criteria after a takedown in the second period; Velte led 8-2 after a 4-point blast-double — but both ultimately lost to 2022 world medalists. This China team is tough with four Senior world medalists plus some accomplished age-level world medalists but the USA women were outmatched and out-wrestled. They'll get the All-World Team next.

USA Women's Freestyle Round 3: 6-4 over All-World Team

50-kg : Erin Golston (USA) over Anna Lukasiak (Poland) 6-0

: Erin Golston (USA) over Anna Lukasiak (Poland) 6-0 53-kg : Maria Prevolaraki (Greece) over Felicity Taylor (USA) 4-1

: Zhamila Bakbergenova (Kazakhstan) over Skylar Grote (USA) 2-0 76-kg: Yelena Makoyed (USA) pinned Yasemin Adar (Turkey) in 3:32

Notes/Observations: Night-and-day difference from the U.S. women's freestyle team's first dual. After a rough start against China who ultimately made the final USA's women's freestylers thumped an incredibly-talented All-World team. It helped that Alex Hedrick accepted a forfeit at 57-kg but Kayla Miracle and Yelena Makoyed both beat world champs Mallory Velte locked up a second-period fall and Jenna Burkert beat a world bronze medalist. This win pushes the U.S. women's freestyle team into Sunday's third-place dual against Mongolia.

More results from wrestling's World Cup

Women's Freestyle Group A Round 1: Mongolia over Japan 5-5 (22-18 on tiebreakers)

Notes/Observations: How's this for an opening-round stunner? Mongolia women rally from down 4-1 to beat Japan via tiebreaker criteria (which is explained below) after the dual end 5-5 in matches. Japan entered the favorite in the women's freestyle competition despite sending a young team that doesn't have a ton of Senior-level experience but is still very credentialed at the various age-level world tournaments. This might throw a wrench into how Group A in women's freestyle gets decided today. Stay tuned.

Men's Freestyle Group B Round 1: Iran over Japan 9-1

Notes/Observations: Iran thumps Japan in the men's freestyle Group B opener. Japan's only win came at 61-kg where Kaito Morikawa won by a 13-2 technical fall. Otherwise Iran rolled closing with five consecutive technical fall victories from 79-kg through heavyweight. Impressive performance to start.

Men's Freestyle Group A Round 2: Georgia over Mongolia 7-3

Notes/Observations: Mongolia won two of the first three weights then Georgia rolled winning the next five in a row twice by tech another by fall and accepting a pair of forfeits. Mongolia won't advance to Sunday's placement rounds after dropping both duals on Saturday. Georgia's win sets up a winner-to-the-final matchup with the United States in Session III. Should be fun!

Women's Freestyle Group A Round 2: Ukraine over Mongolia 7-3

Notes/Observations: After Mongolia won the first two weights Ukraine rolled up back-to-back-to-back pins to surge ahead 3-2 then closed the dual by winning the final four weights highlighted by Kateryna Zelenykh's WILD 12-10 win over Orkhon Purevodrj at 65-kg. It sets up an interesting dynamic in Session III. If Ukraine can beat Japan that would send Ukraine to Sunday's finals and also knock out Japan. But if Japan wins we'd need tiebreakers to decide Group A's final placements in women's freestyle. Stay tuned!

Men's Freestyle Group B Round 2: All-World over Japan 9-1

Notes/Observations: Tough sledding for Japan men's freestyle today but Kaito Morikawa went 2-0 today with two technical falls at 61-kg. That's good stuff. These All-World teams are stacked though. After Morikawa won to make it 1-1 after two weights it was all All-World the rest of the way. They rolled up six technical falls to cruise to victory setting up a winner-goes-to-the-finals matchup against Iran in Session III.

Women's Freestyle Group B Round 2: China over All-World 5-5 (22-19 tiebreakers)

Notes/Observations: WILD dual here and China emerges on a walk-off win from Juan Wang 5-1 over two-time world champion Yasemin Adar of Turkey giving China a criteria win after the dual ended 5-5 in matches. China won the first four matches then the All-World team rattled off five consecutive victories. Then Wang won to force the dual-meet tiebreaker. That's the second dual today that's required a tiebreaker to decide the winner.

Women's Freestyle Group A Round 3: Ukraine over Japan 5-5 (24-17)

Notes/Observations: Japan's young star-studded roster drops its second 5-5 dual this time to Ukraine and gets bounced from the women's freestyle World Cup. Ukraine won two matches via shutout plus one by fall and another by forfeit to go 2-0 on Saturday and advance to Sunday's World Cup final against China. An awesome story gets much much cooler.

Men's Freestyle Group B Round 3: Iran over All-World 6-4

Notes/Observations: Iran won the final two bouts to close out the All-World Team and finish the day 2-0 setting up the highly-anticipated men's freestyle World Cup final between Iran and the United States. Giddy up!

Want this delivered to your inbox? Subscribe to future newsletters here.

It sounds like something out of a dystopian science fiction thriller — faceless headless police robots armed and authorized to kill with the push of a button.

“We all saw that movie…no killer robots” San Francisco protesters wrote on a picket sign last week as they opposed a move by city leaders to authorize police use of lethal force with department-issued robots. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved the measure.

The backlash was so severe that board members quickly reversed the decision Tuesday sending parts of the proposed law back to a committee for further review.

But across the country the debate is just beginning over how much power if any police departments should be giving to “robocops.”

Honolulu police last year used SPOT a $150000 robodog purchased with federal COVID relief money to take the temperatures of people at a homeless camp. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the practice as dehumanizing to people looking for shelter.

The New York Police Department similarly leased a futuristic-looking robotic dog from manufacturer Boston Dynamics as part of a test program in December 2020. The department used it in several instances including a hostage situation in the Bronx. By April 2021 after months of criticism the department ended its lease and returned the robot which officials had nicknamed Digidog. Boston Dynamics and several other robot manufacturers in October condemned the use of firearms on robots but others have equipped robots with sniper rifles and other weapons.

In spite of the failed attempts to introduce police robots at some departments other cities like St. Petersburg Florida seem determined to keep their police robot dogs. And the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is pursuing plans to deploy robot dogs at the borders.

Proponents of the equipment highlight the usefulness of robots for tasks like defusing bombs providing surveillance in hostage situations and in their most lethal capacity injuring or killing people to stop them from attacking other human beings.

In this way police robots are not new. In 2016 Dallas police used a robot armed with a pound of C-4 explosives to kill a man who had fatally shot several police officers.

“We believe that we saved lives by making this decision” Dallas Police Chief David Brown told CNN shortly afterwards. “And you know again I appreciate critics but they’re not on the ground and their lives are not being put at risk by debating what tactics to take. And I’ll leave that to them for a later discussion.”

What remains largely untested however is how America’s courts will treat police robots in comparison with their human counterparts.

Much of the court-established standards on use of force and qualified immunity — a legal doctrine that generally shields officers from lawsuits for what they do on the job — relies on contact between human police officers and the people they encounter. The line establishing qualified immunity for example hinges on what “a reasonable officer” would perceive to be a deadly threat. How will the courts use that standard to account for robots even those that are operated by human beings?

And what will happen when the robot malfunctions or otherwise compromises a criminal case? In a Florida murder case last year police and prosecutors blamed a police-deployed robot for possibly moving a bullet shell casing found at the alleged crime scene.

It’s also unclear how the courts would assess a case in which a robot is involved in a crime like killing someone unlawfully. International courts have found that robots lack the ability to form criminal intent. An international tribunal in the former Yugoslavia suggested that in cases like these the robot’s operator is at fault. But what if the operator claims the machine malfunctioned or that he or she didn’t receive proper training on how to use it? None of these questions account for lawsuits in use-of-force cases or for cases involving robots that rely on artificial intelligence instead of direct human controls.

Controversy also surrounds the secrecy from law enforcement and prosecutors when it comes to sophisticated electronic equipment originally developed for the military. As San Francisco decides what to do about police robots the California Supreme Court could soon consider whether the public should have access to search warrants and other court records related to police use of electronic surveillance from cell phone tracking devices.

No other place like home.

It's a small town. We just want to be able to take care of our own. Banks come and they go. Why this one is leaving is not being explained.

People were wondering what are we going to do?

That's just one more negative against us that we didn't have anything to do with that we can't help.

You have to go back to how banks started and who they were created to serve.

Redlining basically isolated African-American people for almost 100 years.

When you have unequal access to the banking system you end up with unequal outcomes.

In Mississippi there are actually more payday lenders per capita than Starbucks.

There's cash on the top no credit checks instant approval. Those are some of the terms that they use.

My banking is important. My dollars matter.

The social contract with banks has been broken.

Coffeeville is a great place to live. We have school systems. We have a courthouse. We have drugstores. We have other businesses that are keeping us alive and well. They just need more people involved with the growth process the beautification process.

We got a notice early part of the year said we had 90 days. We're closing. We're moving out. They were to notify all people that had accounts there. It was very shocking in a sense. Elderly was really crying because of the commute. The businesses were complaining. It's just difficult to handle business here when we don't have banking.

So where are we going now?

This is The Ville. It's the most recent restaurant that opened here.

I own the restaurant The Ville and that's where we're at here in Coffeeville. It's a little hole in the wall and we got really good food. We were voted in the top five best beef burgers in Mississippi last year. It's very much a community place.

I like living in Coffeeville a lot more than I would probably like to admit. As far as the town you can't find better people that work together and mostly get along. It's just hard when you're losing everything and you have to go somewhere else for everything.

Before the bank closed they were literally two blocks from us. So I could send somebody walking to go get change if we needed it. And now I have to drive 20 25 minutes one way. It doesn't seem like it would be that big a deal but you can't even just go to the other businesses and swap change because they have to keep what they've got. And then you have to be a female driving all that way with that whole week's deposit by yourself. You get a little nervous. People pay attention. They know when you're coming and going. They know where you're going. So it's definitely been a hardship.

How does that make you feel knowing that your community is a banking desert?

I am heartbroken for Coffeeville because that's such a negative thing to have attached to our name when we really are good people.

Hello Mr Taylor.

Hey how you doing?

Got some visitors here.

All right. My name is Jermaine Taylor. I am a screen printer. I make bulk T-shirts. Everything is in bulk. I've been doing it self-employed eight years here in Coffeeville.

So tell us a little bit about the bank in Coffeeville.

Where my business is located is just actually footsteps away from the bank. I didn't have to worry about spending money in gas or anything like that. I don't make deposits every day or twice a day any more. Sometimes it's once a week. Sometimes it's the next week later and that becomes a security issue. There's plenty of money in this town and it's definitely not a desert town.

My wife and I own the local newspaper here in Coffeeville. It's called The Coffeeville Courier. My business is a little different from everybody else's. The hamburger place sells hamburgers. I sell advertising. Well that depends on this town to advertise for different things to promote their business to help promote our school. Well if businesses are closing or businesses won't come here because of the banking issues then that hurts our... it hurts everybody. And you take away the business side of it and just look at the community itself.

It made it hard on the citizens young and old alike. People were wondering what are we going to do? What happens to our money that's in this bank? We need a bank. If I wanted to buy a house I need a bank to be able to go in and sit down and speak with a loan officer.

The federal government has designated Coffeeville as a banking desert. How does that make you feel?

Unimportant neglected in some way like a second class citizen. And I'm not. I am important. My banking is important. My dollars matter.

Banking is pretty well the lifeline of this community right now. Everybody's wanting a bank. They want businesses. They want housing but they're crying about the bank.

There are less branches in black communities less branches in low income communities. And so when a branch closes it has a disproportionate impact. We've seen about 7000 branches close since 2017 about 4000 since the start of the pandemic in March of 2020. So the pace of branch closures has really accelerated which is partially driven by the fact that people are doing more banking online but it's also driven by profitability.

A lot of communities - especially in the southwest of the US southeast certain areas in the Midwest - that have generally been in decline have lost their banks. So as banks merge they close up their inefficient branches. That's part of the model for banking.

Banking deserts exist across the country but they are more concentrated in places like the Deep South in communities of colour in inner city urban neighbourhoods.

Having a relationship - a good relationship - with a financial institution is really what paves the way and helps people build assets so that they can also build generational wealth.

The primary driver of wealth the primary asset on most Americans' balance sheet is a home.

Most of the ways in which Americans build wealth involves borrowing money. So when you have unequal access to the banking system you end up with unequal outcomes.

The inequality comes not from your great great great grandfather. It comes from who got to own a home in 1950. Who was being helped by the federal government? Who had access to that capital?

It's historical. We have to get a good understanding of why people act the way they act.

I like to tell the story of the Freedman's bank. When we look at inequality in America we see pretty deep divides on the basis of race. A lot of that comes from access to banking services both historical and in present day.

African-Americans have had a long history in this country of being denied opportunity to financial structures and institutions. So you can go to slavery. You could go to the post-slavery period called Reconstruction in America where there was the creation of the Freedman Bank and the creation of some institutions to help African-Americans.

The result of the Civil War was the collapse of the southern banking system. The United States Army still occupied the south. And so they had all of these soldiers many of them who were African-American and they had to figure out how do they pay them. So one of the things was to create a bank the Freedman's Bureau Bank which allowed the government to pay these soldiers but also to set up a means for the newly freed to save their money.

It was a big name institution based right here in Washington DC right next to the White House.

Millions of dollars were saved by these newly freed people.

A lot of the people in the community at the time were under the impression that their savings and their wages would be federally insured.

What happened was with the Freedman's bank it took a series of really risky bets on railroads on other investments and went bankrupt and lost everybody all their money. So there's really good reasons why people distrust the banking system.

Why is there a gap between communities of colour and banks in this country? And I think what you find is that oftentimes there is a lack of trust.

I was born in 1940. People in my community they didn't trust the banks because the banks collapsed.

The urban development though is crucial to understand another dimension that banks played. This is where the wealth of the 21st century is being created opportunity to access to land and capital in urban areas and the jobs that go with them. Part of that is to create these dividing lines that the banks underwrote and creating these segregated housing patterns.

How do we do that? Well we build massive subdivisions which end up replicating the patterns that have been put in place at the beginning of the 20th century. And these maps that are drawn by the federal agencies charged with this have red lines to indicate these aren't good neighbourhoods.

Redlining refers to the practise that banks and the federal government used to have of really drawing red lines on a map around certain neighbourhoods and grading every neighbourhood from more desirable to less desirable. Nine times out of 10 the places that were redlined that were deemed to be less desirable were minority neighbourhoods immigrant neighbourhoods. And so banks in redlined communities would not make loans.

We're not going to underwrite mortgages for this community. We're not going to insure houses in this community. And we're not going to give business loans in this community.

Racial segregation and discrimination was very much baked into the credit model the banking model. The racial wealth gap first of all that wealth was very much about housing. It's the entire Midwest Southwest Southeast and in inner cities that were redlined.

The flow of capital repeated into white-only neighbourhoods continued to cut off black neighbourhoods.

You would have banks saying well this is a risk decision. This is not a race decision.

Every single subsidy that built the middle class whether it's the homestead loans the farm loans the New Deal mortgage student loans all of those - not accidentally but explicitly - exempted certain races black predominantly also Mexican Japanese. Because 96 per cent to 99 per cent of all mortgages from 1934 until around 1970 were funded by the FHA that those neighbourhoods never got mortgages.

What they got instead were things like contract loans instalment loans. They were paying twice or three times as much in rent. Your school taxes were linked to your mortgage the roads the parks all of the goodies of the sort of make America great was provided through those subsidised mortgages. And that is the American dream and it was very much financed by the federal government. And if you were not a white male breadwinner you did not get that loan.

Our studies have shown that 70 per cent of communities that were redlined in the 1930s are still low income today.

Land ownership sits at the basis of all capital. And so that history of not being treated equally or fairly in our system is what caused the racial wealth gap.

It starts at the root I think when you look at the disparities between communities of colour and those relationships with financial institutions at the very foundation of relationships themselves have not been created or nurtured. And so you find that in many communities of colour they rely on other alternative lenders.

And in the absence of a bank or credit union the payday lenders the check cashers the financial predators come in and fill the gap.

I said that there were two banking systems. One that is incredibly federally subsidised that plugs in directly to the Fed. And that system largely serves those who have wealth or have enough money to put in a bank account. And then there's this whole other Wild West system.

You look right across the street. There's one here right on the corner. It says cash on the top no credit checks instant approval. Those are some of the terms that they use. I really believe that with the payday lending places the advantage that they have is it's instant and they can just go in and get a loan and come right back out with it but not thinking long term how it really affects them and how it really puts them back in the hole.

In Mississippi there are actually more payday lenders per capita than Starbucks. Payday lenders they are creative. They will pop up in the smallest of places. It is simply put a way for people to have access to small dollar amounts - they're limited at $500 here in the state - on a short-term basis typically 30 days or less with incredibly high interest rates. In Mississippi that's 521 per cent APR. That oftentimes the principal is never repaid and people just end up in a spiralling trap of debt that can take years or decades to break out of.

Relying on these kind of piecemeal solutions instead of a one-stop financial servicer i.e. a bank means that you do end up spending a lot more money for basic services.

What is it about the Delta region that draws these predatory lenders here?

I don't think it's a secret when we look at Mississippi and how it's ranked amongst everything - healthcare education - pretty much ranked last in a lot of things. So it's not surprising to me that large employers or corporations would take advantage of a population that they think is not educated enough to understand what they're getting themselves into.

We're here to talk about financial planning how to create wealth how to keep your money and the dos and don'ts of your money. It's very important especially coming from a small town because we don't have a whole lot here. And we're actually trying to build the community up for the younger generation that's coming along. And if they don't ways to actually make money and be able to create generational wealth then the small town and the town surrounding will continue to go down.

For my experience I don't think most banks here in Mississippi are fair to a lot of loaners. I just think that if there is a system for loaners it should be a system for everybody and not for one group of people.

We use a lot of little community banks around here. Others prefer not to use banks.

Why do you think people go to the payday lenders instead of a bank?

Because it's easier to get money from them than it is from the bank because if your credit is not a certain thing sometimes the banks won't let you get the money.

I tried to buy a house and it was just one thing after another. We need your bank statement. We need your bills. What did you do in 2015? What happened? Why you weren't working? I didn't try to get a house in 2015. I tried to get a house in 2021. Why can't we talk about what I'm doing now?

In areas that are rundown or have a lot of poor not really middle class people they feel like they can feed off of that because they know that they don't have the money especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck.

I don't know. It's just hard. It's hard. And it hurts because you want to do so much for your family. And you know your kids see you're hurting and they see you wanting to do better and they see you struggling. And they're Mum what's wrong? What's going on?

All of our products and services are regulated at both the state level and the federal level. What we offer is basic financial services that are transparent that are convenient that are cost-effective and that provide a bridge for our customers.

There's this facade of informality. They all have different signs and it looks to be embedded in the community. They will have two payday lenders owned by the same company on the same block with different signs pretending like they're different companies. So that's a model that is used.

Many of our customers are either subprime customers or have thin or no credit files so that they are somewhat of a greater risk.

Here's what payday lenders do that banks don't. So payday lenders and check cashers have their fees listed usually. And each week you may pay $50 to renew that loan. Now that is an absurd interest rate to keep rolling over that loan but it's predictable. With banks there are pages and pages of legalese and jargon that is purposefully meant to bury that APR rate or that they may change the fees one month to the next.

Our customers are intelligent. They understand their financial lives. To assume that our customers get trapped is a criticism of our customers. An annual percentage rate contemplates that a loan will be outstanding for a year. Our products are often paid off in a much shorter period of time. That annual percentage rate will distort the actual cost of the credit.

Also here with us today is the great Bill Bynum the CEO of Hope Credit Union.

And Mr Bynum as you know has helped connect so many people in Mississippi and across the south with the opportunity and yes with hope.

We were very excited to be able to host Vice President Harris earlier this year. We invited her to come to the Delta to see first-hand the opportunities that exist and how the administration could leverage its efforts alongside community development financial institutions like Hope. In many of the towns that Hope is located many neighbourhoods where we're located we are the only financial institution. 80 per cent of our branches are in communities of colour. 30 per cent are in rural areas.

Credit unions and banks differ in some fundamental ways but mostly it's who owns the institution. All credit unions are owned by their members whether you have $1000000 or $10 in deposits you have one vote for the board and for key policy decisions.

I think in many cases financial institutions often don't know their neighbourhoods or communities well enough particularly communities of colour. And so they actually need CDFIs as partners to help them not only identify the need but to come up with solutions on providing affordable access and credit to underserved communities.

I'd describe the Delta region as an amazing part of this country. It produced some of the most innovative people not just BB King or the writers and the musicians and artists. But just imagine people who do so much who survive with less. So there's systemic disparities in the banking system.

Black entrepreneurs are three times more likely to report that they did not apply for credit for fear of being turned away by a bank. Black and Latino homeowners are rejected at a higher rate when applying for home loans from traditional financial institutions even when they have credit profiles similar to other applicants.

We've been fortunate to be able to go into communities in many cases where banks have closed and convert those banks into a credit union branch. One great example is Moorhead Mississippi.

Hello Taylor.

Hi. Thanks for having us.

Yeah. Well it's good to have you guys here in our small community. My name is George Holland again and I'm the mayor here in the town of Moorhead. I've been mayor for 14 years. I was born here. My family were sharecroppers. It was 13 of us in a small house two and a half miles east of Moorhead.

Moorhead is known for where the Southern crossed the Yellow Dog. Those two railroads cross here in Moorhead. And that was back in the early 1900s late 1800s everything moved by rail. And Moorhead started out to be the largest community the largest city in the Delta.

When I was a kid this town was hustling and bustling. It was a real productive town. Friday evening and Saturday evening you couldn't hardly walk down these streets for the traffic for people but now it's just dead.

When I went to Moorhead to talk to Mayor Holland and tell him that the bank branch was closed he invited me to get in his truck and drove me around the town. He showed me the community. He showed me a neighbourhood called Eastmoor where homes had been built in the '70s to bring the workers the black former plantation workers closer into town so that it would be more accessible to the businesses that relied on them. But it was built outside the city limits interestingly largely because they wanted to limit the impact of those residents on local elections.

And the houses were built. They were built terrible quality. And it didn't take long before you saw running sewage in the streets. There were electrical fires. Some people died in some of those fires. So we were able to work with the mayor work with some of our partners and bring capital into that community. And we ultimately have renovated every home in that neighbourhood. That's what a bank does. That's what a bank should do. It is the primary economic engine for many communities particularly in small towns.

And I believe it was 2015 that Hope filled the void that really really changed things here in this community.

When a bank leaves we'll try to negotiate a contribution both of the facility and of financial resources to help us to invest in getting that branch to a level where it can perform as a community development finance institution. And in some cases we've been able to work with institutions that have been open to that. In other cases we've had to go to the Senate and to the House and ask policymakers to hold them accountable because there are laws that require that banks reinvest in communities where they extract a profit.

I think banking is a utility just like water. Nobody would think about cutting off water that goes to everybody's house. If you don't have access to credit you really can't fully participate not only in the financial system but in the democracy.

The social contract with banks has been broken. We give you the Federal Reserve liquidity. And in return you serve the communities. If we're going to support the system let it serve everybody. I don't think this is a problem that the market should fix. It was a problem created by policy. Banks run on policy. We manage banks through a variety of different regulations and laws. We should make sure that those laws are serving the communities that are most vulnerable.

So there's something called the Community Reinvestment Act that's a long-standing obligation on banks to serve low and moderate income communities. It ensures that they both provide basic banking services there are other tests that go along with lending and investment. That actually is undergoing a big review right now in the United States. And so it's really going to be modernised to take into account the very different way that banking services are both delivered and consumed.

It was written in 1977 and it was to reverse redlining. We hardly had the globalised digitised system that we have today. So it certainly needs an update.

It's easier to tweak something that exists than it is to create something new because we need to really just take a look at what's tried and true what's in place.

We are encouraged by the trend which shows a steady decline in the total share of unbanked households. Banks around the country through American Bankers Association is really determined to make progress in bringing not just the total number down but making sure that communities of colour all across the nation have a lower percentage of being unbanked.

It is still the case that the average American lives within proximity of 25 bank branches. That is not to say that is everybody and we are working hard and acknowledge the problem. It is also true that the digitisation of banking services means that there is less demand in some cases for customers to go into bank branches.

The pandemic forced a change in consumer behaviour. Banks have been talking about digitisation for years and years and years. They want more people to use their app. It's cheaper for them.

The goal is to get everyone on digital. The problem is that those very same communities that are banking deserts don't have broadband. We're talking about elderly populations. We're talking about tribes. We're talking about places where there aren't the same kind of systems.

I think banks will benefit by really expanding how they look not only at those populations that have been traditionally unbanked or underbanked but also the opportunities that are available if they bring them into that system and help grow the customers themselves.

Everybody who's outside of the banking system is a potential customer and banks want customers. One of the most important solutions we see that's really bearing fruit is encouraging our banks to offer what are called Bank On certified accounts a basic bank account that is fully functional but it also has a special set of guardrails so that people who are not experienced with having a bank account can be completely confident.

This really starts with the inability to access capital and credit. There need to be a number of solutions.

Saying financial literacy is something needed is not to say that you're illiterate. It is just to say that you can't be no more than what your experiences allow you to be.

By the time they get out of high school they should know how to do a checking account and a savings account and et cetera because this is core to how you build wealth in America.

More financial education and addressing some of that distrust would go a long way towards creating a smaller unbanked and underbanked population.

The banks ought to take a hard look at whether or not they can create mechanisms within themselves to deal with helping to repair things that are awry in our system. More than anything else ownership closes the financial wealth gap.

Can we create an instrument here that says we can put people in housing with no downpayment?

As we become a nation that's more diversified in terms of our demographics you can't make it if you have 50 per cent homeownership among black and Latino families.

If African-Americans are excluded from that financial mainstream more than likely they don't have a savings plan to provide even greater benefit for their children. That becomes then a community problem.

The belief of this country is that if people work hard and do the right thing we all should succeed and we should all be able to have economic mobility. But that contract isn't true for everyone because when people don't feel like they can be part of the society - the social contract is broken for them - then they operate outside of that society.

If the market isn't benefiting a majority of people then we need to rethink what kind of market we have.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIyL3NlbmF0b3JzLWFzay1yZWd1bGF0b3JzLXRvLWludmVzdGlnYXRlLWJhbmtzLWFuZC1jcnlwdG8tZmlybXMtY2l0aW5nLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tc3RhdGUtYmFuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senators ask regulators to investigate bank and crypto ties citing Washington state bank,"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren at a 2019 campaign rally in Seattle. (GeekWire File Photo / Todd Bishop)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) are pressing U.S. bank regulators to investigate the ties between the banking industry and cryptocurrency firms including Farmington Wash.-based Moonstone Bank.

“Banks’ relationships with crypto firms raise questions about the safety and soundness of our banking system and highlight potential loopholes that crypto firms may try to exploit to gain further access to banks” the senators wrote in letters sent Wednesday addressed to the Federal Reserve the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Warren and Smith reference a Nov. 23 report in the New York Times that revealed how Moonstone received $11.5 million in venture funding from Alameda Research a sister company of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. They also note that Jean Chalopin who is the head of Moonstone’s parent company FBH is also the chair of Bahamas-based Deltec Bank. Deltec’s most well-known client is Tether a crypto company with $65 billion in assets.

Moonstone Bank formerly known as Farmington State Bank was acquired in 2020 by FBH. Farmington State Bank changed its name just before the FTX investment.

By acquiring Farmington Moonstone received a banking charter a business license required for U.S. financial institutions handling deposits and offering other bank-like services. Moonstone now describes itself as a “chartered digital bank” employs several people in the Seattle region and is based in Bellevue Wash. according to its LinkedIn page.

Banking experts previously told GeekWire that bank acquisitions require a significant amount of due diligence from regulators. Given that Moonstone was partly owned offshore and was involved in crypto the deal should have raised more regulatory flags they said.

Farmington has its origins in the tiny town of Farmington Wash. near the Washington-Idaho border. The lender founded in 1887 previously provided agriculture-focused loans.

Before it started raising capital to transform into a tech-focused bank Farmington had just three staff members and was the 26th-smallest bank in the U.S. out of 4800 The New York Times reported. Its net worth was $5.7 million according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and it did not offer online banking or credit cards.

The Times reported that in the third quarter this year the bank’s deposits grew nearly 600% to $84 million. A majority of the increase came from four new accounts according to the Times.

Warren has long been a skeptic of crypto. She has repeatedly warned that the nascent industry is ripe for financial crimes is dangerous for consumers and is a threat to the environment because of the amount of energy it takes to mine bitcoin and other digital assets.

Lawmakers are set to hold two hearings next week over the collapse of FTX. The company’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried said on Twitter Friday that he would appear before the congressional committees.

Warren and Smith closed the letter with a list of questions probing the bank regulators “to better understand the scope of the banking system’s exposure to the crypto industry and how banking regulators currently assess crypto-bank relationships.”

FTX has a connection to another Seattle-area company: last year its venture arm participated in a $70 million round in Seattle-based Protego Trust Bank a crypto bank that was granted a conditional banking charter in February 2021. Protego was not mentioned in the senators’ letter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbGEudXJiYW5pemUuY2l0eS9wb3N0L3dlZWtseS1oZWFkbGluZXMtZGVjZW1iZXItMTAtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L.A. ranks as world's 4th most expensive city Flood of evictions looms and more,"The game of musical chairs in Downtown L.A. office buildings continues.

This week Brookfield Properties announced that law firm Mayer Brown has signed a new 11-year lease for a 55000-square-foot office space on two floors of the Wells Fargo Center on Bunker Hill. Designed by Aref & Assocaites the new space includes a two-story atrium and an indoor-outdoor terrace.

That news comes just one week after Silverstein Properties announced five leases totaling 72000 square feet of space at the U.S. Bank Tower a few blocks away. New tenants include:

civil engineering firm Walter P. Moore which will relocate from 707 Wilshire Boulevard in Summer 2023 to a 9364-square-foot space on the 72nd floor;

investment bank Lincoln International which expanded its footprint in the U.S. Bank Tower through a 10-year 27117-square-foot lease on the 66th and 67th floors;

investment bank Rothschild & Co which moved from the 67th floor to a new 8544-square-foot space on the 50th floor;

personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan which will open its first Los Angeles office in a 7612-square-foot space on the 22nd floor; and

an unspecified management firm which will relocate from Century City to a 19208-square-foot space on the 69th and 70th floors over a 12-year lease.

The game is part of an effort to highlight athletic talent from schools that might otherwise escape the notice of college recruiters.

The players — all high school seniors — split into two teams designated by red and white jerseys and took to the field after a coin toss by U.S. Sen. Tina Smith. Hundreds of friends and family cheered them on from the stands.

Just after stepping off the field at halftime Gaabi Boucha of Warroad High School said it was a thrill to play on NFL turf.

“It’s breathtaking honestly. I came out for warmups and it really just took my breath away just looking up and seeing stands go as high as the sky” he said.

Boucha is Ojibwe and plays running back and middle linebacker. He was one of 75 athletes including three from Minnesota chosen for the Indigenous Bowl.

Bennae Calac is executive director of the 7G Foundation — the Native American advocacy group that sponsors the event. She says past Indigenous Bowl players have caught the eye of college coaches including at the University of Minnesota Morris.

“A lot of our athletes have gone on to play at different colleges: [Division] II DIII I think we had a DI” she said. “We have helped continue their dreams to obtain their education as well as continue playing in football.”

She said the effort a partnership with the NFL started in 2017 to provide mentorship and skills development to promising Native athletes. This year nearly 500 students submitted applications.

Calac — who’s with the Pauma Band of Luiseño Indians in southern California — said winnowing the roster down to 75 participants is a painstaking process. That’s because Indian Country high schools are generally small and many don’t have the resources to enable athletes to submit videos of themselves in action.

“And so what we have to do is call the individuals’ schools we have to track them down but we do it because we believe in the opportunity” Calac said.

Lyle Uses Arrow Jr. drove from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota to watch the game. He said his nephew — Adam Eagle Shield — found out about the Indigenous Bowl on social media and was thrilled to be able to play on the Vikings’ home field.

“This is something we never dreamed about. We always talked about coming to games here but we never got around to it because we’re so busy” he said. “But this is something a real eye opener and it’s awesome to be here.”

This is the second year that the Vikings have hosted the Indigenous Bowl. Calac said she hopes to grow the event to include regional competitions to ensure that more talented Native high school football players get the opportunities that they deserve."

The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate

NEW ORLEANS — Yolanda Dillion had recently started driving for Uber as a way to make ends meet. The 54-year-old from New Orleans had a master’s degree in sociology from Tulane University and 10 years on the job as a budget analyst with the New Orleans Police Department relatives said.

“She was just trying to pay her bills and get out of debt” said Dillion’s cousin Marlene Riley 62 who called her a kind and humble person.

But Dillion was unaware that the last passenger she picked up Thursday afternoon had deadly intentions. Just moments after she arrived at his destination the Travelodge hotel in Harvey authorities say Brandon Jacobs 29 attacked and stabbed her at least twice from the back seat of her vehicle before pulling out his cell phone and recording the aftermath.

Jacobs and Dillion did not know each other and there was no motive for the stabbing Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said Friday afternoon at a news conference.

“He woke up yesterday morning and decided he was going to kill someone” Lopinto said.

‘Uber picked her’

Jacobs was taken into custody Thursday night just outside of his room at the Travelodge in the 2000 block of the West Bank Expressway. He admitted killing Dillion and was booked with second-degree murder Lopinto said.

Earlier in the day Jacobs had ordered an Uber that transported him from the hotel to a location in New Orleans. Jacobs intended to kill that first driver but changed his plans when he realized he wouldn’t have ride back to his hotel Lopinto said.

Instead Jacobs ordered a second Uber and Dillion accepted the fare. When investigators asked him why he selected Dillion as his victim Lopinto said Jacobs replied: “I didn’t pick her. Uber picked her.”

Jacobs published the cell phone video he recorded after the stabbing onto his Facebook account authorities said. The Sheriff’s Office later worked with the social media company to remove the video Friday morning.

Jacobs fled the crime scene and made his way back to his room in the hotel.

Investigators reached out to Uber to identify Dillion’s passenger but the company couldn’t immediately provide that information — the fare had to be officially closed using the app on Dillion’s cell phone Lopinto said. Detectives located the phone in her vehicle and closed the fare enabling them to eventually identify Jacobs as a suspect.

They determined he was staying at the hotel and arrested him when he emerged from his room to smoke a cigarette Lopinto said.

“She encountered the wrong person at the wrong time and unfortunately she lost her life because of it” Lopinto said.

Outgoing friendly soul

Dillion lived with and was a caretaker for her mother Edna Dillion 83. “She took good care of me” Edna Dillion said Friday.

Yolanda Dillion was an only child who was born and raised in New Orleans. She graduated from Marion Abramson High School before earning a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Xavier University

An outgoing and friendly soul Dillion was well known at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church where she was a lector who read scripture during Mass her mother said. Yolanda Dillion didn’t have any children of her own but she loved to spoil the little ones who attended the church.

On her kitchen table Edna Dillion pointed to the dozens of red and green treat bags that Yolanda Dillion had planned to fill and pass out to children at the church for Christmas.

“She was fun-loving. She was still a big kid herself” Riley said.

https://twitter.com/FOX8NOLA/status/1601343165549658113

Yolanda Dillion was a breast cancer survivor. Though relatives described her as friendly and outgoing she was definitely a homebody who mostly spent time with family or at church they said.

Edna Dillion knew her daughter delievered food for Uber didne’t realize Yolanda Dillion had begun to pick up passengers as well. But she wasn’t comfortable with her daughter’s part-time gig.

“I tried to get her to stop. I didn’t want her to do it” Edna Dillion said. “But she wasn’t afraid of anything.”

“She didn’t deserve this” Riley said.

New Orleans Police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson called Yolanda Dillion an extremely lovely person. Her death hit her team and fellow employees hard he said.

“She will be dearly missed” Ferguson said.

The ride-hail company is attempting to prevent an increase in rates it must pay drivers in NYC by December 19.

On November 15 the TLC voted to increase the per-minute rates of ride-hail drivers by 7.42% and per-mile rates by 23.93% a move by the commission that is meant to attract more drivers to the roads to serve increasing passenger demand. In its petition Uber called the increases “dramatic unprecedented and unsupported hikes” noting that earlier fare increases have ranged from 1.46% to 5.34% and “accurately reflected the impact of inflation.”

Uber accused the TLC of using unsound economic principles to “achieve a predetermined result.” The company said the rule would force Uber to spend an additional $21 million to $23 million per month a cost from which the company could not recover. Uber could alternatively offset the additional payments by increasing rider fares but the company said that would result in a 10% increase for riders which would “irreparably damage Uber’s reputation impair goodwill and risk permanent loss of business and customers.”

The ride-hail giant went on to say that the challenged rule will harm riders drivers and the rideshare industry as a whole. Uber accused the TLC of not proposing a solution to balance these risks.

“A rate increase of this magnitude may very likely result in higher rider fares” reads the lawsuit. “Those higher fares in turn will depress the number of rides requested through the Uber platform. Fewer requested rides translates into fewer opportunities for Drivers to earn fees. The Challenged Rule could very well have the effect of harming Driver earnings undermining the purpose of these regulations.”

Uber has asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to block the implementation of the TLC’s rule pending a decision on Uber’s petition to block it entirely.

Taxi & Limousine Commissioner David Do said in a statement that the city must “stand behind our workers without traditional employment protections.”

“New York City leads the nation in protecting drivers and this important rule reflects that reality” Do said. “We are confident that we are well within our legal authority in implementing this important rule and we are vigorously fighting this lawsuit.”

Uber has challenged rulings in the past that are designed to protect gig workers. A California superior court last year ruled Proposition 22 — a ballot proposal that was passed in 2020 and defines ride-hail and gig workers as independent contractors not employees and thus not eligible for certain labor protections — was unconstitutional and unenforceable. Uber in turn filed an appeal to invalidate AB-5 California’s controversial law on the employment status of gig workers as unconstitutional and block its enforcement. This continual volley in the courts buys Uber time by clogging up the legal system so the company can continue to operate without making changes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2F0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvdWJlci1kcml2ZXItcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWhvc3BpdGFsaXplZC1hZnRlci1zaG9vdGluZy1vbi1sb29wLTQxMC1zYW4tYW50b25pby1wb2xpY2Utc2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber driver passenger hospitalized after shooting on Loop 410 San Antonio police say,"SAPD respond to shooting in the 6800 block of NW Loop 410.

SAN ANTONIO – Two people are hospitalized after being followed and shot by suspects from a bar Saturday morning according to San Antonio police.

The shooting happened at 2:25 a.m. Saturday on Northwest Loop 410 said SAPD.

Police said a 26-year-old man got into an argument with an unknown suspect outside a local bar before getting a ride home with an uber driver.

The suspect followed and shot at the passenger side of the vehicle. The Uber driver a 52-year-old man was shot three times and the passenger was hit one time.

The driver then stopped on the entrance ramp of Loop 410 and ran into a nearby hotel to ask for help said SAPD.

San Antonio Police and Fire Department responded to the shooting in the 6800 block of NW Loop 410.

The driver and passenger were taken to an area hospital for treatment. Police said both are reported to be in stable condition.

This is an ongoing investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS91YmVyLWZpbGVzLWxhd3N1aXQtYmxvY2stbnljLWRyaXZlci1wYXktaW5jcmVhc2UtMTExNTA2MTk1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber files lawsuit to block NYC driver pay increase,"The company reportedly indicated in its lawsuit that it would have to raise fares if drivers get an increase in pay.

Back in November New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) voted to increase the pay rates of Uber and Lyft drivers to make up for the rise in inflation and and operational costs. The new rates were supposed to be implemented on December 19th but now Uber has sued the commission to block the new rates from taking effect. According to Bloomberg Uber said in its lawsuit that it would have to spend an additional $21 million to $23 million a month if the new rates are implemented and that it wouldn't be able to recover those costs without raising fares.

To note drivers' per-minute rates are going up by 7.18 percent and per-mile rates by 16.11 percent under the new rules. That means for a 7.5-mile trip that takes 30 minutes a driver would earn at least $27.15 which is $2.50 more than current rates. The drivers are also getting another pay bump in March 2023 based on inflation rates comparing December's to September's this year. A company spokesperson told Engadget that by increasing drivers' pay this December TLC is locking in ""this summer's high gas prices in perpetuity.""

Freddi Goldstein Uber spokesperson told us:

""With this latest rulemaking on top of the annual inflation adjustment the TLC is choosing to invent a new methodology that locks in this summer’s high gas prices in perpetuity with a ‘mid-year’ adjustment that takes place 12 days before the end of the year. The TLC should have followed its usual annual adjustment and instituted a temporary gas surcharge when gas prices were actually elevated.""

The company's lawsuit seems to indicate that it intends to pass the costs associated with drivers' pay increase to riders. ""Such a significant fare hike right before the holidays would irreparably damage Uber’s reputation impair goodwill and risk permanent loss of business and customers"" its lawsuit said. In a strongly worded response to the lawsuit TLC said acknowledged that Uber already charges 37 percent more today compared to 2019 but it said that the company is keeping money earned from fare hikes over the past few years to itself.

The commission's statement reads: ""Just in time to steal Christmas from New York families Uber is suing to stop the raise the TLC enacted for app drivers after months of public hearings years of stalled wages and the pandemic decimating incomes. Uber's Grinch move is on top of denying a fuel surcharge to only NYC drivers when costs skyrocketed due to record high inflation forcing drivers in one of their most profitable markets to choose between groceries and fueling up.

Uber is already charging passengers 37% more today compared to 2019 AND KEEPING IT FOR THEMSELVES but says this modest raise for drivers is what will break the company. Shame on you Dara Khosrowshahi. We call on the City to stand firm and defend the rights of drivers to labor with dignity. Uber seeks chaos. We seek dignity. We are confident we will prevail.""

The ride-hailing giant is now asking the court to declare the new pay rates as invalid and to prevent the first increase's implementation this month while the lawsuit is ongoing.

UPDATE 12/10/22 10:53AM: Uber clarified that it's had rate hikes over the past years and that the per-minute increase is 7.18 percent while the per-mile is 16.11 percent. We also added the company's official statement.

This cartoon is a follow-up to a cartoon I drew just four years ago about a kid on Santa’s lap in a different privacy era:

“Well Timmy if you didn’t want me to see you when you’re sleeping know when you’re awake know if you’ve been bad or good and sell that data to third parties then you should have checked your privacy settings.”

In the four years since the privacy landscape changed dramatically with Apple’s iOS privacy changes to an opt-in model and Google planning to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome in 2024.

It is estimated that Apple’s privacy changes alone cut ad ROI by 38% and caused a 25% drop in mobile ad spend.

A recent data summit hosted by The Drum estimated that 70% of consumers have gone “data dark.” They referred to this group of consumers as the “Invisible 70%.”

To reach the “Invisible 70%” brands tech platforms and retailers are all investing deeply in building up their first-party data troves. That includes Apple and Google whose privacy moves have increased the value of their own walled gardens of first-party data.

Retailers are using their first-party data to create “Retail Media Networks” that Brent Rosso at cosmetic retailer Ulta Beauty described as “the hottest thing in the media world.”

Here’s how Andra Mititelu at Permutive described the appeal of first-party data the The Drum’s data summit:

“Consumers now have more choice and they are deciding to exercise the choice that is given to them by privacy changes. They are opting out of their data being used by the ad tech layer in the middle but they’re not necessarily opting out of direct first-party relationships with brands and publishers they know and trust. They understand that where they have a direct relationship with a brand and there’s a fair value exchange they don’t mind sharing that data.”

But how this plays out in practice will depend on how those brands tech platforms and retailers each use that first-party data. They’ll have to continually prove to consumers that the value exchange is worth it. In any kind of personalization there’s a fine line between cool and creepy.

Here are a few related cartoons I’ve drawn over the years:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXZlbnRpb24uY29tL2JlYXV0eS9za2luLWNhcmUvYTQyMTY2MDQ1L2tlbGx5LXJvd2xhbmQtYmxhY2stZ2lybC1zdW5zY3JlZW4tc3BmLTMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kelly Rowland 41 Shares the $15 SPF She Says Is 'Incredible',"We may earn commission from links on this page but we only recommend products we back. Why Trust Us?

Kelly Rowland 41 shared the $15 sunscreen she said is “incredible.”

The was made for melanated skin—unlike many other sunscreens it doesn’t leave a white cast behind.

It leaves skin glowing which is why so many others love it too.

Kelly Rowland follows a strict extensive skincare routine. “I know it’s a little excessive” she recently told The Cut before divulging her go-to products. However if she had to pare it down to only the absolute necessities her go-to sunscreen  would top the list.

The actress 41 said the formula is an “incredible” SPF for dark skin tones. In fact it was formulated specifically with melanated skin in mind as the moisturizing formula effortlessly melts into the complexion without leaving a white cast behind as so many other sunscreens do.

Added avocado and jojoba oils moisturize the skin (without leaving it greasy) vitamin E and cacao provide a dose of antioxidants and carrot juice offers vitamin C to prevent hyperpigmentation.

In a 2018 interview with Allure Rowland said she was “waiting for Black dermatologists to come out” with a sunscreen and although Black Girl Sunscreen isn’t derm-created the brand was founded and is run by a Black woman Shontay Lundy. And Rowland isn’t the only one who loves the long-awaited formula.

It holds a 4.7-star rating on Amazon. “No white cast very moisturizing easy to layer and most importantly: NO WHITE CAST 🤩🥳 . Literally made for Black queens and melanated skin tones!” one reviewer raved. “The only sunscreen I wear! A little goes a long way. Very hydrating and moisturizing. Worth the price!” another added. “I can wear it alone or under makeup and it doesn’t feel like I’m clogging my pores” another wrote.

As for the rest of Rowland’s routine it focuses on getting the skin ultra-clean (by cleansing not one not two but three times) and then replenishing it with lots of hydrating goodness. “I’m obsessed with moisture” she told The Cut. Most of the products she uses are by her facialist Shani Darden and . You can shop a few of her favorites below.

Holmes' ""Fill-In"" Anchor on GMA3 and The Internet Is Hot and Bothered","While GMA3 co-anchors T.J. Holmes and Amy Robach have been temporarily pulled off air viewers (and nosy non-viewers like me) have been anxious to see who would be stepping in to fill their shoes. Gio Benitez and Stephanie Ramos have been kind enough to keep the seats warm but we just caught wind that the network has just named a “fill-in” for Holmes. It’s reported that news anchor DeMarco Morgan who just joined ABC News will now step in to host the third hour of Good Morning America as producers scramble to figure out what the hell else to do.

English view video ULTA Beauty Faces A Boycott For Trans-Inclusive Marketing

The commotion however is not due to the fact that they’ve chosen to replace Holmes but who they’ve decided to replace him with. Morgan once was a popular morning anchor in Los Angeles. But if you’re wondering why he looks so familiar my theory is that it’s simply because he looks like a newer make and model of T.J. Holmes himself! And I’m not the only one to notice it.

Since the announcement of Morgan’s new gig Black Twitter has had a field day pointing out the similarities between the two light-skinned pretty-boy anchors. Not only that but it might be safe to say that GMA3 has just expanded its viewership with the Black and ahem…thirsty among us.



“Damn he fine” one Twitter user comments.



“Oh we ‘bout to have another scandal on our hands” writes another.



And as I’m sure you can imagine the tweets get raunchier from there complete with GIFs and memes one of which shows Patrick Star (yes from Spongebob) stepping out of his underwear as he enters the room.

Welp leave it to Black Twitter to make a hot take hotter. We’ll soon see how this one ends up.

The reptile stowaway identified as a harmless garter snake turned up on United Airlines Flight 2038 from Tampa shortly after landing Monday afternoon at Newark Liberty International Airport according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

As the plane taxied from the runway to the gate passengers in the business-class cabin began shrieking and pulling their feet up off the floor one passenger told regional cable outlet News 12 New Jersey.

Airport animal-control officers and Port Authority police officers were at the gate when the plane arrived and removed the snake which was later released into the wild Port Authority spokesperson Cheryl Ann Albiez said by email on Tuesday.

There were no injuries no impact to airport operations and the plane later departed Newark she said.

A spokesperson for United when asked about the incident said only that crew members who were alerted by passengers “called the appropriate authorities to take care of the situation.”

The snake was identified as a harmless garter snake similar to the one pictured. Getty Images/iStockphoto

No mention was made by any of the parties involved as to how the snake might have gotten aboard a commercial airline flight.

But the situation no doubt reminded some passengers of the 2006 movie thriller “Snakes on a Plane” a fictional story about dozens of venomous snakes being released by criminals on a passenger plane in an attempt to kill a murder trial witness.

Monday’s incident was not the first real-life instance of a serpentine creature hitching a ride aboard a commercial jet. A large snake was found slithering through the passenger cabin of an Aeromexico flight to Mexico City in 2016 and a python was spotted by passengers clinging to the airplane wing -on the outside – of a flight from Australia to Papua New Guinea in 2013.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGljazJob3VzdG9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvcG9ja2V0LWtuaWZlLWZvdW5kLW9uLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRyYXZlbGluZy1mcm9tLWhvdXN0b24tdG8tY2hpY2Fnby1vZmZpY2lhbHMtcmVwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pocket knife found on aircraft traveling from Houston to Chicago officials report,"Miami Florida - April 10 2014: A United Airlines Airbus A319 with the registration N805UA on approach to Miami Airport (MIA) in Florida.

HOUSTON – An aircraft traveling from Houston to Chicago was delayed after a passenger reportedly found a knife onboard.

Officials from the Houston Airport Systems say after passengers boarded the United Airlines flight on Saturday morning someone claimed to have found the pocketknife which had possibly been located under their seat.

They then alerted a flight attendant of what they found.

HAS staff said about 132 passengers had to deboard the flight and get rescreened before the plane was allowed to continue on.

It is unclear who exactly the knife belonged to and authorities have not yet arrested anyone in this case.

The bigger question of how a weapon was able to get past the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has yet to be answered.

United Airlines released the following statement:

“This morning customers onboard United flight 469 from Houston to Chicago were deplaned and were re-screened by TSA out of an abundance of caution.

While online shopping is oftentimes more convenient for consumers the same can be said for those brown box bandits wanting to make a quick buck on your new purchase.

The C+R Research report shows that almost one in seven Americans nearly 15% say they have been a direct victim of porch piracy at least one time this year while nearly one-third claim to know someone who has had a package stolen.

While there is not much that can be done to stop nefarious characters from scoping out your doorstep package delivery experts say there are steps that can be taken to keep your packages safe from thieves.

Liz Reisch Picarazzi founder and CEO of Citibin a company that provides solutions to outdoor storage problems offered a few tips to The Dominion Post on how to prevent porch pirates from ruining your holiday season.

Picarazzi said one solution is to require a signature for UPS FedEx and Amazon deliveries.

If you are unable to be home when the package is delivered Picarazzi said to consider having it delivered to a trusted neighbor or if possible having it delivered to work.

UPS and Amazon also have lockers available that packages can be delivered to for later pick-up she said.

For those wanting the extra security while maintaining the convenience of having deliveries to your door Picarazzi said an outdoor package delivery locker such as the ParcelDrop offered through her company is a good solution.

There are a variety of package delivery lockers or parcel drop boxes available through many in-store and online retailers such as Home Depot Lowes Walmart and Amazon at varying prices and sizes.

If none of these solutions are good options it is important to be diligent in collecting delivered packages as soon as possible to lessen the opportunity for porch pirates to steal it.

The report from C+R Research said that about half of Americans choose to stay home when a package is expected to be delivered. Others take different preventative approaches like installing a camera doorbell or opting to pick up an online order in the store.

Most people around 60% according to the report keep a close eye on delivery tracking when packages are expected while 43% sign up for delivery alerts.

Criminal charges for package theft in West Virginia depend on what was in the package that was stolen. If the value of the package(s) is less than $1000 then it is considered a misdemeanor petit larceny charge. If the value was over $1000 it would be a felony grand larceny charge.

The state’s maximum penalty for petit larceny is up to one year in jail or up to a $2500 fine. For grand larceny the maximum penalty is one to 10 years in the penitentiary and up to a $2500 fine.

While the value of every package will vary C+R Research said the average value of stolen packages so far in 2022 is $112.30.

Even if you are taking steps to prevent package theft they still can happen. If you find yourself a victim of porch pirates the United States Postal Service recommends filing a report with local law enforcement.

If you have a package stolen or have information about package thefts contact your local police department: the Monongalia County Sheriff’s Department at 304-291-7260 or the United States Postal Inspection Service at 877-876-2455.

Sounds exciting right?

In 2022 investment into the metaverse space is already more than double what it was in 2021 proving we’re not the only ones keen to be on this journey. With the potential to generate up to $5 trillion in value by 2030 according to McKinsey and Co the metaverse is an opportunity which demands attention across all industries not least hospitality.

The hotels and events sector is worth $1.25 trillion with 33% of all hotel revenue generated through events; this rises to 75% in sector-specific hotels and it is here where the potential of the metaverse can level up hotel offerings.

Given the current inefficiencies of the industry it’s a wonder the sector can be valued so highly when we consider the disconnected nature of the workflow the outdated methods of doing business and its environmental impact on the planet. However it is clear that hotel events from planning and organizing to attending and networking are overdue for an update before the system crashes.

For ambitious event planners going the extra mile to find the perfect venue is par for the course of planning a successful event. With information at our fingertips we’ve become accustomed to shopping around and this scoping out for a dream venue results in approximately 100 million site inspections each year.

Most of these visits sadly do not result in a booking resulting in wasted time resources and lost revenue not to mention the impact on the planet as planners take international flights across the world on their hunt for the ultimate venue. This outdated way of working needs to change.

Through the power of Web3 and true-to-life digital twins hotels can dramatically reduce the number of unfruitful site visits claw back lost revenue and maximize profits on their event spaces.

By creating a digital twin of their event space accessed through the metaverse hotels can welcome prospective clients into the venue at the touch of a button. In addition event planners can view their entire shortlist of venues in one afternoon from the comfort of their desks saving time money and the planet.

The current alternative to in-person site visits is website imagery maybe a virtual tour or possibly even 360-degree photography. But this is not sufficient. Imagine greeting a prospective client at your venue and instructing them to wander around the space alone undirected and with no one to answer any questions or give any information. You’d never do it. So why do it on your website?

Some businesses are turning to mobile devices and video conferencing tools to plug this gap yet the workflow remains clunky and unfulfilling. Such platforms were not built for site inspections which is why hotels need a tool which is truly fit for purpose and can take site inspections to the next level.

Rather than wandering around a virtual space unaided the metaverse allows hotel staff to meet with the prospect and walk them through the venue just as they would in real life. The metaverse experience instils a feeling of authentic presence which is why it cannot be beaten by any other digital alternatives which do not give this life-like level of immersion.

Not only can a metaverse site visit feel like the real thing but it can even go as far as to better reality. In real life planners must imagine different layouts décor lighting and weather. In the metaverse they can experience them and have them right before their eyes in seconds.

At last hotels can demonstrate the versatility of their venues effortlessly and effectively making closing that deal that little bit more likely.

The hotel industry has a lot to answer for when it comes to sustainability; from single-use plastics to industrial laundry loads hospitality is not green by design. Nevertheless it is on the mind of most businesses that our sustainability efforts must improve as eco-conscience begins to impact consumer choices.

By taking your site visits into the virtual world hotels can eliminate tens of millions of flights rail and car journeys and their associated impact on the planet. As the industry progresses to net zero innovative changes like this will make all the difference in reducing our environmental impact without compromising product offerings or revenue goals.

It’s a business no-brainer. Not only do metaverse site visits reduce a hotel’s environmental output but they also cut unnecessary costs. For example for an in-person site visit the venue must be heated or air-conditioned lit and freshly cleaned not forgetting that all the while the space is unbookable and therefore unprofitable.

Conducting a metaverse site visit means that while you’re showcasing your virtual venue your physical venue can thrive with real-life business making a profit and adding to that $1.25 trillion industry.

Though initially used in the planning stages of an event the metaverse also holds numerous possibilities for the attendance of events. Metaverse tickets unlock the option to attend events on every corner of the planet without even leaving the house reducing cost and environmental impact while increasing opportunities.

Thanks to the metaverse a virtual event no longer needs to feel like a poor relation to its in-person counterpart. In the future virtual attendees will be able to interact with in-person attendees as they would in real life ensuring that no one’s event experience is diluted.

Not only does this mean that hotels can kiss goodbye to capacity limits and generate extra ticket sales through virtual event passes but it also means Web3 technology can be woven throughout the entire event. From smarter networking to crypto payments these technologies will bring about slick innovations the hospitality sector craves.

Enlisting the power of the metaverse for hotels and events makes sense for the tech heads the business brains and the eco-conscious. Save time money and the planet whilst levelling up your event offering from planning to attendance with the metaverse.

Peter Gould is CEO of RendezVerse a platform that allows prospects to enter a hotel event space with virtual 360-degree tours or full CGI digital twins. Chairman of Worldwide Events and founder and former CEO of Great Hotels of the World Peter has always pioneered technology to make events and meetings more efficient. In 2010 he created Face2Face a revolutionary scheduling software for one-to-one meetings at events.

In late July a respected member of the community Bedford Corners resident Jennifer Saine contacted me asking if we could report on unfolding issues with our local medical group. The organization had recently announced it would now be part of Optum Tri-State a new entity linking CareMount Medical with ProHEALTH NY and Riverside under the Optum banner.

Journalism is more art than science and one example of that is how much weight reporters and editors give to an endless stream of reader tips based on who gives them. When someone as thoughtful and level-headed as Saine reaches out it tells us a lot right out of the gate.

After consulting with Examiner Editor-in-Chief Martin Wilbur we decided to ask local freelance journalist Sherrie Dulworth to suss out the facts. Sherrie is as thorough a reporter as you can imagine and we wanted to be extraordinarily comprehensive citing many patient sources and more before publishing any piece. Loose talk on social media does not by itself a story make and we don’t just chase gossipy pap.

But despite Sherrie’s excellent efforts and a little poking around on my end almost no one wanted to go on the record with their concerns after months of trying.

In vetting and trying to report out a straightforward news article several patients with stories to tell understandably declined our on-the-record requests not wanting to complicate relationships with their medical office. While there’s always more poking and prodding you can do our stab at a straightforward news report or in-depth news feature hit a general dead end by mid-November.

The Name Game

In October of last year Dr. Scott D. Hayworth now the CEO and market leader for Optum Tri-State Region blasted out an e-mail newsletter message announcing his former CareMount organization joining the “Optum family.” (Before it became CareMount in 2016 with a merger of several area practices the organization was called Mount Kisco Medical Group known in more recent years as MKMG; the original enterprise was founded in 1946.)

“With gratitude to you and your family for having entrusted your health care to us I’m proud to share with you that CareMount Medical has joined the Optum family” Hayworth a veteran Mount Kisco obstetrician-gynecologist as well triumphantly declared at the time.

“Optum is a national health services innovation company helping people live healthier lives and improving the delivery of care for everyone” continued Hayworth who also happens to be the husband of former local Republican congresswoman Nan Hayworth. “Partnering with Optum allows us at CareMount to do even more to fulfill our mission to provide you with state-of-the-art care close to home.”

But that promise Hayworth articulated has failed to deliver scores of patients tell us and tell the wider world on social media. Beyond formal interviews I’ve also heard story after story from reliable even-keeled people in personal conversation.

Local Facebook community group pages and social sites like Nextdoor have been littered for months with myriad complaints over deteriorating patient care access and service particularly around issues with scheduling health records and the affiliated patient portal function along with other infrastructure-type issues. (Even while some patients describe extraordinarily positive experiences and gratitude which I’ll get to in a minute).

One particularly acute concern has been general headaches over communication – including about the patient portal – and the inability to easily schedule human conversations with doctors. An entire maddening infrastructure of digital and human blockades has been constructed to limit real patient-to-doctor one-on-one contact. That’s a relatively new development in healthcare requiring a reckoning.

The more you can limit human interaction and increase automation the more you can scale the business and create a medical delivery system that is somewhat akin to (best-case scenario) a well-run quality fast-food chain and less like your beloved neighborhood restaurant.

“It’s unbelievable how horrible it is when you need to get ahold of someone” one commenter stated earlier this week. “I am beyond annoyed as well!!”

When a torrent of new posts started populating local social media groups again this week I realized it was time to chime in. We didn’t have quite what we needed for a news report. But as a reporting-based opinion columnist this was a story I felt compelled to tell in some capacity with more than enough information to tell it.

The frustration of waiting on hold on the phone for ungodly sums of time is a common complaint. (Common enough to be deemed a publishable offense right here in this column after much deliberation and corroboration.) While Optum does have an automatic callback system locals say that hasn’t fixed the problem.

“They did call me back but then put me right back on hold” one commenter said earlier this week. “I finally gave up.”

The new digital portal communication system also receives mixed reviews and tends to be particularly difficult to maneuver for older patients unaccustomed to the technology. Some people told me they were unable to create new accounts in the new Optum portal or ran into other serious issues in the transition. A patient relayed to me how after they created an account in the new system all of their medical history medications and scheduled appointments were missing.

Phone Woes

To confirm the phone concerns I tried calling Optum myself multiple times over an extended period of months and discovered similar frustrations. On Friday I conducted one final experiment taking more notes along the way.

Mind you I was feeling entirely healthy making an aggravating situation much easier to stomach not to mention the fact that I work from home and don’t have to worry about a boss breathing down my neck while trying to navigate the phone maze. While I felt bad clogging up the line it felt more irresponsible to not give the phone system another try. (Although I did happen to have a legitimate if benign medical question worth asking which comforted my conscience.)

I called at 9:30 a.m.

I waited on hold for about five minutes before hearing the option about getting an automated callback.

I pressed the automatic callback button by about 9:36 a.m. but it didn’t process.

I was returned to the computerized operator which gave me the option of the automatic callback about a full minute later and I pressed “1” to request a callback.

As I only later in the afternoon learned I missed a callback from Optum at 9:52 a.m. because of another time-sensitive call that came in at the same time. I didn’t figure that out until about 2:30 p.m.

Not realizing I missed the call I decided to let at least two hours pass before calling again if a call didn’t come unprompted.

I called again at 11:37 a.m.

Not until almost five minutes later at 11:41 a.m. was I offered the option to request an automated callback. I didn’t press the digit “1” quick enough – I think it gave me up to maybe two seconds – and as a result I was sent back on hold to continue to listen to excruciatingly irritating hold music.

Not until two minutes later at 11:43 a.m. was I provided the option again for an automated callback. I pressed “1.”

It worked perfectly generating a callback only two minutes later at 11:45 a.m. I asked a lovely-sounding receptionist for a doctor to call me specifying it was a doctor I needed to talk to about an issue not a nurse or assistant.

At about 2:30 p.m. after learning about the earlier voicemail I called again to ask for an ETA on a callback from the doctor. It took another few minutes to reach someone but a very helpful receptionist by about 2:35 p.m. explained how the doctor is understandably in with patients and often makes calls after those sessions if a quick call in between patients isn’t possible. I made it clear it wasn’t urgent. She said the doctor would likely be calling me around or shortly after 4:30 p.m.

As of print press time more than three days after my original call I did not receive the promised phone call from what is more than likely an overworked over-scheduled and diligent doctor.

This bullet point is being added after original print and online publication — a very friendly and hospitable assistant (not the doctor) called back on Monday morning noting she was out and unavailable on Friday.

Patients battling a flawed phone system when ill (or when seeking treatment for a loved one) is no small thing especially as it sometimes leads frustrated people – in particular busy working people – to abandon or delay care. In fact it’s a giant problem for any medical establishment genuinely committed to delivering a globally positive experience.

Saine for her part stressed how the developments have led to it becoming “difficult to schedule timely appointments harder to find providers within the group and maintain relationships with those providers because of rushed double-booked seven-minute appointments and being pushed to seeing PAs and nurses.”

Issues with the organization’s billing system are also a lingering longtime concern and one I’ve personally heard grumbles about for years and years well before the Optum development. (One patient told me about charges from 2011 doctor visits they can’t get scrubbed from the system).

“The old CareMount billing department issues have certainly not been resolved never mind the continual phone problems and long telephone wait times” added Saine a trained attorney. “I feel like my family is trapped in a quickly-collapsing system. I have stayed because our doctors are excellent and we value their expertise but how long will they even be able to endure being stretched so thin?”

While wanting to avoid sounding melodramatic Saine pointed out in an interview on Friday how frustration with the phones could have life-threatening consequences.

“It could lead to people not getting diagnosed and not being treated and not getting the care they need to save them” she said. “That is really what can happen with these things.”

But Saine also explained a bigger picture concern. She worries about Optum’s corporate parent looking to dominate the local market in multiple medical industry buckets – insurance and healthcare. She is right to raise the specter of Optum’s corporate architecture. Here’s the deal:

Optum is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group a Minnesota-headquartered multinational behemoth. The entire enterprise appears to be inherently problematic as the broader organization is both a healthcare and insurance company even if the two areas are allegedly siloed. What could possibly go wrong?

The answer is plenty for those keeping score at home.

Poor ‘Judge’ment

In fact just last month the illustrious and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalism site ProPublica published an explosive report outlining how UnitedHealth might use a treasure trove of patient data to give itself a competitive edge.

A federal judge had permitted the company to acquire a mind-boggling boatload of health insurance claims. While UnitedHealth publicly insists it won’t use the data to benefit itself – just trust us. Ha! – some company documents indicate otherwise ProPublica reported.

Meanwhile after the ProPublica piece published the U.S. Justice Department (as well as the New York and Minnesota attorneys general) filed a Nov. 18 notice stating they will appeal a decision by Judge Carl Nichols that allows UnitedHealth Group to acquire a company called Change Healthcare. (It was former President Donald Trump who nominated Nichols for the federal judgeship; the judge was commissioned onto the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 2019.)

Regarding Change Healthcare it is a firm that connects medical patients payers and providers. As ProPublica described it the company “functions as the pipes that carry insurance claims between health care providers and insurers.”

Yeah again what could go wrong?

Good Guys Bad Outcome

It’s worth emphasizing how Hayworth and his top colleagues might very well be pleasant folks. I don’t mean that facetiously. Hayworth is known locally for seriously impactful philanthropy and is surely a fine doctor committed to the Hippocratic oath and all the rest. I have friends who speak glowingly of him as a doctor from personal experience even while critics have harsher conclusions to share about his business practices. But Hayworth the man is not the point even if he’s the local man best positioned to address the point.

The point is we have a fundamentally flawed system leading to the problems that drive people batty sending your friends and neighbors (including some of the reasonable even-tempered ones) to vent on social media with little or no other recourse.

A consolidated local medical industry motivated almost exclusively by profit can much more than justify fewer human beings answering the phone even if it negatively impacts the patient experience as long as the near-monopolistic dominance is potent enough to avoid losing too many paying “customers” while limiting business expenses. (Optum does have competitors and some patients say they are fleeing to alternatives even if it means a little extra travel.)

As a doctor might conclude in a complicated case I can diagnose what’s triggering the symptoms but not provide a cure-all treatment.

That said the Justice Department appeal of the judge’s seemingly wrongheaded decision (please read that ProPublica article) appears to be one place to start. (Not to mention Optum deciding to invest a few lousy bucks on more people to answer the damn phones and general customer experience enhancements; even if doing so requires ahem modestly trimming executive pay; although it feels safe to suspect there’s some surplus dollars lying around to pay more personnel and keep the talented execs fully and handsomely compensated.)

Middle Ground

Everything doesn’t have to be a far-left versus far-right ideological screaming match either debating fully socialized medicine on one extreme versus an almost entirely unrestrained medical industry on the other. A layman can see the dangers in the consolidation of private medical power into too few hands and still enthusiastically embrace the beauties of capitalism to generate elite medical innovation.

That all said we were very eager to hear Optum’s point of view about patient experience. We spent weeks trying to secure an interview offering in-person video or phone options. Eventually all we were granted was a canned statement over e-mail.

“Our priority is to keep our valued patients informed during our transition to Optum – and share what this means for them” stated a ridiculous filibustering reply to what we were trying to ascertain for our readers aka many of Optum’s patients. “Our three medical groups have the expertise experience and dedication to create exceptional personalized experiences for our patients their families and our communities.”

While not an exact quotation the next 116 words of the statement essentially all bureaucratic corporate communications speak basically read “blah blah blah” and was signed by Hayworth and Kevin Conroy the president of Optum in the tri-state region which boasts how it provides “access to more than 2100 providers representing 70 specialties working in 360 medical practices and more than 55 urgent care locations across New York New Jersey and Southern Connecticut.”

We also reached out yet again just before publishing this column offering Optum a post-publication interview opportunity to address patient concerns in a follow-up news article. Fingers crossed.

FYI

In the name of transparency it’s important for readers to know that medical institutions are relatively significant advertisers for local news outlets and we’re no exception.

CareMount et al. has been a major client of ours over the past 15 years. Community news outlets are not financially incentivized to publish hard-hitting area health institution coverage even as many do exactly that to the best of their abilities.

Setting all of that aside if Optum’s corporate communications department is reading this now we’d still love the opportunity to ask follow-up questions – about doctor buyouts compensation for executives whether some money could be better spent on fuller medical staffing levels and a variety of other questions. Given the overlap between our coverage area — from White Plains to Northern Westchester and up through Putnam County — and Optum’s market reach for prospective patients it feels like a meaningful opportunity to share Optum’s perspective with its frustrated constituency.

What’s important to stress is how no reasonable observer doubts that Optum is populated by wonderful doctors and support staff while very many patients undoubtedly enjoy sterling treatment sometimes in the lifesaving variety. Much of the care is genuinely world-class delivered by elite medical talent and the community is extraordinarily lucky in that regard. In fact my interview with Mount Kisco resident Donna Cravotta (full disclosure: she’s a friend and former colleague) illustrates that very fact.

Cravotta and her young adult son Matt have been patients for about 15 years. While she notes how “making appointments is horrendous” she also emphasized how she does not “think the Optum-bashing is fair” and how “as a middle-aged woman who lives alone with health issues I am grateful to have quality healthcare all around me.”

“I know the scheduling problem can be resolved” Cravotta said. “In the past six months I’ve been seeing two new doctors a primary care physician and an electrophysiologist who both handle the scheduling. When I visited my primary doctor I made an appointment for next year as I was leaving. The electrophysiologist’s office is incredible at handling scheduling and insurance issues. The entire organization should follow their lead.”

Cravotta like many patients sees the good and the bad. For instance on the negative side there was a preposterous 18-month wait to get an annual appointment with her gynecologist. She ended up seeing a nurse practitioner at the Yorktown office and made an appointment with her doctor for 2023. While the nurse practitioner was “very thorough” Cravotta also noted how it is “not a good solution.”

On the flip side other than an issue she had with two cardiologists in the past she said she has “loved all of our doctors through the years” and also remarked how she likes how all of her medical records and doctors are in one centralized location.

“And…the offices are convenient” she added. “Matt is going to college in New Paltz. There is an Optum office five minutes away. I have also visited the Yorktown office Katonah office the Briarcliff office and urgent care; all are very convenient.”

‘Totally Fixable’

But the bigger related issue appears to be what some say is a doctor shortage at the medical group as a result of intentional profit-driven attrition.

Maybe there’s no shortage at all. That’s where Optum you can chime in and alert our readers to whether their perception is your company’s reality – or not. And if it’s not how you might explain and/or address the widespread community sentiment about diminished service.

“Not only do you wait a year or two for appointments but once there the appointments are three minutes and they have one (expletive) foot out the door to get to the next of their 300 patients scheduled for the day” one infuriated patient told me requesting anonymity to speak freely about their current healthcare provider. “What has happened to me on many occasions is one waits on hold for hours and then someone picks up and disconnects you.”

But to Cravotta a self-employed marketing strategist the understandable outrage expressed by patients like the unnamed source illustrate a frustrating dynamic. Cravotta moved to town in part because there was an impressive medical group nearby along with Northern Westchester Hospital. To have such specialized medical care in a small suburban community is a genuine blessing she said and in her view the problems at Optum are “totally fixable.”

The company should hire a user experience (UX) consultant so Optum can better interact with patients and use that feedback to improve the organization Cravotta stressed. If say the portal was enhanced with a finer eye toward user experience and molded into a super easy-to-use one-stop-shop more time would be opened up to deal with incoming issues and concerns over the phone and otherwise. A “UX” expert could examine processes and procedures across the organization for low-hanging fruit to pick at and improve.

“How lucky are we to live in this town and have this level of care?” Cravotta said in a phone interview Friday afternoon. “So much of this conversation is because you can’t make an appointment. But it’s amazing we live in a town where you can go see a cardiologist an internist a hand specialist whatever you need. This very fixable issue is detracting from a very special place.”

Another source explained how their family has physicians at Westchester Medical Columbia Physicians and Phelps and they have all successfully incorporated technology to enhance administrative efficiencies for patients. So it’s not like all medical organizations have failed to figure it out.

“Phelps in particular has a great Zoom like setup for remote consults when an in-office visit is not possible” the source noted. “Phelps makes excellent use of technology to make things more accessible and not a barrier to care. Phelps also sends out a questionnaire after every interaction to make sure things went well and to address any patient dissatisfaction — they really try hard to get it right. The solutions are out there.”

As for any of you doctors out there reading this column we don’t usually grant off-the-record interviews. This is a case where we’d make an exception. (Some casual preliminary conversations indicate that patient frustration with Optum is shared by some staff).

One way or the other these first few pages of Optum Tri-State’s local history are just the beginning of an important story we’ll all continue to live through together and tell.

Please stay tuned and be in touch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzExL3doeS1zaG91bGQteW91LWludmVzdC1pbi1ibHVlLWNoaXAtc3RvY2tzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Should You Invest in Blue Chip Stocks?,"Here's why it's worth owning these Warren Buffett-style stocks.

There is no strict definition of blue chip stocks but they are generally recognized as long-standing reliably profitable large-cap businesses.

These are the companies that are seen as the pillars of American enterprise. They are the components of the Dow like Walt Disney Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson.

Blue chip stocks offer a number of benefits including safety income profitability and a proven ability to bounce back from recessions and other economic shocks. Let's take a look at each one of these primary benefits.

1. Blue chip stocks are safe

Year to date the Dow Jones Industrial Average has outperformed the Nasdaq by an unusually wide margin as the chart below shows.

The Dow is beating the Nasdaq by more than 20 points currently because in bear markets and uncertain economic environments investors flock to safe stocks like those on the Dow.

That's why so many Dow stocks have risen this year even in a down market and the winners are from diverse sectors including Caterpillar Coca-Cola and UnitedHealth.

A rising-interest rate environment also favors blue chip stocks as most of them tend to be highly profitable. In a high-interest rate environment future profits become less valuable so investors look to stocks that are generating strong cash flows in the moment.

These are precisely the types of stocks that Warren Buffett has favored and that strategy has served him well over his investing career especially in bear markets.

Because blue chips are able to outperform in bear markets and maintain profitability they tend to be safer than other stocks.

2. Blue chips pay dividends

While it's not a hard-and-fast rule that blue chip stocks must pay dividends nearly all of them do. That's because these are mature profitable companies that have ample cash to return through dividends or share buybacks. Many of them are Dividend Aristocrats meaning they've raised their dividends for every year for at least 25 years.

In addition every Dow stock pays a dividend. Paying a dividend also helps make a stock more defensive as yields will rise as the stock price goes down making the stock more attractive to buyers.

Over the long run dividend stocks have a history of outperforming their counterparts that don't pay dividends. This is likely because dividend stocks carry less risk and these companies have already proven themselves in the market as they've generated consistent cash flows for decades and have the kind of businesses that can be expected to continue bringing in cash.

3. Blue chip stocks have competitive advantages

Companies don't become blue chip stocks by luck or accident. They have proven their mettle over decades withstanding competitors adapting to changes in the market and delivering consistent growth along the way.

While blue chip stocks don't tend to be high-growth companies they use their competitive advantages to find new ways to grow. Coca-Cola for example has a long track record of acquiring smaller beverage brands and folding them into its distribution network to accelerate their sales. The company has also made more high-profile deals to reach into new corners of the beverage market acquiring Costa Coffee for example and taking a stake in and forming a strategic partnership with Monster Beverage.

As another example Disney benefits from a unique flywheel in entertainment where it's able to monetize its intellectual property in both box releases TV shows theme park rides live entertainment consumer products like toys and more. It's also made several acquisitions bringing in valuable content like Marvel and Star Wars.

Blue chip stocks have stood the test of time and that is often because they have a competitive advantage such as a well-known brand and an industry-leading market position. It's no accident that these companies have been a market leader for generations.

If you're looking to make investing easy on yourself be like Warren Buffett and buy some blue chip stocks today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1kaWdpdGFsLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFuZC1haS9icmluZ2luZy10aGUtZm91cnRoLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtcmV2b2x1dGlvbi10by1oZWFsdGhjYXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bringing the Fourth Industrial Revolution to healthcare,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is disrupting and transforming almost every industry in every country uncovering both opportunities and challenges that businesses simply cannot ignore.

In healthcare in particular 4IR technologies hold immense promise with several transformational use cases that could revolutionise the sector.

Whether that’s using robotics in surgery to improve outcomes and lessen hospital stays or the impact of AI on increasing access to care reducing costs and driving up quality — the impact of these innovations will be felt for many years to come.

The irony is that even as 4IR technologies evolve to ensure better health and healthcare often at lower cost and higher value the industry as a whole continues to struggle with the adoption of proven and less complex technologies that have been mature and stable for many years.

The healthcare sector is falling behind in technology

This means that time and time again healthcare is empirically ranked as one of the worst industries for digital maturity along with industries like agriculture construction and manufacturing. And the impact this has both on people and the development of standards to help people in global healthcare contexts is huge.

But why is this? The healthcare industry is data-rich but poor interoperability means data exchange information sharing and security deficiencies plague our healthcare systems at every level on a worldwide scale. With the diversity of organisations in the healthcare system getting them all on the same page at the same time can be tough and this is only exacerbated further by the fragmentation that exists across payers providers organisations and offices. When they do not or cannot share information between one another it poses considerable challenges for IT vendors and their customers.

That’s before you take into account the complexity of health and medical data which makes automation cumbersome at best compared with more traditional industries and methods of data capture. Add to that the complexities on the business side of healthcare and the result is a highly fragmented industry that is meant to help people when they are in the greatest need of care.

Barriers to healthcare IT adoption come down to four key reasons:

Reluctance to share data: Due to a perceived threat on revenue streams and maintaining a competitive advantage Dual power structure: Administrative and clinical departments working against one another and hindering IT decision making Increasing system complexity: Due to hospital mergers and acquisition activity Cost: Efforts to keep operational costs flat have exacerbated IT departments’ ability to adapt to new processes and technologies

All of this naturally leads to the question how can the healthcare industry change to securely embrace technological change in order to compete better in a world in which digital transformation is key to success if not survival?

Enterprise Architecture holds the answers for Industry 4.0

Enterprise Architecture could well hold the answers for this problem. In 2016 and again in 2021 the international consulting firm McKinsey published results from their research on Enterprise Architecture and the rapidly changing importance of technology in driving business value.

They concluded that the Enterprise Architecture function “Is a core element of the foundation that both enables and accelerates the tech transformation that companies need in order to compete in a digital-first world.”

What is it then about Enterprise Architecture that can help the healthcare industry achieve the digital maturity it so desperately needs?

The objective and purpose of Enterprise Architecture is made up of three parts. First it looks to help businesses succeed by identifying and prioritising strategies. Second to get there it helps to devise and align goals to achieve those strategies. Finally it creates innovative and agile solutions for even the most challenging technology problems.

To tackle them Enterprise Architecture requires high-level and rigorous thought processes as well as painstaking attention to detail. To achieve the very best outcome Enterprise Architecture requires coordinated deliberative action among the diverse stakeholders that it is designed for.

The value proposition of Enterprise Architects lies in their ability to help an organisation exploit disruptive forces – such as automation and digitisation – to drive change through optimal performance of core business functions. By focusing on how key parts of an organisation are interrelated Enterprise Architecture helps others understand the organisation communicate this understanding to stakeholders and move the organisation forward to embrace and achieve its digital transformation goals.

The contribution of Enterprise Architecture to the digital advancement of the healthcare industry is clear. By helping decision makers gain a firmer foothold of how their businesses function how the different parts of their companies are organised and structured and how those parts are interrelated in the production of services Enterprise Architecture makes it easier to document and define the current landscape to effectively change systems embrace the technology of the Fourth Revolution and plan for future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYWZmYWlyc2Nsb3VkLmNvbS8yMDIyLWh1cnVuLWdsb2JhbC01MDAtMjAtaW5kaWFuLWZpcm1zLWluLTUwMC1tb3N0LXZhbHVhYmxlLWdsb2JhbGx5LXJlbGlhbmNlLXRvcHMv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9hZmZhaXJzY2xvdWQuY29tLzIwMjItaHVydW4tZ2xvYmFsLTUwMC0yMC1pbmRpYW4tZmlybXMtaW4tNTAwLW1vc3QtdmFsdWFibGUtZ2xvYmFsbHktcmVsaWFuY2UtdG9wcy8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Hurun Global 500: India ranks 5th with 20 Indian Firms,"According to the “2022 Hurun Global 500” a ranking of the 500 most valuable non-state-controlled companies in the world 20 Indian companies are among the 500 most valuable in the world.

Communicable or infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria continue to have the highest fatality rates across the world with the poorest populations affected disproportionately. The impact of poor health is exacerbated when people experience marginalisation on the basis of ethnicity caste language class gender age or sexual orientation and that in turn perpetuates intergenerational poverty.

A rights-based approach to health precedes health policies and their implementation prioritising the needs of the marginalised for achieving equity and a better quality of life. This principle has been adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Universal Health Coverage. In India the right to health is protected under the Constitution of India in several ways. Right to Health is a part of Right to Life and is a fundamental right guaranteed to all under the Constitution’s Article 21.

Tribal communities residing in hard to reach areas are displaced from their land deprived of forest produce have low literacy and financial poverty and poor access to the health system. As a result they have dangerously low health indicators with high prevalence of morbidity mortality and malnutrition. Public health facilities are not easily accessible have inefficient process management lack human resources and equipment drugs and services. This coupled with lack of understanding of local tribal culture and nuanced requirements and socio-cultural discrimination further alienates tribal communities from access to basic health services.

Anamaya the Tribal Health Collaborative established with an aim to end preventable deaths among tribal and marginalised communities works through a collaborative approach to address the complex issue of tribal health art scale and with a sense of urgency. Its approach of communitisation – institutionalizing communities’ ownership for health aims to enable tribal peoples assert their right to health and realise positive health as communities.

Improving access to health for marginalised communities warrants an understanding of their needs barriers to access and developing contextual solutions available in a timely manner at minimal cost and with dignity. MAAdol drive a multi-stakeholder intervention funded by USAID and implemented by PATH and Piramal Foundation to strengthen the Wage Compensation Scheme (WCS) by the government of Assam is one such example. It was launched in 2018 to extend support to pregnant women from tea tribes a group of marginalised tribal communities from the tea garden areas of Assam. Many women working at the tea gardens although eligible were unable to furnish relevant documents as it meant losing a day’s wages. MAAdol drive increases access to maternal and neonatal child health services by addressing gaps and delays in linkage of pregnant women who lack awareness about benefit entitlement through improved convergence at the last mile.

Access to health services for marginalised communities also improves when they are able to articulate their needs and trust service providers. The Aashwasan campaign has been addressing vaccine hesitancy amongst tribal populations supported by frontline health workers. Despite the prevalence of Covid-19 within the community most people in Gogapur (Nandurbar district) were fearful of getting vaccinated due to abounding myths. Rekha an ASHA worker spent time with each family to address their concerns often citing the example of her own vaccination experience. She promised to bear responsibility should any person experience any negative side-effects and sat by community members while they got their vaccine shots thereby succeeding in getting her community vaccinated.

Anamaya the Tribal Health Collaborative identifies TB champions who have survived the disease to help community members get tested and complete their treatment. One such TB champion Reshma a mother of three from Pati (Barwani district Madhya Pradesh) who was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis had to give up her job at Panchayat Bhavan leaving her family who depended on her earnings in dire circumstances. Despite that she adhered to the treatment regime until she recovered. “I felt inspired and encouraged to work as a TB champion and help people in my community after interacting with the team of Piramal Foundation. I never thought of doing this work before. But now I don't want to stop. I want to keep doing this work and help people as much as I can.”

Given the multiplicity of marginalisation of India’s tribal communities it is imperative to create a responsive and sensitive health system that provides equitable access and right to health to these communities. Interventions such as MAAdol and Aashwasan help bring appropriate services to the communities and build their trust in the health system by improving their experience of health delivery. Through collaboration and co-creation we can successfully ensure equitable health provisioning and ensure that India@100 as a developed nation becomes a reality.

There has to be a transparent and comprehensive enquiry and investigation into two recent cases of death in Sarawak allegedly due to the lack of access of health care services in their respective areas.

The first case involves a baby allegedly died in its mother’s arms while travelling on a bus from Julau to Kuching for treatment. The other was an elderly woman from Lawas who died before an ambulance that was supposed to send her to hospital could go through the gate of Sungai Tujoh Immigration Customs Quarantine and Security (ICQS).

It is saddening that in this day and age we still hear of such cases where there are people especially in the rural areas who are deprived of their right to quality health care. This is a clear symptom of long-term under-investment and neglect in our health care services especially in rural areas.

However to properly address this issue we need to address the different social determinants of health (SDoH) which includes addressing poverty providing basic amenities equitable development and many others which may not only fall under the Ministry of Health.

That is why moving forward to resolve health inequities there has to be a comprehensive federal-state inter-ministry and inter-agency framework to come up with a holistic blueprint to properly address all the different social determinants of health so that no one is left behind.

I hope the new Health Minister and Deputy Minister will spearhead these inter-governmental agencies to first and foremost identify issues and then allocate the necessary resources to better equip the healthcare facilities in rural areas and also ensure development in the surrounding ecosystem.

Then it is important to firstly give all the necessary support to existing health care staff in the area and then ensuring that these facilities have the necessary specialists and manpower and even basic amenities and development so that even in cases of emergency patient transfers can be done in the most efficient manner without unnecessary hurdles.

All this requires political will and more importantly for ministries not to work in silos anymore.

We may need to “re-think” how we do health care especially in rural areas as we want to ensure that all Malaysians will get access to quality universal health care and such incidents do not happen again.

No babies in a country with supposed universal health care coverage should die in their mother’s arms on the way to the hospital.

Las expectativas de diciembre están en la mente de todos los sectores productivos y comerciales y el comercio informal no es la excepción.

Los San Andresitos han hecho parte de la historia del comercio colombiano pues llevan 64 años funcionando según Fesacol (Federación de Sanandresitos de Colombia). Estas zonas de comercio informal se han extendido a lo largo y ancho del país y fue así como hace 35 años se formó la agremiación que vela por las prioridades de los comerciantes que hoy agrupa más de 600 centros comerciales.

Según explicó Albeiro Camacho presidente de Fesacol entre 50% y 60% de los productos que se venden en estas zonas son importados. Por ejemplo la confección textil y el calzado son muy fuertes en ventas. “La ropa para adultos y niños y los zapatos se han abierto un campo de los centros comerciales así como la lencería y el cacharro” comentó Camacho.

En cuanto a los productos importados insignia de estos sectores está la perfumería los productos tecnológicos y la ropa. Estos bienes provienen principalmente de China Estados Unidos y Panamá.

Es claro que desde la pandemia los sectores informales también recibieron un impacto en las ventas pues la mayor parte de los comerciantes no estaban preparados y por ejemplo la zona de San Andresito San José de Bogotá tuvo que empezar a incentivar la digitalización lo que actualmente es un proceso con avances importantes.

Al menos en este sector sorprendió que la modernización digital en 2021 hizo que la gente llegara buscando los locales en la temporada. Por otro lado actividades implementadas por el Gobierno como el Día Sin Iva impulsaron las ventas en 2021 según relata Camacho pese a que esta fecha tuvo un enfoque en los grandes almacenes y el comercio formal.

Como expectativa para la temporada navideña este año “se proyecta que las ventas crezcan 30% con relación al año pasado en la temporada” resaltó el presidente de la agremiación. Agregó que también se espera que las categorías de juguetería tengan un repunte significativo porque los comerciantes están trayendo algunos con elementos tecnológicos para estar a la vanguardia del mercado.

Por otro lado durante los últimos años se ha presentado un alza significativa en celulares parlantes consolas de videojuegos y accesorios electrónicos así como la ropa que ha tenido picos elevados. “Seguramente eso seguirá pasando” dijo Camacho.

Cabe resaltar que en los San Andresitos se vende al por mayor y detal lo que anticipa la temporada navideña es decir desde mediados de octubre los comerciantes están preparados para empezar a vender pero los días más fuertes en ventas están en diciembre. Pese a la proyección de crecimiento la inflación y el alza del dólar también es una preocupación del comercio informal.

“Creeríamos que este año sería muy bueno para el comercio pero con el panorama económico sentimos incertidumbre porque la gente no está comprando solo por gastar sino que lo está pensando” dijo Camacho.

Pese a que en el comercio informal no se suelen retratar cifras exactas porque cada comerciante maneja su empresa Fesacol lleva cinco años desde que creó una cooperativa de licores con registro legal y que aseguran en los últimos años ha vendido más de $300.000 millones”.

LOS CONTRASTES

Albeiro Camacho Presidente de Fesacol “Creamos una cooperativa de licores de forma legal que en los últimos cinco años ha recibido más de $300.000 millones en ventas de bebidas alcohólicas”.

Juan Esteban Orrego Director de Fenalco Bogotá “En sectores como juguetería la concentración de ventas podría mantenerse alrededor de 70% como históricamente ha sucedido”.

“Estos procesos en las bebidas alcohólicas permiten que los clientes tengan certeza de la calidad de los productos que están comprando” indicaron.

Desde una mirada sectorizada Accosan (Asociación de Comerciantes de Centros Comerciales San Andresito San José) se repiten las categorías mencionadas por Fesacol como las más populares.

Esta agremiación reúne un total de 50 centros comerciales constituidos entre los cuales está Puerto Príncipe San Vicente Puerta Grande entre otros a lo que se suman 14 establecimientos grandes entre restaurantes y papelerías. En total hay 15.000 locales en la zona que generan alrededor de 20.000 empleos. En una óptica general de acuerdo con Fesacol los San Andresitos generan más de un millón de empleos.

San Andresito San José es una de las zonas de comercio informal más reconocidas en Bogotá. En este sentido los comerciantes se preparan en conjunto para la temporada e invierten en la decoración del sector.

De cara a la temporada alta la agremiación puso a disposición de los clientes 2.500 espacios de parqueadero para no generar trancones en las calles porque según datos de Accosan este es el lugar donde las personas compran su pinta completa de Navidad así como los regalos.

El comercio formal espera que las cifras sean parecidas a las de 2021

El informe de las expectativas de ventas para diciembre desarrollado por Fenalco resaltó que por temas de inflación los comerciantes pueden percibir los mismos ingresos pero vendiendo igual o menos unidades de productos. Sin embargo categorías de juguetería podrían mantener la concentración de ventas y se puede ver un comportamiento similar en calzado tecnología y viajes. La jornada Bogotá Despierta será del 16 al 23 de diciembre y espera que 7.000 establecimientos extiendan sus horarios de atención.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vY3VsdG9yby5lcy9hY3R1YWxpZGFkL3ZlbnRhcy1jb3JyaWRhLWluLW1lbW9yaWFtLTEzMTEyNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La corrida 'In Memoriam' tendrá un cartel de quilates en Las Ventas,"La corrida In Memoriam una de las citas de nuevo cuño que ha ideado Plaza 1 para el próximo San Isidro ya tiene cartel no oficial -según ha podido saber este medio-: serán Julián López “El Juli” Alejandro Talavante y Andrés Roca Rey los que hagan el paseíllo en esta cita con un encierro de Victoriano del Río.

Asimismo también recordamos que según avanzó el director general de Plaza 1 Rafael García Garrido hace unas semanas en el programa El Toril de Onda Madrid la próxima Feria de San Isidro se reestructurará. 23 serán los festejos que se celebren en Madrid en torno a la festividad de su patrón: 18 corridas de toros 3 novilladas con picadores y 2 corridas de rejones será el organigrama de festejos programados en ese 2023 dejando atrás las cifras de años anteriores.

A diferencia de estas temporadas los 23 festejos serán obligatorios en el abono sacando fuera de la Feria una fecha tan significativa como Beneficencia amén de la citada ‘In Memoriam‘ que también irá fuera del abono.

Por otro lado habrá una novedad significativa respecto a cómo se entraban anunciado los carteles de La Beneficencia. Ahora Plaza 1 ha decidido que no se anunciará junto al grueso de la Feria sino cuando acabe ésta: «Creemos que en esta fecha deben estar los triunfadores de San Isidro; da igual la categoría o el nombre deben estar los triunfadores. Es la fecha más importante del año y en ella puede entrar cualquier torero que haga el paseíllo en Madrid durante San Isidro creo que es algo lógico y justo».

Les pesa un complicado 2022 en el que la incertidumbre ha rodeado la disponibilidad de materia seca (vidrio etiquetas tapones cápsulas...) y el precio al que tendrían que adquirirla por no hablar de los altos costes de la energía y del transporte y de una disparada inflación ante la que es difícil prever cuál será el comportamiento de los consumidores ante un producto –también más caro– que no se considera de primera necesidad.

Pero pese a todo las expectativas son ""positivas"" porque en tan difícil año ""y si nada se tuerce en los últimos momentos"" las cuatro bodegas aragonesas cuyos espumosos lucen el sello de calidad Denominación de Origen Cava esperan mantener las cifras de ventas con las que cerraron el pasado año y que se situaron cercanas al millón de botellas.

Las previsiones más optimistas las manifiesta la bilbilitana Bodegas Langa –aunque Calatayud no está incluido en la denominación si lo está de manera excepcional la elaboradora– que espera ""superar sin problemas"" las 450.000 botellas comercializadas de sus premiados cavas. Aunque su gerente César Langa matiza que ""es pronto para dar cifras porque queda mucha Navidad"" y explica que será en enero cuando realmente se puedan sacar conclusiones del resultado de la campaña asegura que ""por el ritmo de salida de producto tenemos la convicción de que va a ser una campaña muy buena"". De hecho Bodegas Langa prevé que algunas de sus referencias ""incluso se van a agotar"".

En un principio los responsables de la bodega integrada también en la Denominación de Origen Calatayud temía que la incertidumbre que golpea al mercado iba a provocar un retraso en los pedidos pero finalmente no ha sido así. ""No sabemos muy bien si se debe a que el buen posicionamiento la publicidad o los reconocimientos conseguidos han activado mucho más las compras pero lo cierto es que en nuestro caso va a ser una campaña muy buena"" insiste Langa.

Ahí están sus cifras. De las 450.000 botellas que comercializarán este año el 60% se disfrutará en las mesas españolas y el 40% restante tendrá como destino los más de 30 países a los que exportan. Unos mercados a los que acude con una amplia y variada gama de cavas ""desde ecológicos a rosados grandes reservas y otros productos más fáciles de beber y pensados para un público que busca algo más sencillo"" afirma el gerente de la bodega bilbilitana que también produce segundas marcas para determinados clientes como el producto que ahora elaborará tras cerrar un acuerdo con un importado de México que tenía marca propia de vino y ahora quiere incluir también el cava. En todos estos mercados señala Langa esta empresa familiar está ganando cuota ""no a base de bajar precio sino ganando valor a nuestros productos para generar riqueza que se queda en nuestro territorio porque lo que hacemos es invertir y generar empleo"".

Desde Cariñena y Ainzón

Dos son los municipios aragoneses integrados en la Denominación de Origen Cava: Cariñena y Ainzón. En el primero se encuentra situado el grupo Bodegas San Valero (BSV) que produce cuatro cavas bajo su marca Gran Ducay y otros tres de la enseña Particular entre los que se encuentra el Blanc de Noir único en Aragón. Muy cauteloso se muestra su responsable de Marketing Javier Domeque que estima que este año la bodega comercializará alrededor de las 300.000 botellas si bien matiza que se trata de un producto muy estacional ya que el 80% de las ventas se realizan en el último trimestre del año y especialmente en las dos últimas semanas del mes de diciembre.

El 70% de esas ventas se realizan en España y de ellas el 40% se comercializa a través de los distribuidores de alimentación y el resto se sirve en el canal horeca. Un 30% se exporta. El comportamiento de ambos mercados (para bien y para mal) ha equilibrado las previsiones por lo que BSV espera mantener las cifras del pasado año.

""En el exterior el mercado ruso que conseguimos abrir hace dos años con cavas de mayor valor prácticamente ha desaparecido"" señala Domeque que explica que por el contrario este año –en el que ya no hay restricciones por la covid– la hostelería y la restauración muestran una notable mejoría. ""Los pedidos han ido muy retrasados y aunque hemos notado cierta recuperación lo cierto es que no estamos aún en datos anteriores a la pandemia pero tal como esta la situación las previsiones son buenas"" destaca.

En Ainzón se encuentran las otras dos bodegas aragonesas que lucen el sello de calidad de la D. O. Cava. Una de ellas es Bodegas Bordejé pionera en Aragón en la elaboración de estos vinos que produce (alrededor de 200.000 botellas) desde hace seis décadas.

Una larga trayectoria vitivinícola tiene también el Grupo Ruberte con sede en Magallón aunque su inclusión en el mundo de los espumosos es mucho más reciente concretamente desde que esta empresa familiar comprara en 2016 la bodega Monasterio de Veruela situada en Ainzón para hacer realidad el sueño de elaborar ""cava de gran calidad"".

La enóloga y gerente de este grupo Susana Ruberte asegura que este año se está notando que la gran distribución ha retrasado mucho sus compras. ""La semana pasada empezaron a entrar pedidos que en años anteriores ya habíamos servido para esas fechas"" matiza. Ruberte cree que esta circunstancia responde a la incertidumbre que existe en el mercado. ""Creo que como no se sabe cómo va a responder el consumo las grandes distribuidoras toman precauciones"" explica.

Pese a ello Bodegas Ruberte espera alcanzar las ventas de años anteriores esto es 20.000 botellas de sus marcas Monasterio de Veruela y Camino al Moncayo que desde el pasado año cuenta con un Gran Reserva ""que está funcionando muy bien"" detalla. Pero la gerente del grupo reconoce que para alcanzar estas cifras tendrán como aliada la exportación ya que sus cavas comienzan ya a llegar a Suiza

Unos elevados costes de producción y un brindis más caro

Los cavas con los que brindaremos este año serán algo más caros que en 2021 pero no tanto como el incremento de costes que han tenido que asumir durante este ejercicio las bodegas elaboradoras por el disparado costes de la energía y de las materias primas. Un suma y sigue que según los productores de cava no se ha repercutido en su totalidad al producto. ""Es muy complicado subir el precio en el sector porque no se asume con tanta facilidad como en otros productos y hay tanta diversidad y competencia que es muy fácil cambiar de proveedor"" explica el gerente de Bodegas Langa. A comienzos de año Bodegas Langa aplicó una «subida muy justita del 5%» explica César Langa que reconoce que en 2023 cuando se sepa cómo quedan los precios de los proveedores tendrán que volver a subir los precios.

Entre un 7% y un 11% se han encarecido los productos de Bodegas San Valero. «Hemos tenido que hacer dos subidas desde enero de 2022» señala su responsable de Marketing Javier Domeque que insiste en que el incremento ha sido «moderado» teniendo en cuenta el «brutal incremento» de los costes de producción.

«Hemos ido ajustando todo lo posible pero al final hemos tenido que repercutir algo los costes y hemos subido lo mínimo posible el precio al consumidor» señalan desde Bodegas Ruberte que han aplicado un incremento del 5%.

Shares of telecom giant Verizon Communications were recently down more than 30% from their high point over the past year pushing the company’s dividend yield up to a fat 6.8%.

Verizon has an excellent dividend track record. The company recently increased its quarterly dividend payment by 2%. That marked the company’s 16th straight year of increasing its dividend the longest in the U.S. telecom industry.

The company has plenty of cash to cover its big-time payout. Verizon’s business generated $28.2 billion of cash from operations during the first nine months of 2022 more than covering the $15.8 billion it invested in maintaining and expanding its network. That left it with $12.4 billion of free cash flow allowing it to fund its $8.1 billion dividend outlay and strengthen its solid balance sheet. The company expects its network investments to drive future growth which should enable it to continue increasing the dividend.

Verizon is big — recently its market value topped $160 billion — and it may not be a fast grower. Still its shares are appealingly priced with a recent price-to-earnings ratio of 8.3 well below the five-year average of 11.2. Long-term investors seeking income should give the stock some consideration. (The Motley Fool has recommended Verizon Communications.)

Ask the Fool

From C.F. in Horace N.D.: What does it mean to recast a mortgage?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: Recasting also called reamortizing can be handy if you suddenly have a large lump sum you’d like to pay toward your mortgage. It involves your lender recalculating and lowering your monthly payments due to the smaller loan balance. Recasting generally doesn’t cost too much and it will save you in overall interest paid but it doesn’t change your interest rate or the terms of the loan.

Depending on the circumstances you might also consider refinancing your loan — having your loan paid off with a new loan. This does cost more but it might get you a lower interest rate a shorter term and/or lower monthly payments. It can also save you a lot in interest.

You might also just apply your lump sum against your current balance and do nothing else. Doing so will get your loan paid off sooner.

Advertisement

From H.T. in Waverly Neb.: Are growth stocks or value stocks better?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: Neither is necessarily better but certain kinds of investors might favor one or the other. Younger or more risk-tolerant investors with long time horizons might want growth stocks — shares of companies whose revenue and/or earnings are increasing at a relatively rapid rate; these could (but might not) grow phenomenally over many years. More risk-averse investors might prefer value stocks which seem undervalued and thus present lower risk.

Note though that the terms aren’t mutually exclusive. Ideally you could find and invest in rapidly growing stocks with market values significantly below what they seem to be worth. That scenario offers the best of both worlds.

The Fool’s School

So you’re planning to get a new home. Should you buy one or rent one? Well it depends.

Advertisement

Do you know the neighborhood well? If not get very familiar with it before buying lest you end up with unpleasant surprises such as a nearby landfill or frequent ambulance sirens. Renting for a while can help you learn about an area.

How long do you plan to live in the home? If it won’t be long renting can be better. Buying involves closing costs which you can’t recoup when you sell. Also homes may lose value over a short period; that’s less likely over a long one.

Are you able to maintain your home? Owners must do so and maintenance takes time and money especially if pipes burst in the winter or a new roof is needed. Renters can expect landlords to handle such challenges.

But buying a home offers benefits too. For starters your monthly housing payments can help you build equity that can be tapped later; down the road you may end up selling your home for a profit. Having a lot of home equity may also help you secure a reverse mortgage in retirement if you want one providing some needed income. (Note that renters can build wealth without real estate by investing in the stock market over a long period.)

Advertisement

Buying a home can also deliver some modest tax breaks such as deductions for mortgage interest and/or property taxes paid. Read up on the rules for these — property tax deductions for those who qualify are currently capped at $10000 per year (and that cap includes state and local income tax deductions as well).

Finally buying a home can give you some stability. Renters may be forced to move if their landlord needs or wants them out but as long as homeowners pay their bills they can stay in their homes. And fixed-rate mortgages mean that monthly loan payments will remain constant.

My Dumbest Investment

From M.D. online: My most regrettable investing move was not investing soon enough. I should have opened an account at a brokerage and bought shares of an index fund sooner. Lesson learned: I should be more proactive. You’re not going to achieve your financial goals with just a savings account and 401(k) investment choices can be limited.

Advertisement

The Fool responds: You’re absolutely right. Many of us should have started saving and investing years earlier if not a decade or two earlier. But we should look forward not back and think about what we can do now.

If you’re now saving and investing that’s terrific. Take some time to make sure you’re doing so at a rate that can get you to the nest egg you need for retirement. It’s important to invest effectively too and as you noted when interest rates are relatively low savings accounts aren’t likely to help your money grow very quickly.

Don’t count out 401(k) accounts though. They do tend to have limited menus of investments to choose from but these days they’re more and more likely to offer one or more index funds such as one that tracks the S&P 500. And a 401(k) account offers tax breaks — a traditional version can reduce your taxable income for the year and a Roth 401(k) permits tax-free withdrawals in the future.

Why it matters ISPs are perpetually among the industries that US consumers complain about most. Increased competition and more options mean better choices for you.

T-Mobile released a new study on Wednesday that touts the progress of its T-Mobile Home Internet with consumers but also speaks to the greater impact of 5G fixed wireless (including competitor Verizon 5G Home Internet) on getting more people connected across the US.

Leaning on its proprietary data and info from OpenVault and Leichtman Research T-Mobile said that its home internet service has already garnered more than 2 million customers. In the last year 78% of the 3.28 million US broadband net adds belong to T-Mobile and Verizon.

It's not shocking that customers would flock to newer options. We noted over the summer that when the American Customer Satisfaction Index released its 2022 report on ISPs the industry had dropped to dead last among all US fields with ISPs falling beneath even gas stations and social media.

Locating local internet providers

Poor customer satisfaction is a big driver for T-Mobile's aggressive courting of customers. One of its taglines is ""Take a bite out of Big Internet."" But T-Mobile also asked its customers for specific reasons why they switched to 5G internet. Over 58% listed a lower price as the main driver while 41% liked that there's no annual contract obligation. Perhaps most interestingly over a third of its customers said that simply having a new option available was a key driver in their decision to switch.

T-Mobile's study shows that 51% of its more than 2 million Home Internet customers are ditching cable internet providers. T-Mobile

All this comes less than a month after Consumer Reports released a year-long broadband costs study. The conclusion was that more competition is necessary to give US consumers adequate choices and options for internet access. Now the arrival of this T-Mobile study essentially drills the point home.

AirPods Pro 2nd generation for only $199.99 through Verizon.

Verizon slashed AirPods Pro 2 to $199.99 which is $30 cheaper than Amazon's current deal. Yet both represent a deep discount over Apple's retail price.

The $199.99 promo from Verizon is excellent since you get free two-day shipping or the potential to pick up the AirPods Pro in-store.

Amazon meanwhile is offering the 2nd Generation AirPods Pro for $229. It does promise arrival before Christmas great when shopping for a gift last-minute.

AirPods Pro 2 sound capabilities

Apple's goal with their next generation AirPods Pro product was to take the immersive experience from the AirPods Max and put them in customers' pockets. They succeeded by providing twice the noise-cancellation ability and improved 6-hour battery life on the buds.

The latest AirPods Pro supports a better Spacial Audio experience by including a new dynamic head tracking for truly immersive sound. It also helps that Apple includes four ear tips so you can find the best fit.

Both the AirPods and MagSafe case are water and sweat resistant with an IPX4 rating. The MagSafe charging case powers up to 30 total listening hours and has precision Find My settings to help protect against loss.

Plus you also get audio sharing touch controls and some of the best sound available from completely wireless buds.

Community Climate Action Day – Oakland highlighted California Volunteers’ commitment to scale up to tens of thousands of service members in the coming years. The event also showed the efforts of California Climate Action Corps’ fight against climate change.

“Oakland is showing what is possible when we invest in service” said California Chief Service Officer Josh Fryday. “We’re bringing the community together taking climate action and Fellows are getting experience and gaining career skills.”

During the event numerous fellows and volunteers removed brush for wildfire resilience planted trees and visited neighborhoods to share actions residents can take at home to reduce their carbon footprint.

Governor Gavin Newsom launched California Climate Action Corps as the nation’s first state-level climate service corps with the mission of empowering Californians to take meaningful action to protect their homes health and communities against the harshest impacts of climate change. The program is led by California Volunteers Office the Governor.

In Oakland 19 California Climate Action Corps Fellows serve with three host partners. From November 2021 through September 2022 the Climate Action Corps:

Engaged 115 people through climate-related outreach and education.

Restored 16 sites.

Built seven compost systems.

Community Climate Action Day – Oakland partners included HandsOn Bay Area City of Oakland Mayor Schaaf Assemblymember Bonta Liberation Park Verizon Trees for Oakland Higher Ground East Bay Regional Park and Oakland Parks and Recreation Foundation.

B-Roll: Community Climate Action Days

What others are saying:

“Today volunteers and community members gathered to collectively do our part to address climate change on a local level” said Assemblymember Bonta (D-Oakland). “Climate change is impacting our environment and our health. With record-breaking heat waves devastating wildfires and longer periods of drought climate change is becoming harder to ignore. I am overjoyed to see so many volunteers in Oakland as part of a broader state action organized by the California Climate Action Corps make a commitment to address climate change. Small steps we take today will have a long and positive impact.”

“No matter how big the mounting threat of climate change might feel it is imperative that we keep the momentum going in all efforts to fight it” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland). “Today that starts here at home and I am filled with so much hope by the sheer number of volunteers turning out to kick-start climate service projects in our community. The collective action of these community members will create lasting impacts for the East Bay and set an example for cities across California to engage their communities in climate action.”

“Climate change is just not something to worry about in the future it’s happening now. Wide-ranging impacts are being felt throughout California and around the globe from severe drought and devastating wildfires to deadly mega storms and catastrophic flooding” said Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley). “That’s why I’m heartened to see so many East Bay residents ‘thinking globally and acting locally’ by participating in the California Volunteers’ Oakland Community Climate Action Day focusing on urban greening wildfire resiliency and organic waste and edible food recovery.”

“Every neighborhood in California is feeling the impacts of climate change today so on-the-ground efforts like these in Oakland are vital to building an equitable and sustainable California for all” said California’s Secretary for Environmental Protection Yana Garcia. “I’m inspired by Oakland residents’ commitment to making a difference and I hope others are just as inspired to take climate action into your own hands in your own communities.”

“Oakland Thrives is thrilled to coordinate this dynamic new collaboration between our City Oakland Unified School District Oakland Promise our local colleges and universities our nonprofit partners and our local employers to saturate our city with service opportunities that are a springboard to career jobs in Oakland” said Melanie Moore Oakland Thrives CEO. “We know that service strengthens the social fabric of our communities. In our City of Service it will also grow the next generation of educators and social sector professionals — young people from Oakland serving and starting their careers right here at home.”

“Scaling service years has the power to transform lives strengthen our communities and fuel civic renewal in America” said Kristen Bennett CEO of Service Year Alliance. “Oakland is an inspiration for cities across the country that are looking to utilize national service to confront the climate crisis bolster our public health system and support students and teachers. Service Year Alliance is proud to support this city-wide collaboration and commitment to building a generation of young leaders. We look forward to bringing our expertise in place-based partnerships to help advance the work in Oakland as well as connecting local leaders to our national network of Service Year Impact Communities — from Central Texas to Western New York — to learn from one another and share their successes with communities across America.”

“As an agency we strongly believe that in order to see positive changes within your neighborhoods it takes the entire community to step up and take action. During the climate day of action we partnered with Brookfield Elementary and local residents to maintain the greenway that serves as a buffer for pollution for all Brookfield Elementary students” said Khariyyah Shabazz Higher Ground Neighborhood Development Corp. Deputy Executive Director. “We believe it is every person’s right to have clean air green spaces and an opportunity to serve.”

“WM is thrilled for the opportunity to work with California Volunteers to inform Oakland residents about the importance of composting” said Sarah LaRock public sector services manager for Waste Management. “Every Oakland resident can fight climate change from their kitchen by placing food scraps and food-soiled paper in their compost cart.”

“At Verizon we’ve instilled environmentally focused values into our culture with the continued support of our Green Team so employees can volunteer to make a difference in the communities of their choice” said Rudy Reyes Verizon West Region Vice President and Deputy General Counsel. “Today our employees are proud to join forces with California Volunteers City of Oakland California Climate Action Corps Fellows and so many others to celebrate the Community Climate Action Day as we work forward together to protect our planet for future generations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vc3BvcnRzLzIwMjIvMTIvd2hhdC1jaGFubmVsLWlzLXRoZS1uYXZ5LWZvb3RiYWxsLWdhbWUtb24tdG9kYXktdnMtYXJteS1mcmVlLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLXRpbWUtdHYtY2hhbm5lbC1mb3ItY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC1hcm15LW5hdnktZ2FtZS5odG1s0gGyAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMi8xMi93aGF0LWNoYW5uZWwtaXMtdGhlLW5hdnktZm9vdGJhbGwtZ2FtZS1vbi10b2RheS12cy1hcm15LWZyZWUtbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW0tdGltZS10di1jaGFubmVsLWZvci1jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsLWFybXktbmF2eS1nYW1lLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What channel is the Navy football game on today vs. Army? | FREE live stream time TV channel for college f,"The Army Black Knights meet the Navy Midshipman in a college football game on Saturday Dec. 10 2022 (12/10/2022) at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.

Here’s a recent college football column via the AP:

The Alabama Crimson Tide will play a football game Saturday that means ... well absolutely nothing.

Not being cruel.

It’s just the way things work in Tuscaloosa.

The Southeastern Conference championship is out of reach. All hope of claiming a spot in the College Football Playoff is gone. Which means there’s no chance of Bama winning its seventh national title since Nick Saban arrived 15 years ago.

Which means of course that the season is effectively over for the Tide.

Just how momentous of an occasion is this for the greatest dynasty in college football history?

One must go all the way back to Nov. 13 2010 for the last time Alabama played a regular-season game sans impact on the national championship race.

Since that day more than a dozen years ago the Tide has hoarded five national titles finished as the runner-up three other times and lost in the semifinals the first year of the playoff. The other two seasons Bama was eliminated from the title race by gut-wrenching defeats at the hands of rival Auburn in the regular-season finale.

With two losses — gasp! — already this season Alabama will trot on the field at Bryant-Denny Stadium for an expected beatdown of Austin Peay relying on motivational goals that are generally reserved for the common folks.

Things like pride and a better bowl bid.

“We’ve still got goals we’d like to reach” linebacker Jalen Moody insisted without naming them. “We’ve got to go out there and prepare every day so we can go out the way we came in. We can’t win a championship now but we’ve still got to finish the right way.”

Alabama’s elimination is good news for the rest of the nation which had grown weary of spending most every January watching Saban’s behemoth win or at least contend for championships.

Then again it seems a good time to add some perspective to just what an amazing run this has been for the Tide:

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Saban’s coaching colleagues in the SEC were Steve Spurrier Urban Meyer Mark Richt Gene Chizik Les Miles Bobby Petrino Houston Nutt Dan Mullen Joker Phillips Derek Dooley and Robbie Caldwell. No need to mention the Texas A&M and Missouri coaches; those schools were still two seasons away from joining the SEC.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Barack Obama was approaching the midway point of his first term and less than two weeks removed from a huge Democratic defeat in the midterm elections.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game the Miami Heat’s “Big Three” — LeBron James Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh — were off to a sluggish 5-4 start in their first season together.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game people still used BlackBerry phones hailed a cab when they needed a ride read a newspaper to figure out what was going on in the world and shopped at places known as malls.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Tom Brady was a mere child of 33 and the Buffalo Bills were 0-8 at the midway point of the NFL season.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Ke$ha had the No. 1 song in the land with “We R Who We R” and “Megamind” was the top-grossing movie.

—The last time Alabama played a meaningless regular-season game Donald Trump was hosting “The Apprentice” and most of us had never heard of Elon Musk.

Some are wondering — hoping might be a better word — that this slight dip of a season is a sign that Saban’s grip on the game is loosening.

He just turned 71. Nothing lasts forever.

Sorry that’s just wishful thinking. While undoubtedly a disappointing season by Alabama’s standards the two defeats came on a last-second field goal at Tennessee and a 2-point conversion at LSU in overtime.

The Tide is just four points away from being undefeated and right back in the thick of things. Come 2023 there’s no reason to think the school won’t be one of the leading title contenders again.

For now Alabama still has next week’s regular-season finale — the Iron Bowl against Auburn — to stir its competitive fire.

Depending on how things shake out the Tide could end up in a major bowl though it’s hard to envision future NFLers like quarterback Bryce Young and linebacker Will Anderson risking injury to play in a postseason game that doesn’t really matter.

These days Saban sounds more like a motivational speaker than a football coach. He figures the last few games as hollow as they truly are will go a long way toward establishing if this is just a blip in his dynasty or the first indication of a more significant decline.

“You know we talk a lot about culture we talk a lot about identity but really what makes you sort of motivated — what creates an identity for all of us? We all strive for self-respect but how do we go about doing it?” Saban mused this week.

“Playing this game for what we want to accomplish what we want to do re-establish the identity that we want in Alabama football” he went on. “That’s what we’re gonna try to finish and do and it’ll be interesting to see how players choose to do that.”

Never bet against Nick Saban.

Just enjoy this rare chance to spend the next couple of months without him.

I compared prices of organic produce meat and dairy at Whole Foods and Walmart in the same area.

Whole Foods has a far bigger selection with nearly every item listed as organic.

Walmart doesn't primarily sell organic products but the ones it had were mostly cheaper than at Whole Foods. Advertisement Whole Foods sells mostly organic and natural products but it's also known for high prices. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Walmart however is known for affordable prices with the majority of shelf space dedicated to non-organic products. AP Advertisement I visited both stores in the Buffalo New York area to see where to get the better deal on organic groceries. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Whole Foods easily has the greater selection with organic products prominently displayed and organic varieties of just about every item. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement Walmart has plenty of produce but the organic options are much scarcer and all grouped together. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider I compared an 18-item basket of organic produce meat and dairy at both stores and found Walmart was about 15% less expensive. Shutterstock Advertisement The Walmart basket cost $58.28 while the comparable basket at Whole Foods cost $67.25 for a price difference of $8.97. Organic vegetables d3sign/Getty Images Walmart has the lower price on a bunch of organic celery at $2.36 compared to $2.99 at Whole Foods. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement Broccoli though is a better deal at Whole Foods at $2.99 per pound a savings of 67 cents over Walmart. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Organic cauliflower had one of the biggest price disparities. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement It was $5.46 for a head of cauliflower at Whole Foods compared to $3.86 at Walmart. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Green kale was pricier at Walmart at $7.12 per pound with a difference of nearly $2 per pound. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement Walmart won the lower price on carrots at $1.96 per bunch though Whole Foods wasn't too much pricier at $2.29. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Organic avocados came out to $2.50 at Whole Foods and $1.66 at Walmart. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement Yellow onions were priced closely at both stores at $1.42 per pound at Walmart and $1.66 per pound at Whole Foods. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Organic garlic is a slightly better deal at Whole Foods with savings of about 20 cents per pound. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement Bananas are a bit pricier at Whole Foods at 79 cents per pound versus 62 cents per pound at Walmart. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider The same patterns in produce held true for meat. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement Whole Foods was the more expensive destination for organic ground beef priced at $8.99 per pound over a dollar more than Walmart's $7.28 price. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Boneless skinless chicken breasts were $6.68 per pound at Walmart much less than the $9.99 price at Whole Foods. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement A half gallon of store-brand milk was slightly more affordable at Whole Foods priced at $4.49 for a savings of 35 cents. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Generally I found that organic items were priced lower at Walmart with the biggest savings on meat. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement The selection is much more limited at Walmart though. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Despite its reputation Whole Foods wasn't actually that much more expensive than Walmart at least if you stick to basic produce and meat and avoid pricier prepared items. Mary Meisenzahl/Insider Advertisement A customer after the absolute lowest prices would probably do better at Walmart especially if they planned to buy large quantities of organic meat.

CHESAPEAKE Va. — The Hampton Roads community is still processing the shooting that took the lives of six Walmart employees last month.

Saturday afternoon Redeemed Church of God invited anyone to come and pray for those still grieving.

While the church is small its members are still doing what they can to help a grieving community.

""The families of the victims – that they’re not alone. We will wrap our arms around them and we love them too"" worship team member William Bernstein

Bernstein said after visiting the memorial outside of the Walmart off Battlefield Boulevard he was overcome with emotion. That’s when he turned to his pastor and presented the idea of the memorial service.

“We just felt like it would be a chance for us to reach out to them and share with them” Pastor Charles W. Hughes said.

The shooting also hit close to home for worship team member Denise Stephens who had previously worked at another Walmart in Chesapeake.

“That could’ve happened when I worked for the company. The could’ve been me"" Stephens said. ""I could've been the one that didn't come home to my family.""

During the memorial a church member read a small eulogy for each of the victims and the worship team ended with a hymn ""How Great Thou Art.""

Stephens said she hopes events like these can offer some healing and comfort.

""We want to grieve with you... we have grievances of our own"" she said. “I hope everybody that comes here walks away with a blessing at least. A little smile something. Something’s better than nothing.""

Walmart is offering counseling services to the shooting victims' families and survivors. The company will also pay associates while the store remains open.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwgFodHRwczovL3ByZXNzb2ZhdGxhbnRpY2NpdHkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY3JpbWUtYW5kLWNvdXJ0cy9vY2Vhbi1jb3VudHktbWFuLXdpdGgta25pZmUtY2F1c2VzLWVnZy1oYXJib3ItdG93bnNoaXAtd2FsbWFydC1ldmFjdWF0aW9uLXBvbGljZS1zYXkvYXJ0aWNsZV9iMjE1MTJlMi03OGUwLTExZWQtYmVkZC0yYmExODMxZGI3ZGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ocean County man with knife causes Egg Harbor Township Walmart evacuation police say,"EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP — An Ocean County man holding a knife was subdued by responding police Saturday afternoon inside a Walmart police said.

David Brennan 32 of Brick Township was seen by an employee holding a knife in a threatening manner in the electronics section of the Black Horse Pike store police said in a news release.

Officers arrived and found Brennan with the knife in his right hand acting erratically and ignoring commands police said. Additional officers arrived and with the assistance of Walmart employees began evacuating the store.

Officers attempted to negotiate with Brennan for about 10 minutes before he began to walk away. Due to the immediate threat to public safety and Brennan not complying officers used force to subdue him police said.

Brennan was arrested and a 5-inch folding knife was located in his right pants pocket. Egg Harbor Township EMS evaluated Brennan on scene and transported him to AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center City Campus in Atlantic City.

From New Albany Police Chief:

Union County 911 started receiving calls that there was an incident with a gun inside Walmart. Officers were dispatched at 4:29 pm and officers were on scene at 4:30 pm. While responding officers received information that shots had been fired inside Walmart. As officers entered Walmart they were directed to where Sheriff Robby Goolsby of Benton County was. Sheriff Goolsby had disarmed Roger Struble and had taken him into custody.

Apparently Mr. Struble had gotten into an argument with another shopper at Walmart. The confrontation escalated and Mr. Struble pulled a handgun from his waistband. Sheriff Goolsby was there shopping and heard the verbal confrontation and went to investigate. As Sheriff Goolsby rounded the corner he saw Mr. Struble pull the handgun from his waistband. Sheriff Goolsby then drew his weapon and ordered Mr. Struble to drop his weapon. Mr. Struble complied and Sheriff Goolsby was able to disarm him and take him into custody as other officers arrived. THERE WERE NO SHOTS FIRED!!! Thanks to the swift action of Sheriff Goolsby Mr. Struble was taken into custody without any further incident.

I personally want to thank Sheriff Goolsby for acting immediately. He was able to stop the situation before it had time to escalate and get out of control. His actions prevented potiental harm for countless number of innocent shoppers.

Even after filing a police report and spending hours on the phone with Walmart customer service Hassan Gerami 77 and Maliheh Banej Shafiei 72 still owed more than $4000 on their Walmart Rewards Mastercard.

""I am so upset with Walmart"" Banej Shafiei told CBC Toronto.

The amount includes a $29 fee the couple was charged because whoever stole the card went over its $3500 limit.

Walmart has said it has spoken with the couple and is in contact with the company that issued their card but with payment on their card statement due on Monday frustration boiled over for the residents of Richmond Hill about 37 kilometres north of Toronto.

""I say to all the people: don't buy or shop in Walmart"" Banej Shafiei said.

On Friday shortly after CBC Toronto reported on the couple's ordeal a spokesperson for Walmart Canada said the issue was resolved. The couple confirmed the company had agreed to reverse the charges within 48 hours — bringing to an end their nearly month-long struggle.

Card stolen at Richmond Hill Walmart

The ordeal began on Nov. 14. After spending about half an hour shopping at the Walmart Supercentre on Major Mackenzie Drive Banej Shafiei says she got to the register and realized her wallet was missing.

From there the pair quickly reported the credit card stolen. They filed a police report.

At first it seemed the damage wasn't that bad. After spending about an hour on the phone with Walmart Mastercard customer service Germani was told the card was only used once for a charge of $258.

But about a week later their credit card statement arrived in the mail.

""I received the monthly bill and I was really shocked because I was charged $4117"" Gerami said.

This is the Richmond Hill Ont. Walmart where Hassan Gerami and Maliheh Banej Shafiei say their Walmart Rewards Mastercard was stolen. It was then used for 16 separate transactions at the same store. (Doug Husby/CBC)

Whoever stole the card managed to make 16 purchases all at Walmart. The card's tap function was used so no PIN number or signature was required.

""Tapping one after another. They cannot stop these people"" Gerami said. ""It is shocking and it is not safe for elderly people to use Walmart Rewards Mastercard.""

Customer service concerns

Since getting the statement the couple tried desperately to get the charges cancelled.

They sent the police report to the company. It had to be faxed to Walmart which required Gerami to make two trips to a Staples store because he says Walmart provided the wrong fax number.

And they've spent hours on the phone with Walmart Mastercard customer service. But they said it was difficult to get solutions or useful information and they felt they were mostly being read scripts by call centre operators.

""When you go on the phone with Walmart Rewards Mastercard they keep you on the phone. It goes on the music and it goes on other stuff"" Gerami said.

""And then they disconnect. They don't give us right answer."".

At the time a spokesperson for Walmart Canada told CBC Toronto that the company was aware of the issue and had spoken with Gerami and Banej Shafiei. In an email the spokesperson said the credit card was issued by Fairstone and that Walmart was in touch with the financial provider.

Seniors advocate surprised

Bill VanGorder with the Canadian Association of Retired Persons (CARP) says he's surprised at how long the couple's situation took to get resolved and that credit cards are usually quick to cancel fraudulent purchases.

""I've never heard of a credit card company not standing behind this if the individuals did everything they could to protect their card.""

Bill VanGorder the chief operating officer and chief policy officer of CARP says he's 'never heard of a credit card company not standing behind this if the individuals did everything they could to protect their card.' (CARP)

VanGorder says several years ago CARP raised concerns to credit card companies about the security risks and lack of consumer protection with the tap function on cards. He says they were told in these cases victims of theft or fraud would not have to pay.

""We were told very strongly that if your card gets stolen through no fault of your own and gets used they will stand behind it and that's the protection."""
DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2hvdGVsdGVjaG5vbG9neW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvd2FsdC1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtcmVzb3J0cy1iZWdpbi10ZXN0aW5nLWRpZ2l0YWwtdm9pY2UtYXNzaXN0YW50LWRlc2lnbmVkLXRvLWVuaGFuY2UtdGhlLWd1ZXN0LWV4cGVyaWVuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walt Disney World Resorts Begins Testing Digital Voice Assistant Designed to Enhance the Guest Experience |,"Disney and Amazon have partnered to create “Hey Disney!” a new voice assistant that will soon be available to guests staying in rooms at Walt Disney World Resorts. The device which is an Amazon Echo-style device adorned with Mickey ears will allow guests to access Alexa services with a Disney twist including cameos from over 25 Disney characters. In addition to providing access to Disney content “Hey Disney!” will also be able to perform everyday tasks such as setting timers and alarms and checking the weather.

The device is expected to officially launch next year and will offer access to interactive Disney storytelling experiences and entertainment. It will also be able to perform everyday tasks like setting timers and alarms and checking the weather.

Last week Walt Disney World Resort began installing Amazon Echo Show 5 smart displays equipped with the Disney-branded version of Alexa. Guests at the resort will be able to request amenities ask for directions or park events and engage in other interactive activities using the voice assistant. The devices will be placed in a limited number of rooms at the resort and will eventually be extended to additional hotels across Disney World. However guests are not required to use the voice assistant and can choose to mute it during their stay. Because the device operates with the hotel room it will not be automatically connected to any Disney accounts.

While many are excited about the prospect of using “Hey Disney!” to enhance their resort property stay others have expressed mixed feelings about the technology. Some have criticized the name of the device arguing that it lacks creativity and that the syntax of “Hey corporate entity” is odd. Others have pointed out that Toodles the robot assistant from “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse” would have been a more suitable character for “Hey Disney!” to get kids involved in their Disney trip.

Another concern raised by some is the lack of privacy associated with “Hey Disney!”. As the device is a microphone-enabled device some are worried about the implications of having such devices in hotel rooms. However Disney has confirmed that “Hey Disney!” is completely opt-in for hotel guests and that the device will be muted when guests enter their rooms only activating after being manually unmuted.

Additionally some have questioned the usefulness of “Hey Disney!” in terms of enhancing the park-going experience. The device cannot link to a Disney account so asking it to book reservations or tickets will not work. For those looking to make dining reservations or book tickets to signature events it is recommended that they use the My Disney Experience app on their phone instead.

While the digital assistant has the potential to enhance the experience of guests staying at Walt Disney World Resorts it has also sparked some controversy and raised questions about its effectiveness and potential privacy concerns.

Amazon and Disney announced their collaboration in September 2021 and explained that Alexa and Hey Disney would coexist on Echo devices. According to Amazon the Disney version of Alexa has “1000 magical interactions to discover” and a custom guide called the Disney Magical Companion that acts as its own character.

Disney fans who have Alexa at home will be able to access the “Hey Disney” experience by paying an add-on fee for supported Amazon Echo devices via the Amazon Alexa Skills Store when it becomes available on supported devices in the future. “Hey Disney!” will allow users to interact with their favorite Disney characters listen to stories and even ask Olaf about the weather. Additionally MagicBand+ will reportedly pair with supported Amazon Echo devices to enhance certain “Hey Disney!” experiences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL2Rpc25leXMtY29udGVtcG9yYXJ5LXJlc29ydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Disney's Contemporary Resort,"

Editor's note: This story is regularly updated with the latest information.

If you want to stay as close as possible to The Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World (without breaking any rules to try to sleep in the castle) there's a very good chance that the best hotel for your Disney vacation is right on the monorail line at Disney's Contemporary Resort.

Although Walt Disney passed away several years before Disney World first opened its gates in 1971 he played a huge role in planning the initial design of this magical Central Florida land including the two original Walt Disney World hotel concepts that did open: Disney's Polynesian Village Resort and the iconic Contemporary Resort.

The park (and its original hotels) have now been open for more than 50 years but Disney's Contemporary Resort is still contemporary thanks to a recent renovation.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

The monorail runs right through the heart of the Contemporary in a way that feels classic with an ever-present nod to a midcentury modern aesthetic yet the property also manages to feel futuristic in a Tomorrowland sort of way.

Not surprisingly being as close to The Magic Kingdom as possible with the monorail running right through your hotel comes at a price. That means it requires careful consideration when figuring out whether this is the right hotel for you. To help you make a decision here's all you need to know about what it is like to stay at Disney's Contemporary Resort.

Booking

While Disney's Contemporary Resort is not the most expensive Disney World hotel it's still up toward the top of the pricing pack as a hotel on the monorail loop.

Rates for entry-level rooms at the Contemporary often range from about $500 to $700 per night. There are sometimes sales and discounts for Florida residents Disney+ subscribers and annual pass holders that can knock it down 20% to 30% but don't expect rates here to ever dip below $300 per night.

At most Disney hotels the specific room type doesn't matter all that much since a pool view versus a garden view is pretty irrelevant when you spend your days at the park and are only in your room at night. However room type really matters when staying at the Contemporary.

In fact absent an incredible deal I would probably not book a garden wing room here as those rooms can be a pretty long walk to get to the monorail and restaurants since they're physically disconnected from the main building. Additionally they're a bit claustrophobic and not nearly as special as staying in the Contemporary's true atrium tower based on my experience.

Garden rooms at the Contemporary. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

To put it another way if you want the full Contemporary experience book the atrium rooms. They will cost more but they're the reason why you choose this resort over another Disney property.

If you can't swing a stay in the Contemporary's pricier accommodations I recommend picking one of the more affordable Disney hotels instead of the Contemporary's garden rooms. For example the rooms at Disney's Wilderness Lodge are only a boat ride away from The Magic Kingdom but cost considerably less — and are arguably nicer — than the Contemporary's garden rooms.

On the other end of the expense spectrum if your budget allows it's hard to beat a club-level room at the Contemporary. Those accommodations are usually at least $700 per night though you'll see them cost well above that during busy periods like the winter holidays. For example our one-night stay in a club-level room in November 2022 cost us $999 before taxes and fees.

By paying up for a club-level accommodation at Disney World you'll enjoy access to a number of extras. At the Contemporary this means upgraded service the use of a lounge with free beverages (both alcoholic and nonalcoholic) and complimentary breakfast dinner and dessert small plates all of which were tasty. For a big splurge Disney trip it's a next-level offering that is hard to beat.

Regardless of which room you book consider using miles from your Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card or Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card (which earns you miles worth 1 cent apiece) to keep some cash in your pocket while visiting. Alternatively you can use your Bilt Rewards points. They're worth 1.25 cents each and can be applied toward Disney hotel bookings when redeemed in the Bilt Travel Portal.

If you're a fan of Disney Vacation Club know that the main Contemporary complex doesn't have any DVC rooms. However Bay Lake Tower at Disney's Contemporary Resort which has rooms bookable with DVC points shares the same grounds. This is important to know even if you aren't a DVC member as you can rent DVC points to reduce your out-of-pocket costs by potentially hundreds of dollars.

Location

The main draw of Disney's Contemporary Resort is without question its location.

When you stay here you're not only a short monorail ride away from The Magic Kingdom. You're also within a 10-minute walk from the park should you decide you want a leisurely stroll.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

We timed the journey by making it a family race of sorts and found that an adult walking from the Contemporary to The Magic Kingdom can often reach the park faster than those taking the monorail since it stops at the Ticketing and Transportation Center Disney's Polynesian Village Resort and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa along the way.

Going the other way is much faster by monorail though as the Contemporary is the first stop after leaving the park.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Since Epcot is also accessible via the monorail you can take it from the Contemporary to that park as well. You'll transfer at the TTC to board the Epcot-designated monorail. Additionally there are Disney buses and the pay-per-use Minnie Vans available in the Lyft app should you wish to reach other areas of the Disney complex such as Disney Springs or Disney's Hollywood Studios.

While it wasn't operational when I checked during my visit you can sometimes take a boat to Disney's Wilderness Lodge and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground too.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Check-in

You can check in to Disney's Contemporary Resort via the My Disney Experience app which makes it possible to get your room assignment before you arrive at the hotel.

This is how we were able to get our room by 1:30 p.m. which is 2 1/2 hours ahead of the official check-in time as we were heading over from a short stay at the Walt Disney World Swan Reserve. Because we were switching hotels we didn't have to worry about our luggage as Disney will transfer it upon request even if you stay at a property that is not a full-fledged Disney resort such as the Walt Disney World Swan Walt Disney World Dolphin or Walt Disney World Swan Reserve.

By using Disney's direct-to-room service you can use your phone and/or MagicBand to open your room door. Simply wait for the text or notification that your room is ready before heading directly to your accommodation. If checking in on the app isn't an option or you prefer a traditional check-in experience you can instead head to the reception area in the hotel's lobby.

If you visited the property prior to its extensive renovation that debuted in 2020 you'll notice the changes as soon as you step into the lobby.

Instead of the relatively nondescript color palette of whites browns and greens previously featured the hotel now showcases a bright midcentury modern design with nods to both ""The Incredibles"" and the era in which the hotel was built. Decor details range from the overt to the subtle and in my opinion restored the grandeur of this hotel in a way that feels true to its roots and makes it relevant today.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Beyond the refreshed decor there's a fun feature for kids. To keep the little ones occupied while you check in the hotel has a miniature waiting area within the lobby. There your kids can watch a TV playing cartoons from pint-size chairs. I suggest taking full advantage of this space especially if there's a long wait when you arrive.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Disney does its best to accommodate early check-in and late checkout requests but they're rarely granted given the volume of guests that enter the resorts every day. You should assume that you likely won't be able to check in until 4 p.m. and will need to check out by 11 a.m. (the Contemporary's posted times).

It never hurts to ask though as I lucked into an early check-in slot during my most recent stay after initially being turned down.

Room

If you visited Disney's Contemporary Resort prior to the 2020 renovation you'll hardly recognize the new rooms. The dark dated rooms of yesteryear are now light airy and just plain fun.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Gone are the dark wood furnishings and uninspired decor from our stay in 2018.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Instead you'll now find a mix of white beige and light gray hues with colorful pops of orange and blue. As an added bonus each space also comes equipped with all the modern-day amenities you could need such as multiple outlets a Keurig coffee maker and a glass-enclosed shower with a rainfall shower.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3 4

As you might expect there are also adorable Disney touches that serve as a perfect example of why Disney resorts are so special and several notches above most other family-friendly hotels.

I won't give away all of these not-so-hidden gems as they are fun to stumble upon but expect to find some memorable details inspired by ""The Incredibles"" including a themed closet with hanging super suits.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

While standard rooms face the resort grounds and are rather underwhelming given the price accommodations in the main tower are solid overall. If possible you'll want to pay up for a room in the main tower's atrium that faces The Magic Kingdom as these accommodations offer pretty fantastic views of the park's fireworks.

We splurged on this view when my kids were younger since we knew the littlest one in our crew wouldn't last in the park until Main Street U.S.A.'s fireworks go off around closing time. It's not an upcharge we typically go for now that the kids are older but it was a true treat to watch the show from our balcony with a glass of wine as the accompanying soundtrack played on our in-room TV.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

If you're like us and have older kids who can stay up to watch the fireworks in the park don't worry about springing for a theme park-facing room especially if you're traveling with multiple people. We prefer paying a little more for an atrium room that can sleep up to five guests (i.e. one with a sofa that easily converts to a handy single bed) instead of a space with a view of the fireworks.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3

No matter which room we're in we find that we sleep like exhausted babies each time. However there's one negative we've consistently noticed: The Contemporary's rooms tend to feel more humid than I'd like.

On our latest visit our room was at the end of the hallway by an exterior door that was propped open at times which probably didn't help. Still even during other stays we've noticed the humidity more while in our room. It's never been bad enough to disturb us greatly but it's worth noting especially if you're planning a summer visit.

Food and beverage

Aside from being ultra-convenient to The Magic Kingdom the Contemporary shines when it comes to dining.

Chef Mickey's

On the same level as the monorail Chef Mickey's is one of the most popular restaurants on the Disney resort grounds — and for good reason. Meals here are legendary as they give you the opportunity to hang with Mickey Minnie Pluto Donald and Goofy as you eat.

Chef Mickey's. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

While Chef Mickey's character meals are available for breakfast and dinner daily I'd argue that the late breakfast hours on a day when you're not heading to the parks is the best time to go.

During this block of time you'll avoid an early wake-up call and spend less as the breakfast service — which is available from 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. — costs $45 per adult and $29 per child 3 and older (kids 2 and younger dine for free). Should you opt to visit during dinner expect to pay $59 per adult and $38 per child.

For breakfast the all-you-care-to-enjoy items include eggs Mickey waffles chicken sausage slow-roasted beef brisket loaded potato-cheese casserole and banana bread French toast among other options. The dinner menu features a number of plated selections such as potato gnocchi roasted salmon pork loin and baby carrots.

Chef Mickey's is a bright loud fun and upbeat experience so plan accordingly — and have your camera ready.

When my kids were younger eating here was the easiest way to meet all these key characters as we didn't have to worry about leaving the hotel's indulgent air conditioning to schlep about the parks in search of our favorite figures. It may not be the most cost-effective way to hang out with Mickey Mouse but it's certainly the most convenient option.

Steakhouse 71

For a more refined meal Steakhouse 71 is a terrific new addition to the Contemporary. Paying homage to the resort's 1971 opening in its name the restaurant serves some of Walt's favorites every day for breakfast lunch and dinner.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1

For breakfast you'll find Walt's Prime Rib Hash ($18) plus a Florida-inspired eggs Benedict ($19) and various omelets ($17 each).

On the lunch and dinner menus there are all kinds of comfort classics with an elevated twist such as gourmet grilled cheese ($17) a burger on a brioche bun topped with lemon aioli ($21) beef tenderloin medallions ($39) and a whiskey-infused chocolate cake ($11).

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 Steakhouse 71. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2

Steakhouse 71 reservations are generally much easier to nab than those for Chef Mickey's. So if you don't want to worry about trying to score a table as soon as they become available 60 days before your visit this higher-end option could be the place to dine.

California Grill

One of the best restaurants in all of Disney World sits at the top of the Contemporary. With its panoramic view of The Magic Kingdom and its evening fireworks California Grill is a dining venue you have to experience for yourself.

Although reservations are tough to get during the prime dinner and fireworks hours checking 60 days out when they open for booking is well worth the effort. Know though that you'll need to pack appropriate attire for meals here since the venue requires guests to dress ""in attire that respects the restaurant's sophisticated and upscale aesthetic.""

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Prices are high too so budget accordingly.

The restaurant is typically an a la carte establishment. However it's currently offering a special three-course fixed-price menu in honor of Disney World's 50th-anniversary celebration so you'll see meals priced at $89 for adults and $39 for children 9 and younger.

Items currently on the menu include classics from when the restaurant (formerly known as Top of the World) opened in 1971 such as duck a l'orange and limited-time dishes like an ""EARidescent"" creme brulee.

Contempo Café

The Contemporary is home to more than sit-down establishments so you can get your food on the run if you'd rather set aside less time and money for meals.

Contempo Café has an eclectic mix of options ranging from internationally inspired items like Chef Gina's lemongrass chicken banh mi ($12.29) and a grilled tofu bowl ($12.99) to comfort classics like a burger with fries ($13.49) and an all-meat flatbread ($12.29). You can order ahead in the Disney app so that your food is ready when you walk up to grab it.

Club lounge

Because I stayed in a club-level room I also had access to a lounge with a variety of complimentary dishes and beverages. Of the club-level rooms at Disney World that I've tried this one at the Contemporary remains at the top of my list thanks to the lounge's service and diverse selection of items.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 Club level at Disney's Contemporary Resort. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2

Situated on the Contemporary's 12th floor the club-level lounge is open every day from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. The food and beverage selections rotate throughout the day so you'll find a mix of items to try as you pop in and out.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Coffee comes out at 6:30 a.m. which is key for those doing early theme park entry as a Disney resort guest. For something more substantial you'll find continental breakfast options available from 7 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.

During our recent stay breakfast items included tortillas with potato egg and onion; small pieces of avocado toast; fried chicken biscuits with bacon pepper jam; shrimp and grits; pastries; and fruit. Much of the food is prepared in the California Grill kitchen located a few floors above so you can expect some pretty fantastic bites when you visit.

Between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. more hot food comes out — enough to make a meal of it if you aren't with a super picky group of eaters. Or you can grab one or two hors d'oeuvres to enjoy as an appetizer before heading to a full-service restaurant on or off the property.

While we were here the evening spread consisted of miso-braised short ribs honey- and soy-glazed salmon tater tots corn dog nuggets a meat and cheese spread buckwheat noodles lemongrass shrimp and a delicious Thai peanut chicken salad.

By 8 p.m. the menu shifts to dessert with savory items swapped out for various drinks and sweet treats. They're a perfect accompaniment to The Magic Kingdom fireworks viewable from the lounge's balcony.

Amenities

While the Contemporary wins when it comes to location and dining it doesn't have the absolute best lineup of amenities for a deluxe Disney resort. Nevertheless it does have some fun options.

Pools

There are two pools on-site: the main pool and an all-ages quiet pool.

Open every day from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. the large activity pool (known as the Feature Pool) has a 17-foot waterslide and lifeguards.

Towels and chairs are in ample supply and there's a hot tub smack dab in the middle of the action if you find the water a touch too cold during the cooler months but want to keep an eye on the kids. There's also a water playground with water cannons and fountains by the main pool should you have little ones in tow.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 Pools at the Contemporary Resort. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3 4

While this is a solid pool option the pools at the Polynesian Disney's Yacht Club Resort and even the Wilderness Lodge rank higher in my book due to their theming and kid-friendly water features. It's also worth noting that this main pool will be closed from early January to early April 2023 as it gets refurbished so if pools are important to you you may want to stay elsewhere.

A smaller circular pool known as the Bay Lake Pool is also available at the Contemporary should you want to take a dip without all the action of the Feature Pool. It sits behind the main pool and is open longer (from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.) though it does not have a lifeguard and asks that guests not splash or make loud noises while visiting.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Should you need a break from the pools you can play volleyball on the sand court located between the pools and the lagoon.

Arcade

Kids who love gaming or need a distraction on a rainy day will find an arcade on the Contemporary's fourth floor.

Although games in the arcade aren't free they're certainly cheaper than a park ticket. An array of options are available including classics like Pac-Man and Skee Ball.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Gym

On the hotel's third floor the gym houses a decent selection of machines free weights medicine balls and more.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 Disney's Contemporary gym. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2

Since many theme park visitors walk 15000 to 20000 steps in a single visit it's easy to understand why this fitness center stays empty most of the time. It also doesn't help that the space isn't very inviting as it has low ceilings isn't staffed and sits in a mostly unused part of the hotel. The lighting left a lot to be desired too when I stopped by.

Boat rentals

Because of its location right on Seven Seas Lagoon the Contemporary offers boat rentals to guests. Each Sun Tracker Pontoon boat can seat up to 10 guests and is available for $45 per half-hour.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2

If you don't want to captain your own vessel consider booking a fireworks cruise that departs from the hotel's dock. It comes complete with a captain and snacks and soft drinks though it's not cheap at $399 per boat for up to 10 guests.

Service

The lesser-known star of Disney's Contemporary Resort is undoubtedly its top-notch service. Whether I've stayed in an entry-level garden room or an upgraded club-level accommodation I've always enjoyed exceptional service from the property's staff.

On my most recent visit which came with higher service standards due to booking a club-level room the hotel proactively reached out to me multiple times via email and by phone to make sure I was aware of everything I needed to know and could make any special requests ahead of my one-night stay.

Then at check-in the cast member noticed that my kids had the new Disney MagicBand+ and asked if I had connected the bands to my phone. Funny enough while I had activated them I was having trouble getting them associated with my phone so I was able to get help setting them up all thanks to this cast member asking a simple question.

TARAH CHIEFFI/THE POINTS GUY

Then there's Dave one of my absolute favorite Disney World cast members. We met Dave during our first stay at the Contemporary back in 2018 when we'd previously booked a club-level room. My kids were little back then and he made their day — or honestly their trip — by busting out a spot-on Mickey Mouse voice that made them laugh so hard they still remember it.

While we didn't hear his awesome vocal skills this time around we were excited to spot him yet again. Based on conversations I overheard it sounds like he's still delighting guests in the same way he entertained my kids several years ago.

Accessibility

Disney is known for being pretty accessible and this hotel is no exception — with one important thing to note.

Disney's Contemporary Resort is like every other Disney resort in that there is an accessible path of travel connecting the lobby rooms restaurants shops pools and facilities such as laundry and the gym. However this property actively utilizes more levels than comparable Disney hotels.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

For example there are some noteworthy amenities and services on the lobby level and third fourth and 15th floors meaning you'll need to set aside a fair amount of time waiting for an elevator if stairs and escalators are not an option. It's not substantial enough of a wait to be a deal breaker but it is worth noting so you're adequately prepared.

At the pools and poolside hot tub you'll find lifts. Additionally standard parking is complimentary for guests with a valid disability parking permit. Parking otherwise costs $25 per night for standard parking and $33 per night for valet parking.

Overall impression

Disney's Contemporary Resort is a Walt Disney World icon.

It's been part of the complex since the beginning — and by design it feels like an extension of Tomorrowland the closest land in the Magic Kingdom.

When you stay here you are literally in the Disney Bubble so the magic convenience and theming are all around you from the moment you wake to the moment you drift off into dreamland.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

The rooms lobby and other common areas at the Contemporary have greatly improved in recent years though you'll still want to skip the basic garden room option in favor of a room in the main building's atrium so you can watch the monorail go in and out as you walk the halls of the resort — a bucket list experience for every Disney fan.

It may not be the best resort to stay at if you plan on having lots of downtime for on-site amenities and it's certainly not the flashiest option out there.

However it continues to be the best accommodation option for young families planning a special trip to The Magic Kingdom as its incredibly convenient location makes it a cinch for guests to maximize their time in the parks and even pop back for an afternoon nap.

Over 2000 jobs will reportedly move to what Disney describes as a master-planned working community.

Since that official announcement fans have questioned whether the move was still on. Some Imagineers left the company following the announcement not wanting to relocate their families from California to Florida. As of now the relocation has been delayed until 2026.

With the swift arrival of Bob Iger back at the head of The Walt Disney Company many concluded the entire move was canceled. However it seems like the project is still moving forward at this time.

Disney recently held an event called “The Future of Lake Nona” in Orlando with Jessi Blakely making a few comments “There are a lot of exciting announcements that I cannot break today but are imminent; even in the next coming months. I would say in the short-term future things are moving along with Disney very well” said Blakely who serves as Vice President of the Tavistock Development Company.

“I do expect that there will be news in the coming months and year around that project. It’s a 60-acre regional campus that they’re creating. They were approved to build 1.8 million square feet of development so hopefully you’ll hear more about what their development plans are for that property.”

The full clip can be found below:

Orlando Sentinel reported in July of 2021 that Disney could receive over $570 million in tax breaks from the state of Florida for building the campus and cited this as a significant reason for the move. This tax break would be among the largest for a major American corporation.

Lake Nona is an up-and-coming area in Orlando that is close to the theme parks and this change will only continue to increase the Florida economy which has been doing well due to the housing demand the state has seen throughout the pandemic. It is also one of the more expensive areas to live in when it comes to Orlando locations.

At the Bhalswa landfill in northwest Delhi a steady flow of jeeps zigzag up the trash heap to dump more garbage on a pile now over 62 meters (203 feet) high.

Fires caused by heat and methane gas sporadically break out – the Delhi Fire Service Department has responded to 14 fires so far this year – and some deep beneath the pile can smolder for weeks or months while men women and children work nearby sifting through the rubbish to find items to sell.

Some of the 200000 residents who live in Bhalswa say the area is uninhabitable but they can’t afford to move and have no choice but to breathe the toxic air and bathe in its contaminated water.

Bhalswa is not Delhi’s largest landfill. It’s about three meters lower than the biggest Ghazipur and both contribute to the country’s total output of methane gas.

Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide but a more potent contributor to the climate crisis because methane traps more heat. India creates more methane from landfill sites than any other country according to GHGSat which monitors methane via satellites.

And India comes second only to China for total methane emissions according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global Methane Tracker.

As part of his “Clean India” initiative Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal if achieved could relieve some of the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these dump sites – and help the world lower its greenhouse gas emissions.

India wants to lower its methane output but it hasn’t joined the 130 countries who have signed up to the Global Methane Pledge a pact to collectively cut global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Scientists estimate the reduction could cut global temperature rise by 0.2% – and help the world reach its target of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.

India says it won’t join because most of its methane emissions come from farming – some 74% from farm animals and paddy fields versus less than 15% from landfill.

In a statement last year Minister of State for Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate change Ashwini Choubey said pledging to reduce India’s total methane output could threaten the livelihood of farmers and affect India’s trade and economic prospects.

But it’s also facing challenges in reducing methane from its steaming mounds of trash.

‘Here we are with no relief’

When Narayan Choudhary 72 moved to Bhalswa in 1982 he said it was a “beautiful place” but that all changed 12 years later when the first rubbish began arriving at the local landfill.

In the years since the Bhalswa dump has grown nearly as tall as the historic Taj Mahal becoming a landmark in its own right and an eyesore that towers over surrounding homes affecting the health of people who live there.

Choudhary suffers from chronic asthma. He said he nearly died when a large fire broke out at Bhalswa in April that burned for days. “I was in terrible shape. My face and nose were swollen. I was on my death bed” he said.

“Two years ago we protested … a lot of residents from this area protested (to get rid of the waste)” Choudhary said. “But the municipality didn’t cooperate with us. They assured us that things will get better in two years but here we are with no relief.”

The dump site exhausted its capacity in 2002 according to a 2020 report on India’s landfills from the Center for Science and Environment (CSE) a nonprofit research agency in New Delhi but without government standardization in recycling systems and greater industry efforts to reduce plastic consumption and production tonnes of garbage continue to arrive at the site daily.

Bhalswa isn’t the only dump causing distress to residents nearby – it is one of three landfills in Delhi overflowing with decaying waste and emitting toxic gases into the air.

Across the country there are more than 3100 landfills. Ghazipur is the biggest in Delhi standing at 65 meters (213 feet) and like Bhalswa it surpassed its waste capacity in 2002 and currently produces huge amounts of methane.

According to GHGSat on a single day in March more than two metric tons of methane gas leaked from the site every hour.

“If sustained for a year the methane leak from this landfill would have the same climate impact as annual emissions from 350000 US cars” said GHGSat CEO Stephane Germain.

Dangerous toxins in groundwater

Methane emissions aren’t the only hazard that stem from landfills like Bhalswa and Ghazipur. Over decades dangerous toxins have seeped into the ground polluting the water supply for thousands of residents living nearby.

In May CNN commissioned two accredited labs to test the ground water around the Bhalswa landfill. And according to the results ground water within at least a 500-meter (1600-foot) radius around the waste site is contaminated.

In the first lab report levels of ammonia and sulphate were significantly higher than acceptable limits mandated by the Indian government.

Results from the second lab report showed levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) – the amount of inorganic salts and organic matter dissolved in the water – detected in one of the samples was almost 19 times the acceptable limit making it unsafe for human drinking.

The Bureau of Indian Standards sets the acceptable limit of TDS at 500 milligrams/liter a figure roughly seen as “good” by the World Health Organization (WHO). Anything over 900 mg/l is considered “poor” by the WHO and over 1200 mg/l is “unacceptable.”

According to Richa Singh from the Center for Science and Environment (CSE) the TDS of water taken near the Bhalswa site was between 3000 and 4000 mg/l. “This water is not only unfit for drinking but also unfit for skin contact” she said. “So it can’t be used for purposes like bathing or cleaning of the utensils or cleaning of the clothes.”

Dr. Nitesh Rohatgi the senior director of medical oncology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute Gurugram urged the government to study the health of the local population and compare it to other areas of the city “so that in 15 to 20 years’ time we are not looking back and regretting that we had a higher cancer incidence higher health hazards higher health issues and we didn’t look back and correct them in time.”

Most people in Bhalswa rely on bottled water for drinking but they use local water for other purposes – many say they have no choice.

“The water we get is contaminated but we have to helplessly store it and use it for washing utensils bathing and at times drinking too” said resident Sonia Bibi whose legs are covered in a thick red rash.

Jwala Prashad 87 who lives in a small hut in an alleyway near the landfill said the pile of putrid trash had made his life “a living hell.”

“The water we use is pale red in color. My skin burns after bathing” he said as he tried to soothe red gashes on his face and neck.

“But I can’t afford to ever leave this place” he added.

Waste target in doubt

More than 2300 tonnes of Municipal Solid Waste arrive at Delhi’s largest dump in Ghazipur every day according to a report released in July by a joint committee formed to find a way to reduce the number of fires at the site.

That’s the bulk of the waste from the surrounding area – only 300 tonnes is processed and disposed of by other means the report said. And less than 7% of legacy waste had been bio-mined which involves excavating treating and potentially reusing old rubbish.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi deploys drones every three months to monitor the size of the trash heap and is experimenting with ways to extract methane from the trash mountain the report said.

But too much rubbish is arriving every day to keep up. The committee said bio-mining had been “slow and tardy” and it was “highly unlikely” the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (which has now merged with North and South Delhi Municipal Corporations) would achieve its target of “flattening the garbage mountain” by 2024.

“No effective plans to reduce the height of the garbage mountain have been made” the report said. Furthermore “it should have proposed a long time ago that future dumping of garbage in them would pollute the groundwater systems” the report added.

CNN sent a series of questions along with the data from the water testing questionnaire to India’s Environment and Health Ministries. There has been no response from the ministries.

In a 2019 report the Indian government recommended ways to improve the country’s solid waste management including formalizing the recycling sector and installing more compost plants in the country.

While some improvements have been made such as better door-to-door garbage collection and processing of waste Delhi’s landfills continue to accumulate waste.

In October the National Green Tribunal fined the state government more than $100 million for failing to dispose of more than 30 million metric tonnes of waste across its three landfill sites.

“The problem is Delhi doesn’t have a concrete solid waste action plan in place” said Singh from the CSE. “So we are talking here about dump site remediation and the treatment of legacy waste but imagine the fresh waste which is generated on a regular basis. All of that is getting dumped everyday into these landfills.”

“(So) let’s say you are treating 1000 tons of legacy (waste) and then you are dumping 2000 tons of fresh waste every day it will become a vicious cycle. It will be a never ending process” Singh said.

“Management of legacy waste of course is mandated by the government and is very very important. But you just can’t start the process without having an alternative facility of fresh waste.

The Quick Response code model launched by Tiruchi Corporation in September to monitor door-to-door waste collection and segregation has been received well by residents.

The reception for the QR code method implemented in parts of K.K. Nagar on a pilot basis has been positive and helped bring down waste piling on the roadsides in the streets. Officials say the civic body has planned to extend the method to all parts of the city to ensure accountability in door-to-door waste collection.

In the initial phase the civic body has started distributing QR code cards to households and commercial buildings in K. Abishekapuram zone. During waste collection the sanitary workers will scan the unique QR code affixed at the entrance of the house and record their feedback to make sure whether the segregation of waste was done at the source or not.

While individual houses will be given a QR code card apartments will be grouped together and given a single card with a common QR code which will be handed over to the Residents Welfare Association concerned.

“At present we are able to determine how many houses are segregating waste and how many are handing over the waste. If a house has not handed over waste in a while the sanitation worker has to address the reason behind it” a senior Corporation official said.

According to an official the civic body will affix QR codes at all residences and commercial establishments before March 2023. “The system was well-received by the people and we have observed that the habit of dumping waste on the streets has significantly decreased” he added.

The civic body is conducting a detailed study of the model and if the desired outcomes are achieved the method will be be projected as a model for implementation throughout the State.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxuZXdzYXNpYS5jb20vY25hLWluc2lkZXIvdGhhaWxhbmQtcGxhc3RpYy13YXN0ZS1pbXBvcnQtcHJvYmxlbS1vY2Vhbi13YXRlcndheXMtMzEzMjI1MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With locals not disposing of plastic correctly Thailand is importing the world's waste instead,"BANGKOK: A temple south of Bangkok has an unusual ask for its followers: They are encouraged to drop off plastic and glass bottles milk cartons paper and other used items.

At the Chak Daeng temple the items are then sorted. Plastic bottles are compressed into bales that will be sent to a factory to be turned into polymer fibres.

These are then mixed with cotton fibres to become thread which is woven into fabric.

After the fabric is dyed saffron it is sent back to the temple to be made into monks’ robes. “If we can make a robe from a plastic bottle that means we’re following Lord Buddha’s teaching” said temple abbot Pra Maha Pranom.

Taking care of the environment is in keeping with Buddhist teachings he added. And believers can do so by “collecting garbage or planting trees”."

Exclusive new data shows rents at Clear Island Waters on the Gold Coast have increased more than any other suburb with the average tenant now paying $1400 for a house – that’s almost an extra $580 extra a week.

But the cost of renting on the Gold Coast is soaring across much of the region according to the PropTrack research.

Of the top 10 suburbs for house rent price growth seven are on the Gold Coast and include Willow Vale (+33.3%) Miami (+33.3%) Highland Park (+30.4%) Paradise Point (+30%) and Tamborine Mountain and Surfers Paradise both up 27.5 per cent in a year.

Kollosche managing director Michael Kollosche said the increase in rental prices was a direct result of huge demand on the Gold Coast.

“This is obviously the after-effect of a significant increase in population growth through Covid where developers couldn’t keep up with the demand for investment” Mr Kollosche said.

“Until the State Government starts to offer significantly more incentives to the private enterprise to build-to-rent in the form of relaxation on land tax incentives around stamp duty incentives around GST we are going to find that this problem will be exacerbated.

“Especially while building prices are at unsustainable levels and builders are experiencing far too much work.”

And Harcourts Coastal business development manager Brent Martens said he didn’t see a slowdown in rental demand anytime soon.

“We thought it would just be during that Covid period but that’s not the case at all” Mr Martens said.

“We’re still finding every third or fourth call for a rental is an expat or people moving here from Sydney or Melbourne.

“We’re also seeing those international students coming back now that borders have opened.”

“If something is priced well we will get 200-300 inquiries within 48 hours of listing it.

“We’re also finding a lot of people who are looking to rent are people who have cashed in on the market.”

The other top suburbs for rent hikes were all in the Wide Bay region – Bargara (+32.1%) Thabeban (+28.6%) and Southside (+26.8%).

In Greater Brisbane renters at Sadliers Crossing (Ipswich) have seen the biggest increase in weekly prices up 32.9 per cent.

It was followed by Sandgate (+30.4%) Ormiston (+27.3%) Gaythorne (+26.6%) and Upper Caboolture (+26.3%).

Renters in Graceville Ningi Beachmere Mount Warren Park and Milton are also paying north of 25 per cent more for houses now than 12 months ago.

PropTrack’s economist Anne Flaherty said Queensland had seen extraordinary population growth during the pandemic and that demand had outstripped rental supply.

“It does sound extreme when you see 41.4 per cent increases but we have seen this occurring in in-demand suburbs” she said.

“There is so much competition that landlords are monitoring rent growth but they are also watching their own increasing costs.

“It all comes back to supply and demand and while the movement to Queensland during the pandemic was out of the ordinary we do expect it will continue to be one of the fastest growing states.”

It comes as new research by the Real Estate Institute of Australia shows that Queensland has recorded it biggest rent rises since 2003.

REIA president Hayden Groves said Brisbane rents had increased the most of all eight capital cities over the past year with 3-bedroom houses increasing 22 per cent and 2-bedroom houses increasing 20 per cent.

The latest REIQ Vacancy Report showed that the tightest markets in Queensland were Goondiwindi Southern Downs and the South Burnett (0.15) while in Brisbane vacancy rates are between 0.6 and 0.8 per cent.

Up north the vacancy rate is 0.5 per cent in Cairns and Townsville while on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast the vacancy rates are 0.6 per cent.

And the PropTrack data shows that for units the impact of soaring rents is being felt across an even bigger geographical area.

Median rents for units in Peregian Beach have soared 30 per cent to $650 a week while Sunrise Beach and Beerwah units are up 23.6 per cent 21.5 per cent respectively.

Two Townsville suburbs – Ingham (+27.8%) and Belgian Gardens (+25.4%) – round out the top three suburbs for rent rises over the past 12 months.

The rest can be found on the Gold Coast – Arundel Merrimac Bundall Ashmore and Coombabah – with weekly rents climbing between 22.2 and 25 per cent.

The biggest rent hikes in Greater Brisbane have occurred in Red Hill up 25.5 per cent followed by Murrarie (+22.9%) and Rosewood (+21.3%).

The remaining top 10 spots went to North Lakes Wavell Heights Newstead Kippa-Ring Albion Sandgate and Lawnton with weekly rents rising between 13.2 and 18.8 per cent.

WFC,Wells Fargo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzEwL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWhhcy1wbGVudHktb2YtcnVud2F5LW9uLWl0cy1lZmZpY2llbmN5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo Has Plenty of Runway on Its Efficiency Initiatives,"The bank has cut expenses in recent years but management sees more areas to realize cost savings.

Nearly two years ago Wells Fargo (WFC 1.00%) launched a big initiative to improve its efficiency ratio which looks at a bank's expenses expressed as a percentage of its revenue. The lower the efficiency ratio the better because it means a bank is spending less for each dollar of revenue it generates.

So far the efficiency work has been pretty well received by the market and management has lived up to its promises. However at a recent conference CEO Charlie Scharf said he still thought the bank was ""incredibly inefficient.""

He's not necessarily wrong as Wells Fargo's efficiency ratio has still been above 70% in most of its recent quarters. Ideally investors will want to see Wells Fargo lower that number to below 60% at least on a core basis. Scharf recently indicated that there is plenty of room for improvement on the expense and revenue side.

How expense initiatives are coming

When Wells Fargo first launched its efficiency initiative at the start of 2021 the plan was to realize $8 billion of gross cost savings over a three-to-four-year period by optimizing the bank's organizational structure cutting branches making layoffs and installing new loan origination systems among other actions.

The work is moving along nicely. At the end of 2020 Wells Fargo had about $57.6 billion in expenses. At the end of last year expenses fell to about $53.8 billion after the bank realized about $3.7 billion of gross cost savings. This year Wells Fargo is on track to realize another $3.3 billion in gross cost savings although the bank will likely exceed its $51.5 billion expense target due to operating losses for historic events such as the phony-accounts scandal that have run hot this year.

That's already about $7 billion of gross cost savings in two years. However Wells Fargo now plans to achieve $10 billion of gross cost savings and Scharf recently said at the conference that he sees room for more. For instance Scharf noted that the bank is ""probably several years behind"" its peers in terms of right-sizing its branch network and the staffing inside those branches. More details about future gross cost savings could come during Wells Fargo's next earnings call.

Wells Fargo sees revenue opportunities

Since the efficiency initiative started a lot of the focus was on expenses. But Scharf is certainly seeing revenue opportunities in the future as well.

Wells Fargo has a smaller corporate investment bank than its peers but it does see an opportunity for measured growth within its current franchise particularly around U.S. middle-market clients with whom it already does a lot of business. The idea is to essentially complement its incredibly strong commercial banking franchise and serve these customers with investment banking products.

The idea of serving clients in a more holistic manner is a common theme among Scharf's revenue ambitions. For instance he said the consumer bank and wealth management business used to run very separately even to the point where the bank wasn't really focusing on more affluent customers who could be ideal clients for the bank's wealth management division. Now Scharf says the culture has changed and wealth management is in a place where the bank went from defense to offense.

Wells Fargo also started to ramp up credit card lending in recent years a product that can be quite profitable if done in a disciplined manner that avoids excessive loan defaults. Credit card loan balances in the third quarter of this year were up 8% year over year at the bank.

A positive efficiency outlook

Although the bank realized a lot of gross cost savings in the first two years of its efficiency initiative there still seems to be plenty of room to continue to cut expenses. At some point in the future operating losses from the phony-accounts scandal and other past scandals will go away. They are unfortunate but not part of core expenses.

Furthermore the bank benefits from the rising interest rate environment which drives up yields on its loans and securities and Wells Fargo also seems to have other areas of the bank where it can grow fee revenue.

Any bank that can lower expenses and grow revenue will bring down its efficiency ratio and this usually results in good things happening to the stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9mb3JtZXItd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tZXhlY3V0aXZlcy1jb3VsZC1mYWNlLXN1YnN0YW50aWFsLXBlbmFsdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Penalties Industry Bans Come From Wells Fargo Scandal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/former-wells-fargo-executives-could-face-substantial-penalties on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9mb3JtZXItd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tZXhlY3V0aXZlcy1jb3VsZC1mYWNlLXN1YnN0YW50aWFsLXBlbmFsdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIyLzEyLzEwL2hhYml0YXQtZm9yLWh1bWFuaXR5LWRlZGljYXRlcy1uZXctaG9tZXMtdG8tZm91ci1kZXMtbW9pbmVzLWZhbWlsaWVzLzY5NzEyNjQwMDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four families to live in half-block of homes built by Greater Des Moines Habitat for Humanity,"Elsabeth Gadriele 34 is looking forward to setting up a Christmas tree and holiday flowers in her family's new home in Des Moines.

Gadriele a 2011 refugee from Eritrea has never owned a home but this Tuesday Gadriele will close on one of four new homes built by volunteers with the Greater Des Moines Habitat for Humanity.

""I didn't have enough money to pay for a house and then Habitat was going to help us"" Gadriele said. ""I was so excited when I found out my application was approved in April.""

In a Saturday morning ceremony GDM Habitat for Humanity dedicated the four single-story homes to each of their new owners. Gadriele will move in with her two children Ayfiri Gadriele 14 and Genet Gadriele 9. The same week three other young families will move into their own Habitat for Humanity houses on the same street.

""During the dedication you could see it already homebuyers being very neighborly seeing they were going to be living near each other"" said Lance Henning the nonprofit organization's executive director ""It's certainly exciting to have these four house all right in a row filling a block.""

The Shaw Street homes on the city's near east side are four of the 26 new homes built by GDM Habitat this year. At the dedication the organization also announced the acceptance of a $240000 donation from Wells Fargo earmarked for building more homes for applicants like Gadriele.

The donation is part of a larger grant partnership between Wells Fargo and Habitat International. This year Wells Fargo has donated $7.75 million to fund the building of 350 affordable houses across the United States. Saturday's gift was the largest donation that a single Habitat for Humanity affiliate has received from Wells Fargo according to Wells Fargo spokesperson Mike Slusark.

""Each one of those families that's living in these homes have young kids"" Slusark said. ""You can just see what the impact that's going to make in that community and how much it's going to change the vibrancy and vitality of that neighborhood to have all these kids running around and everything. It's going to make a huge difference.""

Most applicants for Habitat for Humanity houses come from working-class families without sufficient income to purchase a home through traditional means Henning said. Homebuyers with Habitat for Humanity select and purchase their homes similar to a traditional market but receive a low-interest mortgage. And with the assistance of GDM Habitat no monthly payment will be higher than 30% of the homeowner's income at the time of closing.

Before purchasing a home successful applicants to GDM Habitat's homeownership program must complete homeowner education classes and work from 300 to 400 volunteer hours sometimes spent building or repairing other GDM Habitat homes.

For Gadriele her involvement with GDM Habitat's homeownership program comes down to one emotion: excitement.

""The house is going to be the future for my kids"" she said. ""They're getting their own rooms. They're going to play in the back yard. It's something I'm so happy about.""

We are a leader in paediatric vaccines and also have a strong adult vaccine portfolio in the country. With increased life expectancy and a growing segment of the elderly population healthy aging is a big area of focus. A key intervention for healthy aging continues to be preventive health led by vaccination strategies. We currently market the flu vaccine-Fluarix for the elderly and pregnant women and Boostrix- a DTP (diphtheria pertussis and tetanus) booster vaccine recommended for pregnant women. We plan to maintain this position by introducing the new vaccine against shingles for adults in India next year ’’ he said.At present GSK markets a range of pediatric vaccines which includes Infanrix Hexa  Havrix Varilrix Menveo Boostrix and Fluarix in the country. Equipped with more adult vaccines the nearly Rs 3400-crore company expects the contribution of vaccines to increase over a three-four year period from the existing 22% of the revenue.Elaborating on prices he said that the company will continue to operate in the private market and intends to pursue a consistent ``India pricing strategy’’.``We anticipate the new shingles vaccine we aim to launch next year to significantly contribute to the company’s growth in addition to our existing brands’’ he added.The shingles vaccine which will be imported is expected to be a premium-priced shot.The shot was approved by India’s drug regulator recently and will be launched for the 50-plus population next year. Clinical studies say that it provides protection for 10 years according to the company.Globally GSK’s vaccines business recorded revenues of £2.5 billion in Q3 (July to September) 2022. Global revenues for the Shingles vaccine were up by over 50% to £760 million in the same period. The largest-selling vaccines for the drug biggie are for shingles influenza and meningitis.,,,,,,,,,

If you don’t specifically need the massive sequential speeds of the latest PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 SSDs PCIe 3.0 SSDs such as the WD Blue SN570 generally offer all the speed you need for much less money. This budget SSD builds upon its predecessor the SN550 with much faster speeds but thankfully has an equally generous price.

The Blue SN570 is already on our best gaming SSD guide as the best cheap SSD. While its price may be cheap though you don’t sacrifice too much by opting for this SSD over many more expensive drives. It’s nearly as quick as the fastest PCIe 3.0 SSDs we’ve tested.

WD Blue SN570 specs

These are the WD Blue SN570 specifications:

Interface 4x PCIe 3.0 Protocol NVMe Form factor M.2 2280 Capacities 250GB 5009GB 1TB (tested) 2TB Formatted capacity 931GB (1TB version) Controller WD in house Max read speed 3500MB/s Max write speed 3000MB/s Endurance rating 600TBW (1TB version) Warranty Five years NAND BiCS 5 112-layer 3D TLC NAND

Since the WD Blue SN570 launched WD has also added a new model with a 2TB capacity which is great to see. The range used to top out at the 1TB model (which we’re testing here) but the new affordable-but-speedy 2TB drive will be very useful for users who need a lot of storage space especially when the drives currently cost just $119.99.

While the SN750’s basic design is similar to that of the WD Blue SN550 being a DRAM-less SSD using an in-house WD controller with triple-level cell (TLC) NAND flash memory the faster speeds are likely due to the use of different flash memory chips. While the SN550 used BiCS 4 96-layer 3D TLC the new SN570 uses BiCS 5 112-layer 3D TLC NAND flash memory.

What this means in plain English is that the SN570 is significantly quicker than the SN550. WD claims that the SN570 now has a peak sequential read and write speed of 3500MB/sec and 3000MB/sec respectively while the older SN550 sits at 2400MB/sec and 1950MB/sec – that’s a big speed jump of 43% on the read speed.

Those are some significant speed boosts given the SN570’s similar pricing to its predecessors and these speeds are similar to those found on the faster PCIe 3.0 SSDs available today.

The absence of DRAM to reduce wear on the flash memory doesn’t seem to have impacted endurance either. We’re not looking at the huge TBW ratings of WD’s Red SSDs but at 600TBW for the 1TB model you’re not losing out compared to the competition. For example the 1TB Samsung 980 has the same rating.

WD Blue SN570 performance

Suspecting we’d get slower write speeds with larger files we threw a 100GB file at the WD Blue SN570 and sure enough after writing 15GB or so the speed plummeted to around 500MB/s. However even dealing with many tens of gigabytes at once is an extremely rare situation for most of us. Meanwhile CrystalDiskMark’s sequential tests saw the SSD hit numbers closer to the specifications with a read speed of 3549MB/s and a write speed of 3195MB/s.

The random 4K performance with a queue depth of 32 and four threads saw read and write speeds of 1890MB/s and 1723MB/sec respectively both of which are faster than the results from the Samsung 980 and WD Blue SN550.

What’s more these speeds are faster than those of the ADATA XPG GAMMIX S50 Lite which uses the ostensibly faster PCIe 4.0 interface – this just goes to show that the interface doesn’t tell the whole story when it comes to SSDs.

We didn’t see the WD Blue SN570’s temperature rise above 53°C in our stress test either and that’s without any added heatsinks so it runs relatively cool compared to many other SSDs.

WD Blue SN570 price

Thanks to its very cheap price the WD Blue SN570 offers fantastic value for money particularly when it comes to large capacities. If you want 2TB of storage space but can’t afford the big bucks for the latest PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 drives then the WD Blue SN570 offers a great compromise.

Most importantly you don’t sacrifice an enormous amount of speed by opting for this cheaper drive. It’s not far off the pace of the very fastest PCIe 3.0 drives and it even gives some PCIe 4.0 SSDs a run for their money. You can save yourself some money by opting for the WD Blue SN570 but you also don’t make any massive sacrifices in the process.

WD Blue SN570 conclusion

With a very reasonable price and performance that matches or betters more expensive SSDs the WD Blue SN570 is a fantastic SSD for the money. It offers some of the fastest speeds the PCIe 3.0 interface has to offer and the only area it comes up short is when you’re writing tens or hundreds of gigabytes at once – a job most of us do rarely.

To top it all off the addition of a 2TB option to the stable means you can now get loads of fast solid state storage for a very cheap price. If you don’t move huge files around on a regular basis this is a great SSD for the money.

Alternatives

Samsung 980

Despite having the same number in its name as the Samsung 980 Pro the vanilla 980 is actually a PCIe 3.0 drive rather than a PCIe 4.0 drive. It’s still pretty fast though and you can sometimes pick it up cheaper than the WD Blue SN570 when it’s on offer. The WD drive is generally slightly quicker in our tests but there’s not a lot in it.

WD Black SN850X

Thanks to some dramatic price cuts since its original launch the WD Black SN850X now offers fantastic value. It’s capable of some very fast file transfer speeds and it also has a nifty game mode that we found genuinely makes games load quicker. It’s more expensive than the Blue SN570 and you arguably won’t see the benefit of its extra speed in a lot of cases but this is a great drive if you can afford it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxtdXNpY25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTEvZ29vZ2xlcy10b3AtdGVuLW1vc3Qtc2VhcmNoZWQtc29uZ3MtZmVhdHVyZXMtanVzdC1vbmUtd2VzdGVybi1hcnRpc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Releases Its Top 10 Most-Searched Songs — Just One Is by a Western Artist,"Google Releases Its Top 10 Most-Searched Songs — Just One Is by a Western Artist

Only one of Google’s top ten most-searched songs this year is from a Western artist; most are from Indonesia and Japan.

As the year comes to an end Google shares the trending searches of 2022 revealing that only one of the top ten most-searched songs of the year came from a Western artist. The list features several Indonesian and Japanese singers a reggaeton-inspired Pakistani track and one from Nigerian singer-songwriter Burna Boy.

Google’s Top Ten Most-Searched Songs of 2022

“Tak Ingin Usai” by Keisya Levronka “Pasoori” by Ali Sethi and Shae Gill “Glimpse of Us” by Joji “Satru 2” by Denny Caknan and Happy Asmara “Mixed Nuts (ミックスナッツ)” by Official Hige Dandism “新 時代” by Ado “As It Was” by Harry Styles “Joko Tingkir” by Farel Prayoga “Habit” by Sekai no Owari “Last Last” by Burna Boy

Although Joji and Burna Boy have seen success in the US on multiple fronts the former is Japanese while the latter is Nigerian. The only Western artist on the list comes in at number seven English singer-songwriter and actor Harry Styles with “As It Was.”

The number one most-searched song worldwide was “Tak Ingin Usai” — meaning “Don’t Want to End” — by Indonesian singer Keisya Levronka. The song is Keisya’s fourth single released under Universal Music Indonesia and the first song by an Indonesian singer under Universal Music Indonesia to chart on Spotify’s Global Top 200.

On June 3 “Tak Ingin Usai” was the top-streamed song on six Indonesian digital music platforms simultaneously: iTunes Spotify Apple Music YouTube Music JOOX and Resso. Other Indonesian songs on Google’s top ten most-searched include “Satru 2” a duet by Denny Caknan with Happy Asmara and “Joko Tingkir” by 12-year-old singer Farel Prayoga.

“Pasoori” meaning “Trouble” the second most-searched song on the list is a Punjabi and Urdu-language track by Pakistani singer Ali Sethi featuring Instagram cover artist Shae Gill. With its reggaeton-inspired beat the track is the first by a Pakistani artist to feature on Spotify’s Global Viral 50 chart. The song was featured in an episode of the Disney+ miniseries Ms. Marvel affording it additional exposure to Western audiences.

Japanese artist Joji released “Glimpse of Us” as the lead single from his third studio album Smithereens. His most successful single to date “Glimpse of Us” has peaked at number one in Australia New Zealand Indonesia Singapore and the Philippines while reaching the top ten in the US Canada Ireland Norway and Vietnam. Although Joji is a Japanese native his music is primarily in English. Still other Japanese artists featured on the list (whose music is mainly in Japanese) include Official Hige Dandism with “Mixed Nuts” and Sekai no Owari’s “Habit.”

Google’s year-end summary of trending searches also included notable passings of celebrities throughout 2022. Musicians featured in the top ten included Aaron Carter Olivia Newton-John and Taylor Hawkins.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpem1vY2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvaGFja2VyLWRpZG50LWV2ZW4tdGFrZS1hLW1pbnV0ZS10by1oYWNrLWdhbGF4eS1zMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hacker Didn't Even Take a Minute to Hack Galaxy S22; Broke All the Records,"Samsung phones come with an in-built hardware-level security which is known as “Knox security” and almost every midrange and flagship smartphone of the brand has that feature. Anyway hackers who were going to take part in the Pwn2Own hacking competition targeted Samsung Galaxy S22 and they were surprisingly able to find many zero-day vulnerabilities. The competition is currently going on in Toronto Canada.

Remember that the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) hosts the yearly Pwn2Own hacking competition to showcase the skills of security researchers and hackers while uncovering zero-day vulnerabilities? Thanks to multiple hackers critical “zero-day” flaws in NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices from HP NETGEAR Synology Sonos TP-Link Canon Lexmark and Western Digital have been identified.

The brand’s flagship smartphone the Galaxy S22 was also used by many hackers who quickly discovered flaws in the device. Two critical flaws in the Galaxy S22 were revealed by the STAR Labs team and the Chim team. It happened on the first day of Pwn2Own Toronto and gave hackers complete access to the smartphone. A team by the name of Pentest Limited was successful in hacking the smartphone once more on the second day.

The Samsung Galaxy S22 was successfully hacked on day three in under 55 seconds. It has occurred four times thus far in the competition. In these ongoing days the device has been substantially affected. A Galaxy S22 zero-day vulnerability may be used in under a minute. Security experts at Pentest Limited claim that they gained access using an attack on “improper input validation.”

It is important to note that in accordance with the competition’s rules the device was using the most recent version of the Android operating system as well as the most recent device update. The security expert received a $25000 reward and five points for their research. The gadget was hacked quickly and on the fourth day it had been entirely hacked in less than a minute. This also demonstrates that regardless of how competent the hackers are the gadget has certain security flaws.

Patients across Herefordshire are now benefitting from the biggest change in pathology technology for a century which has been launched as part of a multi-million pound NHS initiative to modernise digital pathology in the UK.

Pathologists at Hereford County Hospital have transitioned from solely using microscopes and glass slides to having instant access to high resolution digital images of patients’ tissue for more than 20000 specimens reported a year speeding up the process for diagnostic results.

Dr Rashmi Rao Consultant Histopathologist at Wye Valley NHS Trust said: “This is a significant advance in our diagnostic capability to improve patient outcomes. This technology enables quicker reporting on images from anywhere in the region as other NHS Trusts go live on a digital platform”.

Delivered in partnership with medical imaging technology provider Sectra the programme is part of the West Midlands Cancer Alliance initiative across four NHS pathology networks and 17 NHS Trusts which are preparing to go live with this new technology as a phased approach.

Working on the same platform from Sectra the 17 NHS Trusts will be able to report on images from anywhere in the region without the need to package and transport slides across different laboratories.

Professor Neil Anderson NHS Midlands regional pathology clinical lead and chief scientist at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust said: “This is one of the most significant events in the last century around how our pathologists work and how that could lead to cancer pathway improvement. The earlier you can detect cancer there is the potential for better outcomes for patients.

“This technology speeds up the process and reporting through the Pathology Departments but also allows teams to work between hospitals enabling them to report on images from anywhere in the region which will support faster better cancer diagnosis. Working on the same platform from Sectra we will be able to more easily share second opinions without the need to package and transport slides across different laboratories which can cause substantial delay. And our new digital platform will help us to explore AI to rapidly triage patients.”

Phil Williams NHS England’s head of digital transformation for the Midlands said: “The significance and scale of this programme is enormous. Bringing four pathology networks together on one platform allows for mutual support and image sharing throughout a huge geographical area where there are multiple trauma centres millions of patients and increasingly in-demand pathology services. The technology we have deployed is an enabler for sharing reporting capacity across the West Midlands – giving us the tools on which we can accelerate strategic long term service transformation that is already underway to allow NHS services and professionals to work together around the needs of patients.”

Sending mobile money should be simple fast and convenient. One merely needs to access the service provider’s app enter the recipient’s detail and your PIN and it’s done in seconds.

But in parts of western Kenya it now takes patience and lots of inconvenience to remit funds to target recipients. Here it is no longer plausible to send cash into individuals’ mobile wallets without first confirming their debt status because you run the risk of bungling the transactions through docked funds.

Many a time you would have to be given alternative “clean mobile wallets” into which to remit the cash as a strategy to dodge instant deductions by lenders.

The debt-free mobile wallets either belong to third parties or are owned by the same persons who register multiple SIM cards mainly to limit their risk of being blacked out by debt-chasing service providers.

Debt-soiled wallets

Such inconveniences of debt-soiled mobile wallets are now very common. By the end of the first half of this year the number of mobile wallets in Kenya had hit the 70.3 million mark against an adult population of 25 million indicating people have more than two subscriptions amid mobile loan default rate of over 50 percent by households according to official figures by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).

Yet the swapping of mobile money wallets is not just a sign of an ingenious lot desperate to escape financial disruption. It also reflects the depth of turmoil caused by fintech loans that are accessed fast and without strenuous demand for collateral.

Many youth in rural Kenya joining the fray for loans for consumerism. This is reflected in the overall rise in the number of digital loans in the country.

For example digital loans from the regulated Safaricom’s overdraft service known as Fuliza rose 30 percent in the six months to June 2022 partly fuelled by households seeking to cope with high inflation.

Covid aftershocks

The amount of cash disbursed on Fuliza hit Ksh288 billion ($2.3 billion) in the first half period up from Ksh220.38 billion ($1.7 billion) in the same period of 2021. This translates to about Ksh1.5 billion ($13 million) daily borrowing on Fuliza alone by individuals between January and June 2022 in an economy still ravaged by the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The fintech loans have however left a trail of regret in western Kenya with residents giving tales of pain including the sale of personal assets to get creditors off their backs.

Paul Opoda a boda boda rider in Kisumu shares in regrets about taking fintech loans after he was debt-shamed by debt collection agents who informed his relatives about the loan using contact information scraped from his phone.

“In 2021 I was on my way back to Kisumu from Koru Girls High School which is about 100 km from Kisumu. I had made a delivery there but unfortunately damaged a tyre on a bad stretch of the road and I had no money to replace it” he says.

“In desperation I logged into a digital loan app and applied for Ksh2000. The request was promptly addressed and the amount was sent to me but less Ksh400 in service fees” he added.

With low business due to the economic shocks of the Covid pandemic Opoda defaulted on repaying his loan.

Indiscipline and shaming

“Within days of defaulting debt collectors began bombarding me with demands to pay up. Then they called my wife as well as my brother and told them about my unserviced loan. I felt so bad because my privacy had been breached and opted not to repay the loan altogether” Opoda says.

For Dennis Ogana a mechanic in Kisumu’s Kamas area the digital loans have been helpful although lack of financial education and sensitisation is causing nightmares for many borrowers.

“The loans have positive sides as long as you tap them responsibly. I have used the advance for business and I appreciate them. I think the masses need to be sensitised more about credit in order to restore order” he said.

Kevin Mutiso chairman of the Digital Financial Services Association of Kenya blames the chaos partly on financial illiteracy noting that debt-shaming of defaulters is no longer tolerated.

“The shaming has been addressed and some rogue players even kicked out. However the bulk of debt problems experienced by some customers have to do with consumer behaviour because once you are aware of terms and conditions you should make appropriate decisions” he said.

Oversight function

“There is a lot of borrower education required to avoid most of the experiences some of them go through. Digital loans serve the masses but consumer education and behaviour make the difference in terms of experience” he added.

The Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Act 2021 which became effective on December 23 2021 empowered CBK to license regulate and supervise digital credit providers (DCPs) to ensure a fair and non-discriminatory marketplace for access to credit.

Subsequently the CBK Digital Credit Providers Regulations 2022 were issued and operationalised on March 18 2022.

Last month the bank released a directory of licensed digital credit providers. The remaining 200-plus applicants for registration are awaiting review and licencing in order to become fully operational alongside the following:

1. Ceres Tech Limited

2. Getcash Capital Limited

3. Giando Africa Limited (Trading as Flash Credit Africa)

4. Jijenge Credit Limited

5. Kweli Smart Solutions Limited

6. Mwanzo Credit Limited

7. MyWagepay Limited

8. Rewot Ciro Limited

9. Sevi Innovation Limited

Robin Williams was a magnificent actor known for his varied roles in features such as Dead Poets Society Good Will Hunting and Mrs Doubtfire and with that was also one of the kindest souls in Hollywood. Williams has been heralded for his acts of kindness a man who always went beyond his station and put others first whether it be spending real time with his fans or making sure that all of his film crew were taken care of properly.

A fan of Williams Brian Lord once told an anecdote about the legendary actor that explained the finer details of his rider. “Years ago I learned a very cool thing about Robin Williams and I couldn’t watch a movie of his afterwards without thinking of it” Lord wrote online. “I never actually booked Robin Williams for an event but I came close enough that his office sent over his rider.”

Lord continued: “When I got Robin Williams’ rider I was very surprised by what I found. He actually had a requirement that for every single event or film he did the company hiring him also had to hire a certain number of homeless people and put them to work.”

In hindsight knowing what we know about Williams it is unsurprising to learn of his rider request. However it further reiterates that he was far more than an actor; he was a genuine human being. We agree with Lord when he writes “I never watched a Robin Williams movie the same way after that.”

Lord went on to write: “I’m sure that on his own time and with his own money he was working with these people in need but he’d also decided to use his clout as an entertainer to make sure that production companies and event planners also learned the value of giving people a chance to work their way back.”

Williams’ altruistic actions will have changed several people’s lives. Lord added: “I wonder how many production companies continued the practice into their next non-Robin Williams project as well as how many people got a chance at a job and the pride of earning an income even temporarily from his actions.”

He concluded: “He was a great multiplier of his impact. Let’s hope that impact lives on without him. Thanks Robin Williams – not just for laughs but also for a cool example.”

The Clark County School District hired a pest control company last month to trap and remove close to two dozen cats from a Las Vegas high school but officials refuse to say what was to become of the creatures.

“Desert Squad Pest and Wildlife will do 1 month of trapping for feral cats underneath the portable buildings that are at the School” says the company’s estimate for $6000 to trap cats at Desert Pines High School. “The traps will be checked daily and re baited. … Desert Squad Pest and Wildlife can’t guarantee that all cats will be removed because in this process more cats could come.”

Tabitha Linton owner of Desert Squad Pest and Wildlife says her company has a permit from the state to trap and euthanize pests including cats. She says cat trapping is not a routine request but one the company has performed.

State law defines a pest as “any form of animal or vegetable life detrimental to the crops horticulture livestock public health wildlife quality of water and beneficial uses of land in this state.”

“With that if the pest control falls within this criteria (the law) does not restrict trapping and euthanasia” says Ciara Ressel spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture.

The company declined to disclose how it kills cats.

“Is it a pest animal or is it a lost pet? I have no idea how these pest control companies can possibly tell the difference” says Keith Williams founder of Community Cat Coalition Clark County. “If it’s a pest animal they can take it out and shoot it. If it’s a pet they’ve stolen someone’s animal and euthanized it illegally.”

Linton declined to say what was to become of the cats at Desert Pines HS adding the school’s principal Isaac Stein instructed her not to divulge their fate to the media. “I’ve been instructed by Principal Stein that any inquiries have to be redirected back to him.”

Stein and CCSD also refused to say what was to become of the cats.

“The school explored options for cleaning sites contaminated by felines with outside entities specializing in complying with local regulations and the humane capture and care of animals” a statement from CCSD said.

But cat lovers know there’s nothing humane about removing a colony of cats.

“You can’t relocate feral cats. They’ll kill themselves trying to get back where they were.” says Nancie Anastopolous of Community Cat Angels a nonprofit that treats sick and injured felines and finds homes for those suitable for adoption.

In October Gina Greisen of Nevada Voters for Animals got wind of the plan to trap and remove the cats and persuaded Stein to allow rescue organizations to intervene. The pest control company retreated and volunteers from Community Cat Angels (CCA) trapped some two dozen cats who were neutered sterilized and returned to the campus at no cost to CCSD. Medical care for two cats cost CCA more than $1500. At least two of the cats were socialized and ultimately adopted.

“If you have nothing to hide and you’re just doing TNR (trap neuter release) which is totally legal why did everyone clam up?” asks Greisen who worries that owned cats in the neighborhood adjacent to the school could have been lured by the bait trapped and removed by the pest control company.

That’s what happened to a Florida woman whose outdoor cat was trapped and legally killed. The law has since been changed.

“I’d like to know how they are euthanizing these animals and if they are looking for an owner or checking for microchips” says Williams. “When people call the pest control company and get inquisitive they get hung up on. The company refuses to answer any of those questions.”

School board trustee Linda Cavazos says the cat trapping contract was included in the board’s consent agenda in which smaller items are approved in one motion.

“We’re only briefed on the big ticket items” she says adding she “was not aware of any contract like this at all.” Cavazos says she inquired about the contract and was told Superintendent Jesus Jara would review it. She says she has not heard back. Jara did not return calls.

Revolving door

Las Vegas North Las Vegas and Clark County fund the Animal Foundation (TAF) and support its community cat program where found cats – socialized as well as unsocialized – are vaccinated sterilized and released where they came from in order to keep the shelter population from exploding and to avoid a higher rate of euthanasia.

The program is not without its critics who have grown more vociferous since learning of CCSD’s foiled effort to remove a colony and complain cats are caught in a revolving door.

“It sickens me that we have a taxpayer-funded community cat program which releases every cat found on the street where they can then just be picked up by another taxpayer-funded effort and ultimately euthanized” says Anastopolous.

TAF’s CEO Hilarie Grey did not respond to requests for comment.

An unsterilized cat averages three litters of four kittens a year according to experts a rate that can’t be absorbed by shelters and rescues via adoption giving rise to a debate over the most humane means of controlling overpopulation – TNR or catch and kill.

Is catch and kill which is widely practiced in Australia an effective means of population control?

“It can be if they rounded up and killed about 10000 cats a year” says Williams who estimates the valley’s feral cat population at more than 200000. “That’s why we try to TNR 10000 cats a year. That’s what it takes to actually affect the population.”

Some local governments such as Henderson require trapped animals to be turned over to be evaluated for adoption or euthanized. But in most of Southern Nevada so-called community cats – which run the gamut from socialized and abandoned domestic cats to unsocialized ferals are protected by law and allowed to run free.

“You can trap feral cats for the purpose of having them spayed or neutered and returned to the same area” says Clark County spokesman Erik Pappa adding that county code and state law “prohibit the unjustifiable killing of animals.”

The City of Las Vegas home to Desert Pines HS gives animal control officials not exterminators the authority to declare a cat or a colony a public nuisance.

“The city’s preference would be that pest control companies take captured feral cats to an appropriate rescue or shelter” says City of Las Vegas spokesman Jace Radke.

While animal control officers have the right to trap a community cat that is deemed a threat to public health or safety a licensed veterinarian must decide if the cat poses an imminent danger or has bitten a person in which cases it may be euthanized the code says.

Animal control officials who investigated the CCSD trapping contract say the pest control company has agreed to abide by TNR procedures should it resume trapping at the school.

Greisen wants the Department of Agriculture which regulates exterminators to investigate whether pest control companies are illegally disposing of community cats. She’s also hoping a legislator will ask for an opinion on whether cats under state law are a pest.

“The media” pops up on your smartphone and is thrown onto your front porch. It is transmitted on television sets and is featured in glossy magazines. It’s so varied in so many ways but is similar in one respect: Many Americans don’t trust it.

According to a recent Gallup poll trust in mass media has hit a near record low: Only 34 percent of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the media while 38 percent of Americans have none at all.

There is however a stark partisan divide: A robust 70 percent of Democrats trust the media while just 27 percent of independents and a mere 14 percent of Republicans say the same.

This is the conclusion of a two-part series on how Wynn Resorts one of the world’s biggest casino operators pursued a deal to acquire land in Macau’s Cotai Strip from a pair of Chinese businessmen. Steve Wynn has said it was a simple real estate deal: In 2005 when Wynn Resorts wanted to build a second casino in Macau China's fast-growing gambling hub the government told him the land had already been committed to someone — a man named Ho Ho. In order to get access to the land Wynn",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzExL2J1c2luZXNzL3d5bm4tZXllcy1leHBhbnNpb24tZXZlcmV0dC1jYXNpbm8taW5jbHVkaW5nLWdhbWJsaW5nLWJpZy1zaXRlLWFjcm9zcy1icm9hZHdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wynn eyes expansion of Everett casino — including gambling — on big site across Broadway,"Most notably the latest plans also call for gambling in the form of a poker room and sports-book facility. But for that to materialize Wynn needs the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to go along.

Wynn Resorts’ newest vision for the company’s land across Broadway from its Encore Boston Harbor casino in Everett includes two hotels with ballrooms three parking garages a theater restaurants clubs — 1.8 million square feet of development in all.

Wynn has made headway in local permitting with the project’s first phase: Everett’s planning board approved a site plan last week and the city council could vote Monday on a required zoning change to allow gambling to take place there. This first phase includes a 2100-space parking garage a sports bar a poker room a nightclub that can fit nearly 1000 people a roof-deck “day club” a 980-seat theater and a 200-seat comedy club. The block would be connected to the main casino via a pedestrian bridge over Broadway (Route 99). The gaming commission awarded Wynn the state’s first sports betting license last week; Wynn plans to offer sports bets in the casino and eventually if the gaming commission agrees in the new building as well.

Big Night Entertainment Group will run most of the operations in the new building excluding the poker and sports betting. Big Night plans to relocate its Memoire nightclub from the casino to the club space in the new building — in part to make way for the overhead passageway and to take advantage of the larger venue newer technology and outdoor decks.

Big Night partner Ed Kane said he’s been impressed with the creativity that Wynn and Elkus Manfredi Architects have shown in designing the new building.

“Whatever way of Broadway you approach it from you’re not going to miss this building” Kane said. “It’s going to be a statement piece. ... The design is fantastic.”

Wynn general counsel Jacqui Krum told the gaming commission last month that about 800 people will be employed at the block’s various venues. Of those Kane expects about 500 people mostly hourly employees will work for Big Night.

The next phase according to plans filed with state environmental regulators on Nov. 15 includes the two hotels one with nearly 500 rooms and the other with more than 300. Each building will feature ballrooms and some restaurant and retail areas as well as garages with at least 450 spaces. The final block will consist of a two-story building with restaurants and shops.

Everett voters in 2013 approved what would become Encore Boston Harbor casino on the site of an old Monsanto plant along Broadway in Everett. Now Wynn Resorts and city officials are seeking approval from the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to expand gaming into new buildings being planned across the street. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff

Matt Lattanzi Everett’s planning director said he estimates the first phase would generate $3.6 million a year in new property taxes (or payments in lieu of taxes depending on the eventual legal structure). He said the second phase with the hotels would bring another $10.8 million a year in revenue to the city on top of roughly $3 million in lodging taxes.

Wynn had initially insisted that there would be no gambling on that side of Broadway during its early planning for the block.

The company first proposed an 1800-seat events venue there. Rival theater operators were worried about the competition and pointed to a provision in the state’s gaming law that bans event venues with 1000 to 3500 seats from being built on casino properties. Wynn eventually scaled back the size of the theater to 980 seats even though the company at the time had argued the land across the street shouldn’t be considered part of the casino.

Now Wynn finds itself arguing to the commission that the new building should be regulated as part of the casino after all. Representatives for Wynn and for the City of Everett said the possibility of an expansion of gambling is in keeping with the intent of the voters’ approval of the casino in a 2013 referendum.

Commission members started to discuss last month whether the voters’ overwhelming support for a casino at the former Monsanto site where the casino was built should count as an endorsement for gambling across the street. No resolution was reached so the discussion will likely spill into the new year. Wynn needs a positive vote from the commission to host any gambling including the sports book and the poker room across the street.

Theater operators meanwhile are staying vigilant amid this expansion. Bill Blumenreich owner of the Wilbur Theatre in Boston said he remains concerned even though Wynn reduced the theater size to just under the legal threshold.

“They’re blatantly trying to hurt other theaters” Blumenreich said of Wynn. “It’s all about their bottom line.”

Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver said in an email that the company wishes to “provide a diverse variety of entertainment options for our visiting guests which we believe will grow not reduce the demand for local entertainment.”

That sentiment was echoed by Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria. The mayor added that Wynn’s plans conform to his efforts to make that part of the city a hospitality destination and to transition it away from gritty industrial uses that have long characterized the area.

“We always knew they were going to increase their footprint there” DeMaria said of Wynn. “I’m pretty certain that the 86 percent of the residents who voted for the referendum and all those who didn’t vote would love to see them expand and hire more people and pay more taxes and create more aesthetically pleasing parcels. We all need to remember what that area looked like before they came and what they’ve done.”

December 11 2022 Jon Sofen Senior Editor U.S.

More than two years after they first met online a ClubWPT group of friends dubbed the ""Stream Team"" finally gathered together in Las Vegas at the luxurious Wynn for an evening of delicious bar-be-que and poker.

The fun evening for the 50 members of the group occurred two days before the start of the historic WPT World Championship the first ever $15 million guaranteed live poker tournament. On Monday the $10400 buy in event will begin at Wynn and the field is expected to crack 1700 entrants perhaps even hitting 2000 an unthinkable amount for such an expensive tournament.

Friends Gather in Las Vegas

During Day 1c of the WPT Prime Championship at Wynn which had an impressive 5430 entries ($5.2 million prize pool) Stream Team members and a few plus-one's congregated in the Brahms reception room for a tasty meal along with World Poker Tour commentators Vince Van Patten and Tony Dunst Executive Tour Director Matt Savage WPT President and CEO Adam Pliska and the talented presenter Lynn Gilmartin. Even Steve Lipscomb the WPT's founder back in 2002 stopped by.

What is the Stream Team? Back in March 2020 when the pandemic first struck poker rooms across the world were closed. The World Poker Tour along with every other tournament was forced to cancel all events for months. But the WPT crew found a way during that time to keep the game going.

Attendees were treated to free food and drinks.

Gilmartin Savage and Dunst would stream ClubWPT action during the pandemic. It was during these streams when the now appropriately named Stream Team first began chatting. They often congregate in a Discord group to discuss poker life and the WPT.

Over the past couple of years the group has bonded online and formed friendships that will last a lifetime. But until Saturday they'd never met in person.

Check out the WPT Hub on PokerNews here!

The Stream Team comes from all walks of life — mostly in the United States although a few members live in Canada. There are men and women of various ages and they all have different occupations. Some are married and have kids others are single. Some are retired others are early in their careers. But there's one thing they all have in common that will always keep them bonded — a passion for poker.

Most of the 50 members and invited guests traveled on their own dime to Las Vegas just to hangout with their fellow Stream Teamers. A few such as Jason ""Kabby"" Kabakoff who moved to Henderson (Las Vegas area) from Dallas Texas a year ago only had to drive across town.

Also in attendance was the ClubWPT Player of the Year Mark ""Symo4709"" Symons who hails from Grand Rapids Michigan. He spoke with the WPT during the BBQ and said he beat out thousands of players to win the award.

""I started playing poker about two years ago during the pandemic"" Symons said. ""I had a work-from-home job and it was not very interesting and so I tuned in to some of the old episodes and I saw Vince Van Patten and Mike Sexton talking about how different hands are played out and Tony Dunst breaking down the 'Raw Deal.'

For his accomplishment Symons won a free seat into the WPT World Championship which runs Dec. 12-20.

ClubWPT Player of the Year Mark Symons honored by WPT CEO Adam Pliska and WPT presenter Lynn Gilmartin.

Surprise Revealed

For two years Al Kalieta and Lynne Christiensen played in Stream Team private games in separate rooms from the same home in Long Island New York. They're engaged and no one else in the group even knew about it until the couple broke the news this weekend.

""She'd play on the first floor and I'd go upstairs and play"" Kalieta explained.

The couple has an interesting story to tell which they did to PokerNews Saturday night. According to Kalieta the two met on the Match.com dating site 18 years ago. But their relationship only lasted for about two years.

A couple years ago he signed up for the Bumble app and had recognized someone on there — it was his ex Lynne Christiensen.

""I got in touch with her she responded and we've been together ever since"" he said.

The New York couple rekindled their romance and plans to one day tie the knot although they don't have a wedding date set. As for who the better poker player is in the relationship they both had similar answers although Kalieta wisely chose his significant other.

""I've been playing longer but I'm going to tell you that she's the better one"" Kalieta said with a bit of hesitation.

Christiensen on the other hand took no time whatsoever to defiantly answer ""I am."" So that settles it.

Let's Play Some Poker

The Stream Team has played hundreds of online games together for nearly three years now. On Saturday they finally had an opportunity to sit next to each other face-to-face in a live poker room to play some cards and they got to take a shot against World Poker Tour familiar faces such as Gilmartin Dunst and Savage.

Each player bought in for $120 with the first-place winner taking home $1500. The first to exit was Dunst who was sent packing by Christiensen perhaps proving her claim that she's a better poker player than her significant other.

At the end of the night Patrick Grimm was the last player standing beating out Terry St. Peter heads up to take it down. Fun was had by all even those who didn't reach the money.

Jeff Walsh

The WPT Prime Championship was thought to be a prelim. An appetizer if you will to the Main Course that is the $10400 WPT World Championship at Wynn Las Vegas with its record-breaking $15 million guarantee.

But by the time the final numbers were in it became clear that the $1100 buy-in event was not simply a precursor to a larger entree but it was a meal unto itself – and a big one at that. When registration closed and all alternates were seated 5430 entries had created a massive $5267100 prize pool. The eventual winner will turn their $1100 buy-in into a first-place prize of more than $700000.

That’s a number that not only crushed the advertised $2 million guarantee but surprised even the most optimistic of forecasts.

“It’s very humbling to see these kinds of numbers” said Angelica Hael WPT VP Global Tour Management. “You always hope that ‘if you build it they shall come.’ You have dreams that a partnership made in heaven between WPT and Wynn will really resonate within the global (poker) community. But nobody I don’t think anybody – from WPT from the Wynn – nobody expected that final number.”

For those paying attention though the outright success of the WPT Prime Championship was no surprise in and of itself. It was just a little unexpected as to just how successful it’s been. WPT Prime the mid-stakes brand successor to WPTDeepStacks which was sunset earlier this year has been outperforming at international stops for the better part of the year. With events held in Vietnam Australia Cambodia and Madrid the Prime brand aims to bring all the swagger of the WPT Main Tour for a more moderate buy-in price point (right around $1100).

It turns out that’s a sweet spot for many Las Vegas-based grinders and those eager to make a December trip to Sin City. The field this week at the Wynn shattered the WPT Prime record of 1050 entries of WPT Prime Cambodia and easily eclipsed even the biggest WPTDeepStacks event of 2023 runners in Sydney.

“It’s breaking the past 20 years worth of WPT records for a mid-major tour with similar buy-in ($1100)” said Cathy Zhao WPT Senior Director Global Tour Management “Not only breaking records but probably doubling records.”

“I absolutely had no idea [about the field size] and I don’t think the Wynn team did either” Zhao continued “The number [of entries] that we had for Day 1B was what we expected for Day 1C. After Day 1A we had a great feeling that it might go even better than we thought. But in the middle of Day 1B we realized that we might have a space issue.”

By the end of Day 1B it was clear that the event was going to be so big that both WPT and Wynn officials were working overnight to expand the capacity for players. The action was spilling out of the ballroom and into the actual poker room as WPT began pulling people in from all corners of the organization to help register in an attempt to cut down wait times.

Day 1C started with a packed 137 nine-handed tables in play and another 300 alternates at the time of “Shuffle Up and Deal”. Events that were slated to take place at the same time needed to be postponed. Special events were pushed back. Not only did the players create a massive prize pool but the packed house also continued the “electric” energy carried over from the opening events.

“It’s palpable. The ambiance in the room…You walk down the hallway and it’s abuzz. Just joyful people and a lot of positive comments” Hael said. “We’ve created something together with Wynn. Something truly remarkable and I think it’s resonating within the community. It’s taken 20 years -not for lack of trying we’ve been knocking on Wynn’s doors lots of times over the course of the year – but maybe the timing wasn’t right. It took 20 years it had to be our birthday for the partnership to come to fruition. And now we’re having conversations of what on Earth we’re going to do for next year.”

The WPT Prime brand traditionally caters to more recreational players but one look at the chip counts and it’s clear that the pros made a point of showing up and getting a warm-up ahead of the $10K World Championship.

The field was replete with notable names and former WPT champions including Alex Foxen Scotty Nguyen Nick Schulman Dylan Linde and Faraz Jaka just to name a few.

Season VIII WPT World Champion David Williams a player who doesn’t traditionally show up for a $1K was battling on Day 1C.

“I don’t really play a lot of tournaments other than the summer just because it’s for fun” Williams said “But I knew this event was going to be special. It’s the 20th anniversary of the World Poker Tour and the Wynn is known for excellence. I’m not surprised that’s awesome. People are happy it’s a big turnout and everything seems to be running pretty smooth.”

Williams echoed the sentiment regarding the vibe in the room from a player’s perspective. He pointed out that the varying levels of play created a more casual vibe which also enticed him to show up as well. And while he was confident that this event was going to reach its guarantee he didn’t expect what he saw in the Encore Ballroom.

“Obviously I didn’t expect $5 million but I knew the guarantee was going to be blown away. I told anyone I know who likes poker you gotta come out for this. The $10K is going to be great but [this] $1K is going to be really awesome. I imagined there will be a lot of people it will be fun it’s a good field a good set-up and it’s at the Wynn…so I’m not surprised I expected it to be huge.

“But I don’t think anybody expected this number” Williams said."

If approved the cost will translate to the customer's electricity bills starting in September of 2023.

The proposed rate hike was a shock to retired healthcare worker Barbara Drennan.

CBS

""Is there no feeling for limited income people? I mean you can't keep raising and raising and raising"" Drennan said.

The proposal would cost the average residential customer $7.33 more a month (8.2%) and the average small business $10.16 more (7.77%).

""As we bring on more electric vehicles as more customers move to Colorado and the Denver metro area that requires us to make sure that the grid is able to handle that new load"" said Robert Kenney President of Xcel Energy Colorado. He says the money will be used to strengthen the power grid repair and replace infrastructure and create new programs.

""As well as protecting against cyberattacks wildfires extreme weather those sorts of things"" Kenney said.

It's not the first time in the last two years rates have gone up the average residential electric customer saw an 8.61% increase in March of last year a 6.44% increase in April of this year and a 2.9% increase in their natural gas bill just last month.

""It's kind of like Xcel uses us as their piggy bank. They want something they get a rate increase. I don't think that's right"" Drennan said.

CBS

Drennan requires a 24/7 oxygen machine that uses electricity. Despite her efforts to conserve she says her bill has been about $180 in the last two months.

""I feel trapped. There's no alternative you either take this or you freeze to death"" Drennan said. Now she wants to want the public utilities commission to stop approving the rate increases.

""When are they gonna say no to Xcel? Do they not care about us?"" Drennan asked.

Kenney said he knows the rate increases can be hard on customers and Xcel offers payment plans and bill assistance for those who need it. He also said Xcel has been shifting towards renewable energy sources which will save customers money in the long run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2tzdHAuY29tL2tzdHAtbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2Jyb29rbHluLXBhcmstb3Zlci0yMDAwLXhjZWwtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWxvc2UtcG93ZXItYWZ0ZXItaW1wYWlyZWQtZHJpdmVyLWhpdHMtdXRpbGl0eS1wb2xlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brooklyn Park: over 2000 Xcel customers lose power after impaired driver hits utility pole,"Around 2100 customers lost power after an impaired driver crashed a vehicle into a utility pole around 2:30 a.m. Sunday in Brooklyn Park according to Xcel Energy.

Brooklyn Park police say officers responded to a single-vehicle crash on the 4000 block of Brookdale Drive and found a vehicle had struck a power pole.

The damage resulted in a “major power outage in the surrounding neighborhoods” according to police.

After officers called Xcel workers came to the scene “immediately” and restored power to the area within an hour.

He admits now he couldn’t have been more wrong but it took time for the former standout Lake City wrestler and three-time state medalist to come to grips with the sport.

“What I grew up with was just — girls didn’t wrestle” he said. “That’s why I was the way I was until I started learning about it. It’s the old-school mindset and it’s just having to change that thought process.”

Still he had an extra singlet with him when he brought his second-grade daughter Lauren to her younger brother’s wrestling tournament. Never one to back down from any challenge he had a hunch Lauren would want to give it a go but was hoping she would say no.

Yet it wasn’t too long after checking in her brother that Lauren was tugging at her dad’s shirt begging to put her out there.

She was persistent.

When someone said 'why not let her wrestle' Jason found himself walking back to the car to grab that extra singlet.

Despite competing in her socks the little but feisty Lauren held her own among the boys that day in Stewartville.

“I didn’t know what I was doing” Lauren Elsmore said with a laugh. ""But it was fun. I was just trying to throw him around.""

She wanted to keep going but her dad wasn’t exactly sold. But they went to another tournament with tougher competition. Once again Lauren’s father held out hope she would say wrestling wasn’t for her.

“I threw her out against the wolves” he said. “And she held her own.""

The third tournament was even tougher. This time Lauren had shoes but the beating she took was the worst one yet. Once again her dad asked her the question: ""Are you done yet?""

She wasn't. Lauren was hooked.

She loved the challenge it brought she loved the competitive nature of the sport and she loved proving people wrong.

That summer as Lauren went to wrestling camps she and her family discovered the popularity of girls wrestling. Somewhat to Jason’s surprise there were programs and opportunities for Lauren and other girls to enjoy the same sport he once did.

“That’s when it really took off” he said.

By the next winter Lauren was not only competing once again with the boys but she began to win.

“That's when I was like ‘Oh this really is my sport’” she said. “I love it and I've been in it ever since.”

From Texas to Colorado to Oklahoma the sport has now taken Lauren and Jason across the country as they look to continue to give Lauren the best opportunity to compete against as many girls as possible.

""Now it gives us something to do as a father and daughter"" he said.

Jason has been a big booster of the sport too; he played a big role in pushing to get girls wrestling sanctioned by the Minnesota State High School League.

After years of work the MSHSL held its first sanctioned girls wrestling state tournament last spring. That’s when as an eighth-grader Elsmore made history wrestling in the first-ever girls state championship match the 100-pound final. She fell to Simley seventh-grader Charli Raymond by a 10-0 major decision but Elsmore's name was officially etched into the history book in a number of ways.

Not only did Lauren became the first ever girls wrestling state runner-up but her and Jason became the father-daughter combination to each take second at the state wrestling tournament.

""It's pretty cool"" Jason said.

Lauren was also one of the first girls to win a state-meet match when she won via pin in her semifinal.

Still despite etching her name into the history books last year was tough for Lauren.

The MSHSL was and still is learning the best way to immerse girls in wrestling. Last year there simply weren’t many opportunities for girls to wrestle against girls as any girls-only tournament also counted towards an event for the boys team. Oftentimes Lauren found herself as the only girl at these tournaments.

“It's different” Lauren said when asked what it’s like being one of the few females in a male-dominated sport. “Like at the tournaments I'd be the only girl there and people would be talking to their friends like 'I'm gonna beat this girl' but no I’m dominating. So last year I get to these tournaments and boys would forfeit because they didn't want to wrestle me. So now this year I might actually be able to get as many matches as I can get in instead of just winning by forfeit.”

Lauren is confident this year will be different because she continues to see more and more girls out for the sport in southeastern Minnesota. She has a female teammate in the wrestling room in Pine Island this year and overall girls wrestling numbers are up across the area with Byron seeing a plethora of girls out for the sport.

""It's the No. 1 growing sport in the U.S. right now"" Lauren said. ""It's really cool because now I can wrestle more and more girls.""

Her next step is to make it back to the state tournament.

She enters the season ranked No. 2 in the state at 100 pounds by the Guillotine and had a great offseason training at the well-respected Pinnacle Wrestling Club.

But Lauren really opened eyes by winning the U14 97-pound16-wrestler division at the 2022 United States Marine Corps Women’s Nationals in May in Texas.

It's a victory she still finds surprising.

""I didn't think I was going to win it"" Lauren said. ""It's a really tough tournament with people from all over the nation. The first girl I wrestled was from Alaska. I was like 'oh my goodness they traveled a long way.'""

It brings forth a confident Lauren into a high school season she is very much looking forward to.

After that? She has another glass ceiling to break through. Another one that will take some convincing of her father.

“I want to do football but my dad says no” Lauren said. “I was like ‘Remember when you didn’t want me to wrestle?’ I’ll convince him.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXUuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTAvMS1wZXJzb24tZGVhZC0xLWh1cnQtbGEtY3Jvc3NlLWFwYXJ0bWVudC1jb21wbGV4LWZpcmUtb3Zlcm5pZ2h0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 person dead 1 hurt in La Crosse apartment building fire overnight,"LA CROSSE Wis.

ReadyWisconsin provides tips on preventing house fires and what to do in the event of a fire in your residence.

Install smoke alarms

Make an escape plan

Properly store or dispose of flammable items

Be careful when using alternative heating sources

Have the electrical wiring in your residence checked by an electrician

Sleep with your door closed

Install fire extinguishers in your residence and teach family members how to use them

Consider installing an automatic fire sprinkler system in your residence

Ask your local fire department to inspect your residence for fire safety and prevention

Never leave lit candles unattended. Consider using flameless battery-operated candles instead

To escape a fire you should:

Check closed doors for heat before you open them. If you are escaping through a closed door use the back of your hand to feel the top of the door the doorknob and the crack between the door and door frame before you open it. Never use the palm of your hand or fingers to test for heat – burning those areas could impair your ability to escape a fire (i.e. ladders and crawling)

Crawl low under any smoke to your exit – heavy smoke and poisonous gases collect first along the ceiling

Close doors behind you as you escape to delay the spread of the fire

Stay out once you are safely out and do not reenter

Call 9-1-1

If your clothes catch on fire you should stop drop and roll – until the fire is extinguished

Is Jack Harlow Gay?

Not too long ago the Churchill Downs singer was the host of Saturday Night Live and sang on the show. He even got to perform on SNL last year during an episode that Maya Rudolph was in charge of.

Jack started his speech by saying “It’s been a big year for me.” He was wearing tiny glasses and a huge grey suit. A lot of people have been calling me the goat but they don’t mean the “Greatest Of All Time.” They are talking about the goat in Narnia.”

Harlow also talked about his fellow singer Lil Nas X and talked about the dating rumors that started when their song Industry Baby came out. He added “I’ve also heard that people try to pair me up with Lil Nas X as a couple.”

The singer for Nail Tech laughed at the rumors and gave them more fuel at the same time. He laughed about the rumors and then said “But I’ll tell you right now: no.”

Harlow talked about the That’s What I Want singer’s sexuality in an interview with The Guardian. She said “The totally inappropriate reaction to him shows that we still have some work to do.”
