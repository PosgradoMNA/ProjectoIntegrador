The Virtual Launch is set for Thursday April 21 2022 at 11:00 EST.

The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) the CARICOM Secretariat and The University of the West Indies have joined forces to implement the project titled Creative Caribbean - An Ecosystem of “Play” for Growth and Development” in the amount of Euros 3 million.

The three-year project that will be implemented in 15 Caribbean countries aims to develop a robust creative economy in the region by strengthening the enabling environment and providing grant support for industry and training initiatives.

The Creative and Cultural Industries (CCIs) targeted for grant support include music fashion festivals film animation and new media visual and performing arts among other areas of entertainment - a sector that provides millions in revenue and in which thousands of people find full-time and part-time work.

The project is expected to strengthen research and data collection on CCIs to facilitate market access opportunities to support the development of national artists registries Cultural policies and Creative Industry Development Acts to incentivise the sector. It will also provide grants to creative and cultural practitioners to grow more globally competitive businesses and enhance their professional development.

“It is an unquestionable fact that the impact of Covid-19 on the cultural and creative sectors was tremendously significant yet CCIs play a notable role in the economy and recovery from the pandemic. The Creative Caribbean project seeks to shift the paradigm from ""the struggling artist"" to creating an enabling environment where creatives are incentivised to produce and thrive and become a key driver of sustainable development in the region"" explains Saadia Sanchez-Vegas Director and Representative of the UNESCO Cluster Office for the Caribbean.

Artists and Cultural Entrepreneurs from the following countries are eligible to apply for grant support under this landmark project: Antigua and Barbuda Bahamas Barbados Belize Dominica Dominican Republic Grenada Guyana Haiti Jamaica Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Suriname Trinidad and Tobago.

Sparking wild celebrations in Hampden the Scotland international full-back ran to the travelling Parkhead support and celebrated with intense vigour.

But despite the wild celebrations after the deflected strike Greg Taylor is actually a boyhood Rangers fan something which has blighted his Parkhead career to date.

Moving to Celtic Park in a £3m deal in 2019 the left-back’s former allegiances to the blue side of Glasgow has seen him get a harsh ride from some parts of the Parkhead support.

But in a fierce rivalry there is no love lost and Greg Taylor’s years of supporting Rangers mean nothing now that he turns out in green and white.

Greg Taylor Celtic celebrations backfire after Rangers win

That’s exactly why Rangers fans will take great pleasure in these celebrations backfiring spectacularly with the feeling that there’s nothing worse than a Scottish footballing turncoat.

Now a professional footballer for Celtic it’s hard to imagine going from standing in Ibrox Stadium to celebrating wildly against Rangers at Hampden.

Governor Abbott reaffirmed the State of Texas' commitment to ensuring Texans affected by these storms and tornado will have the resources and support they need to recover and rebuild their communities. The Governor also thanked local officials in Bell and Williamson Counties first responders and volunteer emergency personnel for their swift response to help their fellow Texans.

""There is no force of nature more powerful than Texans helping Texans and together we will rebuild communities affected and help them come back stronger than before"" said Governor Abbott. ""Thank you to all first responders and volunteer emergency personnel for stepping up swiftly to assist their fellow Texans in the wake of this tornado. I ask Texans to join Cecilia and me in praying for the victims including local officials and emergency response personnel as they navigate response and recovery efforts in their communities. As we enter a time of celebration for Easter Sunday may we also celebrate the strength and resilience of the Lone Star State.""

During his remarks the Governor noted that 70 homes and 3 church buildings were damaged but no lives had been lost as a result of the storm. Governor Abbott also noted that in true Texas fashion volunteers in the area were the first to offer swift response to communities and commended them for being on scene within thirty minutes to aide Texans. He also thanked electric providers in the area for their quick response to restore power in the area.

Texans can contact 254-534-2217 to volunteer or donate to the Bell and Williamson County storm victims. Homeowners impacted by the storm and tornado can call 254-534-4562 to receive assistance.

Texans impacted by the storm in Bell and Williamson Counties are encouraged to complete the Texas Division of Emergency Management’s (TDEM) Self Reporting Damage Survey. This survey will help the state identify damages across Texas and help emergency management officials gain an understanding of damages that occurred during the recent severe weather. This data is also needed to provide information to FEMA to determine the state's eligibility and highlight the need for federal disaster assistance for individuals. The voluntary survey available in both English and Spanish can be accessed by visiting: damage.tdem.texas.gov. Reporting damage to TDEM is a voluntary activity is not a substitute for reporting damage to an insurance agency and does not guarantee disaster relief assistance.

A weeklong protest by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott against President Biden’s recent immigration policy reached a resolution on Friday but the gridlock it created has resulted in hundreds of millions of lost dollars and delays in shipments of everything from avocados to automobile parts that will have a longer-term impact.

On Friday Abbott reversed course on an order he put in place last week that required lengthier “enhanced safety inspections” of commercial vehicles entering Texas. The efforts he said were to help stop the flow of illegal contraband and human trafficking.

Abbott’s move which Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller criticized as “political theater” ultimately created a logjam of trucks between the US and its largest goods trading partner. Vegetable producers say their produce is spoiling in idling trucks and they are losing hundreds of millions of dollars.

Mexico is a critical supplier of vehicles automotive parts electrical machinery chemicals and agricultural goods. Nearly $9 billion of fresh produce crosses the Texas border from Mexico each year said Dante L. Galeazzi CEO and president of the Texas International Produce Association.

And for the past week that produce has been held hostage with businesses and goods “being used as bargaining chips” Galeazzi said.

What used to be a routine border crossing turned into a 30-hour wait for some trucks. Meanwhile the fruits and vegetables in those trucks spoiled leaving some produce department shelves sparse or empty in advance of the holiday weekend he said.

“It could take a week or longer up to probably three weeks before the supply chain realigns” Galeazzi said.

In recent days Abbott has met with the governors of the four Mexican states that border Texas and reached agreements to cease the increased checks. On Friday after meeting with the governor of Tamaulipas Abbott said the commercial checks would end immediately.

The “financial pain” was a necessary consequence to “get the public to insist that their government leaders” take action to curb illegal immigration Abbott said.

‘One thing after another’

Losses to fruit and vegetable producers are estimated to be more than $240 million said Lance Jungmeyer president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas.

Consumers will also pay a price as producers look to recoup some of their losses and supplies run low.

Americans can expect to spend more on strawberries avocados and asparagus as soon as this weekend with the impacts being felt the heaviest in the Midwest and Northeast Jungmeyer said.

“This is not just a localized issue” said Jerry Pacheco president and chief executive officer of the Border Industrial Association in New Mexico. “It’s going to hit you in St. Louis or up in Seattle. We’re connected to a global supply chain.”

“It’s a bad time to be adding this to consumers’ pockets to pay out their pocketbook” Jungmeyer said.

At El Corral Supermarket a Mexican specialty grocery store and meat market in Stephenville Texas co-owner Santos Avila was warned of shortages by his beer suppliers because of glass that got delayed coming into the US from Mexico.

“It’s just one thing after another” Avila said noting the price increases and product shortages that have occurred over the past two years due to pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions.

At places like Luna’s Mexican Restaurant in St. Francis Wisconsin which have yet to see any price hikes as a result of the delayed shipments from Mexico the mere prospect of any delays or shortages for staples like avocados tomatoes and limes causes worry said owner Jenny Bustillos who runs the restaurant with her daughter Brittanie Sexton.

Luna’s has already seen prices triple because of pandemic-related supply chain challenges and inflation Bustillos said. A case of limes that used to run $30 a case pre-pandemic is now $90 and a case of avocados rose from $40 to $120 said Bustillos.

“Everything [we make] contains some type of fresh vegetables so that is very worrisome for a business like us” said Sexton Luna’s manager. “Everyone who works here we are supporting our families with this. We aren’t some chain [restaurant]. This is our livelihood.”

Adding to supply chain instability

It could ultimately take several weeks for supply chains to recover from the weeklong slowdown at the border said Matthew Hockenberry a Fordham University assistant professor who studies supply chains and logistics.

“It’s also just so hard to predict because there’s so much supply instability right now” he said noting that China’s latest wave of lockdowns and the war in Ukraine are causing even more disruptions. “The amount of supply uncertainty is so high that to add another straw here to the camel’s back is a dangerous proposition.”

The logjam also has the potential to compound existing supply chain issues in the manufacturing industry said Erik Lundh principal economist at The Conference Board.

Following the early stages of the pandemic when lockdowns in China resulted in significant delays in shipments it spurred a renewed interest by US companies in working with suppliers in Mexico he said.

“What are companies going to think about this?” he said. ‘What are they going to think when they see that Mexico which has emerged as a potential alternative to China can suffer these kinds of impacts in this US political sphere.”

Those issues could further compound inflationary woes that are already heightened by the war in Ukraine and the new wave of Covid that has hit China he said.

“Coupled with the difficulty in getting things across the border from Mexico” he said “it layers two different kinds of sources of inflationary pressure on top of one another and makes things even more complicated.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGV4YXMtZ292LWdyZWctYWJib3R0LXRydWNrLWluc3BlY3Rpb24tcG9saWN5LWNyZWF0ZXMtbG9namFtLTIwMjItNNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGV4YXMtZ292LWdyZWctYWJib3R0LXRydWNrLWluc3BlY3Rpb24tcG9saWN5LWNyZWF0ZXMtbG9namFtLTIwMjItND9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Gov.'s truck inspection policy led to $240 million in lost produce,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Camila DeChalus

Last week Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced second inspections of trucks crossing from Mexico.

Abbott reversed course on the policy on Friday but experts said it already caused supply chain issues.

The delays led to fruit and vegetable producers losses of over $240 million CNN reported.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to ramp up inspections of commercial trucks at the border created a logjam of trucks that resulted in hundreds of millions of lost dollars from spoiled produce and shipping delays CNN reported.

Dante L. Galeazzi CEO and president of the Texas International Produce Association told CNN that about $9 billion worth of fresh produce crosses from Mexico into Texas each other and that produce was ""being used as bargaining chips"" last week.

Abbott's office last week announced the policy which was described as an effort to tackle ""cartel-facilitated smuggling.""

Mexican truck drivers protested the decision blocking traffic into one of the busiest entry points into Texas Insider previously reported.

The policy caused delays extending trips that would usually only take a few hours to more than 30.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called the move ""unnecessary.""

""Governor Abbott's unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains delaying manufacturing impacting jobs and raising prices for families in Texas and across the country"" Psaki said in a statement Wednesday.

Abbott on Friday announced that the policy has ended and there would no longer be any secondary inspections of trucks crossing the border.

""As we are speaking this moment all these bridges are opened back up to normal trafficking"" Abbott said during a news conference. ""And so all the goods that used to go from one country to the other at a very rapid pace they are moving at that rapid pace as we speak right now.""

However Galeazzi told CNN the policy already left some store shelves empty over the weekend and it would take ""a week or longer up to probably three weeks before the supply chain realigns.""

Lance Jungmeyer president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas told CNN that fruit and vegetable losses added up to over $240 million and that buyers across the country can expect rising prices as producers try to regain some of those losses.

""It's a bad time to be adding this to consumers' pockets to pay out their pocketbook"" Jungmeyer said.

Quinta Brunson’s already highly acclaimed creation has just been given a 100% rating from Rotten Tomatoes. And if it’s been a while since you’ve been out of school that’s a certified A+. The score also earns the show a spot on the Rotten Tomatoes Best TV Series list.

If you’re unfamiliar Rotten Tomatoes calls itself and its “Tomatometer” scoring system “ the world’s most trusted recommendation resources for quality entertainment.” Since its launch in 1998 the platform has put to work hundreds of film and television critics to review (sometimes harshly) the industry’s best and worst on screen offerings. The 100% rating earned by ‘Abbott Elementary’ has proven over the years to be nearly impossible to receive. In 2021 only 17 shows were given the score out of the nearly 600 that were released. Other recent shows that share the honor roll stage with Brunson’s baby include; ‘The Good Place’ ‘Catastrophe’ and ‘American Crime.’

‘Abbott Elementary’ by some standards is considered to be an “evolution of the mockumentary” style of shooting made popular by shows such as ‘The Office’ and ‘Parks and Recreation.’ The premise of the show involves Ava Coleman the fictitious school’s principal having hired a camera crew to follow around the staff and students in an effort to bring awareness to and ultimately raise funding for the cash strapped institution. The camera play and cringe worthy awkwardness written into the script make for the hilarious shoot-milk-out-your-nose comedic moments that have earned the show such high praise.

After premiering in December of last year the series quickly climbed to the top of its class taking Brunson a long way from her humble beginnings at Buzzfeed and viral moments like “Oh he got moneyyyy.” (You had to be there.) Brunson was literally made for this moment but has also kept busy shooting for the equally hilarious HBO sketch comedy series “A Black Lady Sketch Show.”

The report “All In for Transforming Canadian Healthcare” is based on a survey of more than 1800 Canadians. The survey found one-in-four Canadians still find it difficult to navigate the healthcare system including finding the right medical facility and treatment who to contact for a specific concern and the treatment options available to them.

When it comes to access to healthcare providers (e.g. a family doctor emergency department or specialists) the survey found Canadians are generally satisfied but satisfaction levels decrease for people living in remote areas and people with a chronic condition. Canadians that are unsatisfied are most concerned with access to health and wellness coaching such as mental health support diet and nutrition programs and navigation to timely information on publicly funded health services and insurance coverage.

“The pandemic has created an opportunity to reimagine and improve upon how we deliver healthcare in Canada” said Jimmy Yang managing director at Accenture who leads its health industry practice in Canada. “But this requires a mindset of putting the person rather than the system at the centre a dedication to innovating on all fronts and better use of existing healthcare resources such as pharmacies and allied health to deliver certain types of care. Canadians deserve better access to care and digital tools and technology can better enable this.”

Necessity is the mother of invention

The report notes that the need for greater safety precautions during the pandemic led to new ways of delivering care as well as opportunities for public and private players to play a direct role in the provision and improvement of care such as through virtual appointments and additional digitally enabled services.

In fact the research found 80 per cent of Canadians identified online booking and scheduling health services in local pharmacies and telehealth services as the top services that they want to see remain after the pandemic.

The pandemic also highlighted important gaps in the current model of Canadian healthcare including a shortage of digital tools and a reliance on dated processes and systems that aren’t efficient or easy to use. These factors coupled with Canada’s aging and complex patient population put immense pressure on the healthcare system to meet rapidly changing demands more efficiently while thinking about system capacity with a new lens the report found.

“Canada has the expertise and financial resources to deliver world-class public healthcare that improves access experience and outcomes for all communities” said Yang. “The only way to do this sustainably is for healthcare leaders government and industry to work together and put the individual at the centre of everything to transform how Canadians experience healthcare.”

According to the report 72 per cent of Canadians are comfortable with the private sector playing an increased role in the healthcare system especially if the result is to improve the services available to them. At the same time nearly two-thirds (63 per cent) of Canadians said they would not pay for healthcare beyond what the government provides. The report notes that partnerships between the public and private sectors could improve options for better access to care that is closer to home.

Opportunities to improve the healthcare system

The research identified four key improvement areas to create a better more personalized and efficient care experience for Canadians:

Focus on personalization: Three-quarters (75 per cent) of Canadians said they would allow their healthcare provider to share their personal health information especially if it results in better care for them such as targeted advice on medication and treatment based on their personal genetics.

Improve in-person and virtual access to care: Health services that are closer to home can enhance access to care such as through pharmacies. In fact about two-thirds (66 per cent) of Canadians say they are comfortable receiving care such as administration of injectable drugs and vaccinations from a pharmacy. Additionally virtual care which has increased dramatically during the pandemic can help overcome access hurdles by bringing clinical services to the palm of a patient’s hand. The research found 78 per cent of respondents who used virtual care or telehealth felt comfortable or neutral about their experience and if given the choice 44 per cent of respondents might choose a virtual visit over in-person in the future.

Increase patient-provider engagement: More than half (54 per cent) of Canadians tend to engage with their provider only when they need care and conversely 58 per cent of providers mostly engage with patients if the patient initiates contact. There is a need for a more proactive and preventative approach and only 15 per cent of patients said their provider offers such an approach.

Refine investment in digital health tools: Canadians are comfortable with digital tools when they are used for administrative tasks like appointment scheduling and reminders but far less comfortable when such tools including artificial intelligence (AI) are used for diagnosis or treatment.

This On Photography article is personal as I too have gradually confused photography with life.

Meeting Jerry Uelsmann

I met Jerry Uelsmann in the early 1970s. Boise State’s photography department chair Howard Huff had invited him to exhibit his work at the student union. I was a sophomore then. I went to the show and it was life-changing for me.

When I saw them in line for lunch I took my tray to their table and joined them. Howard scowled a bit. I could tell he wasn’t really pleased with my interruption. But I was so moved by what I had seen in Jerry’s show that I had to get closer to this artist of the darkroom.

Later that day Jerry came to one of the few photography classes offered by Boise State. I was fortunate enough to be in one where he did a demonstration showing he created his montages in the school’s darkroom using several enlargers.

I was already really interested in photography. His demo solidified my so far life-long love of the craft. He has always been an inspiration to me.

I met up with Jerry several times after that — at a conference of the Society of Photographic Educators in Atlanta. Jerry was a founding member of that organization. I talked with him at a couple of Photo Plus events and at an Adobe cocktail party in New York. Every time he was gracious and welcoming. His loss is personal to me. That’s why I’ve written this expanded article to mark the passing of this singularly gentle innovative inspirational man.

Walking with a camera

“The simple act of having a camera not a cell phone but a camera-camera there’s a kind of a heightened perceptional awareness that occurs. Like I could walk from here to the highway in two minutes but if I had a camera that walk could take me two hours.” –Jerry Uelsmann

Ansel Adams taught pre-visualization. It looking a scene and imaging how the finished print would look in his mind’s eye. He then set up his camera and made the exposure of the negative that would allow him to make the print later in his darkroom.

Post-visualization

Jerry Uelsmann is a master of a process he has named “post-visualization.” He has spent 50 years photographing places objects figures nudes rocks fields skies clouds — the list is frankly seemingly endless. Yet he doesn’t print a single one of them. He layers many images together onto a single print. Jerry Uelsmann does all of his work on film. His mysterious evocative prints are made in his chemical analog darkroom.

He spends hours with his library of contact sheets considering which images will work together then spends hours in the darkroom setting up numerous negatives in his seven enlargers. His prints are made in a magical way using masking techniques that he has invented to blend many negatives into wondrous works in black and white.

Visual self-challenge

“One thing I try to tell students is that the illusion of knowledge is more detrimental to growth than ignorance” he said in an interview from the New York Times Lens blog “because once you think you know something the questioning stops. And it’s that ongoing ability to question your own imagery. You should even question your own thinking. I find it exciting to constantly challenge myself visually.” He goes on to note “If I have an ultimate goal it’s to amaze myself.”

Three images a year

Jerry Uelsmann makes a hundred images a year. Usually only three make the cut. Uelsmann says he works hard at his art. He sets up an idea and then runs tests. It can take days to arrive at a final image. When an image is finished Uelsmann duplicates them by repeating the process of moving the paper from enlarger to enlarger and so on until developing the print and fixing it into a finished archival photograph.

“And once I get a completed image I consider — how many prints should I make? Most of mine have never sold that many. At that point you want the Holy Ghost to whisper in your ear “Just do two of those.”

Analog darkroom or Photoshop

Adobe approached Jerry Uelsmann in the mid-1990s to create an image to be printed as a poster to promote Photoshop. According to Uelsmann’s ex-wife Maggie Taylor Adobe scanned several of his negatives and provided a Photoshop guru to assemble the image. Uelsmann directed the composite and the guru worked in Photoshop on the computer. He liked the result of the collaboration. Uelsmann went into his darkroom and recreated it as a silver gelatin photographic print (opening photo top row first image.)

Uelsmann does everything in the chemical darkroom. He tests over and over again until he makes a trial image that he likes. He compared his work to that of his former wife Maggie Taylor “It can takes days literally to make the print. And the one thing I’m most jealous of — well there’s several things. My [ex] wife Maggie can work at the computer for an hour two hours and just save it” he said “Once I’m set up in the darkroom I have to have a minimum of five hours and preferably seven or eight hours because you’ve got liquids you’ve got wet prints. You can’t just leave ‘em overnight. And you’ve got to carry through this process. And now because I guess I’m in the big leagues I have to do the archival processing which is additional steps — so I need toning. So that just takes time.”

Uelsmann’s process

In his book Uelsmann” Process and Perception he walks the reader through the creation of some of his surreal images. He explains his thinking. In the Lens Blog he said “

I have stacks of contact sheets from different time periods and I start seeing how images might fit together. There’s a kind of cognition. I’ll be working on an image and I’ll remember a photograph I made 20 years earlier or 15 years earlier. I have to find the negative that I think might fit into that context.”

“But it’s a much more intuitive and emotionally based. You could look at my large body of work and develop themes but I don’t sit down and think “I’m going to deal with that theme.” It emerges because I am who I am and these are my life experiences.”

Jerry Uelsmann’s work is like the Belgian painter Renee Magritte.

Grab your basket the kids and get ready to head out to the fields.

Strawberry season is super short for picking starting in mid-May and lasting through June. In South Jersey the best time to pick is the end of May and beginning of June and usually lasts 3-4 weeks but depending on the weather can last as long as 6 weeks.

North Jersey usually follows South Jersey ripening patterns by one or two weeks.

Some tips for strawberry picking

You want to look for red berries strawberries do not continue to ripen after being picked. So if they look good enough to eat at the moment pick them!

Avoid the berries that have white yellow or greenish tips. You also want to make sure the strawberries feel firm and plump.

How to pick strawberries

To pick a strawberry you want to grasp the stem about one inch above the berry. Using your forefinger and thumbnail pull with a slight twisting motion. Let the strawberry roll into your palm and repeat the picking process until you have 3-4 berries in your hand.

Keep your eye out for our upcoming article from Erin Vogt that will include hours of operation admission prices and more.

These are some of the best places to pick your own in New Jersey based on listener suggestions and my suggestions. The list is broken up by North Jersey South Jersey Central Jersey and the Jersey Shore.

Chocolate Easter eggs

Chocolate Easter Eggs are a traditional gift at this time of year (photo: adobe)

Eggs are symbolic of new life and rebirth.

During medieval times the eating of eggs was prohibited during Lent (the six week period leading up to Easter) so on Easter Sunday scoffing an egg was an absolute treat.

This was particularly so for the poorer folk who could scant afford luxuries like meat.

Churches received eggs from parishioners as Good Friday offerings and sometimes the lord of the manor would be presented with an egg from villagers.

There are superstitions relating to eggs too.

If a hen laid an egg on Good Friday and it was kept for a century it was believed the egg would turn into diamonds.

An egg with a double-yolk was thought to be a sign of prosperity in the future.

It was also thought that if an egg which was cooked on Good Friday wasn’t eaten until Easter Sunday it would improve a person’s fertility and also prevent unforeseen death.

Instead of gifting real chicken duck or goose eggs at Easter we now present chocolate eggs with around 80 million being purchased in the UK every year.

On average each child in Britain will receive up to eight Easter eggs.

The first chocolate Easter eggs originated in France and Germany in the 19th century.

In 1873 the first hollow chocolate Easter egg as we now know it was produced by JS Fry & Sons and Cadbury.

Hot cross buns

Hot Cross Buns have deep religious significance at Easter (photo: adobe)

Hot cross buns are much more than sweet and spicy rolls marking the end of Lent.

According to superstitions dating back to medieval times a hot cross bun hung from the kitchen ceiling on

Good Friday was supposed to ward off evil spirits bring good luck to the household and guarantee a safe cooking space.

In other words prevent kitchen fires and ensure perfectly baked loaves of bread.

The bun is believed to stay fresh and mould-free until replaced the following year.

Hot cross buns were even rumoured to protect boats from being shipwrecked!

They are believed to have come from 14th century Anglican Monk Thomas Rocliffe who baked them to hand out to the poor and needy on Good Friday.

They gained in popularity and were enjoyed the whole year around until Queen Elizabeth I passed a law decreeing that the spiced buns could only be eaten on Good Friday Christmas or at funerals.

The spices in the bread dough are said to represent the spices used to embalm Jesus before he was buried (and rose just like the buns themselves).

The shape of the cross of course also represents Catholic imagery of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.Good Friday fish dish

Fish

Fish is traditionally eaten on Good Friday (photo: adobe)

Fish is traditionally eaten on Good Friday as a result of the doctrine set out by the Vatican.

The medieval church decreed that meat – specifically the meat of warm-blooded land animals – shouldn’t be eaten which meant eating fish instead.

Meat was seen as a delicacy in ancient cultures and was generally linked with celebrations and feasts.Christians believe that Christ who was crucified on Good Friday sacrificed his flesh for our sins.

Therefore those who follow the religion have abstained from eating meat on Good Friday for centuries.

Simnel cake

Although usually associated with Easter originally the Simnel cake was eaten on Mothering Sunday.

It provided a tasty treat midway through the fasting of Lent.

Topped with eleven symbolic marzipan balls – which represent the eleven true apostles of Jesus Christ – the

Simnel cake is lighter than the rich boozy fruit cake enjoyed at Christmas.

But it is made with similar ingredients including sultanas raisins and lemon zest.

The Tudors added saffron to their Simnel cakes but this is rarely done nowadays.

The Simnel cake was waning in popularity but due to celebrity chefs including Mary Berry Nigella Lawson and

Prue Leith all demonstrating their recipes on television it is enjoying something of a revival.

Easter bonnets

Popularised in the Irving Berlin song Easter Parade the Easter Bonnet is now the focal point of competitions and parades held at Easter time.

The origins of the tradition of wearing a bright frilly bonnet stretch right back to when people would wear their new “Sunday best” clothes to church at Easter.

The bright flamboyant hats were a joyful expression of new beginnings after the gloom of winter and the fasting of Lent.

Egg painting

The tradition of painting eggs at Easter dates back to the 13th century.

Advertisement Hide Ad

Advertisement Hide Ad

The egg had become a symbol for the resurrection of Jesus Christ so people would paint and decorate eggs to mark the end of the period of fasting at Lent and eat them at Easter as a celebration.

Egg hunts

This custom is believed to have originated in sixteenth century Germany when traditionally the men would hide eggs for the women and children to find. This was a nod to the story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in which the empty tomb was discovered by women.

Quirky customs and traditions

Egg jarping: A game not unlike conkers in which two players tap the pointed ends of their hard-boiled eggs together until the shell of one cracks.

Hop egg: Eggs are laid on the ground and teams take turns to dance among them with the aim being to damage as few as possible.

Morris dancing: A type of English folk dancing which often takes place during Easter parades or village fairs.

The dance troupes were traditionally all-male (although there are now female groups too) dressed in white with bells on their trousers and either a stick or a handkerchief held aloft in their hands.

Egg rolling: Children roll highly decorated hard-boiled eggs down grassy hills to see whose goes farthest.

This tradition is most commonly observed in Scotland the north of England and Northern Ireland.",,,

The artificial intelligence that powers Amazon’s virtual assistant Netflix Spotify and other digital services use enormous computing resources to plow through massive amounts of data.

Israel’s NeuReality is slashing the high hardware costs and energy consumption required for AI processing. It has partnership agreements with IBM AMD and other computing powerhouses and is set to transform the AI landscape.

“Teaming up with NeuReality which brings a disruptive AI-centric approach to the table is the type of industry collaboration we are looking for” says Dr. Mukesh Khare Vice President IBM Cloud. “The partnership with NeuReality is expected to drive a more streamlined and accessible AI infrastructure which can enhance people’s lives.”

NeuReality has developed a new system architecture to connect the multiple chips used in artificial intelligence. It is designed to make AI processing easier and more efficient while making it affordable to existing AI users new industries and companies.

The technology promises to dramatically reduce the cost of computation and networking chips as well as energy consumption – by a factor of 10 in the short run and 50 in the longer term.

The game-changing platform which will be launched in 2023 targets public safety e-commerce healthcare retail and other high-volume uses of AI.

With its next-generation hardware and software the NeuReality’s architecture slashes the total cost of ownership and improves performance by easing the system bottlenecks created by the current architecture.

The company forecasts initial sales of $2.5 million this year based on its prototype and sees revenue growing to $30 million in 2023. The total market for AI chipsets will reach $75 billion by 2025 according to an estimate by Tractica a market intelligence firm.

A $20 million Series A funding round in NeuReality led by Cardumen Capital and Varana Capital is currently underway. Accredited investors can join the round through OurCrowd the Jerusalem-based venture investing platform.

While we may not think about it AI is everywhere performing tasks that once required human intelligence: smart TVs medical technology autonomous vehicles facial recognition energy grids customer service bots. And it will only grow.

Traditionally the array of chips used in an AI application have been connected by a CPU or central processing unit. Any command to a chip has to go through the CPU. NeuReality’s technology replaces the traditional CPU-centric support with an AI-centric platform allowing components to remotely communicate directly with AI accelerators – as well as connecting those AI accelerators with each other.

“It’s like if you have an engine that runs 360 miles per hour and you put it in an old Subaru that was not built to handle such speed and can’t hold a 1000-horsepower engine” says NeuReality CEO Moshe Tanach.

“Why do we need to use a CPU-centric server to connect AI accelerators to the network? With our technology the data moves directly to the AI accelerator and we can do everything in the hardware” Tanach says.

A system board with $4000 worth of AI chips currently needs $12000 worth of computation and networking chips to support them. NeuReality plans to reduce this $12000 price tag to $1400.

The company is collaborating with Xilinx – a unit of California-based AMD that designs and develops dynamic processing technology – to deliver its new platform.

AMD’s AI accelerator can detect thousands of images per second says Yigal Shamaev the senior data center manager for the US company. NeuReality’s platform can scale that up exponentially at a fraction of the current price tag he says.

“Let’s say that instead of 5000 images you need 100000 images per second until now you would put in a lot of hardware you’d need a bigger computer and it would consume more resources” Shamaev says. “But with NeuReality’s technology we were able to implement a new component that takes this function and scales it so the customer’s total cost of ownership is much less than before.”

From the moment the 27-year-old strode onto Coachella’s Main Stage on Friday (15 April) night he set about delivering an imposing high-energy set joined by frequent collaborator Gunna and flanked by a troupe of gyrating twerking backing dancers.

Lil Baby is among the star attractions of Coachella 2022 which returns to California after a two-year Covid-induced hiatus.

Lil Baby drops his massive hit “Drip Too Hard” early in his breathless set as one of his dancers launches T-shirts into the crowd. A raunchy version of player’s anthem “On Me” follows before Lil Baby strips topless for an exuberant “We Paid”.

Bursts of flames from the stage only underscore his own lyrical pyrotechnics.

Sadly for fans hoping for a surprise guest appearance from Drake the pair’s collaboration “Yes Indeed” comes and goes with just the Canadian megastar’s pre-recorded vocals.

He calls “Emotionally Scarred” “one of my favourite songs to perform right now” and watching him hold his Coachella audience in the palm of his hand as he raps about his journey from a hardscrabble upbringing to global fame it isn’t hard to imagine why. The track was one of the highlights of his second album aptly titled My Turn.

He ends the set with a powerful and emotive version of protest song “The Bigger Picture” which was originally released in 2020 – just days after he led protests in Atlanta which erupted in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.

As he raps the screens behind him fill with images of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations which swept the country in response to yet another act of police brutality.

Lil Baby was a key figure in the Atlanta protests and tonight’s performance proves that he’s an artist not just taking his turn in the spotlight but using that opportunity to make a statement that’s impossible to ignore.

The biggest names in music will perform at Coachella over the next two weekends.

The star-studded headliners for this year’s event include Harry Styles Billie Eilish and Swedish House Mafia with The Weeknd stepping in to replace Kanye West who pulled out last minute.

Viewers — this writer included — adore Zaiver Sinnett‘s zinger-flinging Dr. Zander Perez; TVLine even included the character in its salute to 2021’s best scene stealers. But we want more for him than second-banana status as reliable comic relief or the voice of plus-sized people everywhere (as admirably as he filled that role earlier this season).

We or at least I want Zander to get a love interest.

More from TVLine

How refreshing would it be for the long-running ABC drama to play out a romance for Zander whose portrayer describes himself in a Shondaland interview as “Black and gay and femme” and “chunky”? How cool would it be to find out that this individual who isn’t quintessentially adorkable like Levi or stripper-hot like Nico is just as amorous as any of the surgeons who’ve played doctor at Grey Sloan? How exciting would it be for the show to drop on us a swoon-worthy reminder that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover?

Pretty damn I’d say.

And Grey’s Anatomy is one of the only network series bold enough to take a sassypants character like Zander seriously enough to shed light on what dating and sex are like for him. Would he be anxious about intimacy? Or would he be as comfortable in his skin as he is in his scrubs? What kind of guy would interest him — a nerd like the erstwhile “Glasses”? A swimsuit model like Station 19’s Emmett?

I’m curious. How about you? Would you like to see Zander in love (or at least lust) or should he take a number and wait until we’ve seen poor Helm finally go on a date? Hit the comments with your thoughts.

Not to say she wasn't prepared.

""I had three scripts running"" the actress says in EW's latest Around the Table video which she filmed with costars Viola Davis Gillian Anderson Kiefer Sutherland and Dakota Fanning. ""I had my one script that had all of my notes. And then I had my other script that I would constantly revise with the new changes that came along. And then I had another one for something.... I don't remember what it was for.""

""The week?"" suggests Fanning who first starred with Pfeiffer in 2001's I Am Sam and plays Betty Ford's daughter Susan in First Lady.

""It was an outline of the time breakdown and the scene numbers so that I had a quick reference"" continues Pfieffer who had to jump around to different moments in Betty Ford's life while filming. ""And I laminated it and it was sort of this accordion. It was very colorful.... It was folded out and everything.""

""Just a little bit OCD"" jokes Anderson who stars as Eleanor Roosevelt on the series.

This isn't the first time Pfeiffer has played a character based on a real person — having starred as teacher LouAnne Johnson in Dangerous Minds and Ruth Madoff in Bernie Madoff biopic The Wizard of Lies — but it may be her last.

""I said I would never do it again"" Pfeiffer says having wrapped First Lady. ""It's just it's very very weighty. And it's with you all the time. Every choice you make and you just want to honor the person that you're playing and you want to be as authentic as possible knowing that there will be times where you're not and you can't be. I'm never doing it again.""

Still she's ""proud"" to have honored the first lady's legacy.

""I didn't know half of the contribution that Betty Ford made"" she says. ""Of course like most people I knew of her struggle with alcohol abuse and drug addiction and her founding the Betty Ford clinic but that's really kind of the extent of it. And I mean is if that isn't enough there's so much more to her. I'm really honored that I was given the opportunity to share that story with everyone.""

First it was Norm Macdonald back in September then Bob Saget and Louie Anderson in January and now legendary standup voice-actor and podcaster Gilbert Gottfried.

Gottfried's death at 67 Tuesday was a gut punch to a lot of people whether it was fans and those who grew up watching him in movies celebrities or his fellow comedians. On Tuesday everybody was talking about two things the NYC subway shooter and Gilbert.

For most of my generation my first acquaintance with Gottfried's unique shrill and maniacal voice was in movies like ""Problem Child"" or as Jafar's loudmouth parrot Iago in Disney's ""Aladdin."" Throughout the 1980s-90s the guy had a pretty solid run on TV and film and everyone knew that voice his squinty-eyed face and unstoppable energy.

It wasn't until he began making appearances on Comedy Central Roasts ""The Howard Stern Show"" or in the documentary ""The Aristocrats"" that many of us got our first taste of Gottfried's standup. And it was far from the same guy who voiced so many family-friendly cartoon characters.

Ironically that was arguably the funniest part of it all almost like being blindsided with no time to recover. You just kept laughing harder with each joke rapidly firing at you.

Much like his late colleague Saget Gottfried's standup was the polar opposite of the kid-friendly persona we'd grown accustomed to. It was filthy raunchy and offensive but it will also probably be the hardest you've ever laughed when you see it.

His delivery was a locomotive engine spewing out joke after joke often laced with a kind of brutality where you're almost laughing because you can't believe what you'd just heard.

Gottfried's commitment to the joke above all else no matter the consequences or who gets offended was why he was so respected. Unfortunately it also got him fired from Aflac in 2011 for tweeting jokes about the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

Though that chapter was a big loss for his career he never stopped writing jokes and working the club scene. Being a standup was always his No. 1 no matter what movie or endorsement deals he had or lost.

He was also a loving family man which can be seen in the 2017 documentary ""Gilbert."" The film also shows a different side of the comedy icon most don't see. While he might be boisterous and loud when he's on stage or on TV the real Gottfried was quiet introverted and likes to keep to himself.

But he wasn't afraid to make good conversation especially about topics like old movies Hollywood actors or what'll make the next joke.

Over the last few years Gottfried co-hosted the podcast ""Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Show!"" which I recommend especially to fans of old film old Hollywood and movies in general. The show not only deep dives into Hollywood's Golden Age Universal Monsters and old comedies by Abbott and Costello but is just as funny as it is informative.

It is co-hosted by a comedian who can't resist the opportunity for a joke after all. But part of the charm is Gottfried's seemingly endless databank of movie trivia film facts and anecdotes that only he would know.

While his death means saying goodbye to one of the funniest practitioners of the craft a true icon with one of the most unique and recognizable voices it's fortunate for us he left behind so much material.

With so much content to discover movies to revisit not to mention years of podcast material and guest appearances there's no shortage of ways to celebrate Gottfried's legacy for years to come.

It was always about the joke no matter the cost as long as it was funny.

Gottfried who began doing stand-up comedy when he was 15 was briefly in the cast of Saturday Night Live appeared in major comedy clubs and on Howard Stern’s radio broadcasts and was often featured in raunchy roasts of other comedians.

He played the squawky parrot Iago in the 1992 animated hit film Aladdin and appeared in dozens of other movie and television shows as a character actor or voiceover artist. From 2000 to 2011 he was in several popular television commercials as the voice of the Aflac duck.

But his penchant for jokes that could offend especially after national tragedies such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Japanese tsunami of 2011 led to cancelled contracts and a downturn in his career.

Aflac fired him within an hour of learning of tweets Gottfried had posted about the tsunami which claimed thousands of lives in Japan. Gottfried said he learned of his firing from news reports not from Aflac.

“I don't regret the joke” he said in 2017. “I regret losing the money.”

Like many comedians Gottfried built his act around sex celebrities and his own inadequacies. He combined an older Borscht Belt style of a loud delivery with often-vulgar subject matter.

“Gilbert’s somewhere between Mark Twain and a birthday clown” comedian Dave Attell said in Gilbert a 2017 documentary about Gottfried.

Although he spoke in a resonant baritone offstage much of his humour derived from an exaggerated high-pitched nasal inflection and a sense of the absurd. In one routine he read passages from the erotically charged Fifty Shades of Grey in his trademark screech.

When he appeared on Hollywood Squares a semi-scripted celebrity quiz show he was asked “What mammal has the largest eyes?”

He answered “Marlon Brando at a buffet” speaking of the renowned actor who gained a great deal of weight in his later years. Brando complained to the show’s producers which only prompted Gottfried to make fun of him more often.

When Julia Roberts married stone-faced country singer Lyle Lovett Gottfried added it to his routine but with a personal touch: “I should have asked her out. What’s the worst thing she could have said to me? ‘I’m sorry but you have a normal-shaped head. Could you do me a favour and lie with your head inside the elevator door and let it slam against it throughout the day and then give me a call?’ I loved doing that bit. That was the only celebrity divorce I cried about. The bit made no sense anymore.”

For Gottfried comedy had to risk being offensive it needed to have an edge of danger that would cut through pomposity and polite expectations. For years that quality made him a favourite at celebrity roasts.

A few weeks after the 9/11 attacks Gottfried appeared at one such event poking fun at Hugh Hefner and made a joke about flying on an airliner after the terrorist attacks. Someone in the audience shouted “too soon” and the room went silent.

“You could hear people getting really angry shocked and gasping” he told Vulture.

Gottfried then decided to tell the “aristocrats” joke – one of the oldest and filthiest jokes in the comic repertoire one with so many variations that a 2005 documentary film was made about it featuring Gottfried Bob Saget George Carlin and many other comics.

“I figured ‘Why not go into a lower level of hell? I’ve already lost them beyond belief’” Gottfried said. The audience roared with every twist of the joke.

“That they laughed at and a writer wrote that it was ‘cathartic’.”

‘You want to feel like you’re going to go on a ride and there’s a chance it will kill you’: Gottfried on his comic philosophy ( Getty )

Gilbert Jeremy Gottfried was born 28 February 1955 in Brooklyn where he grew up above a hardware store run by his father and uncle.

He dropped out of high school to pursue comedy and appeared in clubs at the same time as other rising stars including Jerry Seinfeld whom Gottfried sometimes imitated in his act.

He was a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 1980-81 season almost always speaking in his real voice and seldom in his comic persona. Between comedy club performances he acted in dozens of films and TV shows including a role as an unscrupulous lawyer in Beverly Hills Cop II (1987). He reprised his role as the hapless parrot Iago in several Aladdin movies.

“Another person when they were considering me” he later recalled “said ‘I don't know. Gilbert Gottfried seems a little one-dimensional.’ I thought ‘So maybe they should call Meryl Streep to be the parrot.’ You know I don’t have the range to be a cartoon character.”

For years Gottfried appeared on Stern’s radio broadcasts and on late-night talk shows with David Letterman and Jay Leno. In recent years he appeared on shows such as Celebrity Wife Swap and the Sharknado TV movies and remained active on the comedy circuit.

Since 2014 he and writer Frank Santopadre hosted a podcast featuring interviews with actors and other celebrities.

“You don’t want to go on a rollercoaster that advertises that this rollercoaster goes very slowly and doesn't make any sudden turns of drops” Gottfried told Vulture describing his philosophy of comedy. “You want to feel like you're going to go on a ride and there's a chance it will kill you.”

He is survived by his wife Dara and his two children Lily and Max.

These animals are overwhelmingly raised on what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the agriculture industry call Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). We call them factory farms. Each CAFO may hold tens or even hundreds of thousands of animals sealed inside in extremely crowded conditions.

In addition to causing immense animal suffering raising this many animals in these conditions does enormous environmental damage. Globally animal agriculture represents 14.5% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. While much discussion is devoted to methane from cows the massive feed-crop production and manure associated with all CAFOs—cattle pork and poultry—are significant contributors to air and water pollution as well as climate-warming emissions.

In the U.S. animals on CAFOs produce an estimated 885 billion pounds of manure each year none of which is treated or regulated by a government agency.

Nearly 50% of corn and 70% of soy grown in the U.S. is produced to feed animals raised in CAFOs. Those crops consume vast quantities of water and require enormous amounts of fossil fuels and pesticides all of which adds to the environmental footprint of the final product.

Despite its heavy environmental impact industrial animal agriculture is largely exempted from federal and state air and water pollution regulations that apply to other major industries just as it is exempt from almost all state and federal animal-protection laws.

With the evidence mounting about this industry’s cruelty and its connection to climate change the ASPCA is working alongside environmental advocates to replace factory farming with higher-welfare pasture-based animal farming and more plant-based alternatives. Learn more:

The Water Air and Climate Impacts of Factory Farming

Factory Farms Pollute Our Water In traditional farming animals distribute their waste as they move which can be beneficial to the land. With industrial operations tens of thousands of animals are housed in sheds or pens which in addition to causing frustration stress and painful ailments for animals leads to massive build-ups of manure. It's estimated that every minute nearly 2 million pounds of excrement are produced by animals raised on CAFOs in the U.S. Unlike human waste manure from CAFOs is not treated and typically gets flushed into underground pits or lagoons that are several acres wide. It is stored there until it is applied as fertilizer on fields. But the quantity of waste produced on factory farms cannot easily be absorbed resulting in over-application and runoff of the manure—and all of the chemicals toxins and bacteria it contains—into local waterways. It is also common for the pits or lagoons to leak break or overflow contaminating groundwater. Animal agriculture is the leading polluter of U.S. rivers and streams the second-largest source of wetlands contamination and the third-largest source of lake pollution. As a result CAFOs have severe impacts on aquatic health as excessive nutrient concentrations from manure such as nitrogen or phosphorus can make water uninhabitable or cause harmful algal blooms. Rural communities rely heavily on groundwater wells for drinking water and the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2000 National Water Quality Inventory found that 29 states specifically identified CAFOs as contributing to drinking water quality impairment. Cleanup expenses from CAFOs have cost municipal water systems over $1.1 billion over the past 10 years.

Factory Farms Are Water Hogs While pollution is a more visible problem the immense water demand from CAFOs has alarming environmental and community impacts as well. Globally agriculture uses more freshwater than any other human activity and about one-third of that water is for livestock production. Private residential water use makes up 5% of total consumption in the U.S. In contrast animal agriculture makes up 55% of total water consumption. In the time it takes to brush your teeth U.S. animal agriculture uses more than 209 million gallons of water. Drinking water for farm animals accounted for water withdrawals of 2 billion gallons per day mostly from fresh groundwater sources and are the equivalent to the amount of water consumed by 20000 households over the course of an entire year. While animals do drink a lot of water in the U.S. up to 98% of the water involved in livestock production was used to grow animal feed.

Factory Farms Contaminate Our Air Raising animals in crowded conditions indoors surrounded by their own waste affects air quality inside the facilities leading to high concentrations of ammonia hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide and particulate matter (small particles that can be inhaled). This in turn impacts animals’ welfare causing issues like respiratory diseases in cattle raised in feedlots and ammonia-induced eye and skin problems in chickens. Airborne contaminants from manure and dust also pollute the air in surrounding communities pushed out of the facilities by ventilation systems in CAFO buildings and vaporized after manure is applied to land as fertilizer. A recent study showed that agriculture in the U.S. results in over 12000 air quality-related deaths attributable to animal agriculture each year. Ammonia and particulate matter from factory farms can cause asthma bronchitis and other breathing problems and long-term exposure to these emissions increases the risk of dying of heart disease cancer and stroke. In addition to inhaling toxins communities near CAFOs are plagued by noxious smells from manure lagoons decreasing quality of life and home/property values and causing serious mental health issues including depression and anxiety.

Factory Farming Is Driving Climate Change While the transportation and energy sectors are often called out for their role in climate change it’s less understood that animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5% of all human-made greenhouse gases. Factory farms emit methane and nitrous oxide which are up to 300 times more damaging as greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. The greatest contributor to overall emissions from animal agriculture is the enormous production and processing of feed crops like corn and soybeans which are the exclusive source of food for pigs and poultry species raised indoors on CAFOs and a significant portion of dairy and beef cows’ diet.

Switch from Beef to Chicken? Not So Fast. Some researchers have pointed out that beef production contributes the most to greenhouse gases and encourage consumers to “eat smaller” by consuming more poultry and fish. EPA data shows that beef and dairy production account for almost 80% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions. But while poultry and some pork have lower production-related emissions simply switching from beef to chicken is not a climate-friendly choice and it does more harm to more animals. Alarmingly it takes 134 chickens to get the same amount of meat as one cow so as consumers swap beef for chicken billions more animals suffer on factory farms. Chicken CAFOs contribute heavily to air and water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through feed production fossil fuel use and manure management. One area where the pork poultry and dairy industries’ environmental footprints equal or outweigh that of beef is in manure management which represents a significant portion of livestock’s emissions. Poultry litter has been shown to contaminate surrounding waterways with excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous causing dead zones and introducing pathogens including antibiotic-resistant bacteria. As this waste is applied to fields the impact is felt in waterways. Poultry products also have a significant environmental footprint because of the reliance on pesticide- and herbicide-laden feed crops in a CAFO setting as opposed to beef cattle and dairy cows who sustain themselves on grass for at least part of their lives.

The Environmental Impacts of Plant-based Food

There is no question that industrial production of meat eggs and dairy take a huge toll on animals the environment and communities near these facilities. On top of subjecting animals to suffering and endangering our health these industries require a staggering amount of our finite resources and produce climate-warming gases. Yet Americans are eating record amounts of animal products—an annual average of 138.4 pounds of red meat and poultry per person—the vast majority of which is from CAFOs. This is simply not sustainable. It is also not feasible or even environmentally beneficial to take all of the billions of animals currently housed in CAFOs and move them to pasture.

Meanwhile resource use and greenhouse gas emissions from production of plant-based food is significantly lower than those from animal-based foods. Despite a few areas where plant-based products have a heavier water or land footprint almost all of the leading ingredients in plant-based products consume significantly less land and water and have greatly reduced greenhouse gas emissions: 29% compared to 57% for conventional animal products.

Nearly one in four Americans (23%) said they were trying to eat less meat in 2019 and that number has continued to climb in later surveys.

Reducing animal products can range from cutting out meat for one or more days a week going plant-based for breakfast and lunch or opting for smaller portions of animal products. Increasing plants in one’s diet may mean swapping in some of the new products designed to mimic meat eggs or dairy or it may mean increasing beans legumes mushrooms and other hearty nutrient-dense plant foods.

The Environmental Benefits of Pasture-Based Foods

Raising animals indoors in intensive confinement is extremely harmful to animals and our environment. Plant-based food can dramatically reduce those harms. But given that the majority of people will continue to eat meat eggs or dairy is there a form of animal agriculture that is better for animals and our environment?

Industry groups are focused on technologies and feed additives that marginally reduce greenhouse gas emissions but this approach does not address the underlying cause of the pollution and environmental damage not to mention intense animal suffering. Pasture-raising animals on the other hand addresses that imbalance: there are fewer animals animals are raised outdoors at densities that meet the land’s carrying capacity more manure is spread across the land and in the case of grazing animals there is less reliance on feed crops.

While raising animals on well-managed pastures can improve water quality and reduce water demand improve soil health and even mitigate climate impacts this land- and time-intensive approach to animal agriculture also has some real environmental limits. To achieve the joint animal and environmental benefits of pasture-based farming we must raise significantly fewer animals annually which means reducing consumption of animal products.

Pasture-Based Impacts on Water Use and Quality Because manure on pasture-based farms is generally not stored in lagoons or pits pasture-based systems have greatly reduced risks of water impairment events since they don’t run the risk of manure leaching into groundwater or runoff into local waterways. Farm animals in CAFOs require significant amounts of water both for drinking and as an input for the massive amounts of grain required for feed. When ruminant animals (beef cattle dairy cows sheep goats) are pasture-raised they rely on grasses that are predominantly rain-fed and store moisture in the soil thus reducing water usage in the system. While CAFOs and grain production deplete water reserves pastures that include a diverse mixture of grasses legumes and broadleaf plants including drought-resistant species can often withstand water shortages. Further benefits to water are gained through pasture-based farming’s reduced reliance on feed crops. Corn and soy are water-intensive products which when grown for conventional feed crops tend to pollute waterways. Soy production has been shown to cause waterway eutrophication (when water becomes uninhabitable due to excess nutrients) from fertilizer nutrient runoff and heavy herbicide application. Most of the herbicides contain glyphosate —which may persist in soil plants and water reaching both surface water and groundwater—potentially changing the soil’s properties and growth and even causing human toxicity. Similarly corn grown for animal agriculture is heavily fertilized for maximum output and the excess nitrogen contributes to waterway eutrophication. Alfalfa also commonly relies on herbicides and pesticides.

Pasture-Based Impacts on Soil Health Grazing animals distribute manure in sustainable amounts directly on the land building soil health and recycling nutrients. The U.S. is losing an unsustainable amount of nutrient-rich topsoil each year in large part because of practices used to grow corn and soy for animal feed. Well-managed grazing returns nutrients to the soil—moderate amounts of manure act as natural fertilizers for the soil. Compared with row crops pasture-raising animals reduces soil loss by as much as 93%. Integrating livestock into crop rotations can control weeds increase yields and reduce fertilizer use.

Pasture-Based Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions Manure distributed by animals on pasture emits fewer toxins and greenhouse gases than lagoon or pit manure storage associated with factory farming. One study showed that shifting pigs to pasture-based systems could realize a 29% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions and a 7% reduction in methane emissions when compared to the emissions of an industrial factory farm. For pasture-based systems to have a relatively beneficial impact on greenhouse gas emissions the animals’ movement and the pasture itself needs to be closely managed. A study showed that farm animal management systems such as “adaptive multi-paddock grazing” have the potential to cut livestock emissions by more than half when compared to intensive CAFO systems. Well-managed grazing -- where animals are moved regularly to allow the pasture to rejuvenate and pastures are seeded with high quality forage that accelerates animals’ growth -- can help restore degraded rangeland and increase soil carbon sequestration (the re-capture of carbon) through plant growth and improved soil health. The Food & Agriculture Organization estimated that improved grazing management practices on current grasslands had the combined potential to trap the equivalent of 585 million tons of carbon over 20 years representing about 8% of livestock supply chain emissions. With reduced demand for factory farmed animal products the conversion of land currently used to grow conventional feed crops into well-managed pastureland could further offset the greenhouse gas emissions of animal agriculture. While conversion of land used for feed crops to pasture could have benefits to the environment other types of land conversion to expand pasture-based farming such as converting forest to pasture has the opposite effect and instead leads to an increased carbon footprint.

Take Action: How You Can Protect Animals & The Environment

Researchers farmers and advocates continue to debate the comparative environmental and animal benefits of eating plant-based foods versus more humane pasture-based animal products. The truth is either or any combination of these two approaches can spare farmed animals from the suffering they endure now on factory farms and reduce our individual dietary impact on the environment. What matters most is that we take some action. It’s not all or nothing but for animals and the environment it’s urgent that we each do something.

Two actions you can take today to move our food system away from factory farming and toward more plant- and pasture-based foods:",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition an incorrect day of the week was given for an attack on a New York City subway car. It occurred on Tuesday April 12. The article has been corrected. PITTSBURGH — A shooting early Sunday at a house party in Pittsburgh left two people dead and at least eight injured city officials said the latest in a string of high-profile incidents of gun violence that have unfolded across the country in recent days. Police said they responded just after 12:30 a.m. to a property in Pittsburgh’s East Allegheny neighborhood where about 200 people had been attending a party at a house that had been rented via Airbnb.

More than 90 rounds were fired prompting some partygoers to jump out of windows Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott E. Schubert said at a news conference Sunday afternoon.

“It was a very chaotic scene. You had people who were fleeing — you know just trying to get out of there” Schubert said.

Many of the partygoers were underage and one victim was 14 Schubert said. Police believe there was more than one shooter and do not yet have anyone in custody he added. He asked anyone with information about the shooting to contact law enforcement.

A video from the party verified by The Washington Post showed partygoers packed inside the home when a man began shouting “He got a gun! … We gotta go! We gotta go!”

With little to no light people tried to wedge their way through the standing-room-only crowd. Midway through the video the sound of gunfire can be heard and the shouts turned into screams as panicked partygoers searched for an exit.

On Sunday Schubert said there was an “altercation” at the party and that shortly afterward gunshots were fired both inside and outside the house “potentially back and forth.”

Two boys under age 18 were killed in the shooting police said. Officers and emergency workers took some victims to hospitals while others arrived on their own. Police said at least five people suffered injuries that included broken bones and cuts.

A spokesman for the Allegheny Health Network confirmed Sunday that seven victims had been taken to Allegheny General Hospital with gunshot wounds and other injuries. He did not provide names or details about their conditions.

Two other victims were taken to a University of Pittsburgh Medical Center facility a UPMC representative said.

Police initially said in a statement that there were 11 gunshot victims including the two who died but Schubert said later Sunday that there were 10. Several young people fled the area on foot and in vehicles.

“This is our priority and we’re not going to sleep until we get who did this” Schubert said. “This shouldn’t have happened and we’re sick about it and we’re going to do everything we can to get those responsible for it.”

Two cans of Mike’s Hard Lemonade and one Air Jordan sneaker lying in the street near the house on Suismon Street and Madison Avenue were the only signs of the party in what is typically a quiet working-class neighborhood of mostly brick rowhouses.

The rest of the scene appeared grim: Broken glass littered the sidewalks near the home and three of its windows — two to the side and one in the back — were completely shot out. The front door to the house was open with two imprints on it that suggested it had been kicked in. Bullet holes could still be seen in vehicles nearby.

Early Sunday afternoon a girl who did not want to be identified returned to the neighborhood to retrieve her car a white Toyota hit with bullets on its side and windshield. She said the party had been advertised around the neighborhood via paper posters. She said she did not know who started shooting or why.

“There were like a million people” at the party said a female neighbor who spoke on the condition of anonymity because police had told her not to discuss her surveillance footage with anyone else.

The neighbor said underage people poured into the party all night and that several neighbors called police about loud music around 9 p.m. Saturday.

Asked why the party hadn’t been broken up earlier Schubert said he was not aware of noise complaints to police before the shooting and said he would look into those calls.

Once the shooting started the neighbor said she saw people run out of the house and later saw bloodstains on cars parked nearby. One bullet went through her front window and into her living room; the house next door also had a bullet hole in the window she said.

“Right now I am trying to stay calm” she said.

Officials are processing evidence at eight crime scenes and detectives are interviewing witnesses and reviewing video footage police said.

Another neighbor Mitchell Wilston 30 said before the shooting broke out a line of people had been waiting to go inside the house. “People were all lined up like it was a club” he said.

Wilston said his neighbors had called police around 9 p.m. “Everyone looked like they were 15” he said.

After the shooting he said blood was smeared on his car. Surveillance footage from Wilston’s security camera showed that police were at the party house as early as 11 p.m. Saturday.

Surveillance video captured on April 17 showed police arriving at an Airbnb rental property in Pittsburgh less than two hours before gunfire erupted. (Video: Mitchell Wilston)

Wilston said he believed the house had been used for bachelor and bachelorette parties before Saturday but that the biggest problem neighbors had with the Airbnb before the weekend was simply pizza boxes left on the curb.

Airbnb in a statement said it has a strict ban on parties at its listings and confirmed that the gathering in Pittsburgh was an “unauthorized party thrown without the knowledge or consent of the host.”

The company pointed out that the host had stipulated on the listing page that there were no parties allowed that there was a noise curfew between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. and that any evidence of parties would result in a $500 fee.

“We share the Pittsburgh community’s outrage regarding this tragic gun violence” Airbnb spokesman Ben Breit said. “Our hearts go out to all who were impacted — including loved ones of those who lost their lives injured victims and neighbors.”

Breit said the guest who had made the booking has been issued a lifetime ban from Airbnb and that the company is “considering all legal options to hold this person accountable.”

Calls to people who were listed as the homeowners according to property records were not immediately returned Sunday.

During a news conference Sunday several Pittsburgh city and law enforcement officials including the police chief condemned the spread of illegal guns in Pittsburgh echoing officials from other cities in which other mass shootings have taken place in recent days.

On Tuesday a gunman filled a New York City subway car with smoke then opened fire on the train injuring 10 people and traumatizing scores of other commuters. Authorities have since arrested Frank R. James a 62-year-old man who had a history of posting angry bigoted videos online.

The mass shootings came as President Biden took steps last week to crack down on “ghost guns” and renewed his calls for Congress to pass a ban on assault rifles. Biden also announced the nomination of Steve Dettelbach to head the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives which has been without a Senate-confirmed leader since 2015.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMTcvMi1taW5vcnMtZGVhZC1hZnRlci1tYXNzLXNob290aW5nLWF0LWEtcGl0dHNidXJnaC1haXJibmItcGFydHkuaHRtbNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzA0LzE3LzItbWlub3JzLWRlYWQtYWZ0ZXItbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy1hdC1hLXBpdHRzYnVyZ2gtYWlyYm5iLXBhcnR5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 minors dead after mass shooting at Pittsburgh Airbnb party,"Police said a large party was being held at an Airbnb when shots broke out.

Two minors were killed early Sunday after shots were fired at a large party hosted at an Airbnb rental in Pittsburgh according to the city's police blotter. At least eight others were being treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries.

Police said they were called around 12:30 a.m. to a house party that had as many as 200 people in attendance several of them underage.

""As many as 50 rounds were fired inside prompting some party-goers to jump out the windows sustaining injuries such as broken bones and lacerations. Several more shots were fired outside the home"" the police said in the blotter. Many young people fled the area on foot and in vehicles.

Based on preliminary evidence officials believe there were multiple shooters Police Chief Scott Schubert said at an afternoon press conference.

Schubert said that after an altercation occurred guns were fired inside and outside the residence potentially back and forth.

The department is processing evidence at as many as eight separate crime scenes it said. No arrests have been reported so far and no suspects were immediately identified. The names of the two boys who died were not immediately released. One was as young as 14 Schubert said. An initial police report said nine people were injured by gunfire but Schubert updated the figure.

Airbnb said it has reached out to the city's police department and mayor's office to help in the investigation. The guest who booked the listing has been issued a lifetime ban from the platform and the company is ""considering all legal options"" to hold the person accountable.

""Airbnb strictly bans parties and we condemn the behavior that is alleged to have prompted this criminal gun violence"" Airbnb spokesman Ben Breit said in an emailed statement. He added that it was an unauthorized party thrown without the host's knowledge or consent.

Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms have struggled with so-called party houses where users rent a listing to solely host a party. Airbnb placed a ban on party houses and rolled out several safety features in 2019 after five people were killed at a shooting at one of its bookings.

Due to the way these companies operate however they can't always stop parties from taking place. Guests can sometimes check in to remote properties themselves while the owner is away and can invite as many people over as they want.

Pittsburgh Public Safety

(PITTSBURGH) — Two teenagers were killed and at least eight people were wounded when a barrage of 50 gunshots broke out early Sunday inside a Pittsburgh Airbnb rental house where police said roughly 200 people were having a party. Some escaped the gunfire by jumping out of windows.

The shooting marked the third time in nine days that gunfire erupted during parties being held at Airbnb rentals including one near Sacramento California which left a teen dead and another that rocked a suburban Houston residential neighborhood.

The Pittsburgh shooting unfolded Sunday around 12:30 a.m. when police were notified of multiple ShotSpotter gunfire-detection alerts in the East Allegheny neighborhood on the city’s North Side according to the Pittsburgh Police Department.

Cellphone video taken from inside the packed house and obtained by ABC News captured the screams and panic of party-goers rushing to get out of the residence some tripping and falling down a staircase.

In the footage someone is heard shouting: “He’s got a gun!” and “We got to go!” As apparent gunfire sounded someone yelled: “They’re shooting!” The shouts were followed by screams.

Victims suffering from bullet wounds were found near the home and taken to hospitals by ambulance police said. Other gunshot victims were taken to area hospitals in private cars including two juveniles who were pronounced dead upon arriving at emergency rooms authorities said.

A total of 10 people were shot including the two slain teenagers police said. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office identified the deceased as Mathew Steffy-Ross and Jaiden Brown both 17.

Several other victims suffered broken bones and cuts fleeing the chaotic scene according to police.

Police said a preliminary investigation found that the shooting occurred during a large party being held at the short-term rental property “with as many as 200 people in attendance many of them underage.”

“As many as 50 rounds were fired inside prompting some party-goers to jump out the windows sustaining injuries such as broken bones and lacerations” police said in a statement Sunday. “Several more shots were fired outside the home.”

No arrests have been made and detectives are combing over evidence found at eight different crime scenes in a radius of several blocks around the Airbnb house. Detectives are also reviewing security video in an effort to identify suspects.

During a press conference Sunday Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said the gunfire started after an “altercation” and confirmed that multiple shooters engaged in a gunfight. He said that in addition to the gunshot victims five other people were injured from either jumping out of windows or falling down stairs while taking cover.

“It is our top priority to find out who did this and get them off the street” Schubert told reporters.

He noted that the “vast majority” of people at the party were juveniles.

“This is something that shouldn’t have happened. This goes back to having too many guns — too many illegal guns — on the streets. Too many people who have access to these illegal weapons” he added. “Innocent people were struck… We’re sick about it and we’re gonna do everything we can to get those responsible for it.”

Shell casings collected at the scene indicate multiple weapons were fired including rifles a police commander told ABC affiliate station WTAE in Pittsburgh.

“We share the Pittsburgh community’s outrage regarding this tragic gun violence. Our hearts go out to all who were impacted — including loved ones of those who lost their lives injured victims and neighbors” Airbnb told ABC News in a statement Sunday. “Airbnb strictly bans parties and we condemn the behavior that is alleged to have prompted this criminal gun violence.”

Airbnb said the person who booked the house has been issued a lifetime ban from Airbnb. The company confirmed that an “unauthorized party” was thrown without the knowledge or consent of the house host who specifically stated in the listing page that no parties were allowed and that any evidence of a party would result in a $500 fee.

“We will be considering all legal options to hold this person accountable” Airbnb’s statement said adding that the company is cooperating with the Pittsburgh Police Department’s investigation.

Addressing allegations that many of those attending the party were minors the company said “we can confirm that users must be 18 or above to create an Airbnb account.”

The company also noted that its CEO Brian Chesky has joined a coalition of CEOs nationwide calling for stricter gun control measures to get illegal firearms off the streets.

Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said in a statement Sunday that police were using all available resources to find those responsible for the shooting and added that members of the community had contacted the investigators with information on the episode.

According to Gainey the shooting came as Pittsburgh police and city leaders have been been working on a plan in the past several weeks to address gun violence in the city. He said a special meeting of public safety and key community members is being scheduled to discuss a citywide effort to combat gun violence.

“The time is now for us to move with a sense of urgency to bring justice to the victims and peace to our city” Gainey said. “It is critical that we come together now to help reduce the violence currently happening while we begin to do the long-term work of ending the culture of violence that is enabling the senseless loss of life we are experiencing today. We must say no more and never again.”

Anyone with information about the shooting can call the Pittsburgh Police Department’s Major Crimes unit at 412-323-7161.

The former zookeepers a man and a woman worked at the zoo for five and nearly four years respectively and have both gone on to work at other zoos in major U.S. cities.

In written exit interviews other interviews documents and emails obtained by the Wisconsin State Journal the two former zookeepers and other zoo staff describe witnessing animals die because of zoo management decisions; the zoo’s deputy director using a racial epithet about Asians; and unfair treatment and retaliation for voicing their concerns to management. Among the charges of animal neglect they said a penguin had been “decapitated” by a raccoon.

In their exit interviews both zookeepers pointed to the leadership of Beth Petersen the general curator and Joseph Darcangelo the deputy director as the cause of troubles at the zoo which is owned by Dane County.

“I foresee management being problematic as long as Beth Petersen and Joseph Darcangelo are in their current roles” wrote Taylor Woods one of the zookeepers. “They are more interested in their personal vendettas against certain staff members than they are in increasing animal welfare and developing their staff.”

The other zookeeper Marley Mann likened the work environment at the zoo to “a North Korean dictatorship where truth is bestowed from on high regardless of fact and dissent is not tolerated.”

Mann who has worked at the Dallas Zoo since leaving Dane County in January said in an interview with the State Journal that discipline at the zoo had devolved into a culture of snitching in which staff in the good graces of management get away with mistakes that could get others punished.

Woods who left the zoo in February declined a request for an interview. She now works at the St. Louis Zoo according to her LinkedIn profile.

Petersen Darcangelo and zoo director Ronda Schwetz did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

In a statement on behalf of zoo management Greg Brockmeyer the director of Dane County’s Department of Administration said the county encourages all departing employees to give honest feedback about their employment.

“Obviously there are times when such feedback may include assertions that are either obviously false or turn out to be unfounded after a thorough investigation” Brockmeyer said. “Nevertheless the County remains committed to providing employees a voice to express any concerns or suggestions when they decide to depart.”

Union steps in

In March Erik Anderson a zookeeper and the head of ASFCME Local No. 65 which represents county workers voiced concern about Mann’s and Woods’ resignations and complaints of racism to the Office for Equity and Inclusion’s advisory board.

“We have no more Black zookeepers” Anderson said. “I think that that’s important to address the lack of people who look similar to visitors and especially for children to look up to.”

Anderson has made his own accusations against zoo management of retaliation and harassment over his union activities and reporting racism according to documents. He declined to speak about conditions at the zoo on the record citing the zoo’s media policy which prohibits staff from speaking to reporters without authorization.

The exit interviews and Anderson’s comments have prompted “an ongoing look into the workplace environments across various Dane County Departments jointly conducted by OEI (Office for Equity and Inclusion) & Employee Relations” Dan Lowndes Dane County’s risk manager said in an email.

“It’s not an hour-and-a-half review” Lowndes added noting the review was ongoing and involved dozens of face-to-face interviews with employees. “It’s in depth to really figure out what we can do to improve things.”

In the last five years four complaints have been made to the Office for Equity and Inclusion regarding the zoo according to copies of the complaints obtained through public records requests. County investigators determined all those complaints were unfounded.

Dying penguins

The Vilas Zoo has long been a beloved fixture of Madison. One of the last free zoos in the United States the grounds adjacent to the UW Arboretum house more than 650 animals from bison and flamingos to bears snakes and giraffes.

But Mann and Woods also disclosed a number of actions by zoo management that they said led to the deaths of some animals.

In one instance Petersen the general curator decided to stop trapping raccoons that got onto zoo property and instead put Epsom salts on the ground in an attempt to repel them according to Woods’ exit interview and an interview with Mann and other zoo staff. The salts did not work as hoped and a raccoon found its way into the penguin exhibit and decapitated an elderly African penguin named Alice.

Petersen then opted to trap the raccoons Woods said. But Petersen put the traps on concrete which caused the raccoons to rip the skin off their fingers and hands as they tried to dig out of the traps. The raccoons were then euthanized since they couldn’t be released into the wild.

Zoo managers made other mistakes that led to the loss of five to six African penguins within the last year Woods said. One of the penguins died from a fungus infection and the others died from capture myopathy an often fatal disease for animals in captivity caused by overexertion and handling.

“Instead of sending them to an institution who has a successful penguin colony we are providing them with stuffed animals and mirrors to make them think that they are in a larger colony” Woods wrote. “This is not appropriate ... All of the bird-savvy keepers agree that we should send them out but the managers have decided to keep them because it is easier.”

Other incidents

In other animal welfare complaints Woods alleged:

A capybara named Shrek jumped into a drained pool while it was sedated breaking one of its legs. The animal was found dead the next morning.

A hornbill was introduced into a meerkat exhibit and was later found dead and partially eaten by the meerkats.

A young seal named Lucille had an uncommon intestinal issue and died within a week after Petersen declined to take the animal to the vet.

Two green aracaris a species of toucan drowned after being introduced to an exhibit with an aquarium.

“They’ll often come up with an idea that might sound good at a surface level” Mann said of management citing the decision to introduce hornbills to the meerkat exhibit since some hornbills forage together with some mongooses.

But meerkats can eat small birds Mann added.

“We tried to diplomatically provide this info that ‘Hey this is probably not going to turn out super well because they might kill each other’” he said. “They didn’t want to listen to us.”

Curator responds

Jess Thompson the zoo’s conservation education curator and veterinarian staff at UW confirmed the incidents involving the penguins seal capybara hornbill and aracrais although they said the hornbill died a year after being introduced to the meerkat exhibit and that another hornbill has successfully lived alongside the meerkats since being introduced. They stressed nothing indicated that the meerkat killed the hornbill. Dr. Mary Thurber an expert in zoological medicine who works for the zoo said the sick seal received daily medical care.

Thompson noted that the zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums a “gold standard” given to fewer than 10% of wildlife exhibitors in the country.

Half of all animals in zoos die before reaching their median life expectancy according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums which notes on its website that “it is particularly difficult to place an individual death in the context of what is typical for the species.”

Many animals at the zoo live well beyond their median age Thompson said noting that the mother of Lucille the seal Betty died at 50 as the oldest seal in captivity.

“It’s (animal welfare) a field that’s evolving and we are really fortunate to have experts both at UW that we work with and the AZA” Thompson said. “We’re always looking to evolve and update to the best of our knowledge and we’re proud of the longevity of the animals that are here.”

The zoo has not seen any lapses in its accreditation since first receiving it in 1990 nor any animal welfare complaints save one regarding an elephant 20 years ago that ultimately went to a sanctuary said Rob Vernon a spokesperson for the AZA. Vernon did not respond to questions about whether any animal deaths at the zoo have been reported to the association.

Documented complaints

In their exit interviews both Mann and Woods cited racism and discrimination and the resulting lack of opportunity as reasons for quitting their jobs.

“I have been the victim of many microaggressions and witnessed racism towards my coworkers several times (from the managers)” Woods wrote. “None of those incidents were ever acknowledged by upper management.”

Neither recounted specific incidents in those interviews. However other documents show Mann and other zoo staff complained to county officials about unequal treatment and that Darcangelo the zoo’s deputy director was accused by other zoo staff of referring to a Chinese restaurant in February 2020 as “Ching-a-Ling’s” and said it served “Ching-Chong” food.

Darcangelo made the comment to another zookeeper according to documents.

That zookeeper who declined to be named because of the zoo’s media policy confirmed the incident to the State Journal.

“It’s a toxic waste dump here” the zookeeper said of the workplace environment. “If you speak up against it you’re labeled as a bad person (by management).”

After learning about and investigating Darcangelo’s comments at the time Anderson the head of the union reported it to director Schwetz on June 30 2020 according to emails.

Three days later Schwetz emailed Anderson calling his actions “completely inappropriate.” She noted that Anderson was not management and that his “actions will have negative effects on any attempt to appropriately investigate this matter.” Anderson was also ordered to appear for a pre-disciplinary meeting and hand over any information he had regarding complaints about Darcangelo’s comment. Anderson ultimately was not disciplined.

“I would maintain that I do have a right to ask questions and report it” Anderson said in an interview with the State Journal. “I would assert that that’s my right and duty as an employee group officer.”

In a complaint to the County Board Local 65 said Schwetz was retaliating against Anderson for reporting racism in the workplace adding that that the zoo director reprimanded Anderson for reporting “widely known complaints of her fellow supervisor’s racist discriminatory misconduct.”

In a response to the union’s complaint Amy Utzig the county’s director of human resources urged county supervisors to dismiss the complaint and not investigate because Schwetz had already investigated Darcangelo.

Utzig’s letter does not specify what Schwetz’s own investigation found or whether Darcangelo was disciplined. Utzig declined a request for comment saying the county does not comment on personnel matters.

There was one complaint made directly to zoo management in the last five years but it was resolved internally said Lowndes the county’s risk manager.

There have been no complaints about the zoo made to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development’s Equal Rights Division or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Lowndes said.

Workplace friction

While working at the zoo Mann filed a grievance with the county’s administration and a complaint of racism from zoo management to the Office for Equity and Inclusion.

Mann complained he was being discriminated against because of his race leading to him being disciplined differently from other staff assigned more work and not being allowed to work with big cats his main field of interest.

During both probes Petersen and Darcangelo denied Mann’s complaints to county investigators according to documents. They said Mann had a history of showing up late for work and had nine disciplinary infractions.

But Mann argues he garnered so many infractions because he was made to work more areas of the zoo than other zookeepers which made him prone to mistakes.

One of the infractions stemmed from when Mann and the zookeeper who reported Darcangelo’s alleged racist comment were working in the big cat area and accidentally let a lion get too close to a tiger. The other zookeeper is white.

“They punished me and they did not punish him and their justification for it was all these other infractions that they documented” Mann said in an interview. The other zookeeper “wanted to take his share of the responsibility but they wanted to blame me and give him a pass.”

In an interview with the State Journal the other zookeeper said he was “as much if not more responsible” for the incident.

In performance evaluations zoo management wrote that Mann “does own up to his actions” and that he had a “positive relationship” with other keepers.

Of the four complaints about the zoo made to the Office for Equity and Inclusion which included those by Mann one was made by a female zoo employee in 2018 according to documents obtained through a records request.

The female employee reported that a male co-worker would enter her work area unannounced making her anxious because she often triggered his anger. In a letter responding to the complaint from the Office for Equity and Inclusion that female employee was told to “work these issues out with your supervisor.”

“It is important that all Dane County staff work to get along and hopefully the issues in this case can be resolved within your department” wrote Carrie Braxton the county’s manager of Equal Employment Opportunity.

Past controversy

The complaints and accusations of zoo staff are the latest controversy to hit the zoo’s top brass in recent years.

In 2021 Schwetz the zoo’s director struck a deal with authorities in Seattle to dismiss criminal charges of sexually assaulting a male co-worker during a 2018 business trip in exchange for taking drug and alcohol awareness classes.

Two years prior the Henry Vilas Zoological Society filed a complaint against Schwetz and her eventual accuser for making sexually explicit and demeaning comments to society staff. The accusations came as the zoo and the society were locked in a public battle over the society’s role in operating concessions and guest services at the zoo.

A county investigation determined there was not enough evidence to prove that Schwetz had used a vulgar term to describe the society’s executive director.

Now in Dallas Mann describes his new job and relationship with management as a “night-and-day difference” compared to his experience in Madison.

Despite being on the job a couple of months he’s been moved up to a primary zookeeper position and is finally working in his longtime field of interest: large carnivores like lions cheetahs and spotted dogs.

“The management here trusts its staff and communicates with them ethically” Mann said.

As a primary keeper Mann works in one area during the day a far cry from his days in Madison where he was expected to move between and build knowledge of multiple areas.

“It’s a night-and-day difference” he said.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct or clarify the characterizations of some of the animal injuries. The capybara that jumped into a drained pool broke one of its legs in the fall. The seal that died had an uncommon intestinal problem. And the hornbill died a year after being introduced to the meerkat exhibit while another hornbill has successfully lived alongside the meerkats since being introduced.

Many investors could be diagnosed with a fever. It's not the flu. Instead their condition can be blamed in large part on Alphabet and Amazon.

These two giant companies announced 20-for-1 stock splits earlier this year. And now a lot of investors appear to have a case of stock-split fever. They're anxiously looking for other stocks that could split.

You can cross Berkshire Hathaway off the list. Even though Berkshire's class A shares trade at more than $518000 CEO Warren Buffett is dead set against splitting the stock. Berkshire's class B shares offer investors a more affordable alternative anyway.

But there are other companies with super-high share prices that could consider splits. Here are the three best stock-split candidates on the planet after Alphabet and Amazon.

1. NVR

With the lone exception of Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares no other stock trading on the major U.S. exchanges has a higher share price than NVR (NVR 1.70%). The homebuilder/mortgage bank's share price currently tops $4400.

Unsurprisingly NVR usually ranks near the top of any list of potential candidates for stock splits. The stock's price has consistently been greater than both Alphabet's and Amazon's over the past couple of decades. However NVR has never conducted a stock split in its nearly 30 years of trading as a public company.

The company's incoming CEO Eugene Bredow could be more favorable toward a stock split though. Bredow will take the helm as president and CEO pending shareholders' election of current CEO Paul Saville as executive chairman of the board.

NVR faces interest rate increases that are likely to negatively impact both its homebuilding and mortgage lending businesses. With a more challenging macro environment on the way the company just might view a stock split as a way to boost investors' interest.

2. Seaboard

Seaboard (SEB 1.11%) doesn't trail behind NVR very much with a share price of close to $4150. The share price of the agribusiness and transportation company has topped $1000 throughout most of the 21st century.

But Seaboard and NVR have something else in common in addition to their high share prices. Like NVR Seaboard has never split its stock.

Is there any reason to expect Seaboard's management team to have a change of heart about a stock split? Not really. Robert Steer has served as CEO of the company since July 2020. There's nothing to suggest that Steer has a split on his mind.

Seaboard's executive team is more likely focused on some of the tailwinds impacting the business. Inflation especially higher fuel costs presents a key challenge for the company.

3. Booking Holdings

Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.20%) claims the third-highest share price after NVR and Seaboard (excluding Berkshire's class A shares). The online travel company's shares currently trade at close to $2250.

Unlike NVR and Seaboard Booking does have a stock split in its history. However it was a unique kind known as a reverse stock split. In June 2003 the company (then known as Priceline) conducted a 1-for-6 reverse stock split in a move that boosted its share price.

Booking's share price is much higher than that of Shopify another company that has recently announced a stock split. While Booking appears to be a great candidate for a stock split though don't count on one happening anytime soon.

However the situation for Booking could change down the road. As COVID-19 concerns fade global travel could enjoy an even greater resurgence. That could drive Booking's share price to a high enough level that the company's management puts a stock split on the table.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb2FjaGVsbGEtMjAyMi1keWxhbi1taW5uZXR0ZS1zdG9wcy0wMTIxNDQxOTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coachella 2022: Dylan Minnette stops Wallows performance to get medic for festivalgoer,"Actor/indie frontman Dylan Minnette stopped his band Wallows’ performance mid-song at Coachella to aid a fan in need on Saturday (16 April).

Minnette who gained fame for his lead role in the Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why was performing “Pictures of Girls” with his band when he became aware of a member of the crowd in trouble.

“Real quick let’s stop” Minnette said as his band silenced their instruments. “Do we need a medic out here is there someone who needs help?”

The lead singer went on to direct medical professionals toward the person in need leading to cheers and applause from the crowd.

“I did not notice sooner sorry about that” Minnette apologised before advising festivalgoers to “stay hydrated stay cool as possible this weekend”. Temperatures at Coachella have been in the mid-low 30s this weekend.

Musicians have been on heightened alert about crowd safety since a deadly crowd surge during Travis Scott’s performance at the Astroworld festival in Houston last year left 10 people dead and scores more injured.

Among those who have made sure their fans are ok during concerts since the tragedy is Billie Eilish who will become the youngest Coachella headliner in history on Saturday (16 April).

The 20-year-old stopped in the middle of her performance at State Farm Arena in Atlanta in February this year after she noticed a fan having difficulty breathing. She told the crowd “I wait for people to be OK until I keep going” which some people including Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) took to be a dig at Scott.

""And I laminated it and it was sort of this accordion. It was very colorful.... It was folded out and everything.""

""Just a little bit OCD"" jokes Anderson who stars as Eleanor Roosevelt on the series.

This isn't the first time Pfeiffer has played a character based on a real person — having starred as teacher LouAnne Johnson in Dangerous Minds and Ruth Madoff in Bernie Madoff biopic The Wizard of Lies — but it may be her last.

""I said I would never do it again"" Pfeiffer says having wrapped First Lady. ""It's just it's very very weighty. And it's with you all the time.

Still she's ""proud"" to have honored the first lady's legacy.

""I didn't know half of the contribution that Betty Ford made"" she says. ""Of course like most people I knew of her struggle with alcohol abuse and drug addiction and her founding the Betty Ford clinic but that's really kind of the extent of it. And I mean is if that isn't enough there's so much more to her. I'm really honored that I was given the opportunity to share that story with everyone.""

Quite a few right? But do you know the actual number of purchases you’ve made over the previous 30 days? Probably not off the top of your head but it’s important to keep your eyes on what you’ve ordered.

Those one-click purchases can add up quickly throwing your budget off. And if you regularly shop on Amazon and have multiple packages delivered to your house each week you may not even realize a package or two is missing. Tap or click for the safest ways to disinfect your Amazon deliveries.

The easiest way to do this is to download your Amazon order history which lays out all of your purchase history in a spreadsheet for you to look over. However some users have reported trouble with this feature in the past. That’s why we’re here to share a backup plan for finding your data.

How to keep track of your Amazon order history

It used to be easy to download your Amazon order history report. But the order option disappeared in 2020 according to customers who posted on Reddit and Amazon forums asking for help. One user named Kimberly asked Amazon customer support why she could no longer download her order history report each week.

She says she finally got a response from Amazon but it still didn’t tell her why the order history feature is missing from user accounts. She got this reply: “We apologize for the inconvenience. The Order History Report tool has been deprecated.”

In other words the tool was removed but there wasn’t any apparent reason why that happened. Not from the customer service response anyway.

It’s 21 years since James Youboty moved across the North Atlantic from war-torn Liberia to what he still likes to call the City of Brotherly Love where he prints store nameplates and T-shirts at his crowded Parkside Impressions Sign Shop in Southwest Philadelphia.

“When I came here all these shops were empty” Youboty recalled. “Now as you see there is someone in every one. There are more people and they know me so I don’t have to struggle as much. And now there’s the truck.”

“The truck” is the newest sign of hope in this old-rowhouse and former-factory part of town where immigrant owners from Africa Southeast Asia and the Caribbean have launched businesses and where activity appears to be on the upswing. The truck picks up trash from businesses along the busy retail corridors of Woodland Elmwood and Chester Avenues in Southwest Philly’s Elmwood section on days the city trucks don’t run.

The vehicle was financed by a $48000 grant from M&T Bank which has redoubled its efforts to cultivate clients in the area. A $294000 city grant covers a manager and a dozen workers this year. And the vehicle is owned and run by the African Cultural Alliance of North America (ACANA) which says it has enrolled more than 600 local businesses most of them immigrant-run.

The response from business owners has been almost giddy.

“It’s been a month since they started with the truck. It’s wonderful” said Sayed Ahmad whose family owns the Cousins Fresh Market at 6411 Woodland Ave. “I can feel things turning around. You don’t see the abandoned places like before. You see people fixing up and moving in.”

At the same time formidable challenges remain in an area where incomes and home values are well below the city average. The owners echo complaints about high taxes and intrusive regulations common to their counterparts across the city and say some businesses are already moving to better locations in Delaware County where the commercial levies aren’t so harsh.

“This tax on soda the law on plastic bags the city cigarette tax [a $2-a-pack surcharge] it really hurts the businesses around here” said Ahmad whose family’s four-store chain now includes a location in Chester. “People are moving to Delaware County. If costs keep rising it is going to be hard for us to grow here.”

Elmwood’s factory past

Like many city neighborhoods Elmwood used to attract residents for factory jobs — such as building generators at the giant General Electric plant and refining oil into fuels at the Arco Gulf and Sunoco facilities on the nearby Schuylkill. The refinery complex employed a fraction of its former workforce when it shut after an explosion and fire in 2019.

GE closed the last part of its three-block complex in 2002 and leveled the site. Last year Amazon beat out SEPTA to take over the GE site for a last-mile warehouse. Meanwhile Giant Co. opened a large e-commerce warehouse and fulfillment center in Eastwick. Ongoing redevelopment of the former refineries and other vacant sites could add thousands of jobs city officials said.

The nearby Philadelphia International Airport represents another big source for employment in Elmwood as does the University City medical complex.

The area remains a magnet for immigrants. In Elmwood’s 19142 zip code one in four residents in 2020 was foreign-born compared with 1 in 7 across the city and 1 in 11 for the region census estimates show.

Homes remain a relative bargain here with average prices below $100000 — less than half the city average in 2020 and one-third of the region’s average according to Policymap.com a Philly-based data analytics company.

Median household income was about $35000 less than half the regional average.

Yet for the stores business has been brisk. Just 5% of the Elmwood area’s business addresses are now vacant compared with more than 8% citywide according to Policymap.com and the marketing firm Valassis Corp.

The activity is evident in the shopping districts along Chester Woodland and Elmwood Avenues. Ethnic groceries restaurants hair-and-nail salons electronics stores and worship centers now crowd the busiest blocks. “Immigrant entrepreneurs are driving revitalization” here and in other low- and moderate-income city neighborhoods such as Olney said city spokesman Kevin Lessard. “Immigrants and their families [have] been essential” to the city’s growth in recent years.

But owners say it’s tough to attract investment capital and bank loans and they worry about how to draw more visitors from the airport to the south or from University City and Center City to the north.

Banks and other institutions that stayed have been seeking ways to win immigrants’ business with some success.

Bank deposits which fell by two-thirds in Elmwood and were flat in nearby Eastwick from 1994 to 2010 roughly doubled in both neighborhoods by June 2021 according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data.

One bank that is digging in

M&T Bank like other lenders had closed branches in older city neighborhoods over the last 20 years as consumers and big businesses began banking digitally.

But at its 6301 Woodland Ave. branch and at another on Castor Avenue in the multi-ethnic lower Northeast M&T decided to add staff education and community programs. The goal was to attract immigrant and ethnic entrepreneurs who still use neighborhood branches said David Femi head of M&T’s “multicultural banking and diverse market” strategy.

“We are moving in the direction our customer want us to — and we are seeing a rapid growth of multicultural and diverse communities” Femi said. “There’s so much potential in these areas. It’s only going to grow from here.”

As part of that larger strategy the bank increased its commitment in Southwest Philly after its Woodland Avenue branch was gutted following local protests against George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police on June 1 2020.

“They destroyed it; we were shut down for three weeks” recalled Preston Stackfield the former branch manager.

M&T sustained similar damage at its Rittenhouse Square branch. It was no surprise the bank planned to fix the office in that high-rent area serving $40 million in depositor accounts; but would it also return to Woodland Avenue? By that point after losing more than 80% of its deposits since 1994 that branch had just $4 million in neighborhood accounts still on the books.

“I want the community to know we understand — and that we are coming back” Stackfield told his boss regional manager Brandon Smith.

M&T responded with 30 volunteers to clean up the mess. They also put rose bushes in vacant planters along the avenue. And sent contractors to replace the vandalized equipment.

The bank advertised the existence of government-funded forgivable PPP loans to pay small-business employees idled by the pandemic. And it approved a grant program fueling the expansion of businesses such as Youboty’s shop Desiree Shields’ GLAD Center preschool and Sam Perry’s Southwest Fresh Hairstudio.

Plus the bank funded the truck that ACANA had been trying to finance since 2018.

The vehicle arrived in early March and went right to work in the business district where ACANA installed West African national flags recalling those that line the Parkway in Center City.

Some hopeful signs have emerged: Deposits at the little M&T branch nearly doubled to $8 million though bankers said they couldn’t yet track as strong an increase in loans. Many small businesses struggle to establish credit.

Meanwhile the neighborhood retains its global feel. At Cousins Ahmad said he sees people “from Honduras Guatemala  Mexico Salvador a lot are in construction. The Africans from Mali Nigeria Guinea Liberia Sierra Leone the majority are working in the airport” and more from southeast Asia and the Caribbean.

“I call this a ‘multicultural tsunami’” says M&T’s Femi a Nigeria native. “We see the non-Hispanic white population continuing to decline. Multicultural Americans are responsible for all the population growth in America and in places like Castor Avenue and Woodland Avenue. They are also driving a lot of the economic growth.”.”

“Twenty years ago it was easy for a lot of people to look at places like Woodland Avenue and see a decline that was likely to continue” observed Domenic Vitiello a Philadelphia native and associate professor of city planning at the University of Pennsylvania.

“People thought of this as just another neighborhood that was re-segregating from Irish and Italian and Jewish to Black. But that African and African American community is very diverse. It has made Woodland Avenue a cosmopolitan place.“

Count the “more than 20″ African groceries restaurants advertising cuisine of more than a dozen nations and it’s clear that Woodland Avenue has become “a regional destination” for immigrants beyond the neighborhood Vitiello added.

Elected officials have noticed. Among other grants last winter Harrisburg promised $3 million in redevelopment funds if ACANA can raise a like amount for its new headquarters to showcase its citizenship literacy music public-health and business programs.

“We hope to have a ballroom where we can host visitors coming from Africa — as you know we are the closest part of the city to the airport” said Musa Trawally director of ACANA’s Community and Business Development arm. But even African visitors are routed to tourist areas in Center City instead he said.

Delaware County beckons

Above all Philadelphia can’t take this neighborhood revival for granted. ”Back in 2015 when my cousin Sahmed Okyne opened Kings and Queens Liberian Cuisine right off 69th Street there were maybe two African restaurants in all of Delaware County. Today I can count 20” said Hafiz Tunis who represents that neighborhood on the Upper Darby Township Council.

His immigrant family lived “on Woodland Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia — we still call that Africa Town” before moving to Upper Darby in 2007 when he was 10. “Our slogan out here is ‘The World in One Place’ — Greeks Koreans Bangladeshis Pakistanis African refugees and now more from the Latin countries” Tunis added.

“In Philadelphia to start your business you have to deal with City Hall all the way downtown. Here you just walk across the street to the township building. And people view it as a safer community with less competition and more opportunities. They are moving up to Media too.”

“You know each community has reached critical mass when they move on from restaurants and start selling groceries directly to their families and neighborhoods” said Vincent Rongione whose family moved from Italy to South Philly a century ago and followed the immigrant road to Upper Darby where he is township administrator. “We are very actively trying to cultivate and compete with West Philadelphia for these residents and their businesses.”

LOUIS Mo. — Two days after a cybersecurity expert said Missouri could be “ground zero” for attacks on its power grid federal law enforcement agencies issued an alert that malicious cyber tools created by entities capable of sabotaging the energy sector and other critical industries had been found.

What You Need To Know U.S. government has warned of potential for Russian cyberattacks as retaliation for American support of Ukraine.



Utility industry reaction: ""The threat of cyber and physical attacks targeting critical infrastructure is not new.""



Member of congressional advisory board on cyberattacks testified before Missouri House panel Monday.



Missouri has potential to be targeted due to Whiteman AFB home to B-2 bomber squadron.

The public alert from the Energy and Homeland Security Departments the FBI and National Security Agency did not name the actors or offer details on the find. But their private sector cybersecurity partners said the evidence suggests Russia is behind the industrial control system-disrupting tools — and that they were configured to initially target North American energy concerns.

The U.S. government has warned critical infrastructure industries to guard for possible cyberattacks from Russia as retaliation for severe economic sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

Officials have said that Russian hacker interest in the U.S. energy sector is particularly high and CISA urged it in a statement Wednesday to be especially mindful of the mitigation measures recommended in the alert. Last month the FBI issued an alert saying Russian hackers have scanned at least five unnamed energy companies for vulnerabilities.

Peter Pry executive director of a congressional advisory board that works to protect the U.S. from electromagnetic pulse or EMP cyberattacks and other threats testified Monday before the Missouri House Special Committee on Government Accountability. Pry told lawmakers Missouri has a bullseye on it because it is home to Whiteman Air Force Base home of the B-2 bombers which would deliver a nuclear payload if necessary.

“What we’re talking about are catastrophic blackout scenarios that could basically last not just for days or weeks or months but forever if the grid is not protected” Pry told lawmakers. “Telecommunications wouldn’t work. Your cellphones wouldn’t work. Personal computers wouldn’t work. None of that stuff we require to support our modern electronic civilization that sustains the lives of 330 million people would work anymore in the aftermath of an EMP.”

Ameren shared a statement from the Edison Electric Institute which represents U.S. utilities when asked by Spectrum News about its ability to guard against cyberattacks.

""Given the attack on Ukraine and the capabilities of the countries involved EEI and our member companies are closely monitoring the situation and are coordinating across the industry and with our government partners through the CEO-led Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC) to ensure vigilance and the ability to respond quickly if needed"" EEI Senior Vice President for Security & Preparedness Scott Aaronson said. ""The threat of cyber and physical attacks targeting critical infrastructure is not new which is why we partner with the government through the ESCC to share actionable intelligence and to prepare to respond to incidents that could affect our ability to provide electricity safely and reliably.""

In general Pry said the nation is more vulnerable than it was 20 years ago. “Missouri should take the lead and protect itself” he said.

Once woman took to twitter for instance to announce her $10020 haul from United Airlines:

I also got two $10 meal vouchers. I am going to go INSANE at Pizza Hut — Allison M. Preiss (@allisonmpreiss) March 22 2018

This got expensive. American Airlines gave out $250000 in travel credit on a single flight. Carriers took steps to rein in their costs. By the time 2020 rolled around I declared that the post-David Dao era of generous compensation was ending. Early in the pandemic United cut its denied boarding compensation maximum by 75%.

Now American Airlines and Southwest – which had promised to stop overbooking – account for 70% of all involuntary denied boardings in the U.S. Candace Owens though thinks she knows how they’re keeping those numbers down.

According to the commentator American sees that they’re overbooked on the day of travel delays that flight for a long period so passengers make other plans and then they no longer have to involuntarily deny anyone boarding.

Anybody else noticing American Airlines new habit of delaying and then un-delaying flights same day? Should be investigated. Pretty sure they are overbooking every flight and then faking long delays to force people to change their flights so they absorb no costs. — Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) April 11 2022

Let’s be 100% clear: American Airlines is perfectly capable of long flight delays without resorting to faking them.

Most passengers believe airlines regularly cancel flights that only have a few seats sold. In fact the airline is paying for the plane paying for the crew and usually needs the aircraft in the downline city to operate the next flight. Cancelling costs more than they’d save in fuel.

Still conspiracy theories are tempting and they aren’t always wrong! American unlike United and several other airlines willingly provided refunds for flights they cancelled during the pandemic. Other airlines played games. United even redefined the word cancel so that any flight on a route they still served wasn’t cancelled (if they cut down from 6 flights a day to 1 they hadn’t cancelled any flights). Nonetheless at the time I wondered whether their penchant for last minute cancellations was a way to avoid refunding customers.

Candace Owens though has lots of theories about American Airlines. She believes they want all of your AAdvantage miles to expire. Yet she still buys premium cabin tickets on the airline and once bought first class DC to Dallas leaving me on the upgrade list.

(HT: @crucker)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtcmljaC1jdXN0b21lcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Is American Airlines ""Showing The Door"" To Non-Rich Customers?","There are a lot of very bad airline industry takes on the internet though this has to be one the worst I’ve seen in a long time…

“American Airlines just showed the door to customers who aren’t rich”

ZDNet published a rambling article that tries to draw conclusions about society based on American Airlines’ new Boeing 787-9 configuration. For context it was recently leaked that American’s upcoming Boeing 787-9 deliveries will have a more premium layout.

The planes will feature new business class seats with doors and they’ll have more business class and premium economy seats while they’ll feature fewer economy seats. This configuration will just be available on select aircraft that operate business routes with lots of premium demand (for example think London).

The ZDNet story makes so many bizarre points yet seemingly doesn’t delve into anything for more than a sentence or two (which isn’t surprising because the points simply don’t make sense). We can all agree with this part of the story:

What’s different about American’s latest Dreamliners is that they lean much more heavily toward customers who have well a lot more money. These will have 51 Business Class seats. No wait. 51 Business Class pods. And these pods have doors. Welcome to the gated community at 36000 feet. The latest Dreamliners will also have 32 Premium Economy reclining seats. In total there’ll be 41 fewer seats on these planes as compared to American’s previous 787-9s. It’s easy to fly to conclusions.

The conclusions the author arrives at though are bizarre. Among other things:

American’s new Boeing 787s are compared to how Southwest is now allowing its fares to appear on Kayak but only for those who are part of a company

This reflects the greater inequality in society of haves and have-nots

This is going to cause a problem because economy class passengers have to walk past “Fancy Class passengers who are already on their second glass of champagne” and research suggests that walking past fancy seating is linked to increased unrest among economy passengers

“You’d think that airlines have already had enough unrest from passengers during the pandemic”

Airfare has “recently risen by around 20%” which somehow has something to do with these seats?

This is a “slightly difficult situation” because “it’s not like a restaurant where the food is the same the ambiance is the same but some people order ridiculously priced wine”

Passengers may “see a greater more palpable division of a potentially uncomfortable kind”

“If you’re a regular American Airlines Economy Class customer and you have to walk through the gated community how will you feel when you get to your own seat?”

“One day you might get the chance to fly in the gated community and open a door to your seat it’s what they call the American dream”

American will introduce business class seats with doors

No no no no no

Let me start by saying that I’m the furthest thing from an American Airlines apologist and I’ll agree that inequality is a big problem (and we’ll leave it at that because I want to focus on the ridiculousness of this story rather than get political). That being said none of the author’s conclusions otherwise reflect reality and the whole piece just seems intended to piss people off for no good reason.

Where do we even begin?

Airlines often have subfleets with different configurations reflecting that demand is different depending on the market; American isn’t reconfiguring existing planes with this configuration but rather the airline realizes that it doesn’t have enough business class seats to meet demand in some markets

The existence of doors generally doesn’t increase the footprint of a seat so it’s not like anything is being taken away from economy class passengers to offer a more competitive experience in business class; this paints economy passengers as being incredibly catty and just for no reason being opposed to those who paid for something nice

This more premium configuration has little to do with the pandemic and has more to do with American’s projections of long term demand among business travelers (along with premium leisure demand)

Even Spirit Airlines the ultra low cost carrier has the “Big Front Seat” and arguably nearly all the points being made above would also apply to that

I guess the author would love the direction American has been taking in general by cramming more seats into planes ripping out TVs etc. in order to offer a more low cost experience

On major global network airlines business class passengers are subsidizing economy class passengers in many business markets; that’s why long haul economy airfare is often so cheap

Take a flight between the United States and London in winter and you may very well find that there are more passengers in business class and premium economy than in economy

American’s 777-300ERs have 52 business class seats

Bottom line

There are a lot of things that we can (and should) criticize American Airlines for. But American Airlines introducing a new premium Boeing 787 configuration shouldn’t be one of them. Airlines create products intended to meet demand in different markets.

The demand for business class between New York and London won’t be the same as the demand for business class between New York and Athens and it makes sense for airlines to have different configurations to reflect that.

In this particular case the upcoming Boeing 787-9s are clearly intended to become American’s new flagship aircraft eventually replacing the carrier’s fleet of Boeing 777-300ERS (which have even more premium seats).

Suggesting somehow that economy class passengers should get their pitchforks out because doors are being added to business class seats is a weird direction to take. But hey to each their own…

Even in the small Illinois university towns of Urbana and Champaign where I live the once-familiar howl of the New Flyer D 40 LFs is disappearing as those buses are being replaced by hybrid and all-electric buses. Even some hydrogen buses are being used here.

But what about the motorcoach side of things?

Compared to the city transit and the personal sectors electric motorcoaches are just not catching on as quickly. At least not in North America.

(In my video I review the pros and cons of several electric vehicles introduced to the North American market such as MCI D45 CRT LE MCI J4500 Charge Van Hool CX45E Van Hool TDX25E Temsa TS45E and BYD C10MS.)

Right now they’re money-losers

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been asked if Peoria Charter the bus company that I work for plans to purchase all-electric coaches. The short answer is no based on the current abilities of the electric coaches on the market.

Peoria Charter offers at least six line-run services every day to and from the Chicagoland area and major airports. Each of these routes is over 350 miles each day. This means that none of these all-electric buses would come close to getting the job done.

A 3- to 4-hour recharge in the middle of these routes would double the travel time for our passengers and make it so long that one driver would not have the legal hours to do the trip.

As for the advertised ranges of these all-electric buses those numbers are calculated under ideal conditions. Battery capacity can change drastically depending on the temperature outside and will be affected by the weight of 56 passengers with a full bay of luggage. Air conditioning systems are a huge drain on electricity.

The battery capacity will decrease 2% to 3% each year which means every year your bus is going to have less and less range.

For a city transit bus that’s doing circles around the community range is not as big of a deal because it is able to recharge on a recharging pad at each bus stop within minutes of each other. But for a motorcoach that needs to get its passengers to their destination 400 to 500 miles away within a 10-hour window that doesn’t work.

Numbers don’t work yet

The bottom line is that electric vehicle technology has not caught up to the needs of the motorcoach industry – at least not for companies that run long-distance trips for most of their services.

Cost is going to play a huge factor. Electric coaches are double the price of a diesel-powered motorcoach which usually are around $500000 per coach. That means I could buy two full-sized diesel motor coaches and make the profit of two charter trips for the price of one all-electric motorcoach.

Another expense is maintenance. You’re going to need an entirely new set of garage equipment and tools to keep these all-electric coaches running. Your mechanics will not be certified to work on your new buses and would basically need to go back to school and get another degree in order to be able to work on these all-electric vehicles.

So how are city transit agencies able to do this and most privately-owned motorcoach companies not? One simple answer is the government. Tax dollars pay for most of their purchases and upkeep. Privately owned motorcoach companies do not have the government giving them money if their businesses are not making a profit.

Waiting for right technology

I’m not slamming nor am I against all-electric buses. In fact I am very hopeful that one day we will have an entire fleet of them. I mean why wouldn’t I want to never have to buy fuel again?

But at its current stage all-electric motorcoach technology is not far enough along for many motorcoach companies in North America to survive if they purchased them.

As a business owner or manager you would never want to purchase something that’s going to cost you more money than you would make back.

Some motorcoach companies have contracts and trips that keep them running local shuttles that do not extend past the range of the batteries. More power to them for being among the first companies to own operate and maintain these new species of motor coaches.

And personally I can’t wait for the day to be able to do the same.

Here’s what some of you had to say on the topic.

Chances are the Great Salt Lake is part of your daily life even if you don’t live in Utah.

If you pop open a can of soda in the United States it more likely than not contains magnesium harvested from the Great Salt Lake which gives the container its strength. The fruit vegetables and almonds you buy at the grocery store were likely grown with potash fertilizer produced from material in the lake’s salty water too. And with the lake’s two largest mineral companies ramping up to harvest one of the world’s hottest commodities — lithium — bits of the Great Salt Lake soon could be found in your phone laptop and car battery.

And the revenue the state collects from minerals like lithium will also be used to shore up the imperiled lake’s health.

“We know from the science that there [are] fairly large amounts of lithium in the lake” said Rep. Timothy Hawkes R-Centerville. “It has been mined in the past but it wasn’t commercially viable.”

Lithium is the lightest metal in the periodic table and it’s used in all kinds of things. It makes glass and ceramics stronger. It’s a handy component in car parts and vehicle greases since it holds up well in extreme temperatures. It’s a mood stabilizer that helps treat bipolar depression. It also helped create the hydrogen bomb. It’s in pool chemicals air scrubbers polymers and refrigerants.

“It’s used in a multitude of very mundane things that no one ever considers” said Brian Jaskula a mineral commodity specialist who has researched lithium for the U.S. Geological Survey since 2008.

For decades the United States was the largest producer of lithium with the bulk of it coming out of a hard rock mine in North Carolina. Then a small fertilizer company called SQM in Chile’s Salar de Atacama salt flat borrowed a form of lithium extraction first pioneered in Nevada.

The method “mines” materials from salt brine. That mineral-rich water is held in shallow ponds which evaporate and concentrate its resources.

Ogden's 55000-acre solar evaporation pond complex produces salt sulfate of potash and magnesium chloride from the Great Salt Lake.

“In order for them to be economic and achieve the lowest production costs they have to be blessed with a nice hot dry environment” Jaskula said of brine mineral harvesting. “And the Salar de Atacama is the driest place on Earth.”

Evaporative extraction of lithium proved more cost-effective than hacking it out of a mountain since the sun does most of the work. By the 1990s SQM was able to sell its lithium at half the price of traditional mines.

“As a result hard rock wasn’t able to compete” in the U.S. Jaskula said “so they all went out of business.”

Why lithium works well in computers smartphones and electric vehicles

Around the same time consumer electronics became more widespread. Manufacturers soon realized lithium was an especially useful ingredient for making batteries.

“It has this outer electron it really wants to get rid of” Jaskula said. “Because of that reactivity … it has the benefit of having a lot of innate energy in it as well as being very light.”

Lithium-ion batteries are now prolific in computers and smartphones. But in recent years one product in particular is driving a surge in demand for the mineral: electric vehicles.

In 2015 batteries eclipsed glass and ceramics as the dominant end-use of lithium and that use continues to mushroom. Last year 74% of the world’s mined lithium went to batteries. By 2030 CNBC reports more than 90% of lithium demand will likely be fueled by electric vehicles.

Sometimes referred to as “white gold” by investors the price of lithium ballooned from just over $6000 per metric ton in 2012 to $17000 last year according to USGS estimates. But the true cost of lithium is known only by peddlers and buyers of the product Jaskula said and it may be selling for much more.

“The last half of this decade the demand is going to be in excess of what production can come up with” he said. “There’s this mad scramble for all these existing operations to expand their capacity and for new mines to come online.”

China consumes the most mined lithium in the world. It has contracts for up to 95% of the lithium mined in Australia making that nation the largest producer of the material followed by Chile.

“Even the most unimpressive lithium operation if there’s even a chance it will become economical China will make a deal” Jaskula said. “They’re the No. 1 battery maker now and their mega-factories are going to be increasing at a logarithmic growth rate.”

U.S. lags in lithium production

Electric vehicles are steering China’s insatiable appetite for lithium Jaskula said. They’re also a key component in President Joe Biden’s efforts to modernize infrastructure and combat climate change in the United States. The U.S. Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy announced in February a $5 billion investment to build out a charging network across the nation’s highways.

But the U.S. lags in domestic production of some of the crucial materials including lithium needed to build a greener future.

Compass Minerals produces salt plant nutrients and magnesium chloride for application primarily in North America. Ogden's 55000-acre solar evaporation pond complex produces salt sulfate of potash and magnesium chloride from the Great Salt Lake.

A number of companies and organizations throughout the nation are experimenting with innovative ways to economically extract lithium including a geothermal project at California’s Salton Sea. Still the USGS reports only one viable domestic operation: a brine extraction mine at Nevada’s Silver Peak that’s been in business since the 1960s.

Because it’s currently the nation’s only lithium mine USGS doesn’t share data about Silver Peak to protect proprietary information. But The New York Times reported last year the outfit extracts about 5000 tons annually. That’s a mere drop in the bucket of worldwide lithium production which USGS pegged at 100000 tons last year.

The Biden administration meanwhile announced last month that it’s pouring $30 million into research to help U.S. companies source local sources of lithium cobalt nickel and other critical elements for green technologies. The supply issues the nation faced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic were apparently a wake-up call.

“Because of the way the market is going now” Jaskula said “the U.S. and other countries are finally bringing back mineral refining capacity.”

Enter the Great Salt Lake.

How the Great Salt Lake is getting in the lithium game

Utahns have extracted minerals from the Great Salt Lake since at least 1847 when a group of pioneers gathered 125 bushels of crude salt from its shores. Today it contributes more than $1 billion to the state’s economy.

One of the lake’s largest mineral harvesters Compass Minerals in Ogden got its start in the late 1960s as Lithium Corp of America. The company quickly realized fertilizer was a more profitable venture at least at the time. It’s now the largest producer of sulfate of potash in the Western Hemisphere a nutrient used to grow a variety of produce including grapes potatoes and nuts.

But Compass is going back to its roots and investing in lithium once again.

Ogden's 55000-acre solar evaporation pond complex produces salt sulfate of potash and magnesium chloride from the Great Salt Lake.

In October the company announced it had successfully converted lithium brine into battery-grade lithium carbonate. Compass expects to send its lithium product to the market by 2025 according to a news release and it currently has two lithium chiefs on its nine-member executive team.

Compass CEO Kevin S. Crutchfield said the company’s Great Salt Lake operation has a “2.4 million ton lithium brine resource.” It plans to generate up to 25000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium each year with as much as 65% of production sourced from brine Compass already has evaporating in its 55000 acres of ponds.

Across the lake in Tooele County US Magnesium has produced its namesake mineral from Great Salt Lake brine for half a century. It’s virtually the only magnesium mine in North America (China accounts for about 75% of the global magnesium supply according to USGS) and 50% to 75% of the cans and certain car parts manufactured in the U.S. likely have magnesium that originated in the Great Salt Lake.

In recent years the company has had an eye on a second product.

“About 10 years ago we started recognizing the value of the lithium” said Tom Tripp a Tooele County Council member and director of technical services for US Magnesium.

(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) US Magnesium seen across the Great Salt Lake from Stansbury Island on Saturday March 26 2022.

Rather than pulling more water out of the desiccated Great Salt Lake the company is using its own mining waste where lithium is concentrated as a byproduct.

“This was a residue that had no commercial value to us at the time” Tripp said “so it got stacked in the backyard and accumulated for 50 years.”

In 2018 US Magnesium quietly broke ground on a lithium production facility. The plant now has the capacity to produce 10000 tons a year according to a brief post on the company’s website.

Tripp sees future potential for the mineral beyond car batteries.

“Someday if you’re going to get into solar power in a real [utility-scale] way … you’ve got to be able to store a lot of power to get you through the dark” he said. “You’ve got to have massive battery banks.”

How will mining impact the struggling Great Salt Lake?

The Great Salt Lake hit a record low last summer and with Utah’s prolonged and persistent drought there’s little relief in sight.

State lawmakers toured the lake via a helicopter in February taking in its vast parched lakebed. They passed a slew of water conservation bills in response. Among them was HB157 sponsored by Hawkes which creates a special account for the Great Salt Lake ensuring the royalties collected from mineral extraction are reinvested to improve the lake’s health.

“Where the lake has such significant needs” Hawkes said “let’s protect the resource generating the revenue.”

(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) The shore of the Great Salt Lake on Stansbury Island on Saturday March 26 2022.

It’s unclear how much of a windfall lithium mining will generate for Great Salt Lake restoration since extraction of the mineral is still in its early stages. But royalties from current brine-harvesting operations generate between $5 million and $13 million each year according to Laura Vernon Great Salt Lake coordinator for the Utah Department of Natural Resources.

“They’re still working hard at generating lithium and becoming profitable” Vernon said. “It would be a great bonus a tremendous asset but I couldn’t say how much.”

Before Hawkes’ bill created a Great Salt Lake account royalties from its minerals went to things like keeping the state Fairpark afloat reopening national parks when the federal government shut down and rehabilitating sage grouse habitat. Hawkes said the mineral companies lobbied lawmakers to keep that revenue local before the lake’s ecosystems — and its industries — collapse.

“They’ve long felt ‘Geez we pay all these royalties to the state and now the source is at risk” Hawkes said.

The push for more domestic sources of minerals comes with risks to natural resources like the Great Salt Lake. Proposed lithium mines across the country face protests and legal battles from nearby communities and native tribes who fear increased pollution and depletion of precious water resources.

While solar evaporation mining is touted as more environmentally sound than typical hard rock or open pit mines it isn’t without impacts.

US Magnesium formerly called Magnesium Corp. was once dinged as the largest polluter in the nation. Its emissions discolored cars and gave workers headaches brittle hair and respiratory problems according to a High Country News report from 1996.

Just last year the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached a settlement with the plant over illegal hazardous waste disposal. The agency required US Magnesium to build a barrier wall that prevents leaks to the Great Salt Lake along with a filtration plant at a cost of at least $37 million.

“It’s laudable to say we should be doing our own extraction for the things that we’re going to use” said Aimee Boulanger executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance or IRMA. “However ... it’s not like we’re going to be doing the extraction of lithium from affluent communities who are driving their brand-new electric vehicles.”

Compass Minerals produces salt plant nutrients and magnesium chloride for application primarily in North America. Ogden's 55000-acre solar evaporation pond complex produces salt sulfate of potash and magnesium chloride from the Great Salt Lake.

Since 2006 IRMA has worked with mining industries to develop a standard for responsible mineral development that assesses environmental impacts fair labor and social responsibility for mines. Mining and end-use companies volunteer to adopt all or part of the standard. IRMA finalized its list of more than 400 best practices in 2018 and began auditing mines in 2019. Lithium brine operations in South America were among the first mines to sign up for an assessment.

“They know the expectation is they’re supposed to be selling themselves as part of a climate-stressed world solution” Boulanger said. “You didn’t have to convince them.”

While Boulanger said she hasn’t heard from any Great Salt Lake operations so far the industry causing lithium demand to soar — car manufacturing — is getting on board with sourcing their materials from mines meeting IRMA requirements. BMW was the first carmaker to join IRMA in 2020. Mercedes-Benz Ford GM and Volkswagen have since followed and Boulanger said another U.S.-based manufacturer is set to announce its partnership next week.

“There’s a shared sense as we move to a needed transition on energy fuels that we all still need to be looking at the impacts” Boulanger said. “... We need to make sure that our solutions don’t cause more problems than they were set to solve.”

It comes on the heels of Ukraine withstanding an attempt by Russian hackers to knock out power to 2 million people in that war-torn country. The Biden administration has been releasing sensitive intelligence and dire warnings that the Kremlin is preparing to launch a new generation of cyberattacks on American soil. U.S. cyber defenders tell us they are now watching Russian state actors probe some of our most critical systems and are bracing themselves — especially at the Department of Homeland Security — with an initiative called ""Shields Up.""

Jen Easterly: We are seeing evolving intelligence about Russian planning for potential attacks. And we have to assume that there's going to be a breach. There's going to be an incident. There's going to be an attack.

Jen Easterly is director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Known by its acronym CISA the agency helps secure computer networks in 16 sectors deemed vital to national security like energy finance and communications.

Jen Easterly: Anything that could impact critical infrastructure.

Jen Easterly

Easterly is not your typical bureaucrat. She's a decorated retired Army officer with two Bronze Stars who's also decorated with a tattoo and nails painted the colors of Ukraine's flag – she's a techie with serious chops. A West Point graduate and a Rhodes scholar she was part of the National Security Agency's elite hacking team and went on to help create the agency's cyber command.

Bill Whitaker: When you've got someone like Vladimir Putin who just doesn't seem to care about norms how do you protect against that? When you've got someone like Vladimir Putin who just doesn't seem to care about norms how do you protect against that?

Jen Easterly: I think we are dealing with a very dangerous very sophisticated very well-resourced cyber actor. And that's why we've been telling everybody consistently shields up. What does that mean? It means assume there will be disruptive cyber activity and make sure you are prepared for it.

She's taken to social media to encourage industry to share information with the government to defend against cyberattacks and calls on all Americans to put their shields up by updating software and using multi-factor authentication on computers and phones.

Jen Easterly: I'm a big Star Trek fan so ""Shields Up!"" And it has really caught on as something– that's all about preparation not panic.

Bill Whitaker: Is there one sector that worries you more than the others?

Jen Easterly: We know that energy targeting the energy sector is part of the Russian play book. But also finance given potential retaliatory attacks for the very severe sanctions that the U.S. and our allies have imposed and continue to impose.

Bill Whitaker: If I'm just sitting at home watching this why should I be concerned about a cyberattack?

Jen Easterly: Everything that you do hour by hour is largely dependent in some way on the critical infrastructure. How you get gas at the local pump how you get food at the grocery store how you get money from your ATM how you get your power how you get your water how you communicate – all of that is our critical infrastructure. And that's what we're saying is at potential risk to a Russian malicious cyberattack.

Robert Lee: There's only been one country out there that's actually had expertise in taking down electric power systems and that's Russia.

Robert Lee

Robert Lee – another former NSA hacker – is the co-founder of Dragos a cybersecurity company. He's known as a wizard of the dark arts of cyber war specializing in the defense of critical infrastructure. In 2015 he investigated an incident in Ukraine the most destructive cyberattack on civilian infrastructure the world had ever seen.

Bill Whitaker: What– what'd you find?

Robert Lee: The Russian state broke into three different power companies across Ukraine probably about six months ahead of the actual attack. So they broke in over the summer got into position and they started learning how to operate those systems. And as a result they disconnected over 60 substations across Ukraine and caused blackouts for around 225000 customers in the dead of winter.

It was all done remotely from this building in Moscow by hackers with the military intelligence agency the GRU. The Ukrainians had to send utility workers to the impaired substations to manually restart each one. A year later Lee says GRU hackers were back with a much more sophisticated attack – a piece of malware that could cripple multiple transmission stations with one keystroke.

Bill Whitaker: What did it mean that Russia was able to do this?

Robert Lee: It was a shock to everybody because there's been a lot of theory around how you could do this. People in my community on the cybersecurity side have been talking about this for a long time on it's possible. But to actually see it demonstrated is a giant proof that you can do it. And we also know now they're bold enough to do it.

Bill Whitaker: Could the Russians do the same thing here in the U.S.?

Robert Lee: Absolutely.

Over the last few years Lee's cybersecurity company Dragos has tracked the same GRU hacking group – known among researchers as ""Sandworm"" – installing malware and probing power companies here in the U.S.

Robert Lee: There was about a dozen power companies that ended up getting compromised in the 2014-2015 time frame by the same group that ended up taking down the electric system in Ukraine.

In the summer of 2017 Russian hackers launched a more brazen and potentially much more dangerous attack – this time on Petro Rabigh a massive oil refinery along the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia. On a Friday night in August a safety system triggered the whole plant to shut down. Julian Gutmanis was working cybersecurity for the Saudi oil giant Aramco and rushed to the scene to investigate.

Bill Whitaker: From what you saw you– you were alarmed?

Julian Gutmanis: At that stage yes yep. Like why is somebody going after the safety systems on a weekend at night? It's just not normal.

What Gutmanis discovered stopped him in his tracks; someone had hacked into the emergency shutdown system and installed suspicious computer files.

Julian Gutmanis: The files were created and executed– you know momentarily before the– the initial outage that we responded to.

Bill Whitaker: You were able to trace that back?

Julian Gutmanis: Forensically yeah. I came across a– function that they'd defined in there called ""execute exploit."" Hairs stood up on my arms and I'm like ""This is probably something really serious."" You don't normally have the word ""exploit"" in– in normal kind of vendor software.

Bill Whitaker: So that– that set off alarm bells?

Julian Gutmanis: Oh huge alarm bells. And it really kind of made us focus on ""How did these files get there? Where did they come from? Who created them? And– and what do we do? What are they trying to do?""

Julian Gutmanis

Gutmanis now works for Robert Lee at Dragos who also investigated the hack. Lee says the hackers could have set off explosions and released toxic chemicals with the malware they implanted known as Triton.

Robert Lee: It's the first time in history we've ever seen a cyberattack explicitly designed to kill people. It targets safety systems. And these safety systems are only there to protect lives. So going after that system explicitly the only reason to do it is to hurt people. What happened is they made a small error in the software that instead of actually causing the effects they were looking to achieve like an explosion where you'd kill people instead it simply shut down the plant.

Lisa Monaco: The Russians pose a serious and persistent threat.

As the second highest ranking official in the Justice Department Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco oversees the FBI and its 1000 strong cyber division. Three weeks ago her department unsealed two secret indictments: one described how Triton worked and identified Evgeny Gladkikh from a Russian Ministry of Defense research institute as one of the hackers. The second indictment says between 2012 and 2017 three Russian intelligence agents and accomplices hacked hundreds of energy companies around the world and managed to get inside the computer network at a nuclear power plant in Kansas.

Lisa Monaco: This was historical activity. But it is very much the type of activity that we are warning about today when it comes to Russia's response to the world's response to the horror in Ukraine.

Bill Whitaker: What about right now? Are you seeing Russian activity– Russian plots to disrupt our infrastructure?

Lisa Monaco: We are seeing Russian state actors scanning probing looking for opportunities looking for weaknesses in our systems on critical infrastructure on businesses. Think of it Bill as a burglar going around trying to jiggle the lock in your house door to see if it's open. And we're seeing that.

Lisa Monaco

Earlier this month Monaco joined Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray to announce the U.S. had conducted a bold operation: stopping Russian hackers as they were preparing to strike.

Lisa Monaco: We're talking military intelligence actors deploying malware malicious code on thousands of computers in hundreds of countries. We're seeing them deploy that code and take control of these computers. It's like an army of infected computers that with a single command can be deployed to do everything from gathering information stealing information and sometimes to have destructive effect. And we were able to work with the private sector to understand it to be able to use unique investigative tools to trace it back to attackers at keyboards. And then use our tools to go in not only remove that malware but again to lock those doors to keep the attacker from coming back.

Dmitri Alperovitch: This was the first time that we have taken that action against something that the Russian military has done preemptively before they launched the attack. We took it down.

Dmitiri Alperovitch is well acquainted with Putin's tactics. As co-founder of the heavyweight cybersecurity company Crowdstrike he helped trace the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee back to the GRU in Moscow. He currently is a member of the Homeland Security Advisory council. The Moscow-born Alperovitch has a theory why Putin hasn't launched a full scale cyberattack on the U.S. yet.

Dmitri Alperovitch

Dmitri Alperovitch: He thinks that a victory that he can pull out is still achievable and that as he can make a deal with Europeans at least and possibly the Americans to take the sanctions off. I think he's mistaken on that. But I think at least until he tries that he's unlikely to launch the cyberattacks.

Bill Whitaker: So why do you think President Biden has said a cyberattack from Russia is coming.

Dmitri Alperovitch: Well I think the reality is that those sanctions will not come off that the economic pressure on Russia will continue and they are gonna start retaliating for that in cyberspace once it hits them that this is permanent that this is not going away. And they're gonna try to look for ways to press us economically in retaliation. And cyber is a perfect way for them to do so.

Perfect because cyber is a battlefield where Russians have an advantage: a target-rich environment in the United States.

Dmitri Alperovitch: The reality is that we have way too many targets. If you look particularly in our energy sector you have regional utilities. You have minor energy processing companies storage companies pipeline companies. And make no mistake Bill. The cyber actors that they have are top notch. And they've demonstrated that time and time again.

Bill Whitaker: We have said in the past that if you do this to us we will respond in kind. Would we?

Dmitri Alperovitch: We have to let him know that you will not touch our critical infrastructure without a response. And the way to do that I think is through a cyber operation that can demonstrate our capabilities without lasting damage. One of the ways you can do that for example is by taking Russia off the internet for a few hours. It won't cause any lasting impact but it will demonstrate the power of the United States Cyber Command what we can do to his economy by disconnecting him effectively from the internet.

Bill Whitaker: We can do that?

Dmitri Alperovitch: We can absolutely do that. And we'll let him know that if he keeps going if he keeps attacking us we can make that permanent.

The home for this five-night event will be the 26 Bridge Street event space in DUMBO which is a former metal factory steps from the East River and near Manhattan Bridge. According to this week's announcement the space will be altered to resemble noma's home location in Copenhagen including plenty of greenery and typically minimalist Scandinavian wooden tables and chairs in the dining room to create a sort of mod-hygge look.

It's a rare opportunity to experience a special menu from a restaurant that is a bucket list-type establishment for foodies and one that some gourmands plan their entire travel calendars around. The World's 50 Best Restaurants list for instance declared noma ""one of the most coveted restaurants on the planet"" as part of its most recent top ranking in 2021.

noma's menus curated by founder and chef René Redzepi tend to rotate three times per year depending on the season. A seafood-focused menu is usually available between January and June with vegetable season in the summer months and ""game and forest"" fare in the winter.

While $700 for the Brooklyn experience is not cheap neither is a regular dinner seating at the restaurant in Denmark. The current food menu is priced at approximately $421 per person with another $262 for wine pairings or $145 for juice pairings (and we're not talking Capri Sun pouches here but rather bold flavor combinations like quince-saffron or green gooseberry).

Adding to the allure of this event Redzepi himself is expected to be on hand for the five New York dinners in May.

The main merch tent which houses hundreds of performer T-shirts hoodies bandanas socks posters blankets stickers patches and more had a steady line of at least 1000-plus patrons at any given time throughout each festival day at the Empire Polo Club in Indio. However specific artists have started to work with a wide variety of brands to create Coachella-exclusive merchandise that in most cases can only be purchased on the festival grounds.

Of course that all comes with a higher cost.

Rare and exclusive

On top of having her own massive pop-up store near the main entrance Saturday headliner Billie Eilish and singer-songwriter Conan Gray each worked with American Express to design and release limited-edition merch. Eilish created a reclaimed and upcycled black hoodie with her image on it for $100 and Gray contributed a watermelon-colored crewneck pullover with cactus embroidery for $70. Both were available via the Amex Artist Shop online where Eilish’s hoodie sold-out just 15 minutes after being released on April 15. The remainder of the stock was available on-site to American Express cardholders who waited in line to visit the American Express Lounge which only made the items available on both Fridays of the festival.

“Of course we got these hoodies; it’s Billie and she’s a queen” George Chavez of Anaheim said. He did some snooping around online weeks before the festival to see if any of the headliners would partner with American Express since they had previously collaborated with 2019 headliner Ariana Grande. Though he and his friends stood in line for over an hour to purchase the hoodies “I’m glad we got here and it’s absolutely worth it” he said.

Friday headliner Harry Styles created several event-exclusive shirts pullover sweaters and hoodies that ranged from $45-$75 for his Harry’s House pop-up near the main entrance of the festival. His beauty company Pleasing also had a bold and colorful nail polish bar experience that offered free manicures for fans and sold Coachella-specific bandanas for $20 and oversized hoodies for $110.

Through its GV BLACK x Coachella initiative the festival partnered with six Black designers and brands from Southern California including Nicholas Mayfield Kacey Lynch Diana Boardley Brownstone Gavin Mathieu and Skid Row Fashion Week to sell festival-themed merch in The Boutique located in the Coachella Courtyard. Each designer came up with a variety of imagery and patterns for clothing items including shorts T-shirts hoodies jean jackets and more that ran anywhere from $60-$300.

Home shopping

Fans watching from home could also buy additional exclusive merch from Eilish as well as performers Brockhampton and Flume who collaborated with YouTube which is livestreaming both festival weekends. The goods were only available during the livestream on April 16. The same line of merch will be available again the following Saturday April 23 during weekend two of the fest. The collection includes T-shirts for $35-$45 long-sleeved shirts for $45 and woven blankets for $80.

Virtual marketplace StockX partnered with Coachella artists to release 10 exclusive capsule collections which became available to the global market on April 11 with prices ranging from $30-$140 per item. Some of the partnerships include Snoh Aalegra x Melody Ehsani 88Rising x AMBUSH and Vince Staples x Brownstone. Instead of a physical store on-site StockX set up an immersive art installation which looked like three sets of stairs in between the Mohave and Gobi stages where fans could scan a QR code to directly order the goods from the site.

Brands and bands

Though spotting big brand names on tents on the festival grounds is nothing new things have changed. Instead of pop-ups offering free swag fans now line up for exclusive festival experiences or seek RSVP invites through the brand’s social channels and mailing lists. Companies like Heineken Lager Beer and Absolut Vodka have set up lounges for those 21-and-older to hang out enjoy beverages and participate in their activations. Ray-Ban Sunglasses and Postmates had pop-ups that offered fans a variety of photo experiences and free festival-exclusive goodies while Frito-Lay made its festival debut with a chip tasting experience inside its Potatodomes in the festival campgrounds.

Branding and cross-marketing even took over the main Coachella Stage on Saturday as music collective 88rising which represents a number of Asian-American artists and partners with Coachella event promoters Goldenvoice for Head in the Clouds Festival had its own Head in the Clouds Forever showcase with performances by CL Jackson Wang Hikaru Utada Milli Bibi Warren Hue Niki and Rich Brian.

Prior to the festival 88rising launched three exclusive NFT (non-fungible token) collections filled with digital collectibles and opportunities for in-person experiences on-site.

With matches played in consecutive days on El Salvador’s southern coast the U.S. defeated Argentina 4-2 to open the tournament beat Bahamas 5-2 in the second match and edged the hosts 3-1 with two third period goals on Saturday finishing atop the four-team group with nine points to lift it’s first international trophy - in only its fourth competition - since debuting in 2019.

USA forward Lauren Leslie was recognized as the tournament’s Most Valuable Player after leading the U.S. with four goals while scoring in all three matches. Kilee Quigley and Ali Hall finished three goals apiece and also scored in the three games.

After a four-day mini camp the 10-player USA roster was reduced by one on the eve of the opening match when goalkeeper Melissa Lowder was recalled by her NWSL team the San Diego Wave. U.S. head coach Morgan Church also had to depart to join the U.S. Under-17 Women’s National Team coaching staff ahead of the World Cup Qualifying tournament at the Concacaf Championship.

The deep U.S. squad pushed through with assistant coach and former Men’s Beach Soccer defender Ryan Futagaki stepping in on the sidelines and veteran goalkeeper Christy Yount directing the backline for all three matches.

It took the U.S. until the third period of the opening match to get rolling. After Quigley put the U.S. ahead early against Argentina with a long-distance free kick the South American’s took a 2-1 lead into the final stance. But the U.S. scored three unanswered in the final five minutes with goals from Hall Tori Huber’s first career goal and Leslie to win its first match since defeating Paraguay at the 2019 World Beach Games in Qatar.

The team’s second match saw Leslie and Quigley put the U.S. ahead of Bahamas 2-1 in the first period and Leslie and Hall stretched the lead to 4-2 after two. Ashley Triplet put the game away midway through the third with her first international goal.

With Argentina having defeated Bahamas earlier in the day on match day three the U.S. knew it had to defeat the hosts in order to win the tournament. Ali Hall put the USA up seconds into the match with a deft lob to the back post but the home side’s Fatima Vazquez leveled before the end of the second. Quigley put the USA ahead in the third with a rip from 20 yards off a quick restart from Yount and Leslie headed in a long Hall pass to ice the game.

Leslie has now scored 10 career goals surpassing Samantha Witteman’s 8 goals. Quigley currently ranks third with six goals and Hall fourth with 5 tallies.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought immense suffering to the people of that land while sparking calls for increased military spending in both the United States and Europe. Though that war may prove to be a tragedy for the world one group is already benefiting from it: U.S. arms contractors.

Even before hostilities broke out the CEOs of major weapons firms were talking about how tensions in Europe could pad their profits. In a January 2022 call with his company’s investors Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes typically bragged that the prospect of conflict in Eastern Europe and other global hot spots would be good for business adding that “we are seeing I would say opportunities for international sales… [T]he tensions in Eastern Europe the tensions in the South China Sea all of those things are putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there. So I fully expect we’re going to see some benefit from it.”

In late March in an interview with the Harvard Business Review after the war in Ukraine had begun Hayes defended the way his company would profit from that conflict:

“So I make no apology for that. I think again recognizing we are there to defend democracy and the fact is eventually we will see some benefit in the business over time. Everything that’s being shipped into Ukraine today of course is coming out of stockpiles either at DoD [the Department of Defense] or from our NATO allies and that’s all great news. Eventually we’ll have to replenish it and we will see a benefit to the business over the next coming years.”

Arms to Ukraine profits to contractors

The war in Ukraine will indeed be a bonanza for the likes of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. First of all there will be the contracts to resupply weapons like Raytheon’s Stinger anti-aircraft missile and the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin-produced Javelin anti-tank missile that Washington has already provided to Ukraine by the thousands. The bigger stream of profits however will come from assured post-conflict increases in national-security spending here and in Europe justified at least in part by the Russian invasion and the disaster that’s followed.

Indeed direct arms transfers to Ukraine already reflect only part of the extra money going to U.S. military contractors. This fiscal year alone they are guaranteed to also reap significant benefits from the Pentagon’s Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program both of which finance the acquisition of American weaponry and other equipment as well as military training. These have in fact been the two primary channels for military aid to Ukraine from the moment the Russians invaded and seized Crimea in 2014. Since then the United States has committed around $5 billion in security assistance to that country.

According to the State Department the United States has provided such military aid to help Ukraine “preserve its territorial integrity secure its borders and improve interoperability with NATO.” So when Russian troops began to mass on the Ukrainian border last year Washington quickly upped the ante. On March 31 2021 the U.S. European Command declared a “potential imminent crisis” given the estimated 100000 Russian troops already along that border and within Crimea. As last year ended the Biden administration had committed $650 million in weaponry to Ukraine including anti-aircraft and anti-armor equipment like the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin Javelin anti-tank missile.

Despite such elevated levels of American military assistance Russian troops did indeed invade Ukraine in February. Since then according to Pentagon reports the U.S. has committed to giving approximately $2.6 billion in military aid to that country bringing the Biden administration total to more than $3.2 billion and still rising.

Some of this assistance was included in a March emergency-spending package for Ukraine which required the direct procurement of weapons from the defense industry including drones laser-guided rocket systems machine guns ammunition and other supplies. The major military-industrial corporations will now seek Pentagon contracts to deliver that extra weaponry even as they are gearing up to replenish Pentagon stocks already delivered to the Ukrainians.

On that front in fact military contractors have much to look forward to. More than half of the Pentagon’s $6.5 billion portion of the emergency-spending package for Ukraine is designated simply to replenish DoD inventories. In all lawmakers allocated $3.5 billion to that effort $1.75 billion more than the president even requested. They also boosted funding by $150 million for the State Department’s FMF program for Ukraine. And keep in mind that those figures don’t even include emergency financing for the Pentagon’s acquisition and maintenance costs which are guaranteed to provide more revenue streams for the major weapons makers.

Better yet from the viewpoint of such companies there are many bites left to take from the apple of Ukrainian military aid. President Biden has already made it all too clear that “we’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead.” One can only assume that more commitments are on the way.

Another positive side effect of the war for Lockheed Raytheon and other arms merchants like them is the push by House Armed Services Committee chair Adam Smith (D-WA) and ranking committee Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama to speed up production of a next-generation anti-aircraft missile to replace the Stinger. In his congressional confirmation hearing William LaPlante the latest nominee to head acquisition at the Pentagon argued that America also needs more “hot production lines” for bombs missiles and drones. Consider that yet another benefit-in-waiting for the major weapons contractors.

The Pentagon gold mine

For U.S. arms makers however the greatest benefits of the war in Ukraine won’t be immediate weapons sales large as they are but the changing nature of the ongoing debate over Pentagon spending itself. Of course the representatives of such companies were already plugging the long-term challenge posed by China a greatly exaggerated threat but the Russian invasion is nothing short of manna from heaven for them the ultimate rallying cry for advocates of greater military outlays. Even before the war the Pentagon was slated to receive at least $7.3 trillion over the next decade more than four times the cost of President Biden’s $1.7 trillion domestic Build Back Better plan already stymied by members of Congress who labeled it “too expensive” by far. And keep in mind that given the current surge in Pentagon spending that $7.3 trillion could prove a minimal figure.

Indeed Pentagon officials like Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks promptly cited Ukraine as one of the rationales for the Biden administration’s proposed record national-security budget proposal of $813 billion calling Russia’s invasion “an acute threat to the world order.” In another era that budget request for Fiscal Year 2023 would have been mind-boggling since it’s higher than spending at the peaks of the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam and over $100 billion more than the Pentagon received annually at the height of the Cold War.

Despite its size however congressional Republicans — joined by a significant number of their Democratic colleagues — are already pushing for more. Forty Republican members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have in fact signed a letter to President Biden calling for 5% growth in military spending beyond inflation which would potentially add up to $100 billion to that budget request. Typically enough Representative Elaine Luria (D-VA) who represents the area near the Huntington Ingalls company’s Newport News military shipyard in Virginia accused the administration of “gutting the Navy” because it contemplates decommissioning some older ships to make way for new ones. That complaint was lodged despite that service’s plan to spend a whopping $28 billion on new ships in FY 2023.

Who benefits?

That planned increase in shipbuilding funds is part of a proposed pool of $276 billion for weapons procurement as well as further research and development contained in the new budget which is where the top five weapons-producing contractors — Lockheed Martin Boeing Raytheon General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman — make most of their money. Those firms already split more than $150 billion in Pentagon contracts annually a figure that will skyrocket if the administration and Congress have their way. To put all of this in context just one of those top five firms Lockheed Martin was awarded $75 billion in Pentagon contracts in fiscal year 2020 alone. That’s considerably more than the entire budget for the State Department dramatic evidence of how skewed Washington’s priorities are despite the Biden administration’s pledge to “put diplomacy first.”

The Pentagon’s weapons wish list for FY 2023 is a catalog of just how the big contractors will cash in. For example the new Columbia Class ballistic missile submarine built by General Dynamics Electric Boat plant in southeastern Connecticut will see its proposed budget for FY 2023 grow from $5.0 billion to $6.2 billion. Spending on Northrop Grumman’s new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent will increase by about one-third annually to $3.6 billion. The category of “missile defense and defeat” a specialty of Boeing Raytheon and Lockheed Martin is slated to receive more than $24 billion. And space-based missile warning systems a staple of the Trump administration-created Space Force will jump from $2.5 billion in FY 2022 to $4.7 billion in this year’s proposed budget.

Among all the increases there was a single surprise: a proposed reduction in purchases of the troubled Lockheed Martin F-35 combat aircraft from 85 to 61 planes in FY 2023. The reason is clear enough. That plane has more than 800 identified design flaws and its production and performance problems have been little short of legendary. Luckily for Lockheed Martin that drop in numbers has not been accompanied by a proportional reduction in funding. While newly produced planes may be reduced by one-third the actual budget allocation for the F-35 will drop by less than 10% from $12 billion to $11 billion an amount that’s more than the complete discretionary budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since Lockheed Martin won the F-35 contract development costs have more than doubled while production delays have set the aircraft back by nearly a decade. Nonetheless the military services have purchased so many of those planes that manufacturers can’t keep up with the demand for spare parts. And yet the F-35 can’t even be properly tested for combat effectiveness because the simulation software required is not only unfinished but without even an estimated completion date. So the F-35 is many years away from the full production of planes that actually work as advertised if that’s ever in the cards.

A number of the weapons systems which in the Ukraine moment are guaranteed to be showered with cash are so dangerous or dysfunctional that like the F-35 they should actually be phased out. Take the new ICBM. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry has called ICBMs “some of the most dangerous weapons in the world” because a president would only have minutes to decide whether to launch them in a crisis greatly increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war based on a false alarm. Nor does it make sense to buy aircraft carriers at $13 billion a pop especially since the latest version is having trouble even launching and landing aircraft — its primary function — and is increasingly vulnerable to attack by next-generation high-speed missiles.

The few positives in the new budget like the Navy’s decision to retire the unnecessary and unworkable Littoral Combat Ship — a sort of “F-35 of the sea” designed for multiple tasks none of which it does well — could easily be reversed by advocates from states and districts where those systems are built and maintained. The House of Representatives for instance has a powerful Joint Strike Fighter Caucus which in 2021 mustered more than one-third of all House members to press for more F-35s than the Pentagon and Air Force requested as they will no doubt do again this year. A Shipbuilding Caucus co-chaired by representatives Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Rob Wittman (R-VA) will fight against the Navy’s plan to retire old ships to buy new ones. (They would prefer that the Navy keep the old ones and buy new ones with more of your tax money up for grabs.) Similarly the “ICBM Coalition” made up of senators from states with either ICBM bases or production centers has a near perfect record of staving off reductions in the deployment or funding of those weapons and will in 2022 be hard at work defending its budgetary allocation.

Towards a new policy

Coming up with a sensible realistic and affordable defense policy always a challenge will be even more so in the midst of the Ukrainian nightmare. Still given where our taxpayer dollars go it remains all too worthwhile. Such a new approach should include things like reducing the numbers of the Pentagon’s private contractors hundreds of thousands of people many of whom are engaged in thoroughly redundant jobs that could be done more cheaply by civilian government employees or simply eliminated. It’s estimated that cutting spending on contractors by 15% would save around $262 billion over 10 years.

The Pentagon’s three-decades-long near $2 trillion “modernization” plan to build a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers missiles and submarines along with new warheads should for instance simply be scrapped in keeping with the kind of “deterrence-only” nuclear strategy developed by the nuclear-policy organization Global Zero. And the staggering American global military footprint — an invitation to further conflict that includes more than 750 military bases scattered on every continent except Antarctica and counterterror operations in 85 countries — should at the very least be sharply scaled back.

According to the Center for International Policy’s Sustainable Defense Task Force and a study of alternative approaches to defense carried out by the Congressional Budget Office even a relatively minimalist strategic rethinking could save at least $1 trillion over the next decade enough to make a healthy down payment on investments in public health preventing or mitigating the worst potential impacts of climate change or beginning the task of narrowing record levels of income inequality.

Of course none of these changes can occur without challenging the power and influence of the military-industrial-congressional complex a task as urgent as it is difficult in this moment of carnage in Europe. No matter how hard it may be it’s a fight worth having both for the security of the world and the future of the planet.

One thing is guaranteed: a new gold rush of “defense” spending is a disaster in the making for all of us not in that complex.

But during the recent hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson Andrew C. McCarthy—a Republican former federal prosecutor and a prominent legal commentator at National Review—took the unusual step of denouncing an attack from his own side. When Republican senators including Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn began accusing Jackson of having been a dangerously lenient judge toward sex offenders McCarthy wrote a column calling the charge “meritless to the point of demagoguery.” He didn’t like Jackson’s judicial philosophy but “the implication that she has a soft spot for ‘sex offenders’ who ‘prey on children’ . . . is a smear.”

In the end the attacks failed to diminish public support for Jackson and her poised responses to questioning helped secure her nomination by a vote of 53–47. But the fierce campaign against her was concerning in part because it was spearheaded by a new conservative dark-money group that was created in 2020: the American Accountability Foundation. An explicit purpose of the A.A.F.—a politically active tax-exempt nonprofit charity that doesn’t disclose its backers—is to prevent the approval of all Biden Administration nominees.

While the hearings were taking place the A.A.F. publicly took credit for uncovering a note in the Harvard Law Review in which they claimed Jackson had “argued that America’s judicial system is too hard on sexual offenders.” The group also tweeted that she had a “soft-on-sex-offender” record during her eight years as a judge on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. As the Washington Post and other outlets stated Jackson’s sentencing history on such cases was well within the judicial mainstream and in line with a half-dozen judges appointed by the Trump Administration. When Jackson defended herself on this point during the hearings the A.A.F. said on Twitter that she was “lying.” The group’s allegation—reminiscent of the QAnon conspiracy which claims that liberal élites are abusing and trafficking children—rippled through conservative circles. Tucker Carlson repeated the accusation on his Fox News program while a chyron declared “jackson lenient in child sex cases.” Marjorie Taylor Greene the extremist representative from Georgia called Jackson “pro-pedophile.”

Mudslinging is hardly new to American politics. In 1800 a campaign surrogate for Thomas Jefferson called Jefferson’s opponent John Adams “hermaphroditical”; Adams’s supporters predicted that if Jefferson were elected President he would unleash a reign of “murder robbery rape adultery and incest.” Neither the Democratic nor Republican Party is above reproach when it comes to engaging in calumny and since at least 1987 when President Ronald Reagan unsuccessfully nominated Robert Bork to be a Justice the fights over Supreme Court nominees have been especially nasty. Yet the A.A.F.’s approach represents a new escalation in partisan warfare and underscores the growing role that secret spending has played in deepening the polarization in Washington.

Rather than attack a single candidate or nominee the A.A.F. aims to thwart the entire Biden slate. The obstructionism like the Republican blockade of Biden’s legislative agenda in Congress is the end in itself. The group hosts a Web site bidennoms.com that displays the photographs of Administration nominees it has targeted as though they were hunting trophies. And the A.A.F. hasn’t just undermined nominees for Cabinet and Court seats—the kinds of prominent people whose records are usually well known and well defended. It’s also gone after relatively obscure sub-Cabinet-level political appointees whose public profiles can be easily distorted and who have little entrenched support. The A.A.F. which is run by conservative white men has particularly focussed on blocking women and people of color. As of last month more than a third of the twenty-nine candidates it had publicly attacked were people of color and nearly sixty per cent were women.

Among the nominees the group boasts of having successfully derailed are Saule Omarova a nominee for Comptroller of the Currency and Sarah Bloom Raskin whom Biden named to be the vice-chair for supervision of the Federal Reserve Board. David Chipman whom the President wanted to run the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives and David Weil Biden’s choice for the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor both saw their nominations founder in the wake of A.A.F. attacks. Currently the group is waging a negative campaign against Lisa Cook who if confirmed would become the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.

Tom Jones the A.A.F.’s founder and executive director is a longtime Beltway operative specializing in opposition research. Records show that over the years he has worked for several of the most conservative Republicans to have served in the Senate including Ron Johnson of Wisconsin; Ted Cruz of Texas; Jim DeMint of South Carolina; and John Ensign of Nevada for whom Jones was briefly a legislative director. In 2016 Jones ran the opposition-research effort for Cruz’s failed Presidential campaign. When I asked Jones for an interview through the A.A.F.’s online portal he replied “Ms. Meyers . . . Go pound sand.” Citing an article that I had written debunking attacks on Bloom Raskin from moneyed interests including the A.A.F. he said “You are a liberal hack masquerading as an investigative journalist—and not a very good one.” Jones subsequently posted this comment on his group’s Twitter account along with my e-mail address and cell-phone number.

A decade ago Bill Dauster a Democrat who is now the chief counsel to the Senate Budget Committee helped Jones organize a bipartisan Torah study group for Jewish congressional staffers. Dauster recalls him as “soft-spoken and cordial” and finds it hard to reconcile the man he knew with Jones’s current persona. “I find what he appears to have done quite distasteful” he said.

In interviews with right-wing media outlets Jones hasn’t been shy about his intentions. Last April he told Fox News which called A.A.F.’s tactics “controversial” that his group wants to “take a big handful of sand and throw it in the gears of the Biden Administration” making it “as difficult as possible” for the President and his allies on Capitol Hill “to implement their agenda.” When asked why his group was bothering to attack sub-Cabinet-level appointees he explained that people in “that second tier are really the folks who are going to do the day-to-day work implementing the agenda.”

Last year an A.A.F. member infiltrated a Zoom training session for congressional staffers about the ethics rules surrounding earmarks—pet spending projects that lawmakers write into the federal budget. The infiltrator asked leading questions during the meeting and then posted a recording of it online. The attempted sting backfired: nothing incriminating was said and the A.A.F.’s underhanded tactics became the story. Evan Hollander then the spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee told The Hill that “for a group that purports to concern itself with ethics using fake identities misrepresenting themselves as Congressional staff and surreptitiously recording meetings is hypocritical in the extreme.”

Jones made no apologies. He told Fox News “I’m never doing anything illegal. But just because it’s impolite to log into an earmark-training seminar and offend the morals of Capitol Hill staff that’s not going to stop me from doing it.” He added “If I’ve got to trail someone on the ground to find out what they’re doing I’m totally going to do it. Because people who are making decisions need to have this information—they need to understand who they are trusting with the reins of government. And sometimes that means we will use unorthodox methods.”

Liberal and conservative political groups habitually scrutinize a prominent nominee’s record or personal life in search of disqualifying faults. But the A.A.F. has taken the practice to extremes repeatedly spinning negligible tidbits or dubious hearsay into damning narratives. The group recently deployed its unorthodox methods Politico has reported while “desperately pursuing dirt” on Lisa Cook the nominee for the Federal Reserve. Cook who has been a tenured professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University since 2013 has attracted bipartisan support. Glenn Hubbard the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the George W. Bush Administration has said “Cook’s talents as an economic researcher and teacher make her a good nominee for the Fed adding to diversity of perspectives about policy.” In college Cook won a Marshall Scholarship. She subsequently obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California Berkeley taught at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and served as a staff economist on President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. She also held appointments at the National Bureau of Economic Research and at various regional Federal Reserve banks. The A.A.F. though has portrayed her as unqualified and suggested that her tenure at Michigan State is undeserved.

On April 13th Jones sent out the latest of at least three e-mail blasts from the A.A.F. to about fifty of Cook’s colleagues at Michigan State. In the most recent of these messages which were obtained by The New Yorker Jones said that Cook “did not warrant” tenure. Through a Freedom of Information Act request the A.A.F. obtained records showing that the school’s provost had granted Cook full professorship in 2020 overruling a decision not to give her that title the previous year. Jones sent these personnel records to dozens of Cook’s colleagues and asked “Are any of you concerned that . . . she’s not good enough to sit on the Federal Reserve Board?” He urged any detractors to “not hesitate to” contact him. Meanwhile Jones fished for further information by posting a message on an anonymous online gossip forum Economics Job Market Rumors which has been decried by one prominent economist as “a cesspool of misogyny.”

Some of the A.A.F.’s attacks on Cook carried racial overtones. Cook had made donations to bail funds for impoverished criminal defendants including racial-justice protesters who had been arrested; she was following a tradition of activist lawyers in her family and considered it a form of charity. The A.A.F. argued on Twitter that she had made “racist comments” and “even bailed out rioters who burned down American cities.” Cook’s reputation was sullied enough that the Senate Banking Committee vote on her nomination resulted in a tie with no Republicans supporting her. Cook’s nomination can still proceed to the Senate floor but her confirmation remains in limbo as one conservative news outlet after another repeats the A.A.F.’s talking points. A writer for the Daily Caller Chris Brunet said in a Substack column that Cook is a “random economist at Michigan State University who has shamelessly leveraged her skin color and genitalia into gaining the backing of several key White House officials.” Brunet tweeted proudly that his critique had been promoted on Fox News by Tucker Carlson.

The A.A.F.’s treatment of Cook has been mild compared with what several other Biden nominees have gone through. Late last year Saule Omarova—a leading academic in the field of financial regulation who is a law professor at Cornell and holds doctorates in law and political science—withdrew her name from consideration as Biden’s Comptroller of the Currency. She did so she told me because an opposition-research campaign against her which the A.A.F. took credit for had among other things falsely portrayed her as a secret communist.

Born in Kazakhstan in what was then the Soviet Union Omarova received an undergraduate degree from Moscow State University but she became a naturalized American citizen in 2005. Yet during her confirmation hearing in a moment reminiscent of the Joseph McCarthy era the Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana declared that he didn’t know whether to call her “professor or comrade.” Omarova replied “Senator I am not a communist. I do not subscribe to that ideology. I could not choose where I was born.” Omarova’s résumé is hardly anti-capitalist: she worked at the corporate law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and served in George W. Bush’s Treasury Department.

Omarova told me “There were so many accusations. A.A.F. was at the forefront of making my life extremely and unnecessarily difficult.” The group discovered that Omarova after she’d read an article in The Economist about potatoes had tweeted fondly about a time she helped farmers harvest potatoes outside Moscow. The A.A.F. proclaimed that the Biden Administration had “nominated a woman who waxes nostalgic for the good ole days of poverty hunger and forced labor in communist Russia.” Conservative outlets pounced on similar tweets about her past. “The A.A.F. made it into this big deal” she told me. “They said ‘She wants to make America into the Soviet Union.’ It was a complete absurdity. But people who have no idea who I am jumped in and said ‘Go back to the Soviet Union!’ ”

Digging into a person’s past—especially someone who isn’t that well known—takes time and money. “Somebody must have paid them a lot” Omarova said of the A.A.F. “They went through all my public speeches and academic writings to find any kind of phrase they could use against me.” She’d been featured along with other professors in an obscure 2019 documentary based on “Assholes: A Theory” a whimsical treatise by Aaron James a philosophy professor at the University of California Irvine. The A.A.F. without acknowledging the film’s satirical tone promoted a snippet of Omarova calling the financial-services industry “the quintessential asshole industry.” She told me “They didn’t cite the film. It made me sound unhinged nasty and like a rude person.” A compilation of clips from the documentary had been taken off YouTube owing to copyright violations; during the pre-hearing process for Omarova’s nomination Republican staffers insinuated that she’d personally concealed the footage. “I don’t know what kind of relationship those senators had with A.A.F.” she told me. “But clearly they knew of that clip.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNmci5vcmcvYmxvZy93aHktd2FyLXVrcmFpbmUtcmVtaW5kZXItc3RyZW5ndGhlbi1kZW1vY3JhY3ktaG9tZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the War in Ukraine Is a Reminder to Strengthen Democracy at Home,"In 2013 eight years before horned intruders stormed the United States Capitol in the name of a perverse freedom Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass argued in his book Foreign Policy Begins at Home that the greatest threat to American security comes not from abroad but within. Originally launched in 2012 and renewed at the beginning of 2022 the Council’s Renewing America initiative is predicated on just such an idea: for the United States to succeed abroad it must fortify its democracy first.

Since Haass’s original insights others have echoed his call for a foreign policy that begins at home. In 2020 Zack Cooper and Laura Rosenberg then co-directors at the Alliance for Democracy argued in Foreign Affairs that in order to maintain influence abroad democracies must strengthen domestic institutions. If they can get “their houses in order” democracies have a winning hand to play; genuine rule of law superior economic dynamism a free press and competitive markets are all comparative advantages in the long game of geopolitical competition.

One year after their article in Foreign Affairs the war in Ukraine while far from over has offered indications that Cooper and Rosenberg may be right.

Renewing America Ideas and initiatives for renewing America’s economic strength. View all newsletters >

The United States and its allies buttressed by the fierce resistance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian people have rallied in a defense of democratic values and a show of economic political and military might. Despite the troubling electoral successes of far-right leaders in France and Hungary the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has acted swiftly and effectively imposing crippling sanctions on the Russian economy and oligarchs and seizing an estimated two-thirds of Russian foreign currency reserves. The United States has supplied Ukraine with essential albeit still inadequate security assistance recently approving an additional $800 million in military aid that includes sales of artillery armored vehicles and helicopters. Meanwhile Russian technology and IT workers have fled the country while over 600 companies have chosen to exit Russian markets amid heightening social pressures and an increasingly isolated Russian economy.

On the Russian side its forces—many of whom did not even know why they were being deployed to Ukraine—have sabotaged their own equipment and refused to carry out orders. There have been staggering numbers of Russian causalities—including top generals—amid poor planning and logistics failures. Putin has grown increasingly paranoid and dangerous and U.S. intelligence has stated that Putin’s top advisers are too afraid to be honest with him about the state of the war. Moreover Putin’s intense secrecy prior to the invasion when he neglected to consult some of Russia’s top government officials before invading Ukraine have fomented confusion and led to poor execution since the start of the offensive.

Thus the West has so far managed to leverage its significant political economic and military advantages in defense of Ukraine. The pull of free markets and rule of law has led to a mass Russian exodus from the private sector and multilateral action from the world’s leading democracies has showcased their global influence. But as Richard Haass reminded us almost a decade ago global power begins at home. Without an improvement in domestic institutions the international influence of democratic nations on display in the war in Ukraine will slowly but surely erode.

And given the declining state of democracy both at home and abroad there is ample reason to worry. In its Freedom in the World 2022 report Freedom House determines that just twenty-five nations improved their democracies in 2021—nearly a 75 percent decrease from 2005. The same Freedom House report shows that eight out of ten of the world’s citizens currently live in only “partly free” or “not free” nations with 38 percent of the world’s population living in the latter countries the highest proportion since 1997. And although the United States still received a denomination of “free” its aggregate democracy score has fallen by eleven points in the decade from 2010 to 2020.

For Americans such figures point to an unsurprising pattern of institutional decay and democratic backsliding. 2020 concluded with a hotly contested presidential election—in which an incumbent president refused to accept the results of an election that experts have almost unanimously deemed secure. And 2021 began with the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol launched on the basis of such false beliefs about the election’s fraudulence. In a University of Massachusetts Amherst poll taken in December 2021 just 21 percent of Republicans said they believed that Joe Biden’s victory was legitimate. And in a March 2022 report the Pew Research Center estimated that Democratic and Republican members of Congress are “farther apart ideologically today than at any time in the past fifty years” a reflection of the growing partisanship that has wracked the American political system.

Equally frightening while Russian troops marched on Kyiv elements of America’s illiberal right-wing have stirred. Swaths of America’s most prominent GOP voices have expressed what has been at best ambivalence and at worst outright support for Putin. On February 19 Ohio GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance stated “I don’t really care what happens in Ukraine.” In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine President Trump referred to Vladimir Putin as a “genius  ” though he later tried to walk back his comments citing distortions by the “Fake News.” Tucker Carlson of Fox News has equated the Russian and Ukrainian regimes as democratic and moral equals stating that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin are “both tyrants” and arguing that Ukraine is a “growing dictatorship.” One of Carlson’s most elegant diatribes scolding the supposed provocative behavior of the United States was used by Russian state media as propaganda. Carlson’s antics would be easy to dismiss as fringe were it not for his over three million nightly viewers.

Such outcries of illiberalism do more than just inflame partisan fervor. They undermine the ability of the United States to act abroad. As Cooper and Rosenberg argue when democracies fall short of their own ideals “authoritarian competitors use those deficiencies to discredit them.” And evidence shows that it’s not just our enemies that pay attention—our allies take note when American leadership fails as well. The percentage of German French and British citizens who “have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs” jumped respectively by 78 76 and 72 percent after President Joe Biden assumed office from President Donald Trump according to a Pew Research poll. These numbers—and the fact that former President Trump was impeached for withholding $400 million in congressionally approved aid from Ukraine for political reasons—highlight the dangers that the erosion of domestic institutions pose to an effective foreign policy.

Still Ukraine has magnified the power that the United States and other democracies can have on the global stage. But the roots of this influence are domestic. The immediate lesson for Americans is clear: leading up to what is sure to be a contentious 2022 midterm election season and an even more fraught 2024 presidential election the world will be watching. The work of the January 6 committee to investigate the attack on the U.S. Capitol is encouraging but its dissolution after the 2022 midterm elections would strike a blow to American democracy and subsequently America’s international credibility. The case for improvement is therefore not simply a moral one; it is a realist imperative for the preservation of America’s international power.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW1vbmRlLmZyL2VuL2Vjb25vbXkvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzA0LzE3L2luLXRleGFzLXRoZS1sYXJnZXN0LWJpdGNvaW4tZmFjdG9yeS1pbi10aGUtdXMtd2lsbC1jb25zdW1lLXRoZS1lcXVpdmFsZW50LW9mLWhhbGYtYS1udWNsZWFyLXJlYWN0b3JfNTk4MDc4OF8xOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Texas the largest bitcoin factory in the US will consume the equivalent of half a nuclear reactor,"Finally we are able to enter the inner sanctum: on twenty rows and nearly 300 meters long with a deafening noise 23000 computers are running at full speed. All the same all with the same program all connected to each other with two fans each. The mass effect is such that the computers cause a current of air which comes in cool from the outside through cells and is expelled hot into a cooling room and escapes through the roof.

Here we are at Whinstone in the largest bitcoin mining factory in the United States in Rockdale a small rural town in the heart of Texas between Houston and Austin. Mining is the work of running the huge decentralized bitcoin transaction system. In return miners get free bitcoins which makes their fortune: 16 bitcoins a day in February with a total of 38300 computers. In total the company has accumulated 5783 tokens a jackpot of about $230 million (208 million euros) with a bitcoin price of $40000.

The man behind the plant that broke ground in early 2020 is Whinstone CEO Chad Harris who arranges a tour of the facility. There are seven warehouses like the one we're visiting three of which are under construction. In one of them there is an experimental system: computers have been submerged by the thousands into a special oil which reduces how much they heat up and increases their efficiency. It is a curious contrast to see these computers immersed in liquid running silently. But that doesn't stop them from consuming energy. Eventually Whinstone will grow from 300 megawatts of electrical capacity to 700 megawatts almost as much as half an atomic reactor. ""It's not a nuclear power plant but it's a lot of energy"" says Chad Harris. In these days of global warming no one cares in Texas. There is abundant gas there which is used to generate electricity and Chad Harris turns the energy into bitcoins.

A paradoxical situation

His journey resembles that of America's adventurous entrepreneurs where the truth seems more beautiful than any legend. Chad Harris was selling pre-decorated Christmas trees in New Orleans Louisiana but in the course of his business he fell out with his bank which froze his accounts in 2014. ""I never missed a payment. I didn't like having my accounts frozen"" he tells us in a prefab nicknamed ""the White House"" which serves as his office. He called his son a teenage bitcoin fan and off they went embarking on the adventure of mining bitcoins cryptocurrencies that are supposed to be able to escape the grip of any authority. They started their business in New Orleans but it didn't take off. Not enough energy too many taxes too much bureaucracy in Louisiana. He then looked to neighboring Texas and in mid-2019 saw press reports about the misfortune of a competitor.

Paloma Arciniega is one artist chosen out of around 60 applicants to create a mural inside the office space on the theme “What does LA mean to you?”

“There’s a lot of artists in LA” said Arciniega putting the finishing touches on her mural. “LA is a dream maker but it’s also a dream crusher.”

Arciniega’s mural depicts three musicians showing not only the joys of music but also the despair that artists can experience in pursuing a career in the arts. For Arciniega her portrait of Swedish multi-instrumentalist Gunhild Carling gives the mural an ultimately triumphant message.

“I think it’s very powerful just as a woman the way she shows up in front of a band of all men every time and she’s just like [triumphant growl]!”

Arciniega said she was inspired seeing the other artists working around her creating their pieces which cover a wide range of topics cultural influences and techniques.

Silverstein Properties the New York-based real estate developer who took ownership of the U.S. Bank Tower in 2020 started the installation project. He has already been doing similar art projects in New York.

Melanie Navas of Silverstein Properties says the art installation is all part of revamping the building and connecting to the surrounding communities.

“Part of that was kind of reimagining what an office building means to people and that it can be a creative space” Navas said. “Like arts and culture and dance and music can all come together.”

The U.S. Bank Tower is a commercial office building housing law firms financial institutions and as Navas explained the average Angeleno has had little access to the view from the 72nd floor.

“It was really amazing to come up here on the top floor nonetheless and be able to paint and do their art up here” Navas said.

For Arciniega it has been an emotional experience creating work in a unique location along with other artists she respects.

“We all have that struggle of people don’t want to pay us they don’t appreciate us and then suddenly ‘We appreciate you! We want people to see this!’ It’s...I cried” she said with a smile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWNrZWQuY29tL2FydGljbGVfMzM0ODdfYmFjay10by10aGUtZnV0dXJlcy1kaXJ0eS1lYXN0ZXItZWdnLWhpZC1hLWJlaGluZC10aGUtc2NlbmVzLWpva2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Back To The Future's Dirty Easter Egg Hid A Behind-The-Scenes Joke,"Back to the Future is full of easter eggs; from “Twin Pines” mall becoming“Lone Pines” following Marty McFly’s journey to the past to the entire movie serving as a psychological allegory for Marty’s raging sexual anxieites. And speaking of sex ever notice that Hill Valley is the home of a broken clock tower an aerobics gym and … a 24-hour porno theater?

Universal Pictures

In 1955 the Essex Theater was showing a Ronald Reagan cowboy picture abd in 2015 it was showing the 19th Jaws movie that we sadly never got in real life. But in 1985 the Essex was a straight-up porno theater showing something called Orgy American Style – which we’re guessing featured neither Reagan nor a giant rubber shark.

It turns out Orgy American Style is a real X-rated movie from 1973 apparently about a “voluptuous and sultry foxy owner of a pirate radio station.” And it was likely chosen for the marquee seen in the movie as part of an extremely deep-cut joke. Remember when Marty makes it back to 1985 he encounters a guy named “Red” the unhoused gentleman thoughtlessly blocking an advertisement for California Raisins?

Red is played by a guy named George “Buck” Flower who also appeared in ‘80s movies like They Live and Starman and before that he was in … Orgy American Style. Yup although credited as “Buck La Fleur” Flowers was in the porno playing in the theater from Back to the Future. We’re guessing that this inside joke was probably the handiwork of the production designer or another crew member because co-screenwriter Bob Gale once claimed that he didn’t even know if Orgy American Style was a real movie or not. No word if anyone in the cast or crew was involved with the live sex show from the alternate universe 1985.

Customers can also view additional information such as the estimated time of restoration and steps to take when under an advisory.

Megan Hannah Senior Manager Government and External Affairs told MetroNews that customers have requested a map similar to what electric utility companies use.

“All the information that is on the map is information that has been available to our customers but never in such a way that is so easy for our customers to be able to search by their address to determine if they are in an area of a boil order advisory or an outage” Hannah said.

Hannah said launching the map is part of the company’s way to improve its customer system for alerts making it more user-friendly. WVAWC has recently upgraded its customer dashboard with new tools to check and schedule service.

“If you see water going down your street on your neighborhood or if you turn on a faucet and water is not coming through you can easiliy go online and report those outages rather than calling the 800 number and maybe waiting on hold for a period of time” Hannah said.

WVAWC said its customers are encouraged to log onto MyWater and update their account information allowing the company to reach them as needed for any updates specifically related to their property.

“We are committed to providing exceptional customer service and are continually seeking ways to improve our communication around outages and advisories” said Chris Carew vice president of Operations at West Virginia American Water in a release.

“This customer advisory map is a helpful tool that allows customers to view events happening in their area that may impact their water service.”

Hannah said a person does not have to be a customer to access the map.

Chances are the Great Salt Lake is part of your daily life even if you don’t live in Utah.

If you pop open a can of soda in the United States it more likely than not contains magnesium harvested from the Great Salt Lake which gives the container its strength. The fruit vegetables and almonds you buy at the grocery store were likely grown with potash fertilizer produced from material in the lake’s salty water too. And with the lake’s two largest mineral companies ramping up to harvest one of the world’s hottest commodities — lithium — bits of the Great Salt Lake soon could be found in your phone laptop and car battery.

And the revenue the state collects from minerals like lithium will also be used to shore up the imperiled lake’s health.

“We know from the science that there [are] fairly large amounts of lithium in the lake” said Rep. Timothy Hawkes R-Centerville. “It has been mined in the past but it wasn’t commercially viable.”

Lithium is the lightest metal in the periodic table and it’s used in all kinds of things. It makes glass and ceramics stronger. It’s a handy component in car parts and vehicle greases since it holds up well in extreme temperatures. It’s a mood stabilizer that helps treat bipolar depression. It also helped create the hydrogen bomb. It’s in pool chemicals air scrubbers polymers and refrigerants.

“It’s used in a multitude of very mundane things that no one ever considers” said Brian Jaskula a mineral commodity specialist who has researched lithium for the U.S. Geological Survey since 2008.

For decades the United States was the largest producer of lithium with the bulk of it coming out of a hard rock mine in North Carolina. Then a small fertilizer company called SQM in Chile’s Salar de Atacama salt flat borrowed a form of lithium extraction first pioneered in Nevada.

The method “mines” materials from salt brine. That mineral-rich water is held in shallow ponds which evaporate and concentrate its resources.

Ogden's 55000-acre solar evaporation pond complex produces salt sulfate of potash and magnesium chloride from the Great Salt Lake.

“In order for them to be economic and achieve the lowest production costs they have to be blessed with a nice hot dry environment” Jaskula said of brine mineral harvesting. “And the Salar de Atacama is the driest place on Earth.”

Evaporative extraction of lithium proved more cost-effective than hacking it out of a mountain since the sun does most of the work. By the 1990s SQM was able to sell its lithium at half the price of traditional mines.

“As a result hard rock wasn’t able to compete” in the U.S. Jaskula said “so they all went out of business.”

Why lithium works well in computers smartphones and electric vehicles

Around the same time consumer electronics became more widespread. Manufacturers soon realized lithium was an especially useful ingredient for making batteries.

“It has this outer electron it really wants to get rid of” Jaskula said. “Because of that reactivity … it has the benefit of having a lot of innate energy in it as well as being very light.”

Lithium-ion batteries are now prolific in computers and smartphones. But in recent years one product in particular is driving a surge in demand for the mineral: electric vehicles.

In 2015 batteries eclipsed glass and ceramics as the dominant end-use of lithium and that use continues to mushroom. Last year 74% of the world’s mined lithium went to batteries. By 2030 CNBC reports more than 90% of lithium demand will likely be fueled by electric vehicles.

Sometimes referred to as “white gold” by investors the price of lithium ballooned from just over $6000 per metric ton in 2012 to $17000 last year according to USGS estimates. But the true cost of lithium is known only by peddlers and buyers of the product Jaskula said and it may be selling for much more.

“The last half of this decade the demand is going to be in excess of what production can come up with” he said. “There’s this mad scramble for all these existing operations to expand their capacity and for new mines to come online.”

China consumes the most mined lithium in the world. It has contracts for up to 95% of the lithium mined in Australia making that nation the largest producer of the material followed by Chile.

“Even the most unimpressive lithium operation if there’s even a chance it will become economical China will make a deal” Jaskula said. “They’re the No. 1 battery maker now and their mega-factories are going to be increasing at a logarithmic growth rate.”

U.S. lags in lithium production

Electric vehicles are steering China’s insatiable appetite for lithium Jaskula said. They’re also a key component in President Joe Biden’s efforts to modernize infrastructure and combat climate change in the United States. The U.S. Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy announced in February a $5 billion investment to build out a charging network across the nation’s highways.

But the U.S. lags in domestic production of some of the crucial materials including lithium needed to build a greener future.

Compass Minerals produces salt plant nutrients and magnesium chloride for application primarily in North America. Ogden's 55000-acre solar evaporation pond complex produces salt sulfate of potash and magnesium chloride from the Great Salt Lake.

A number of companies and organizations throughout the nation are experimenting with innovative ways to economically extract lithium including a geothermal project at California’s Salton Sea. Still the USGS reports only one viable domestic operation: a brine extraction mine at Nevada’s Silver Peak that’s been in business since the 1960s.

Because it’s currently the nation’s only lithium mine USGS doesn’t share data about Silver Peak to protect proprietary information. But The New York Times reported last year the outfit extracts about 5000 tons annually. That’s a mere drop in the bucket of worldwide lithium production which USGS pegged at 100000 tons last year.

The Biden administration meanwhile announced last month that it’s pouring $30 million into research to help U.S. companies source local sources of lithium cobalt nickel and other critical elements for green technologies. The supply issues the nation faced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic were apparently a wake-up call.

“Because of the way the market is going now” Jaskula said “the U.S. and other countries are finally bringing back mineral refining capacity.”

Enter the Great Salt Lake.

How the Great Salt Lake is getting in the lithium game

Utahns have extracted minerals from the Great Salt Lake since at least 1847 when a group of pioneers gathered 125 bushels of crude salt from its shores. Today it contributes more than $1 billion to the state’s economy.

One of the lake’s largest mineral harvesters Compass Minerals in Ogden got its start in the late 1960s as Lithium Corp of America. The company quickly realized fertilizer was a more profitable venture at least at the time. It’s now the largest producer of sulfate of potash in the Western Hemisphere a nutrient used to grow a variety of produce including grapes potatoes and nuts.

But Compass is going back to its roots and investing in lithium once again.

Ogden's 55000-acre solar evaporation pond complex produces salt sulfate of potash and magnesium chloride from the Great Salt Lake.

In October the company announced it had successfully converted lithium brine into battery-grade lithium carbonate. Compass expects to send its lithium product to the market by 2025 according to a news release and it currently has two lithium chiefs on its nine-member executive team.

Compass CEO Kevin S. Crutchfield said the company’s Great Salt Lake operation has a “2.4 million ton lithium brine resource.” It plans to generate up to 25000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium each year with as much as 65% of production sourced from brine Compass already has evaporating in its 55000 acres of ponds.

Across the lake in Tooele County US Magnesium has produced its namesake mineral from Great Salt Lake brine for half a century. It’s virtually the only magnesium mine in North America (China accounts for about 75% of the global magnesium supply according to USGS) and 50% to 75% of the cans and certain car parts manufactured in the U.S. likely have magnesium that originated in the Great Salt Lake.

In recent years the company has had an eye on a second product.

“About 10 years ago we started recognizing the value of the lithium” said Tom Tripp a Tooele County Council member and director of technical services for US Magnesium.

(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) US Magnesium seen across the Great Salt Lake from Stansbury Island on Saturday March 26 2022.

Rather than pulling more water out of the desiccated Great Salt Lake the company is using its own mining waste where lithium is concentrated as a byproduct.

“This was a residue that had no commercial value to us at the time” Tripp said “so it got stacked in the backyard and accumulated for 50 years.”

In 2018 US Magnesium quietly broke ground on a lithium production facility. The plant now has the capacity to produce 10000 tons a year according to a brief post on the company’s website.

Tripp sees future potential for the mineral beyond car batteries.

“Someday if you’re going to get into solar power in a real [utility-scale] way … you’ve got to be able to store a lot of power to get you through the dark” he said. “You’ve got to have massive battery banks.”

How will mining impact the struggling Great Salt Lake?

The Great Salt Lake hit a record low last summer and with Utah’s prolonged and persistent drought there’s little relief in sight.

State lawmakers toured the lake via a helicopter in February taking in its vast parched lakebed. They passed a slew of water conservation bills in response. Among them was HB157 sponsored by Hawkes which creates a special account for the Great Salt Lake ensuring the royalties collected from mineral extraction are reinvested to improve the lake’s health.

“Where the lake has such significant needs” Hawkes said “let’s protect the resource generating the revenue.”

(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) The shore of the Great Salt Lake on Stansbury Island on Saturday March 26 2022.

It’s unclear how much of a windfall lithium mining will generate for Great Salt Lake restoration since extraction of the mineral is still in its early stages. But royalties from current brine-harvesting operations generate between $5 million and $13 million each year according to Laura Vernon Great Salt Lake coordinator for the Utah Department of Natural Resources.

“They’re still working hard at generating lithium and becoming profitable” Vernon said. “It would be a great bonus a tremendous asset but I couldn’t say how much.”

Before Hawkes’ bill created a Great Salt Lake account royalties from its minerals went to things like keeping the state Fairpark afloat reopening national parks when the federal government shut down and rehabilitating sage grouse habitat. Hawkes said the mineral companies lobbied lawmakers to keep that revenue local before the lake’s ecosystems — and its industries — collapse.

“They’ve long felt ‘Geez we pay all these royalties to the state and now the source is at risk” Hawkes said.

The push for more domestic sources of minerals comes with risks to natural resources like the Great Salt Lake. Proposed lithium mines across the country face protests and legal battles from nearby communities and native tribes who fear increased pollution and depletion of precious water resources.

While solar evaporation mining is touted as more environmentally sound than typical hard rock or open pit mines it isn’t without impacts.

US Magnesium formerly called Magnesium Corp. was once dinged as the largest polluter in the nation. Its emissions discolored cars and gave workers headaches brittle hair and respiratory problems according to a High Country News report from 1996.

Just last year the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached a settlement with the plant over illegal hazardous waste disposal. The agency required US Magnesium to build a barrier wall that prevents leaks to the Great Salt Lake along with a filtration plant at a cost of at least $37 million.

“It’s laudable to say we should be doing our own extraction for the things that we’re going to use” said Aimee Boulanger executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance or IRMA. “However ... it’s not like we’re going to be doing the extraction of lithium from affluent communities who are driving their brand-new electric vehicles.”

Ogden's 55000-acre solar evaporation pond complex produces salt sulfate of potash and magnesium chloride from the Great Salt Lake.

Since 2006 IRMA has worked with mining industries to develop a standard for responsible mineral development that assesses environmental impacts fair labor and social responsibility for mines. Mining and end-use companies volunteer to adopt all or part of the standard. IRMA finalized its list of more than 400 best practices in 2018 and began auditing mines in 2019. Lithium brine operations in South America were among the first mines to sign up for an assessment.

“They know the expectation is they’re supposed to be selling themselves as part of a climate-stressed world solution” Boulanger said. “You didn’t have to convince them.”

While Boulanger said she hasn’t heard from any Great Salt Lake operations so far the industry causing lithium demand to soar — car manufacturing — is getting on board with sourcing their materials from mines meeting IRMA requirements. BMW was the first carmaker to join IRMA in 2020. Mercedes-Benz Ford GM and Volkswagen have since followed and Boulanger said another U.S.-based manufacturer is set to announce its partnership next week.

“There’s a shared sense as we move to a needed transition on energy fuels that we all still need to be looking at the impacts” Boulanger said. “... We need to make sure that our solutions don’t cause more problems than they were set to solve.”

Dix

As NATO and the United States rally to the defense of Ukraine citizens and corporations are joining together to support Ukrainian citizens in their fight against Russia.

AMETEK a global company with a major presence in Kent and northeast Ohio is among those leading the charge.

When I caught up with Matt French senior vice president and general manager of the Advanced Motion Solutions division in Kent Matt was in Bonndorf a community in southwest Germany meeting with Uwe Lorenz managing director of Dunkermotoren a company AMETEK acquired in 2012.

The plant is led by Lorenz who reports to French and one of the topics on their agenda was their ongoing support for the Ukrainians an initiative started in the community by two employees in their plant that employs 1000 workers.

The Dunkermotoren employees had hoped to fill one semi-truck with blankets groceries diapers medical supplies clothing and other basic living supplies through an appeal they made in Bonndorf a small Black Forest community of about 7000 people.

To their astonishment they ended up garnering enough donations to fill three semi trailers some 45 tons in all. The much-needed relief was supplied to a local charity in Ukraine which took over distributing supplies to the victims of the Russian attacks.

Included in the donations were six tons of clothing 13800 liters of drinking water 3100 tons of powdered milk 13 tons of food two tons of baby diapers one ton of over-the-counter medicines and two tons of bedding. The team of two employees quickly became a team of five and then grew to more than 100 volunteers.

AMETEK’s Bonndorf and Czech Republic plants are also in the process of employing Ukrainian refugees.

“We already have hired several new colleagues in the Czech plant and it has worked out very well for everyone. We are excited to have Ukrainian refugees joining our workforce and becoming part of the community” French said.

AMETEK whose 18000 employees work in more than 150 production facilities around the world has earmarked a considerable donation from the AMETEK Foundation for charities that are providing food shelter and medical supplies to Ukrainian refugees.

Locally area readers should know that AMETEK is assisting a Kent State University graduate student Lydia Lisowsky a second generation American-Ukrainian whose father is an AMETEK employee.

Lisowsky has established a goal to fill 3000 medical kits for soldiers in Ukraine by collecting supplies donated throughout the community. Lisowky’s cousin Paul Jatsyshyn told KentWired that her grandparents Eugene and Ingrid Lydia Nebesh fled Ukraine during World War II and found refuge in America.

“I feel a duty to help the country that has given me so much brightness” Lisowsky said in the interview.

She is modeling her kits after those created by Plast Ukraininan Scouting-USA in which she holds a membership. Placing collection bins for medical supplies located in strategic sites in White Hall Dunbar Hall and Tri -Towers Lisowsky picks up the donations. Community members can contribute by either donating money or buying supplies directly. Plast Scouts then package and send the kits to Poland and finally to Ukraine to meet the needs of soldiers and those surviving the horrific Russian bombing attacks.

French said that AMETEK is donating refreshments to the student volunteers and Plast Scouts during the assembly process and volunteering an AMETEK box truck to make sure the medical supplies get to the proper location. French and his wife have also personally donated medical supplies for the kits.

Lorenz said Germans are just as astonished over the outbreak of a war in Europe as Americans.

A family man with children ages 10 and 13 Lorenz said he is worried about Europe. After 77 years of relative peace he said “We did not even imagine a war could break out in Europe.”

Recognizing the plight of the Ukrainians Germany has opened its doors and set up a responsive organizational approach to settling the Ukrainians in situations where they meet and interact with Germans.

“We want them to fully integrate and not be left in isolation to themselves"" Lorenz said.

AMETEK is a leading global provider of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices providing differentiated solutions to support its customers’ challenging applications. The company’s products can be found in a wide range of end markets including aerospace medical research power industrial automation and advance measurement applications around the world.

There’s the vegan punk rocker with a soft spot for kittens and botanicals who fearlessly strolls into a local florist shop and presses his nose into a sunny bouquet. There’s the hot-rod racing granny who’s also an electrical engineer. There’s an ice sculptor a dog walker and a suburban mom with a talent for chopping wood.

The message? Despite your severe asthma Tezspire can help you “be you.”

The eclectic lineup of CGI characters made their TV debut last week in the companies’ first DTC commercial for the drug. We see them embracing their authentic lives unafraid of pet dander cold air pollen or other potential asthma triggers presumably thanks to taking Tezspire.

The “Be You” campaign was born out of patient insights showing that unpredictable asthma attacks and “triggers that come out of nowhere” can prevent people from being their true selves said Kate Tansey Chevlen Amgen’s sales and marketing head for Tezspire.

The diverse cast whose bios appear on the Tezspire website is also a nod to the drug’s label and its ability to help a broad range of severe asthma patients. The ad emphasizes that “no matter what type of severe asthma you have Tezspire can help”—playing up what analysts see as the drug’s competitive advantage.

Tezspire is indicated for severe asthma regardless of the cause of inflammation setting it apart from Sanofi and Regeneron’s heavily advertised blockbuster Dupixent GlaxoSmithKline’s Nucala and other biologics on the market that target eosinophilic forms of the disease.

The companies chose animation to further stand out among those other brands said Elizabeth Bodin AZ’s vice president for respiratory and immunology in the U.S.

“These fun characters come to life in a really vibrant way” she said allowing Tezspire’s message to “break through the noise in what we know to be a rather crowded category.”

The companies have launched a “360 surround sound” campaign airing ads on digital platforms including cable and connected TV audio and social media channels including TikTok. They’re also testing the waters with gaming and weather apps the latter of which have been largely untapped by pharma.

Asthma patients often turn to weather apps to check pollen counts or humidity levels “so we know that patients are there” said Chevlen. “We’re excited to see what kind of engagement we get there.”

AZ and Amgen launched Tezspire in January after winning FDA approval for the monoclonal antibody last December as an add-on treatment for severe patients 12 and older. Before the DTC campaign AZ and Amgen ran an unbranded awareness campaign tapping E! host Nina Parker to help patients learn how to “break the cycle” of uncontrolled asthma though it was not directly linked to Tezspire.

Analysts have pegged peak sales of the drug at $2.5 billion in 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZjc3Rhci5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy92Y3MwMjUzNjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lorraine Henwood Obituary,"Lorraine Henwood

Lorraine passed away peacefully in her home surrounded by loved ones on March 25 2022 after a long fought battle with cancer. Lorraine will be lovingly remembered by her two sons David and Douglas their wives JoJo and Rebecca and her granddaughters Harper Whitney and Romy. She is also survived by her four siblings and their families relatives and grandchildren to be. Lorraine was preceded in death by her husband Don Douglas Henwood.

Lorraine was born on June 17 1960 in New Jersey. She was the middle child of 5. Her younger years were spent moving around due to her dad's (aka Pop) employment. They spent a period of time in Lincoln Nebraska where she became a big Cornhuskers fan. They eventually settled in Thousand Oaks California where she spent most of her life and called it home.

In early adulthood she had two sons that she raised before getting a job at Amgen as a project manager. When Lorraine retired from Amgen she went on to spend time outdoors exercising competing in triathlons taking long bike rides and enjoying her passion of hiking and backpacking. She did many hikes with her family and friends but she also enjoyed solo hikes. She conquered Half Dome Mt. Whitney and multiple sections of the Pacific Crest Trail. In recent years Lorraine became very interested in the history of The Mother Road Route 66. She did various trips both with her friends and solo driving and visiting iconic landmarks on Route 66. She always enjoyed trying new and interesting foods camping jeeping and most of all spending time spoiling her grandkids. No matter what Lorraine did she always experienced it to the fullest and had a blast doing it.

Lorraine will forever be remembered as an unaimed arrow because an unaimed arrow always hits its mark.

Family and Friends are invited to celebrate Lorraine's life with us on Saturday April 30th 2022 at 10:00 AM at Conejo Memorial Park in the Chapel of the Islands. There will be a memory book at the service where the family would love for you to include stories and memories of Lorraine.

In a conventional EV battery wiring supports communication between each cell in the battery pack and an electronic control unit (ECU) which regulates its operation to ensure that it provides power to the vehicle.

This requirement for communications inside the battery reflects the complex architecture of a large battery pack: it is made up of modules each of which contains multiple cells. Natural production variations mean that each cell has individual characteristics that vary within a specified tolerance range. To maximise battery capacity lifetime and performance the key parameters of battery operation—voltage charge/discharge current and temperature—need to be monitored and logged individually for each module. This is the job of the cell monitoring units in the BMS.

But the data from each cell only become useful when they reach the BMS’s ECU which controls the way power is supplied to and drawn from the battery module by module and maintains the battery’s safety functions.

This is why an EV’s battery requires a means to transfer data from each module—where voltage current and temperature are measured—to the ECU’s processor. Traditionally these connections have been made with wires: wired connections have the advantage of being familiar and well understood.

It is not difficult to compile a long list of disadvantages: a copper wiring harness is heavy and occupies space that if filled by a battery cell would give extra energy capacity. Additionally the connectors can potentially suffer from mechanical failure. In other words wires increase development effort manufacturing cost and weight while also reducing mechanical reliability and usable space. This results in reduced driving range. Get rid of the wiring harness and the car manufacturer also gains new flexibility to design the form factor of the battery pack to fit the design requirements of the vehicle.

The complexity of a battery’s wiring harness also makes the assembly of a battery pack difficult and expensive: wired packs must be assembled and the connections terminated manually. This is a costly and hazardous process because high voltage EV battery modules are supplied charged. To maintain the safety of the assembly process and to protect production line workers rigorous safety protocols are applied.

In GM’s implementation of the wBMS technology the scalable architecture of the Ultium modules also helps lower the cost of the battery pack to GM. While the Ultium battery had its debut appearance in 2021 the modules will be deployed across the range of GM vehicles not only in heavy duty vehicles but also in all road cars from performance and premium cars to small vehicles. As Kent Helfrich GM executive director of Global Electrification and Battery Systems mentioned in a September 2020 press announcement  “Scalability and complexity reduction are a theme with our Ultium batteries—the wireless management system is the critical enabler of this amazing flexibility.”

The wBMS technology makes it easy to read out critical battery data from each intelligent module: this means that the condition of each battery module can be determined individually and wireless. This data can for instance provide information about the SOC and SOH of a module without connecting via cables to a test station. In combination with data from when the module was originally produced this allows the optimal usage of second life modules in their next application and the provision of a detailed set of specifications for each module on sale. The data’s ready availability increases the resale value of the modules.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMTYvcGFwZXItdGFwZS1yZWFkZXItc2VsZi1jYWxpYnJhdGVzLXNwZWFrcy11c2Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paper Tape Reader Self-calibrates Speaks USB,"Input devices consisting of optical readers for punched paper tape have been around since the earliest days of computing so why stop now? [Jürgen]’s Paper Tape Reader project connects to any modern computer over USB acting like a serial communications device. Thanks to the device’s automatic calibration it works with a variety of paper materials. As for reading speed it’s pretty much only limited to how fast one can pull tape through without damaging it.

While [Jürgen]’s device uses LEDs and phototransistors to detect the presence or absence of punched holes it doesn’t rely on hardware calibration. Instead the device takes analog readings of each phototransistor and uses software-adjusted thresholds to differentiate ones from zeros. This allows it to easily deal with a wide variety of tape types and colors even working with translucent materials. Reading 500 characters per second isn’t a problem if the device has had a chance to calibrate.

Interested in making your own? The build section of the project has all the design files; it uses only through-hole components and since the device is constructed from a stack of 1.6 mm thick PCBs there’s no separate enclosure needed.

AON President Abdulmunaf Sarina made the call in a statement on Friday while condemning the attack on some staff of Max Air in Abuja.

He lamented that some unruly passengers who assaulted the aviation workers due to a flight delay also destroyed some of the airline’s properties.

Sarina said this has further heightened the union’s concern and worry over the increasingly deplorable state of security and the rising threat to the lives of airline staff and their properties at the airports.

He described the airport vicinity as a sensitive and sacrosanct environment where people should not be allowed to behave in a callous and uncontrollable manner.

According to AON scribe a situation where passengers are allowed to have access into sensitive restricted areas of the airport and attack airline staff or prevent a plane from departing to other destinations because a particular flight is delayed or cancelled puts the country in a bad light in the international community.

He stressed that issues of delay or cancellation could be addressed in a civil manner without resorting to violence.

Sarina believes the unruly passengers that went after Max Air and destroyed its computer reservation systems further exacerbates the problem for other passengers going to other destinations.

He explained that AON understood the frustrations whenever a flight was delayed or cancelled and apologised to passengers on behalf of airlines for such delays or cancellations.

The AON president however stated that delays happen worldwide and there were conditions responsible for such incidents.

He warned that should there be a reoccurrence like that of Max Air the union might be forced to have a rethink on how to respond in such circumstances.

A recent software update for Apple's iPhones includes a ""pregnant man"" emoji as well as a number of other gender neutral cartoons.

Apple rolled out the update in mid-March according to the Wall Street Journal adding the pregnant emoji as well as a gender neutral ""person with crown"" emoji to go alongside the king and queen cartoons. Apple also added 35 other emojis.

Apple first rolled out the pregnant man and ""pregnant person"" emoji in January as part of an optional update but it came to all users with the iOS 15.4 update.

On Wednesday South Korea-based Jahwa Electronics said it would spend 191 billion won ($155 million) to build out new facilities capable of producing new optical image stabilisation actuators.

The OIS modules are rumoured to be destined for iPhones in the future AppleInsider reported.

According to The Elec Jahwa's OIS sensors are set to be shipped to LG Innotek for use in their own folded camera zoom modules.

LG is said to be the primary partner on Apple's plans to bring folded zoom cameras to its devices the report said.

Components from LG and Jahwa are likely related to a periscope camera setup which would allow Apple to enhance the optical zoom capabilities on iPhone.

A system based on periscope lenses or folding lenses increases the amount of optical zoom available on a device without significantly increasing the size of a camera setup.

The Elec has previously reported on Apple's apparent plans to bring a periscope system to a future Phone. Rumours about Apple's flagship getting a periscope-based lens system have surfaced occasionally since 2020.

“I’m a little busy right now but I support them so much” the That ’70s Show vet tells TV Insider. “I’m rooting for them. I wish them nothing but the best. And if the timing is right I’d never say no.”

Valderrama played Fez — short for Foreign Exchange Student — for the entirety of That ’70s Show‘s eight-season run on Fox from 1998 to 2006. He previously reunited with costars Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson on another Netflix sitcom The Ranch on which he recurred in Seasons 1 and 2 as ranch hand Umberto.

Cameras officially began rolling on the highly anticipated ’70s sequel series on Feb. 11. Leaked photos revealed returning series regulars Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp (aka Red and Kitty) mid-conversation at the Formans’ kitchen table which you can see here.

That ’90s Show picks up 15 years after the original series finale. The year is 1995 and Eric and Donna’s daughter Leia (played by Shut Eye‘s Callie Haverda) is “visiting her grandparents for the summer where she bonds with a new generation of Point Place kids under the watchful eye of Kitty and the stern glare of Red” according to the official logline.

As previously reported fellow OGs Topher Grace (Eric) Laura Prepon (Donna) Mila Kunis (Jackie) and Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) are expected to recur on the 10-episode offshoot — but when asked about a potential return on Sirius XM’s The Jess Cagle Show Grace answered “It’s all top-secret.”

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Avec le Plan Maroc Vert puis Generation Green le Maroc veut donner une nouvelle impulsion à l’activité à travers l’amélioration de la qualité et l’augmentation de la productivité et du rendement. Ces objectifs doivent être atteints en évitant d’avoir un effet négatif sur l’environnement. C’est pour cette raison que le gouvernement préconise l’encouragement d’une agriculture durable.

L’idée est d’opter pour une utilisation rationnelle des intrants notamment les produits phytosanitaires qui doivent répondre aux normes en vigueur. L’objectif est d’assurer la conservation des sols et de la biodiversité.

Mais le principal défi a trait à la gestion des ressources hydriques. Le Royaume est doté d’un climat semi-aride et se retrouve de ce fait dépendant des aléas climatiques avec une alternance des saisons pluvieuses et des années de sécheresse. L’exemple de la saison en cours est typique. Les mois de janvier et février 2022 ont été les plus secs des 30 dernières années accusant un déficit hydrique de plus de 65% par rapport à la normale.

A contrario le mois de mars et le début avril ont connu de bons niveaux de précipitation. Pour maîtriser ces contraintes le développement de l’irrigation est un choix stratégique que le Maroc a pris depuis l’indépendance. Mais ce choix a été un peu compromis par la sécheresse. Le Royaume dispose actuellement de 149 barrages d’une capacité de 193 milliards de m3. Dans le cadre du programme national d’approvisionnement en eau potable et d’irrigation 2020-2027 15 grands barrages sont en cours de construction totalisant des réserves de 43 milliards de m3. En dépit des efforts du pays pour mobiliser les ressources hydriques à travers la construction des barrages les disponibilités en eau demeurent insuffisantes pour répondre aux besoins notamment de l’agriculture qui monopolise pas moins de 80% des réserves.

A cet égard l’Etat veut développer les techniques assurant des économies et une utilisation efficiente de cette précieuse denrée comme l’irrigation localisée. Il est prévu d’augmenter le nombre des superficies utilisant cette technique de 50.000 hectares par an. Les superficies concernées totalisent actuellement 750.000 ha portant le cumul des terres irriguées à plus de 17 million d’hectares. Menés à titre individuel ou collectif l’Etat soutient les projets utilisant cette technique.

Depuis le forage et le cuvelage des puits les bassins de stockage d’eau jusqu’aux équipements des exploitations (installation des pompes d’eau des canalisations et autres conduites) tout un système d’aide est mis en place qui concerne également les travaux d’aménagement complémentaires. Les subventions publiques peuvent atteindre 80% du coût d’acquisition ou des travaux. Cette forme d’irrigation a permis de reconvertir plusieurs exploitations qui étaient essentiellement dédiées aux céréales vers des filières assurant plus de revenu pour les exploitants. L’idée est aussi d’assurer une bonne gestion de l’eau dans les zones à fort potentiel agricole mais subissant une forte pression sur les ressources hydriques comme Souss et Haouz par exemple. Il faut noter également que le secteur agricole consomme 7% de l’énergie nationale dont une partie est utilisée pour le pompage de l’eau.

Les exploitants se servent essentiellement de gaz butane subventionné pour irriguer leurs terres. Toutefois le pompage solaire gagne de plus en plus du terrain en raison de la baisse des prix d’acquisition des équipements et du coût de cette énergie. Plus compétitif qu’auparavant il est estimé en moyenne à 044 DH/m3 contre 098 DH/ m3 pour l’électricité 167 DH/ m3 pour le gasoil et 076 DH/m3 pour le butane. Actuellement près de 35.000 exploitations sont équipées de cette technique. Il est prévu de porter ce taux à 40% à l’horizon 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlcnVnYnluaXN0ZXJlLmZyL25ld3MvcnVnYnktbGUtdmVyZGljdC1lc3QtdG9tYmUtdm9pY2ktbGVzLWFmZmljaGVzLWRlcy1xdWFydHMtZGUtY291cGUtZGV1cm9wZS0xNzA0MjIxODQyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RUGBY.

The Met Gala Vogue's annual celebration of fearless fashion was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on Monday night. It's a big night for fashion and celebrities which include a number of athletes. Tom Brady Steph Curry Russell Westbrook Simone Biles Carmelo Anthony and other major sports stars have been invited in the past.

The theme for 2024 was ""Garden of Time"" to celebrate the opening of the ""Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion"" exhibit at the Met. Let's see how this year's chosen athlete-stars (the gala is by invitation only) interpreted that theme.

It seems fitting to start with Angel Reese the college basketball star who was drafted by the Chicago Sky in late April and is currently one of the biggest stars on the planet. She celebrated her 22nd birthday on Monday by making her Met Gala debut in a stunning low-cut seafoam green gown adorned with an ostrich feather tutu and embroidered tulle.

Serena Williams is retired from tennis but not fashion. She was a goddess swathed in gold lamé.

Her sister Venus Williams was also wearing gold but her dress was made of sequin paillettes the size of a quarter.

Lewis Hamilton looked vaguely like a villain from ""The Matrix"" in his all-black look complete with a black coat embossed with flowers.

The most talked-about look of the night came from Ben Simmons. He's still playing for the Brooklyn Nets (though you're forgiven if you hadn't noticed) but since they're not in the playoffs he was free to attend. He came solo wearing a black suit and black coat with panels of plaid fabric at the top and a vine down the side. The outfit wasn't bad but his literal interpretation of the ""Garden of Time"" theme involved a clock briefcase.

Are We Not Aroused?,"Watching the red carpet at Monday night’s Met Gala I couldn’t help but recall a prediction I’d heard from Emily Kirkpatrick who writes the Substack newsletter “I <3 Mess.” She’d told me recently that before the end of 2024 it’s possible that “someone is going to show up fully nude on a red carpet.”

That didn’t happen at this year’s gala but it got very close as Doja Cat — who appeared earlier this year at the Grammy Awards in what was called “the most naked dress ever” — presented at the Met Gala in a long clinging soaking wet transparent and entirely revealing white T-shirt by the label Vetements.

Near-nudity is everywhere at least on celebrities and the celebrity adjacent. Bianca Censori Kanye West’s 29 year-old partner wandered around Paris wearing a cropped jacket with sheer pantyhose and seemingly nothing on underneath her modesty preserved only by the stockings’ single center seam. Julia Fox attended a fashion launch with three silver medallions covering her private parts under a long — and frequently parted — trench coat.

But only a sliver of students are participating or view it as a top issue according to a new Generation Lab survey shared exclusively with Axios. Why it matters: The poll hints that the war — and the accompanying protests — might not hurt President Biden's election prospects among young voters as much as previously thought.

By the numbers: Only a small minority (8%) of college students have participated in either side of the protests the survey of 1250 college students found.

Students ranked the conflict in the Middle East as the least important issue facing them out of nine options.

It landed behind health care reform racial justice and civil rights economic fairness and opportunity education funding and access and climate change.

What they found: The survey found that three times as many college students blame Hamas for the current situation in Gaza than they do President Biden.

Some 34% blame Hamas while 19% blame Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 12% blame the Israeli people and 12% blame Biden.

Zoom in: A large majority (81%) of students support holding protesters accountable agreeing with the notion that those who destroyed property or vandalized or illegally occupied buildings should be held responsible by their university per the survey.

A majority also said they oppose the protest tactics: 67% say occupying campus buildings is unacceptable and 58% say it's not acceptable to refuse a university's order to disperse.

Another 90% said blocking pro-Israel students from parts of campus is unacceptable.

The other side: Students were still more likely to say they support the pro-Palestininan encampments than oppose them.

45% said they support them either strongly or a little bit. 30% were neutral and 24% were strongly or a bit opposed.

Zoom out: More than 2000 people have been arrested on campuses across the U.S.

Worth noting: A majority of people (58%) who participated in or favored protests against Israel said they would not consider being friends with someone who has marched for Israel.

Meanwhile 64% of those who participated in a pro-Israel protest said they would still be friends with someone who has marched against Israel.

Methodology: This study was conducted May 3-6 from a representative sample of n=1250 students nationwide from 2-year and 4-year schools. The margin of error is +/- 2.7 percentage points. The Generation Lab conducts polling using a demographically representative sample frame of college students at community colleges technical colleges trade schools and public and private four-year institutions.

Datasets and data pre-processing

In this study the window level and window width were set to clearly observe the liver on CT (window level: 50 window width: 180)23. Figure 1 shows the result of the window setting. Furthermore CT data had the same 512 × 512 in-plane resolutions but due to the computational limitation of the graphics card the image was resized to a resolution of 256 × 256. Finally the image and ground truth data had a shape of 64 × 256 × 256 × 1 and were divided into train: validation: test sets in the ratio of 70: 15: 15.

Liver segmentation using DALU-Net

The proposed model Deep Attention LSTM U-Net (DALU-Net) had an architecture similar to the standard U-Net consisting of an encoder and a decoder10. The encoder could extract more complex hierarchical features and obtain contextual information. The decoder deconvolutes the features extracted by the encoder to reconstruct the size of the volume reduced by the convolution operation. In addition it concatenates hierarchical features using the skip connection at every level of encoder and the decoder. Information about localization lost due to convolution and pooling layers in the encoder can be corrected and the network can segment objects more accurately. Figure 2 illustrated the DALU-Net architecture.

DALU-Net is a model that combines AM DS and CLSTM techniques. AM uses a module called attention gate (AG) to skip connections between the up-sampling layer and encoder. The CLSTM was used in the feature map from AG and was used only in the decoder. DS was used for fast convergence of the model and the loss is calculated at every level of the decoder and the final loss was calculated as the sum of each loss.

AM is commonly used for machine translation24 and classification in natural language processing and graph neural networks2526. Recently AM has been variously used in semantic segmentation and classification tasks27. AM has demonstrated improved accuracy in the medical image11132829. In the image segmentation and classification task the AM was designed to generate an attention map by analyzing the gradient of the output class score for the input image reduce the weight of the background by multiplying it with the input image and focus on the object. The details of the AM are shown in Fig. 3.

DS supervises the CNN's hidden layer in the segmentation task to speed up convergence and resolve the gradient-vanishing problem121730. The red arrow in Fig. 2 the loss is calculated using a sigmoid function for every level of the decoder and the final loss was determined by summing each loss. It has the advantage of allowing the final loss to converge rapidly by optimizing at each level. In this study DS was applied to the output values from the attention gate of each level.

Liver volumetry

The segmented liver area was calculated using the proposed model on the axial image. The liver volume was calculated for each image by multiplying the liver area and the section thickness. Thus the whole liver volume was estimated by adding the liver volume of all images.

Ground truth for liver segmentation and volumetry

The liver was manually labeled on all CT images under the supervision of a liver transplant surgeon with more than 5 years of experience in CT analysis related to liver transplantation. ImageJ software was used for manual segmentation (NIH Bethesda MD USA). For liver volumetry the calculated liver volume based on manual segmentation was used as the reference standard (as described in “Liver Volumetry” section).

Ground truth for left and right and caudate lobe

In this study a comparative analysis was performed for segmentation and volume measurements for the left right and caudate lobe regions according to the anatomical structure of the liver3132. The left lobe was defined as the upper region above the middle hepatic vein and the lower region was defined as the right lobe. The caudate lobe was located to the left of the inferior vena cava (IVC) without overlapping the left lobe in the coronal view3132. Figure 4 schematically illustrates the ground truth for the left lobe right lobe and caudate lobe.

Implementation details

The DALU-Net was implemented in Python 3.7 TensorFlow 2.1.3 Keras 2.3.1 and was run on four NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 5120 cores and 32 GB of memory. Our networks were trained using the Adam optimizer to minimize the dice loss3334. When the loss was not minimized over 10 epochs the learning rate was reduced by multiplying the initial learning rate by 0.1 with an initial value of 0.01. We terminated the process early when the loss did not improve for 30 epochs in the training procedure. Our network terminated the training procedure early in 90–150 epochs.

Evaluation metrics

We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach. The evaluation metrics included the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) intersection over union (IOU) and Hausdorff distance35. The DSC was defined as the volume of overlap between the CNN and manual labeling segmentations divided by the average of the segmentation volume of the two methods. The IOU was defined as a mathematical indicator of how much the two objects’ positions coincide. The Hausdorff distance was defined as the difference measured between two subsets of metric space.

Police said employees were closing the store for the night when the suspects a man and a woman arrived. The “open” sign was turned off and the doors were locked.

A man came up and kicked at the door before an employee made contact with him. Authorities said the man was then let inside by an employee as the woman waited outside.

The man made a purchase and left the store as the woman outside started to photograph some of the employee vehicles according to SAPD.

The employees asked the woman why she was photographing their vehicles and that’s when the man went inside of his vehicle and pulled out a firearm police said.

Officials said the man got closer to the victims and pointed his handgun in their direction. That’s when the victims went back inside of the store and called SAPD.

Anyone with more information on the suspects’ identities or whereabouts is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 210-224-STOP (210-224-7867).

Just a bit of history for those that aren’t familiar with Bulletproof Automotive. The California-based tuner is one of the best in the business. For over a decade their Nissan GTR builds have been the staple of the high-powered ludicrously good-looking GTRs that found their home all over the world. In recent years the company also expanded into the high-end detailing business offering these services to their customers through their sister company the Bulletproof Auto Spa. And even though the first project by them is not a Nissan GTR but a Tesla Model S Plaid it’s still a great showcase of their capabilities regardless.

The owner of this 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid wanted to create a unique-looking build and wasn’t afraid to take a risk in doing so. In turn the addition of the Avery Dennison Gloss Lightning Ridge exterior wrap gives the customer just want he wanted: a really unique look. With this wrap there isn’t a single angle in which the car doesn’t look different as the chameleon-like finish on this wrap adds such a gorgeous transition that this might be one of the most epic wraps we’ve installed to date.

The full name of this wrap is Avery SW900 Supreme ColorFlow Gloss Lightning Ridge Vinyl Wrapping Film. It’s a vehicle wrap film with a gloss color-shifting finish as you can see from this particular build. Lightning Ridge has a unique range of colors that shade shift and looks different in various lighting conditions. The film can be applied to your vehicle’s hood trunk roof mirrors door handles interior trim and dash panels chrome and metal parts motorcycle parts and just about any relatively non-porous surface. And Bulletproof Auto Spa did it all! The shop covered not just the exterior of this Tesla but also the door jambs and door shuts.

Besides the unique and gorgeous wrap the owner of this Tesla Model S Plaid opted-in for the XPEL Slate Smoke protection film on all the lights and the 360° window coverage in our premium ceramic window tint the XPEL Prime XR Plus. And since this Model S Plaid is going to Hawaii there is no doubt that the color-changing vinyl wrap will look spectacular under the Pacific sun creating a unique color combo from every angle. Damn impressive!

Of course the 2000-acre development is more than a multigenerational solution. It’s a vibrant neighborhood of single-family homes where nature and common outdoor spaces are abundant.

There are different homes for different stages in life. There are single-family detached homes estates on oversized lots for upsizing townhomes for downsizing and active living homes for adults 55-plus. That means you can have the grandparents a divorced parent and a blended family living all in the same community.

“It makes Trinity Falls feel like a village” says C’Ella Clayton Director of Marketing for the Houston-based developer Johnson Development Corporation. This is Johnson Development’s second DFW community; In 2012 they built the master-planned mecca Viridian in Arlington.

Chesmar Homes is one of six builders in Trinity Falls

Homebuyers can choose one of 100 floorplans from six different builders including Chesmar Homes Coventry Homes Del Webb Drees Custom Homes Highland Homes and Perry Homes. The homes will start in the mid-$300s and range up to $900000.

Clayton says the 30 townhomes they released in 2020 were so popular that Trinity Falls has increased its array of townhome floorplans by Highland Homes.

Coming this summer 200 new homes will be available for purchase and another 250 homes will come available in the fall Trinity Falls’ Clayton says. “This is great news since most new master-planned communities in the Collin County area are not delivering lots until the end of the year or next year” she says.

Located at the tip of McKinney near US 75 and the SH 5 split Trinity Falls could be described as the perfect intersection of nature and convenience. It’s nestled among 10 acres of hike and bike trails with a small lake and a northern fork of the Trinity River. Remember this is 2000 acres of previously undeveloped land. It runs parallel to 75 but Clayton says you don’t hear any road noise when you’re by the peaceful trails and lake.

Amenities here are plentiful. There’s The Club at Trinity Falls with a beach-entry-style pool splash pad and pavilion and The Basecamp with a playground and splash pad. The Lodge coming soon will have a fitness center bocce ball yard resort-style pool playground co-working space and event space with a catering kitchen that can house up to 100 people. Plus The Lodge will have a food truck alley for vendors to visit on weekends. There’s a nearby 21-hole disc golf course and Old Joe Dog Park.

The neighborhood was developed in 2015 by Castle Hills Partners and was purchased by Johnson Development Corporation in 2018. Already more than 1700 families live in Trinity Falls and when complete the neighborhood will house approximately 5000 homes. Next fall a new elementary school will open for Trinity Falls and surrounding neighborhood children.

The community has some interesting incentive programs for Realtors as well. Once an agent sells and closes two homes in Trinity Falls they are enrolled in their complimentary Realtor Academy program for a year which provides them priority registration for free continuing education (CE) classes quarterly luncheons and Realtor events. The well-attended events include festive themes such as Trails and Ales the Tour of Trees and the VIP Spring Preview.

BRENTWOOD Calif. (KGO) -- Police are investigating an unusual bank robbery attempt in Brentwood Sunday where they say a suspect used a tractor in attempt to break-in to an ATM.

An officer on patrol spotted the front loader abandoned near a Bank of America branch Sunday morning with the ATM mangled and in pieces.

Police believe the tractor was stolen from a nearby construction site.

""We can't even live safely in this community. People work so hard. They need to just work. Why are they stealing stuff?"" said Brentwood resident Soma Azizi.

Despite the damage no cash was taken.

A similar break-in also in Brentwood happened about a month ago.

In that one witnesses reported seeing a tractor tear the ATM from the front of a Wells Fargo branch.

The machine was found dumped about a 100 yards from the bank.

For example green bonds social bonds and sustainability bonds raise money for specific projects with environmental benefits while sustainability bonds cover both environmental and social issues. Sustainability-linked bonds however cover broader corporate-wide sustainability performance targets rather than a particular project.

“Green bonds are likely to retain their position as the largest segment of GSSS issuance. However we expect sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) to be the fastest-growing segment given the greater flexibility they offer issuers in terms of use of proceeds” Simrin Sandhu the bank’s executive director for credit research said in a report.

Standard Chartered Bank forecasts that global issuance of green social sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bonds will total US$1.7 trillion this year representing 52 per cent year-on-year growth. Deal volume is projected to reach US$4.2 trillion in 2025 accounting for around a third of all bonds issued.

Sustainable finance deals are expected to continue their galloping growth this year and beyond as the trend for companies to set environmental targets and investors’ appetite for such projects remain healthy according to bankers.

Analysts say this credit instrument is gaining traction in the market. Bank of America Global Research said more than US$30 billion worth of sustainability-linked bonds were issued globally in the first quarter of this year. Standard Chartered Bank’s report noted that sustainability-linked bonds showed the strongest rate of growth among all ESG bonds with total issuance soaring to US$109 billion in 2021 up from only US$11 billion the year before.

“The strong momentum in this segment reflects the greater flexibility offered by these instruments allowing issuers to advance their sustainability goals without having debt issuance proceeds ring-fenced for use in a specific project” Standard Chartered’s Sandhu said.

Despite the tighter credit environment caused by geopolitical risks and rising US interest rates the sustainable debt market has managed to maintain its growth. In the first two months of 2022 global ESG funds saw inflows of US$6 billion compared to US$75 billion in outflows for non-ESG funds according to the Bank of America.

Analysts said the growth extends to the Chinese market as government policies for carbon neutrality and investor demand spur more companies to hasten their sustainability investment.

Proceeds from Chinese green sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds rose 103 per cent year on year to US$82 billion in 2021 with US$47.4 billion in domestic bonds according to data from Refinitiv.

The onshore ESG bond market in China was strong in the first quarter with growth outperforming the global market according to Ping Luo head of Asia Pacific ESG Capital Markets at Bank of America.

“China’s onshore market is more shielded from US interest rate hikes and global market risks. Domestic policies and environments remain very supportive towards green bond products” Luo said.

“We started to see ESG issuances enjoy pricing advantages over conventional bonds in both primary and secondary markets. Government policies remain supportive [and] further unification of definition for green projects and further strengthening [of] disclosure requirements also provide more confidence to investors” Luo added.

Sustainability-linked bonds are still new in the mainland Chinese market with only six such bonds issued onshore last year according to Refinitiv. However Luo is confident that Chinese companies will catch up with the global trend as companies work to boost their sustainability profile.

“We expect more companies coming to the market with this product and there will be more sectors taking part. The companies need to already have established sustainability targets or net zero targets in order for them to be ready for this type of instrument. That’s something Chinese issuers are working on” Luo said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXJrc2hpcmVlYWdsZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYmVya3NoaXJlLWJhbmstbmFtZXMtc3ZwLXJldGFpbC1icmFuY2gtYmFua2luZy9hcnRpY2xlX2Q4ZmFkOWMyLWI1ZDctMTFlYy1hM2VmLThiNDM1ZDY1ZmZkYi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berkshire Bank names SVP retail branch banking | Business | berkshireeagle.com,"You have permission to edit this article.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms."

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Sen. Robert Nichols recently acquired most of Jefferson County through redistricting but it’s certainly not an unfamiliar area for the politician who graduated from Lamar University in 1968.

“I lived here for a number of years” Nichols said last week while speaking to the Rotary Club of Port Arthur. “I moved back to Jacksonville after college.”

It was there he married his high school girlfriend and began what would become a successful venture as a businessman.

“My wife and I instead of buying a house we bought a plastics machine” he said.

Nichols built four manufacturing facilities.

“We kept growing our little plastics businesses and I ended up with about 900 employees at four different factories” he said. “Two of them made medical devices sold all of the world.”

Eventually one was sold to Baxter International and the other three to Johnson & Johnson.

During his time in Jacksonville Nichols got involved in government through city council. After a successful run as a council member he then became mayor.

Before running for the Texas Senate in 2006 he served as the Transpiration Commissioner of Texas.

“I was appointed by then-Governor George W. Bush to the Transportation Commission” he explained. “I traveled all over the state. Rick Perry liked what I was doing and reappointed me for another six years. I was halfway through that and my state senator decided not to run. They encouraged me to run and I won.”

Redistricting

In October district lines were redrawn through a special legislative sessions. Nichols called it “one of the most difficult things you go through” because it disrupts established relationships. Following redistricting he said he lost close to 150000 constituents in and around Montgomery County.

“But the good news is I picked up a big chunk of Jefferson County so I’ve got all of Beaumont all three of the Mid County cities and part of Port Arthur” he said. “Brandon Creighton and I had been working together for 16 years. We’re great friends. He was a great House member. He’s a great Senate member. So the good news is you’ve got two of us who work closely together.”

Working with him is Jake Ellis who operates from the Jacksonville office and Jennifer Harris who began Monday establishing an office in Southeast Texas.

“(Harris will) be at a lot of events I can’t physically get to because my district is about 19 counties and a little under one million people” he said.

In the last few months before he officially becomes the local representative in January the team has been frequently traveling to Jefferson County to meet with county city and community leaders.

“What I’ve been trying to do is what I call real quality one-on-one like with your school superintendent” Nichols said of Mark Porterie. “We probably spent several hours with him going over the issues that y’all have. Y’all have a great superintendent. I’ve got about 100 school districts and he’s outstanding.”

Nichols explained the role his office will play for Southeast Texas residents.

“While mayor and on city council I was astounded with how much the state touched my little community” he said. “There we were Jacksonville Texas. A town of about 15000 out in the woods 30 miles away from anybody else. Yet the state was touching us everywhere. (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) our landfills our wastewater our freshwater the department of state health services our hospitals our nursing homes the department of aging mental health issues. And those are the kinds of things I’ll be able to help y’all with.”

He gave an example of an older woman currently struggling to get her driver’s license renewed after an extended period of time.

“To do that you have to get your birth certificate but she was born at home 80-something years ago” he said. “She never really had a birth certificate. Yet I’ve known her all my life. A person in our office is working their way through that. In the meantime she’s driving with an expired license and a letter from a state senator saying ‘we’re working on getting it.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJheHRlcmJ1bGxldGluLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2NvcnBzLWluc3RhbGxzLW1ldGVycy1hdC1idWxsLXNob2Fscy1ub3Jmb3JrLDI3Mjc50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corps installs meters at Bull Shoals Norfork,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://www.baxterbulletin.com/stories/corps-installs-meters-at-bull-shoals-norfork,27279 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJheHRlcmJ1bGxldGluLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2NvcnBzLWluc3RhbGxzLW1ldGVycy1hdC1idWxsLXNob2Fscy1ub3Jmb3JrLDI3Mjc50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYWwuY29tL2VuLXphL25ld3MvYmF4dGVyLXRvLWthaXplci1jaGllZnMtZmFucy1hbWFraG9zaS1oYWQtbm8tcHNsLXN1Y2Nlc3Mtd2l0aG91dC1tZS9ibHRkYWY1ZjllNTE2ZDJlMjll0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baxter to Kaizer Chiefs fans: Amakhosi had no PSL success without me,"The tactician is under pressure after the Soweto giants fell to Matsatsantsa on Saturday in their PSL outing

Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has bragged he is the only coach who has brought the club success in the last 20 years and suggested it is illogical to call for his exit after a loss to SuperSport United.

Amakhosi had come to the FNB Stadium hoping to impress the fans who were allowed back to the stands for the first time since March 2020.

However a second-half strike by Thamsanqa Gabuza hurt the club's chances of finishing in second place on the PSL table and ensured their fans witnessed a disappointing 1-0 loss instead.

The supporters were not impressed by the result and apart from booing their coach they called for his sacking which did not amuse the Englishman.

""I don’t have any message to the fans because if they want me to go I’ll go"" Baxter said as quoted by iDiski Times.

""If the chairman says to me I don’t think you’re doing a good job then I’ll walk. I’ve got no problem doing that. I will walk myself if I don’t think I’m affecting the team in a positive way I’ll walk not a problem.

""I’m the only coach that has given this club any success in the last 20 years but I’ve got to go because we dominate the game and lose 1-0? I’ve got to listen to that?""

The 68-year-old went on to state the fans might be right to express their anger but they cannot decide his fate at the club since it is the management that can do that.

""It’s ok they're fans they have the right to say exactly what they want. If that reflects what the chairman thinks and what the players think and the majority of our fans think then maybe I should walk"" he added.

""But that’s nothing a group of fans will decide that’s something the football club or I will decide. If I get that feeling then of course I’ll walk. But at the moment I’m looking at it as a game we should’ve won but we didn’t and that happens in football.""

Baxter claimed he was the only coach who “has given this club any success in the last 20 years” insisting that the decision to axe him solely lay with management.

Amakhosi were not amused as SuperSport’s Thamsanqa Gabuza broke their hearts with a solitary strike leaving their club five points behind second-placed Royal AM. With the title almost decided Chiefs are chasing a second-place finish guaranteeing them Caf Champions League football next season.

“I don’t have any message to the fans because if they want me to go I’ll go” Kaizer Chiefs head coach Stuart Baxter told the media.

Buffett’s former three-bedroom home in the Dundee neighborhood of Omaha Nebraska is on the market for $799000 the Wall Street Journal reported. Buffett hasn’t lived in the home at 5202 Underwood Avenue for a long time but the sellers James and Nancy Monen are shareholders in Berkshire Hathaway.

The home’s best feature might be its rich history. Buffett and his then wife Susan rented the 3300-square-foot home for $175 a month. The sunroom is the founding site of Buffett Associates which garnered only slightly more than $100000 from investors.

Many of the assets of Buffett Associates merged into Berkshire Hathaway according to the Journal.

The Buffetts lived in the Underwood Avenue home for two years before paying $31500 for a different home in Omaha where Buffett still lives.

Those who don’t know the property’s history offhand will quickly discover it upon entering the house. Buffett came back to visit the home with two of his children in 2019 according to the Journal when he scribbled his signature and company name on the sunroom door.

The Monens purchased the property in 2005 for $397000. They told the Journal they had no knowledge of Buffett’s connection to the home at the time though James’ late uncle was an early investor with Buffett.

The home hit the market at a busy time for the area as the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting is slated to draw the eyes of the financial world into Omaha at the end of the month. However not everyone suspects the historic property will be enough to woo an out-of-town shareholder into buying.

“We also kind of have a gut feeling that the buyer might live in Omaha” Jessica Dembinski of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Ambassador Real Estate told the Journal.

Each show we highlight a different doctor/healthcare professional to come on our show and talk to us about their specialty. It has turned into one of our favorite segments. All of our doctors have exhibited a ""human"" side that people don't always get to see with their physicians. We encourage you to check out some of our past episodes here. We've done about 40 of these segments highlighting everything from Lyme disease to hernia repair to finding a health care plan and everything else in between. We've learned a lot and hope you can too.

Our guest this week was Dr. Abdullah Altayeh a pulmonary specialist that focuses on treating asthma and other chronic respiratory ailments.

Some of the questions addressed in this episode are:

How common is asthma?

What are some common early warning signs and symptoms of asthma?

What types of complications do people with asthma typically run into?

Does it affect their everyday life?

What are some risk factors for developing asthma?

How do you diagnose and treat asthma?

Like many of our guests on What's Up Doc? Dr. Altayeh had a wonderful bedside manner that you can tell would make his patients at ease while talking about a serious subject like treating an asthma case.

We thank Dr. Altayeh for his time during a bust schedule and look forward to our next guest on What's Up Doc?

Not only are there several different kinds – from mini dash cams to front-and-rear options and even dash cam mirrors – there are a surprising array of features too including sensors parking modes and different video resolutions.

It's not surprising then that many buyers look to keep things simple with a mini dash cam. These are ideal if you don't have much space to play with and they also tend to be cheaper than their more fully-fledged counterparts. But what are the downsides and drawbacks of these smaller dash cams? And which are the best ones out there? We've put together this guide to help you decide.

What is a mini dash cam?

The mini dash cam is a smaller and more compact version of a standard in-car camera which takes up less space and is usually less obtrusive too. Some of the more conventional dash cam models can be rather bulky and aren’t always as appealing to drivers with confined cockpits to contend with. A mini dash cam is just the opposite.

While any dash cam must be mounted so that it doesn’t interfere with your driving or obstruct your view through the windshield the benefit of a mini dash cam means there’s even less to worry about.

(Image credit: Future)

Whichever model you choose they mount in the same way are larger dash cams usually using a self-adhesive pad or a suction mount. The smaller dimensions of a mini dash cam means they can also hide away neatly behind your rear-view mirror.

But there are naturally some downsides. From a lack of bundled accessories and features to the absence of a display you'll need to weigh up whether that added convenience is worth the limitations of mini dash cams.

What are the downsides of mini dash cams?

Most mini dash cams have enough features and power for the average driver but their smaller designs do bring some compromises. Overall there are three main drawbacks to be aware of.

Firstly there's the common lack of a rear screen. Some models do have one (like the Garmin Dash Cam 67W below) but the chances are it’ll be a little on the small side. Luckily this isn't an issue for most drivers as they won't need to review footage on the device itself. Instead there's invariably a companion app that offers the ability to view footage on your smartphone as well as set up the dash cam. This will likely prove to be a more enjoyable experience in the long run.

A bigger limitation of mini dash cams is often their video quality. Because their lenses have been shoehorned into a smaller space you may experience a degree of fisheye distortion from the resulting video footage. If the camera has a less impressive resolution (another common limitation of small dash cams) then this could combine with the distortion to make it harder to make out details in your videos.

Some mini dash cams like the Garmin Dash Cam 67W do have a small screen on the back. (Image credit: Future)

That said an HDR (High Dynamic Range) mode can help compensate in harsh daytime sunshine as can buying a cheap polarizing filter to cut out glare. Both of these are possible on mini dash cams and this can have as big an impact on image quality as resolution and lens quality. Ultimately the better quality the footage the greater the chance you'll be able to use it in an insurance claim.

A third drawback is usually a lack of features compared to larger dash cams. For example our top choice – the Garmin Mini Dash Cam Mini 2 – doesn't come with GPS (so can't track your vehicle's speed) a hard-wiring kit or even a microSD card. That said you can sync it with a Garmin dash cam that has GPS via the Drive app.

Not all mini dash cams lack GPS either – a good middle-ground option is the Garmin Dash Cam 67W which has 1440p video recording wide 180-degree field of view GPS and voice control as well as a 2-inch LCD screen. There are even lane departure and forward collision warnings too.

So if you’ve been looking at standard-sized dash cams and think they’re too big and bulky searching for a mini dash cam could be the way forwards. This is especially the case if you drive a sports car with a small windscreen area. As we've discovered there are a few compromises to be had in terms of performance and features but if space-saving is the main consideration then a mini dash cam makes perfect sense.

What are the best mini dash cams?

(Image credit: Future)

If you need a basic dash cam that just does the fundamentals and hides away discreetly behind your rear-view mirror then the Dash Cam Mini 2 is our current top choice.

It’s small with dimensions of just 3.1 x 2.9 x 5.3 cm and weighs in at just 35g. But it still comes with most of the features and functionality you’ll need for monitoring the road ahead. There’s a 140-degree field of view and the video quality while only 1080p resolution is very good for its size.

Voice control also comes as part of the package which is a nice bonus though GPS is missing. If you want the Dash Cam Mini 2 to record videos while you're parked it's also worth noting that you'll need an always-on 12V cable or Garmin's Constant Power Cable (which isn't included). But the Garmin Drive app which is very polished and this is an important part of the experience with mini dash cams.

2. Thinkware F800 Pro A premium but powerful mini dash cam Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Video quality: 1080p Viewing angle: 140 GPS tracker: GPS Memory: 16GB-32GB internal microSD Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + GPS tracking + Good image quality + Useful night mode Reasons to avoid - Some features need hard-wiring - Pricey compared to rivals

Another slender dash cam worth investigating is the Thinkware F800 Pro. It's quite pricey but comes packed with clever features – and also offers a front-and-rear bundle which means you’ll be covered in case of a shunt from behind.

The feature set is strong with a stick-on low-profile design GPS tracking and good-quality HD footage. Wi-Fi connectivity means you can hook up your smartphone to the unit plus you get the benefit of a night mode for more effective recording after dark.

You’ll need to hard-wire the camera into your car if you want to make use of its neat Time Lapse Mode though which keeps a watchful eye on your car when you’re not in it overnight.

(Image credit: Garmin)

It isn't quite as compact as Garmin's Dash Cam Mini 2 but the 67W is still only about the size of a matchbox – and it offers a few more features for that higher price tag.

The main difference from Garmin's other compact dash cams is the wide 180-degree field of view (hence the 'W' in its name). This causes some fish-eye distortion but it's useful if you have a larger car or want a dash cam that can see right the way around the front of your vehicle.

The sensor's 1440p footage is crisp while an HDR (High Dynamic Range) function makes sure the footage remains high-quality even in tricky lighting conditions. That extra resolution over the Dash Cam Mini 2 can also be handy for punching into footage to pick out details like license plates.

Some features like the ability to check in your parked car remotely demand that the 67W is hard-wired into your car and connected to a Wi-Fi network. But if you want high-quality footage with a wide angle of view this a great mini dash cam.

A powerful compact front-and-rear dash cam bundle is the Thinkware Q800 Pro. This one packs 2K 1440p shooting quality GPS speed and location logging plus a Super Night Vision feature.

There’s a Sony Exmore R Starvis image sensor so the quality is excellent. Expandable up to 128GB there’s an included 32GB microSD card along with access to the Thinkware Cloud for quick and easy backups.

While Thinkware doesn’t always win everyone over with its supplementary app once you’re up and running the image quality and feature set is impressive.

Over six decades years Walmart Inc. has gone from one humble discount store in Bentonville Arkansas to a $555-billion-a-year retail behemoth. By comparison the world’s largest retailer beats mighty Amazon Inc. in annual global retail sales by more than $200 billion.

Walmart’s strategy has always been an aggressive pursuit of low prices. And today its massive logistics and supply chain networks and management strategies are studied at business management schools where the company is used to explain important concepts and also to address related social issues such as the company’s market dominance and reliance on cheap imported goods. (You might be surprised at how many people work at Walmart in each state and what they are paid.)

For the consumer Walmart’s focus on eye-catching bargain-basement prices is a powerful draw. But this aggressive pricing strategy has its faults. Economies of scale can only go so far in driving down prices before they begin to affect the quality and selection of products. (That said large-scale retail operations do sometimes sell top-flight products at good prices. Click here to see some surprisingly good Costco Walmart and Target products.)

To determine the products that you are better served buying elsewhere than Walmart 24/7 Wall St. reviewed articles on the subject appearing on MoneyWise Reader’s Digest BestLife Consumer Reports Business Insider CheatSheet and Alot Living. The list’s overall message can be summed up with the idiom “You get what you pay for.”

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Uneven quality In its effort to offer the lowest prices Walmart’s stock of televisions mixes in a lot of “you get what you pay for” duds. While higher-end models are often available you’re better off browsing and buying at a retailer that’s focused on selling home electronics and appliances.

[in-text-ad]

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Small selection and more expensive Walmart’s selection of white goods like refrigerators and washing machines is more limited than competitors in this product category. You’re better off heading directly to Best Buy Home Depot or regional chains with better selections and competitive prices.

Source: scyther5 / Getty Images 3. Vacuums

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Small selection and more expensive Like all home appliances at Walmart the selection of vacuum cleaners can be smaller than what you can find at a retailer that’s more dedicated to the sale of such items. Prices aren’t always better at Walmart for these items either.

Source: filadendron / E+ via Getty Images 4. Laptops

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Poor quality or more expensive Walmart’s dedication to its “Save Money” slogan can lead to a tradeoff in quality and durability. This is particularly true with its selection of laptops especially for more expensive models peppered in with its ample selection of low-end clunkers. A good rule of thumb: Don’t buy electronics from a place that also sells fruits and vegetables.

[in-text-ad-2]

Source: mailfor / iStock via Getty Images 5. Drones

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality more expensive on the high end Walmart’s website currently lists 38 drone models from several brands ranging in price from $150 to thousands of dollars. But that inventory is slim compared to the many options available online that offer more brands at the same price range.

Source: Savushkin / iStock via Getty Images 6. Professional-quality cameras

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Sales people aren’t knowledgeable As with electronics in general Walmart isn’t the best place to shop for high-end photographic equipment. The best option for them is to find a good camera store with knowledgeable staff where you’re more likely to receive the best customer experience (such places do still exist). Otherwise find a camera department at a national or regional retailer that focuses on consumer electronics.

[in-text-ad]

Source: Nastco / iStock via Getty Images 7. Video games

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Video games are increasingly purchased and downloaded online either through a digital distribution service like Steam or through the PlayStation and Xbox online stores. But if you’re in the market for a video game burned onto CDs and sold in plastic boxes you’re likely to find better prices elsewhere especially if you look for used games online.

Source: byakkaya / iStock via Getty Images 8. Phone accessories

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive The phone accessories market is filled with an enormous selection of mobile phone accessories like cables adapters and automobile cradles. But so many of them are shoddy produced by obscure third-party Chinese manufacturers and they can conk out quickly or even damage your mobile device. Like its competitors Walmart does carry name-brand phone accessories but you’re not likely to be paying the lowest possible price for them.

Source: franckreporter / Getty Images 9. Photo printing services

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More difficult to print photos from your phone Walmart’s Photo Center currently offers 4×6 prints for nine cents apiece from images that can be uploaded to the site with a registered account. Canvas sizes images (16 x 20) currently cost $34.96. But if all you need is photo printing you’re better off using an online service or going to an easier-to-navigate smaller office supply outlet with a printing center.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive on the low end Walmart sells popular battery brands at competitive prices. For example a 16-pack of Duracell Coppertop AA batteries is currently $12.78 at Walmart $3.20 less than The Home Depot’s current price. However if you’re looking for lower-cost brands with comparable performance Consumer Reports found Costco’s Kirkland Signature AA batteries (currently 48 for $13.99) were the best store-branded batteries.

Source: santiphotois / Getty Images 11. Tires

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Beleaguered department store chain Sears used to be the gold standard for in-store automotive centers — places where you could get an oil change while shopping for clothing kitchenware and tools. Walmart has taken up the slack in this space as Sears continues to shutter stores. But tires can be more expensive at Walmart. For example Costco tends to have better deals and (unlike Walmart) offers free rotations and balances for the lifespan of the tires.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality Buying cheap luggage can lead to your overstuffed bag bursting open at check-in — one of the reasons why luggage is sold in stores at major airports (at a huge markup). In this instance Walmart isn’t alone in selling luggage lemons as its competitors like Target aren’t any better. A Consumer Reports survey found that the best places to buy luggage include REI L.L. Bean or a dedicated luggage vendor like Luggage Pros.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality Even by the flimsy standards of mass-produced particle-board furniture Walmart is not the best place to find budget shelving tables or other self-assembled home furnishings. IKEA remains the gold standard for these affordable goods.

Source: sutteerug / iStock via Getty Images 14. Bedding

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality As with wood furniture Walmart is not a great place to purchase bedding. Higher thread-count sheets and pillowcases can be purchased elsewhere at comparable prices (relative to quality) and larger selections such as Bed Bath & Beyond or Macy’s.

[in-text-ad-2]

Source: artran / iStock Editorial via Getty Images 15. Meat and poultry

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality meats often more expensive Walmart is a decent place to buy non-perishable food items like canned food and frozen dinners. But with its massive supply chains complicated logistics operations and aggressive pricing strategies against its suppliers the quality of perishable foods can suffer. According to Consumer Reports a common customer complaint about Walmart is the quality of its meat and poultry.

Source: AlexRaths / iStock via Getty Images 16. Fresh produce

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality smaller selection Anyone who has shopped at both a bargain grocery store and a high-end market is likely to have noticed a difference in the quality and shelf life of fresh produce. Walmart’s content pursuit of the lowest prices means the quality and selection of fruits and vegetables suffers. Produce is usually better from premium grocery stores and prices tend to be competitive (for in-season fruits and vegetables) as they use it to lure customers to their higher-profit goods.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Brand names are competitively priced Walmart’s store brand may cost less than similar items it stocks but the value might not be that great. Reader’s Digest reported that when considering the sizes of Great Value products versus name brands the price difference is negligible.

There’s no questioning the success of the iPhone. In fact Apple apparently sold well over 40 million units of the iPhone 13 series just over the 2021 holiday season. The iPhone 13 Pro is one phone (two if you count the larger but essentially identical iPhone 13 Pro Max) holding its own against an army of some of the best Android flagships and succeeding at it without a need to delve into the nitty-gritty of spec sheets and behind-the-scenes action. Instead the company focuses on the experience as it looks to tempt buyers into its wider product ecosystem.

Apple is also one of the rare brands openly embracing the fact that users don’t need to upgrade phones every year or even two years. Modern iPhones remain well supported for five years or more. To that effect the yearly releases are no longer essential purchases and often you’d be wise to save some cash by opting for a slightly older model. With that in mind how well does the iPhone 13 Pro hold up six months later? That’s what we aim to find out in the Android Authority iPhone 13 Pro review revisit. Our original verdict: iPhone 13 Pro review

The good

Design

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

I find myself aligned to the Bauhaus school of design. Balancing minimalism with functionality is important to me and it is an art that Apple excels at. The iPhone 13 Pro might not have the Dieter Rams-inspired minimalism we saw on products like the iPod but the phone still looks understated yet chic six months down the line.

The iPhone 13 Pro never had a revolutionary design to begin with. However it built itself on the excellence of the iPhone 12‘s design which itself didn’t scream out its presence. Instead the sharp lines and muted colors whisper understated elegance. More significantly the phone has held up rather well in the time I’ve had it. The tactile feedback is still rock solid and premium. Errant fingerprints on the rear panel are easily wiped clean. That said I’m less enthusiastic about the shiny metallic side rails that tend to attract scratches. I’d recommend slapping on a case to protect your pricey purchase.

The iPhone 13 Pro is also one of the few mainstream flagships to ship in a size that’s perfectly suited for my hand — in its default configuration. The 6.1-inch 120Hz display is more than sufficient for day-to-day tasks and even heavy browsing. I’m not much of a smartphone gamer but the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max offers an alternative for those who need something bigger. It all comes down to which you value more ergonomics or massive real estate.

Performance

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

Apple has honed its chipset optimizations to perfection. The A15 Bionic ranked at the top of the charts when it launched and it’s still at the top of the CPU charts despite the launch of Android range-toppers powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1

Having used the phone as a secondary device ever since it launched it has stuck to the oh-so-important theme of consistency I touched upon in my review. From launching apps to scrolling through the interface and heavy multitasking the iPhone 13 Pro remains as silky smooth as day one. That’s in sharp contrast to some other flagships that haven’t fared quite as well in my experience.

The all-out performance is great but it's the longevity afforded by it that's the true selling point.

The understated advantage of that all-out performance is of course the longevity. Flagship phones are expensive and iPhones are near the top of the pile. But they remain functional and performant years down the line. I like looking at Apple products as a five-year purchase. From that lens the cost isn’t as prohibitive anymore considering that the phone will still retain most of its grunt even near the end of its lifecycle.

Battery life That blistering performance is also matched by class-leading battery optimization. Calling the iPhone 13 Pro’s battery life incredible would be doing it a disservice. This is by all measures a two-day phone for me. In fact the iPhone 13 Pro is the only phone I’d trust to last me through a night out without searching for a charger beforehand. For context I’m usually looking to slap the Galaxy S22 Ultra on a charger before 5PM.

Most of that longevity comes from the astonishingly frugal standby battery drain. The phone sips battery when idle and you’ll observe a drop of 2-3% at best overnight. It isn’t impossible to kill the phone though. High-intensity games like Genshin Impact do put a dent in the battery. However the battery optimizations mean that you can game that much longer than the alternatives. Even after extensive use the iPhone 13 Pro displays battery health at 97% — and I’m convinced it’ll serve me just fine for many years to come.

Cameras

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

The iPhone 13 Pro’s camera package is far from the most packed and yet I keep coming back to it. Appreciating the cameras on the iPhone requires looking at them through a different lens. You’re not getting the most feature-packed setup on the market. In fact the iPhone’s camera offerings are a far cry from the humongous 108MP sensor on the S22 Ultra. Nor does it have the litany of cameras you’ll find on most Android flagships. The iPhone’s paltry 3x lens also pales in comparison to the 10x zoom on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. And that’s without factoring in the surprisingly useable 30x zoom

But what really matters is the final result from that main camera. Now it’s a perfectly subjective choice here but the iPhone’s proclivity to opt for realistic colors and ever-so-slightly warmer white balance tips the scales in its favor for me over other flagships.

Food photography Indoor Night mode portrait Low light Portrait mode Indoor HDR

The iPhone 13 Pro’s primary camera comes across as more true to life than the hyper-saturated colors and night-turned-to-day shots from some phones. Yes a fair few Android phones can outperform the iPhone’s photos in perfect light but perfect lighting is just one scenario. Where many phones opt for digital noise reduction the iPhone is perfectly content letting in a bit of grain — just like film. This is something I’ve really appreciated on Pixel phones as well. I’ve also really come to appreciate the iPhone’s handling of color and white balance across multiple lenses. All of which is to say the imaging experience here matches the cornerstone of iPhone ownership — consistent reliability. You can trust this phone to snap a pic without worrying about how it will turn out.

Of course iPhones are known for their video quality and nothing has changed on that front. Examining footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra side by side the iPhone 13 Pro wins by a decent margin. Not only is there more detail but the excellent stabilization exposure control and color science all come together to deliver the best video footage you can get out of a smartphone right now.

The not so good

Charging The tremendous battery life of the iPhone 13 Pro comes in handy because charging it is a chore. The phone is hamstrung by the Lightning connector. The antiquated port neither supports super-fast charging like recent Android phones nor does it deliver high-speed data transfers. In fact you’ll have more luck getting files off the iPhone using AirDrop or even the cloud over connecting it via a cable. Seriously get with the times Apple. Now that the entire ecosystem of Apple products barring the iPhone uses USB-C there’s really no excuse not to adopt the universal connector. But I digress.

The brutally slow charging speeds are a no-go in 2022.

The charging power you’ll get here tops off at 23W — and that’s only with an appropriate charger. Wireless charging is also locked to 7.5W unless you splurge on a pricey MagSafe charger. In a world where some brands are pushing beyond 100W and even Samsung is hitting 45W the iPhone 13 Pro’s slow charging comes across as a bit of a joke.

Camera (again)

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

The iPhone’s camera is very good. I would even go as far as saying that it is amongst the best in the business and I’ve already talked about how much the results speak to my tastes on a personal level. But it’s not perfect. One of the more notable issues ailing it is a consistent lens flare anytime you are shooting into the light. Additionally the downside of having less aggressive HDR than Android alternatives is that the phone can sometimes struggle with dynamic range. I found this to be particularly true when shooting a portrait against the sun. The camera also has a tendency to wash out the sky altogether and the telephoto zoom isn’t on the level of many Android flagships.

Software

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

iOS is good until it ain’t. My experience with iOS has been rather excellent for the most part. However it is hard to overstate how poorly the operating system manages notifications. For the most part it is just a steady stream of notifications and clearing them out is a mix of one tap to clear or in most cases swiping them away one app at a time. It requires too many steps to interact with or clear them all out.

The iPhone's notifications system is incredibly annoying and needs a significant reboot.

Elsewhere the addition of widgets was a good call but the lack of a home screen and app drawer hierarchy can add to a lot of visual clutter. I find myself making use of Spotlight search to find and launch my preferred apps rather than poring over pages upon pages of apps.

Face ID

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

The last two years of the pandemic have reinforced the importance of fingerprint readers. The iPhone finally got mask support for Face ID (without the need for an Apple Watch) in March 2022 but that was too little too late. The implementation isn’t perfect and has been pretty much 50/50 in my experience. It also fails when using accessories like sunglasses.

You know what would have worked flawlessly? A return to Touch ID. We know that Apple can make it work. The iPad Air already ships with a fingerprint reader embedded in the power button. It isn’t a stretch to imagine a fingerprint reader included in the iPhone’s power button either. Don’t get me wrong Face ID works brilliantly well as long as you’re not wearing a mask but it’d be nice to have options. Read more: The best iPhone 13 alternatives

iPhone 13 Pro review revisited: The verdict

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

For all its follies the iPhone 13 Pro makes up for them with a user experience that as the most popular phone series in the world sets a high benchmark for all smartphones. The fluidity achieved by the pairing of hardware and software is as good as anything else in the market but it one-ups much of the competition by maintaining that silky smooth user experience over time. The timeless design incredible display and reliable cameras round off the package and make it an easy recommendation if you want to take a walk on the Apple side.

Is the iPhone 13 Pro still a good purchase six months later? 2773 votes Yes it's still a great purchase 81 % No I'll consider something else 19 %

Apple’s insistence on sticking to “features” like the Lightning connector and slow charging are speed breakers sure but they don’t take away from the fact that the iPhone 13 Pro remains one of the best phones you can buy even six months down the line. Moreover this is a phone that will last you and last you well for many years to come. Buying into Apple’s ecosystem requires buying into some conformity but the iPhone 13 Pro shows that conformity has its merits.

Apple iPhone 13 Pro An extra camera lens and other perks up the ante for this model. If you need something more capable than the vanilla iPhone 13 but don't want an increase in size this is the model for you. See price at Best Buy See price at Verizon See price at AT&T

The decision means only patients who have enrolled in clinical trials will receive Medicare coverage for Aduhelm which goes by the generic drug name of Aducanumab.

Because of the restrictions many Alzheimer’s patients may be unable to use the drug. Without Medicare coverage Aduhelm’s annual cost is USD 28200 or USD 2350 a month a price that’s prohibitively expensive for most Americans.

What’s more not everyone with mild Alzheimer’s will be able to enroll in a clinical trial due to location or other logistical issues. And some of those in the trial may be randomized to only receive a placebo.

Medicare’s ruling clashes dramatically with the Food and Drug Administration’s decision in June 2021 to approve Aduhelm for all Alzheimer’s patients without restrictions.

This is a departure for Medicare which almost always pays for drugs the FDA approves at least for authorized uses.

Biogen has criticized Medicare’s decision saying the added requirements “would significantly restrict and delay patient access to an FDA-approved therapy for a progressive disease.” But the core of the issue surrounding this drug is simple: Does it actually work? As a physician and researcher who investigates the efficacy of medicines I have been watching this story unfold over the past year. As of right now I am certain of one thing: With 6 million people in the United States suffering from Alzheimer’s and current treatments only marginally effective there is a desperate need for medications that can slow the disease.

But the evidence on Aduhelm so far is contradictory. Two-Phase III clinical trials were stopped early after an independent committee appointed by Biogen analyzed the data and reported the studies were unlikely to show Aduhelm would demonstrate a benefit. This is not unusual; clinical trials are often stopped when early data suggests a drug will not work.

After that analysis Biogen announced it did find benefits that were statistically significant in one of the trials. This came after evaluating results for 318 participants whose data was not available in time for the initial committee review. That new data showed the cognitive function of participants in the high-dose group declined 23 percent more slowly than those in the placebo group. The low-dose group showed no benefit.

While the effects on cognitive decline may seem ambiguous Aduhelm indisputably reduces patients’ amyloid plaques. It was on this basis that Biogen sought approval for Aduhelm through FDA’s accelerated approval pathway where drugs treating a serious illness may receive expedited approval if they are reasonably likely to provide a clinical benefit based on some other marker such as amyloid plaque burden.

Aduhelm is a monoclonal antibody treatment delivered as an infusion. The drug targets amyloid a protein that clumps in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.

While Aduhelm does reduce amyloid plaques in patients’ brains so do many other medications that haven’t been shown to slow cognitive decline. It may be that reducing amyloid plaques does not necessarily improve cognitive function in Alzheimer’s patients.

At the core of the question is the amyloid hypothesis which has been a central concept of Alzheimer’s research for decades. Simply put the hypothesis assumes that accumulation of the peptide amyloid-B is the primary cause of Alzheimer’s. Many researchers believe that it initiates a cascade of processes that include inflammation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles made up of the protein tau within brain cells. This is thought to lead to dysfunction of the communication points between brain cells known as synapses which ultimately leads to cell death.

But amyloid plaques are often found in the brains of individuals who do not have Alzheimer’s. The reduced cognitive function seen in Alzheimer’s is more closely correlated with the number and location of intracellular tau-tangles. It may be that those with plaques but no symptoms have an early stage of Alzheimer’s.

While the benefits of Aduhelm remain murky some risks are clear. The same Phase III trials showed that 41 percent of patients who received the high dose of Aduhelm – the dose that may have led to cognitive benefits – experienced cerebral swelling or hemorrhage. Although the majority of these were minor and asymptomatic a 75-year-old woman in the trial died after experiencing brain swelling and seizures. The risk was considered high enough for the FDA to require the company to place a warning on Aduhelm’s label advising physicians to monitor patients and obtain two MRI brain scans during the first year of treatment.

Patients selected for the Phase III studies were excluded if they had any of the many medical complications common for older people. This includes cardiac problems the use of blood thinners or impaired liver or kidney function. These selected patients who may be healthier than those in the general public who would receive the medication underwent not two but seven MRIs for monitoring. MRIs are expensive procedures; they raise the real cost of Aduhelm by about 20 percent.

Other anti-amyloid immunotherapy medications are in the pharmaceutical pipeline. More data may emerge to suggest these drugs delay progression of Alzheimer’s but so far the relatively minor cognitive benefits seen do not seem to match the robust reduction in amyloid plaques. While it’s indisputable that Aduhelm can consistently and convincingly reduce the level of amyloid plaques in the brain the cognitive benefit it provides to patients remains in doubt. This discrepancy speaks to the complexities of Alzheimer’s – and the holes that remain to be filled in the understanding of this terrible disease. wax

The tornado warning was issued shortly after 7 pm ET.

By 8.30 pm the storm had hit Craighead and Greene Counties with large hail and strong winds Region 8 News reports.

The mayor of Cherokee Village said there is “severe isolated damage” on the west side of town according to a tweet.

The damage included shingles and siding torn off of homes.

Roads were closed because of downed power lines.

Boats on Lake Omaha reportedly flipped while others were ripped from moorings.

A resident of Cherokee Village said the front of his home is gone cars are crushed and there is softball-sized hail.

The tornado was reported as ""life-threatening"" by the NOAA.

At the height of the storm the news crew at Region 8 posted a photo of them on Twitter sheltering in place in a hallway as the storm was expected to pass north of the station.

Chief Meteorologist Ryan Vaughan and Meteorologist Aaron Castleberry continued to provide live team coverage.

By 9.45pm the storm had moved east across the Mississippi River.

Lawrence County Sheriff Jeff Yates said a trailer park in Hoxie suffered a “lot of damage.""

Downed trees and property damage were also reported in the area according to Region 8.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that BlackRock the world's biggest asset manager and hedge fund Marshall Wace are shorting the retailer's stock.

The funds have disclosed the combined £35million short position just weeks after the retailer announced that food boss Stuart Machin will become chief executive alongside Katie Bickerstaffe.

Blow: BlackRock the world's biggest asset manager and hedge fund Marshall Wace are shorting Marks & Spencer's stock

The pair will replace M&S veteran Steve Rowe next month in an unusual joint arrangement where Bickerstaffe whose title is co-chief executive reports to Machin.

Short-selling is a way of betting a share price will fall. Traders borrow shares sell them and then buy them back ideally at a lower price before returning them to the owner and pocketing the difference.

The shorts by BlackRock and Marshall Wace come as M&S has seen its stock tumble in recent months. The shares are down 37 per cent this year valuing the business at £2.9billion.

Retailers are facing multiple challenges including rampant inflation which is pushing up wages and energy costs as well as squeezing consumer wallets.

Machin is credited with aiding Rowe and chairman Archie Norman in starting to turn around the long-troubled retailer which underwent a revamp during the pandemic.

M&S saw food sales advance over Christmas and clothing sales have been boosted by stocking outside brands.

The company is expected to confirm next month that its joint food delivery venture with Ocado is hitting targets. But the share sell-offs and short positions – the first bets against M&S disclosed since December – indicate the City is unconvinced of its prospects under new management.

BlackRock Investment Management is betting against a string of consumer-focused stocks including Sainsbury's Dixons and B&Q owner Kingfisher. Marshall Wace chaired by Sir Paul Marshall is targeting online retailers Asos Boohoo and AO World.

Richard Hyman partner at retail consultancy TPC said: 'The M&S leadership team has focused too much on food and not enough on investing in fashion – which is higher margin.'

M&S's decision to employ an unconventional management structure has created uncertainty. Hyman said: 'It strikes me as a cop-out. It's very difficult to have two chiefs.'

M&S BlackRock and Marshall Wace declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9wZW9wbGUvYXJpZC00MDgyOTM5Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mark Moriarty: The day you start telling yourself you're great is the day you can retire,"I grew up in Blackrock County Dublin with my younger sister Laura and my parents Tom and Monica. Another lady Frances lived across the road from us and was like our second family. We used to spend the days there while my parents were at work.

My dad can't boil an egg god bless him. My mum is a great cook but my interest in cooking came from the time I spent in Ventry County Kerry where my father is from. Every weekend week off holidays summers were spent down there. I had a big interest in fishing. The natural progression from that I suppose was to learn how to cook all the stuff that we were landing every morning.

My earliest memory is eating cauliflower and cheese in a highchair I don't know what age I was. It was steamed cauliflower with a bit of sauce or something on top of it. We were always well fed. We never ate crap. My parents worked flat out but we sat down as a family every evening for our dinner. And it was always good food.

I feel very fortunate that I haven’t faced any great challenges in my life so far. Losing my job during the pandemic was a challenge but I wouldn't say it was a massive challenge because my peers were in the same boat. There was a support network there. I was part of a team at work and then I became part of a team that lost their jobs... but I was still part of a group. I think we definitely need that as people. Isolation is what we fear the most.

I was able to bring my dad on a trip to Vancouver recently for his 70th birthday. Being able to bring him away look after him and pay for it myself off the back of the work I've been doing for the last 10 years — that's probably my proudest achievement. I was looked after so well and he did so much for me so it was nice to be able to finally at 30 years of age give back and treat him.

My greatest skill... I like to think I am good in times of crisis. I react well to problems which I think is a very important quality. No day in the world is ever perfect and it's how you deal with problems that defines the quality of your life. It’s particularly key in my job. I've done numerous competitions in my career and I've judged them and the key to competitions is everyone's going to make a mistake and it's the person that reacts best to that mistake who wins the competition. It's exceptionally rare that — especially in a competition setting — things just go seamlessly. How you react to the problem is what sets you apart. It's the same in the professional kitchen. Things go wrong every minute of every day. If you just fall apart in a heap on the ground when something goes wrong you're absolutely no use to the team.

Mark Moriarty: ""Hard work pays""

In this industry you never pat yourself on the back. The day you start telling yourself you’re great is the day you can retire. If you’re a Michelin star chef I think you’re there because there’s that innate sense inside you that you want to be better and that’s why you end up at the top. It’s a mentality. People who are happy with what they do every day they aren’t really progressing are they?

The life lesson I would like to pass on is that hard work pays. Anyone who's successful is successful because they've worked hard. That's the common denominator. You can be the most talented person in the world but if you don't work hard at it you won't be successful.

A good saying that has stood me in good stead is 'Have more than you show and speak less than you know'.

My greatest quality is not taking myself too seriously. If I could change something about myself I’d like to be more patient. I think I am getting better as I get older.

What surprises me in life is how predictable and consistent human behaviour is. As much as we talk about how we are progressing [as a species] we make the same mistakes over and over again. You only have to look at the news at the moment. It's like being back in the 1940s. And you're kind of like 'how is this happening? We're supposed to be such an intelligent species'.

What scares me most in life is failure. There’s always the sense that all of this could be gone tomorrow... but that fear of failure is also key to success. When I was 20 I came second in a big cooking competition and at the time it felt like the biggest failure in the world. I took it very badly and ended up in hospital. I was out of work for two weeks. I had just burned myself out. But it was a good learning experience. I learned about managing my energy and my time better and that working more hours than everyone else doesn't necessarily result in success. It's about being a bit smarter sometimes rather than working harder. I won that competition the next year.

I would like to be remembered as a decent person. You don't take your CV to the grave.

Take Sunset Boulevard’s As if we Never Said Goodbye:

‘The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways / The atmosphere as thrilling here as always / Feel the early morning madness / Feel the magic in the making / Why everything’s as if we never said goodbye.’

Then there’s the titular theme from the 1971 Bond film:

Get The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up

‘Diamonds are forever / Hold one up and then caress it / Touch it stroke it and undress it / I can see ev’ry part nothing hides in the heart…’

When recited these words are poetry but the man who wrote them disagrees.“Poetry is written to be thought about. Lyrics are written to be sung” says Don Black who then sings a line from Sunset the musical he wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber that earned them both a Tony. “Poetry you can put down and go back to. A lyric has to be instant and in time. You’ve got three minutes to say it all.”

Don has been saying it all to music created by his many collaborators since 1965; the year flagged on his website beside Thunderball his Bond theme with John Barry. By then he had tried stand-up comedy but sat down to write songs for the singer Matt Monro whom he was managing and for whom he wrote the hit Walk Away.

Robbie Williams describes Don (formerly Donald Blackstone of South Hackney) as the “Pele of lyricists” which is not too shabby for the son of a garment presser father and shop worker mother who listened to “Jewish gypsy music” mingled with songs Don loved by Cole Porter and Irving Berlin. These songs have been getting airtime recently on BBC Radio London as Don revisited the show he did for Radio 2 which incidentally my late father-in-law Stanley never missed.

What Stanley and other listeners (of all ages) enjoyed was the chance to hear singers from a bygone era interspersed with the host’s anecdotes. Don has so many and will play a Vic Damone ballad then offer a gem such as the time he was at Lloyd Webber’s New York apartment working on Aspects of Love when Steven Spielberg popped round.

Lloyd Webber did the introductions and Spielberg gasped: ‘You’re not the Don Black are you? You wrote my favourite title song of all time: Diamonds Are Forever!” Kanye West aka Ye also likes that song and sampled it in a rap but the point here is Don’s humility in the face of huge praise from Spielberg or anyone – and that’s what made this Oscar/Tony/ Olivier award-winner such a popular collaborator in an industry of egos.

To emerge so level-headed with a love for the business intact at the age of 83 is best elucidated by the title of his memoir The Sanest Guy in the Room which was published last year and completed after he was hospitalised with Covid. Don was serenaded out of the hospital by nursing staff performing his song Born Free.

For the past three years Don has been working on a musical adaptation of the Orson Welles classic The Third Man. Joined by Christopher Hampton composer George Fenton and Trevor Nunn to direct it will follow Don’s other new musical Casanova which he wrote with his son Grant and opens next year in Vienna. But before that there’s Bonnie and Clyde which has taken its rightful place at the Leicester Square Arts Theatre.

“It originally opened in America 10 years ago but only lasted three months on Broadway” said Don. “But it caught fire and got a cult following across America. We’ve been trying to get it here for a decade and finally a very enterprising producer Dan Looney bought the rights.” Heralded by several concerts at Theatre Royal Drury Lane the interest has been palpable since it found a permanent home albeit for three months. “The Arts only has 400 seats so we’re hoping it will go to a bigger West End theatre which it will if the reaction is anything to go by. “But there are lots of musicals waiting to come to the West End because of Covid.”

Married for 60 years to beloved wife Shirley who enabled him to be the ‘sanest man in the room’ Don references her constantly though she died in 2018. Accepting her loss – “That final stage of grief they talk about” – alludes him as they had been together since meeting at a dance in Clapton. Of course Don’s own songs remain an intrinsic part of their story – “she’d look over and say that’s terrible” – he recalls but told podcaster Mark Steyn that the best lyrics of grief are were those in the Paul Williams song You and Me Against the World.

‘And baby when one of us is gone / And one is left alone to carry on / Well then remembering will have to do.’

Anyone who loves musical theatre would be reluctant to leave a

conversation with Don Black– the colour comedy and heart in his stories are so compelling – and when he shares the one about changing the lyrics for As If We Never Said Goodbye for Barbra Streisand at her Bel Air home you want more.

“She made me a cup of tea. It was just so lovely and normal like talking to you” he says. Of course I wanted him to keep talking about working with Gypsy’s Jules Styne with whom he wrote Bar Mitzvah Boy and Marvin Hamlisch who asked him to write extra lyrics for The Goodbye Girl and referred to Shirley as Don’s “secret weapon”.

Along with his wife Don has lost so many composer friends of late the most recent being Leslie Bricusse who died last year. Playing their music is how he keeps them alive. Among those great late talents is Billy Wilder the legendary director of the film Sunset Boulevard who Don met at the musical’s opening night in LA.

“He told Christopher Hampton and I we were very clever to which I replied: ‘Why is that Mr Wilder?’ and he said: ‘You didn’t change anything.’” I squealed at some of these anecdotes so it was fortunate for him that his busy diary – “which stops me monitoring my decline” – took him away. I think we both knew I would never have said goodbye.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vYnVzaW5lc3MvaGlyYW5hbmRhbmktaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1sb2dpc3RpY3MtcGxhdGZvcm0taW5rcy0yLWxha2gtc3EtZnQtZGVhbC1pbi1jaGVubmFp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hiranandani Industrial & Logistics platform inks 2 lakh sq-ft deal in Chennai,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.constructionweekonline.in/business/hiranandani-industrial-logistics-platform-inks-2-lakh-sq-ft-deal-in-chennai on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vYnVzaW5lc3MvaGlyYW5hbmRhbmktaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1sb2dpc3RpY3MtcGxhdGZvcm0taW5rcy0yLWxha2gtc3EtZnQtZGVhbC1pbi1jaGVubmFp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Boeing declined to comment.

SEATTLE — A former Boeing Co. security officer is suing the company alleging she suffered lasting health issues because of chemical sprays used by workers inside a hangar at Paine Field where she was stationed in 2019.

Holly Hawthorne began experiencing migraines breathing problems and skin issues because she was repeatedly exposed to the toxins — industrial-grade “corrosion inhibiting compounds” used in aircraft assembly and maintenance — without warning or protective gear according to her attorney.

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle on April 7 accuses Boeing and Hawthorne’s employer security service provider Allied Universal of failing to protect her from the chemicals even though the companies knew there would be negative health effects.

A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment on the claims.

Allied Universal did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Darrell Cochran one of Hawthorne’s attorneys says the case is the latest in a long history of workplace chemical-exposure claims against Boeing dating back to the 1980s.

“It appears that Boeing engages in a practice of exposing its employees (to toxins) as a cost of doing business” Cochran said.

One of the two chemicals named in the lawsuit is a form of hexavalent chromium a known carcinogen to humans according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. It has a variety of uses in many industries including aerospace where it’s applied during a chrome-plating process.

In September a state-mandated cleanup plan was finalized for Boeing’s Everett manufacturing plant and grounds outlining the steps the company must take in the coming years to remove various industrial pollutants that have seeped into the soil and groundwater below the plant in the past 50 years. Chromium is among the plant’s targeted “chemicals of concern” known to exceed cleanup standards on the roughly 1000-acre site on the northeast corner of Paine Field.

The aerospace giant has other facilities at the airport too that aren’t covered by the cleanup. The building where Hawthorne allegedly worked is part of Boeing’s Everett Modification Center at the south end of Paine Field.

Hawthorne who began working for Allied Universal in July 2018 was assigned in November 2019 to work in “Building 45-335” which lacked “adequate ventilation systems” the lawsuit says.

According to the construction company that erected Building 45-335 the structure is a “pre-manufactured metal building” with large roll-up doors for aircraft entry made for assembly and testing of KC-46 tankers that Boeing is building for the U.S. Air Force.

While Hawthorne worked there she alleges Boeing employees repeatedly used Cor-Ban 35 an aerosol spray meant to prevent metal parts from rusting. She was also exposed to “chromium (VI) oxide” also known as chromic acid the lawsuit says. The legal complaint includes excerpts from safety sheets that warn that breathing fumes of both the chemicals can irritate the skin and respiratory tract.

Inhaling chromic acid repeatedly can lead to “nosebleeds nasal congestion erosion of the teeth perforation of the nasal septum chest pain and bronchitis” according to the safety data sheet for the chemical.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers all hexavalent chromium compounds to be “occupational carcinogens” according to the agency’s website.

“Workers may be harmed from exposure to hexavalent chromium” says one CDC web page. “The level of exposure depends upon the dose duration and work being done.”

The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration imposes strict workplace limits on airborne levels of the contaminant. It also requires that employers provide employees with access to standardized safety data sheets for any chemicals used in the workplace.

According to the lawsuit Allied Universal had previously allowed employees assigned to the building to request reassignment and refuse to work there if an employee was worried about the effects of the chemicals but Hawthorne wasn’t given that chance.

The lawsuit alleges that Boeing and Allied Universal “had actual knowledge that injury was certain to result from unprotected exposure to the aerosolized chemical sprays including CORBAN-35 and Chromium (VI) Oxide used in the unventilated Building 45-335.”

“As a result of the misconduct and unlawful acts described above” says the lawsuit Hawthorne “has suffered and continues to suffer general and special damages including negligent infliction of emotional distress mental anguish emotional physical and mental pain and suffering past medical expenses attorneys’ fees and costs and other general and special damages.”

The lawsuit does not demand a certain amount but states “the amount in controversy exceeds $75000.”

Hawthorne was eventually reassigned to another building but experienced some degree of “retaliation or isolation” for the request said Cochran.

“For a period of time the company kept her on but the persistence of the medical condition ultimately required her to stop working” he said. “She recently moved down to Las Vegas hoping that the drier warmer air would help ameliorate the effects.”

Similar lawsuits against the company have made it all the way to the state Supreme Court setting legal standards for workplace injury lawsuits.

In 1987 when Boeing began working with a new woven fiberglass cloth containing phenol-formaldehyde resin at its Auburn facility employees suffered rashes nausea headaches and dizziness. Fourteen of them sued the company four years later alleging Boeing knew that level of chemical exposure would make employees sick.

In the case Birklid v. Boeing Co. the state’s highest court held that the plaintiffs “demonstrated facts sufficient to justify a jury in finding a deliberate intention by Boeing to injure them.”

The company settled the case out of court for an undisclosed amount according to a 1997 report by The Seattle Times.

Years later retired Boeing employee Gary Walston sued the company over another claim of chemical exposure in the 1980s alleging he inhaled asbestos at a Seattle plant and later developed mesothelioma as a result. Before the case was resolved he died of the disease.

The following year in 2014 the Washington Supreme Court sided with Boeing holding that the Walston couldn’t prove Boeing had “actual knowledge” that the asbestos exposure “was certain to cause injury to the plaintiff.”

The report noted this might be a part of the startup’s Series B round which began last November. Euler Motors has now raised more than $26 million since forming as a company in 2018 and the company said it plans to close the current round at about $60 million.

Euler Motors was founded by Saurav Kumar and manufactures commercial three-wheeler EVs claiming to have deployed hundreds of EVs to BigBasket Ecom Express and Udaan. The company also said it received orders for around 2500 vehicles from Flipkart and BigBasket per the report.

The fiscal year ending March 31 2021 saw Euler getting a boost of 76% in its operating revenue. The total expenditure of the company was up almost 98% the report said.

PYMNTS reported last month that due to an increased demand for EVs automakers have partnered with third parties and apps to help EV owners streamline the process of keeping the vehicles charged.

Automakers have noted that charging stations have the potential to draw EV drivers to retail locations and extend automakers’ relationships with vehicle owners along with helping more shoppers consider EVs.

“We believe that making charging easy also makes ownership easy” Greg Silvestri vice president of service operations at Kia America said in a statement.

Among the innovations Kia America is running a program giving EV owners a solution to “bring the charging to them” with a no-cost access to an on-demand mobile charging service which will charge the EVs at the time and locations they choose.

Additionally there’s another partnership between Volvo and Starbucks that will install 60 chargers at 15 Starbucks locations available for a fee to some EV owners with the price reduced or free for Volvo owners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzE2LzMtYmVzdC1zdG9jay1zcGxpdC1jYW5kaWRhdGVzLW9uLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtYWZ0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Best Stock-Split Candidates on the Planet After Alphabet and Amazon,"They're great candidates but don't hold your breath that stock splits will actually be on the way soon.

Many investors could be diagnosed with a fever. It's not the flu. Instead their condition can be blamed in large part on Alphabet and Amazon.

These two giant companies announced 20-for-1 stock splits earlier this year. And now a lot of investors appear to have a case of stock-split fever. They're anxiously looking for other stocks that could split.

You can cross Berkshire Hathaway off the list. Even though Berkshire's class A shares trade at more than $518000 CEO Warren Buffett is dead set against splitting the stock. Berkshire's class B shares offer investors a more affordable alternative anyway.

But there are other companies with super-high share prices that could consider splits. Here are the three best stock-split candidates on the planet after Alphabet and Amazon.

1. NVR

With the lone exception of Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares no other stock trading on the major U.S. exchanges has a higher share price than NVR (NVR 1.70%). The homebuilder/mortgage bank's share price currently tops $4400.

Unsurprisingly NVR usually ranks near the top of any list of potential candidates for stock splits. The stock's price has consistently been greater than both Alphabet's and Amazon's over the past couple of decades. However NVR has never conducted a stock split in its nearly 30 years of trading as a public company.

The company's incoming CEO Eugene Bredow could be more favorable toward a stock split though. Bredow will take the helm as president and CEO pending shareholders' election of current CEO Paul Saville as executive chairman of the board.

NVR faces interest rate increases that are likely to negatively impact both its homebuilding and mortgage lending businesses. With a more challenging macro environment on the way the company just might view a stock split as a way to boost investors' interest.

2. Seaboard

Seaboard (SEB 1.11%) doesn't trail behind NVR very much with a share price of close to $4150. The share price of the agribusiness and transportation company has topped $1000 throughout most of the 21st century.

But Seaboard and NVR have something else in common in addition to their high share prices. Like NVR Seaboard has never split its stock.

Is there any reason to expect Seaboard's management team to have a change of heart about a stock split? Not really. Robert Steer has served as CEO of the company since July 2020. There's nothing to suggest that Steer has a split on his mind.

Seaboard's executive team is more likely focused on some of the tailwinds impacting the business. Inflation especially higher fuel costs presents a key challenge for the company.

3. Booking Holdings

Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.20%) claims the third-highest share price after NVR and Seaboard (excluding Berkshire's class A shares). The online travel company's shares currently trade at close to $2250.

Unlike NVR and Seaboard Booking does have a stock split in its history. However it was a unique kind known as a reverse stock split. In June 2003 the company (then known as Priceline) conducted a 1-for-6 reverse stock split in a move that boosted its share price.

Booking's share price is much higher than that of Shopify another company that has recently announced a stock split. While Booking appears to be a great candidate for a stock split though don't count on one happening anytime soon.

However the situation for Booking could change down the road. As COVID-19 concerns fade global travel could enjoy an even greater resurgence. That could drive Booking's share price to a high enough level that the company's management puts a stock split on the table.",,,,,,,,,

At least 17 families were displaced impacting as many as 61 people.

Fire departments from several towns responded as strong winds fueled the six-alarm fire.

Investigators believe the fire started on a back porch and spread to at least five buildings melting the siding off of others nearby.

""There was a lot of fire and these are three-deckers they're 100-year-old buildings balloon frame structure which means no fire stops"" said Lawrence Fire Chief Brian Moriarty. ""It's windy extremely close together they're houses I can't walk between they're that close together.""

No one was injured. The families were brought to a nearby senior center for shelter.

""[The families are] just saying that everything they have is lost"" said Lawrence City Councilor Stephany Infante. ""That's the comment that keeps being repeated by the families. 'We lost everything we lost everything.' And I'm doing my best to remind them that at least they are here. They're here and that's the most important thing.""

Gift card donations for the victims are being organized by Heal Lawrence and may be dropped off at The Center on 155 Haverhill St. in Lawrence from Monday - Friday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. starting after Patriot's Day.

Clothing donations are being organized by Debbie's Treasure Chest on 15 Union St. Suite 411 in Lawrence.",,,,,,,,,

Despite the 15-hour time difference there's a strong and growing link between Australian and Minnesota med-tech companies. Many Australian companies are adding jobs here and striking deals with contract medical-device companies in Minnesota. The strength and depth of Minnesota's med-tech economy is a big draw.

Connections have emerged over the years due in part to similar med-tech specialties said Frank Jaskulke vice president of intelligence for Medical Alley.

""There's this parallel path where particularly in Victoria the state where Melbourne is they have a lot of neuro and cardiac stuff"" said Jaskulke. ""There's this long cardiac and neuro history where a lot of University of Minnesota and Mayo researchers have done work for researchers in Melbourne in particular.""

Medical Alley forged a partnership with BioMelbourne in 2014 which has opened more collaboration. Medical Alley counts a dozen companies with Minnesota/Australian connections.

Minnetonka-based Osprey Medical was ahead of the curve. Although it's publicly traded there Osprey does not have an Australian corporate address.

""The original idea came from a doctor in Australia the original venture capital came from there and then we went public in Australia. But I don't employ anybody in Australia"" said Mike McCormick Osprey's CEO.

Osprey Medical makes a device to help reduce kidney injuries caused by contrast dye in catheterization labs for high-risk patients. When the company needed money for clinical trials it raised $20 million from its Australian IPO in 2012.

McCormick said it would be very tough to go public in the U.S. without FDA approval which it secured in 2015. It's easier for companies to go public in Australia he said but valuations there are lower than they would be for a publicly traded company in the U.S.

Saluda Medical which is developing a spinal neuromodulation system landed $125 million in equity financing at the beginning of March. In the wake of the new capital its local office will be expanding.

""It was really a no-brainer for the company"" said Jim Schuermann CEO of Saluda Medical. ""We felt like it was a competitive advantage for us to be in Bloomington versus other parts of the country.""

Saluda is based in suburban Sydney but Schuermann said the company considers itself to have dual headquarters in both its homeland and Minnesota.

The company opened its Minnesota office in 2016 which it expanded within three years. Today it's home to 25 of Saluda's 86 U.S. employees. The company is planning to add 50 to 100 U.S. employees this year but not all of those jobs would be in Bloomington.

""We've got a number of former Medtronic employees"" said Schuermann who previously worked for Medtronic and Boston Scientific and is based in the Boston area.

The list goes on.

Melbourne-based Seer Medical was one of four companies selected in March for the initial cohort of the Mayo Clinic Platform Accelerate a business incubator designed to help early-stage artificial intelligence (AI) medical companies get market-ready.

Seer which makes at-home diagnostics devices for epilepsy was the only company outside of the U.S. to be selected for the program.

ImpediMed Ltd. another Australian med-tech company opened an office in Bloomington in 2016. The company makes bioimpedance spectroscopy devices that measure a patient's total body water. That in turn can be used to diagnose or assess treatment for chronic diseases.

With each new Australian company to the Minnesota market Jaskulke said the connection gets stronger.

""You get this highway going back and forth and it's worked out really well"" said Jaskulke.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As the researchers explain some white blood cells such as NK cells (Natural Killers) are capable of recognizing and killing cancer cells.

However in some blood tumors the defensive NK cells become dormant after interlocking with the cancer cells. This renders the NK cells unable to kill the cancer cells clearing the way for cancer to develop.

Kissing between white blood cells and other cells is common explains Italian immunologist Michele Ardolino.

The phenomenon is called trogocytosis from the Greek trogo meaning to nibble or gnaw. The defensive cell comes into contact for a few minutes with another cell - which may for example be cancerous or virus-infected - and steals a fragment of its membrane. “My hypothesis is that immune cells have evolved these mechanisms to better sense and be influenced by their environment” says Ardolino who leads the Ottawa team.

Making proteins takes time and energy so white blood cells steal them from their neighboring cells to regulate their own behavior in response to the outside world - when infected by a virus for example. “It’s like if you’re entering a baking competition and you’re late for the competition” explains Ardolino. By way of comparison he says that “you could make your own cake batter” but it would take less energy to “simply take a pre-made one from the fridge.”

The kiss between a cancerous cell and an NK cell is a unique case of trogocytosis. NK cells are extraordinary cancer killers but a protein called PD-1 prevents them from functioning properly. In the beginning Ardolino’s team didn’t understand where this protein came from. As they later discovered “NK cells don’t make their own PD-1 protein they steal it from cancer cells.” During the kiss the NK killers steal a fragment of tumor membrane that is riddled with these numbing proteins.

The Italian immunologist Michele Ardolino. Hospital de Ottawa

The Italian immunologist says it’s clear some cancers take advantage of trogocytosis to override the human body’s defenses.

The discovery is the result of a multitude of experiments on mice with leukaemia and was published in the journal Science Advances on Wednesday.

Other cancer-killing white blood cells the T cells do produce their own PD-1 protein a natural deterrent that helps prevent them from attacking other normal cells in the body. As Ardolino points out there are already drugs that target this PD-1 protein. Indeed some of them are among the biggest moneymakers in the world such as Keytruda a drug from the US pharmaceutical company MSD that is indicated against melanoma certain lung cancers and some other tumors. Sales of Keytruda were close to €16 billion in 2021 according to an analysis by UK company Evaluate Vantage. Opdivo another similar anti-tumor drug Made by US-based Bristol Myers Squibb had sales of €7 billion.

By inhibiting PD-1 these drugs release the natural brakes and trigger the ferocity of T-cells against cancer cells. Japanese immunologist Tasuku Honjo won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering the PD-1 protein more than a quarter of a century earlier and learning how to inhibit it in order to fight cancer. The US approved the drug Keytruda in 2014 and authorized Opdivo the following year. Immunotherapy in which the human body’s natural defenses are stimulated in an attempt to eliminate a patient’s tumor was born.

In some countries these treatments can cost more than €50000 per year per patient. Tasuku Honjo himself lamented these prohibitive prices in an interview with EL PAÍS in 2019. “It’s always the same problem with any drug. It would be better if it were cheaper so that everyone could benefit. Even penicillin when it came on the market was very expensive. And then it became affordable for everybody” he argued.

Ardolino’s team first noticed four years ago that these blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor drugs originally designed to stimulate T cells also stimulated NK cells. Immunologist David Raulet of the University of California Berkeley was involved in that work. “The field of cancer immunotherapy has focused on mobilizing T cells but we believe that NK cells also play an important role” said Raulet at the time. Some tumors do not respond to current treatments that activate T cells but they could perhaps succumb to an attack by suitably equipped NK cells.

Michele Ardolino believes his new discovery will help refine the therapies to fight cancer. As each cancer is unique so is each person’s immune system. Ardolino’s dream is that when a cancer patient arrives in hospital doctors will be able to biopsy the patient to not only determine the specific mutations of their tumor but also obtain a very detailed profile of how the patient’s immune system responds. Each patient could then be offered a more targeted immunotherapy possibly even tailored to the cancerous proteins stolen by their white blood cells.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zb2NpZXR5LzIwMjIvYXByLzE3L21lZGljYWwtcmVndWxhdG9yLWZhY2VzLXF1ZXN0aW9ucy1vdmVyLWJvYXJkLW1lbWJlcnMtbGlua3MtdG8tZHJ1Zy1maXJtc9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zb2NpZXR5LzIwMjIvYXByLzE3L21lZGljYWwtcmVndWxhdG9yLWZhY2VzLXF1ZXN0aW9ucy1vdmVyLWJvYXJkLW1lbWJlcnMtbGlua3MtdG8tZHJ1Zy1maXJtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medical regulator faces questions over board members’ links to drug firms,"The UK medicines watchdog has been urged to strengthen its conflict of interest policy after it emerged that six of its board members are receiving payments from the pharmaceutical industry.

Board members involved in overseeing the regulator’s “strategic direction” also have financial interests in companies including US and Saudi drug giants and firms with ambitions to break into the UK’s healthcare market. Some offer consultancy services while others help run or own shares in drug and medical device firms according to official transparency records.

There is no suggestion of wrongdoing but the findings have led to concerns about perceived conflicts of interest among senior figures at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care responsible for regulating drugs and medical devices and ensuring they are safe.

The MHRA said that “in order to be an effective regulator” it needed to “bring together the right expertise from across industry academia the public and beyond” adding that board meetings are held in public and non-executive board members – to whom the potential conflicts relate – are not involved in “any work or decisions relating to the regulation of any products”.

But critics raised concerns about the potential for bias – or the perception of it – and called for stricter rules on conflicts of interest for those working in pharmaceutical regulation.

The board is responsible for helping set strategic priorities and advising on the delivery of policies potentially giving members access to information that could be useful in their positions at outside organisations.

David Rowland director of the Centre for Health and the Public Interest thinktank said regulators needed to be “whiter than white” in order to maintain “the absolute trust of the public” – particularly when they are responsible for “licensing new and potentially innovative products and devices”.

“We’ve seen during the pandemic a lot of people questioning the reliability and safety of vaccines and other treatments” he said. “Once people start thinking there are potential financial gains to be made it’s very difficult to get that trust back.”

Of 16 board members six have declared financial interests in drug or medical device companies or firms working on their behalf according to Observer analysis of official transparency records published in February.

All but one of the six joined the board in September and each of the appointments was signed off by the Department of Health.

Dr Junaid Bajwa chief medical scientist at Microsoft is also a non-executive director of Ondine Biomedical a Canadian life sciences company and Nahdi Medical a Saudi pharmaceutical retailer according to the logs. He also owns shares in the pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp and Dohme and is a paid adviser to the Swiss firm Novartis.

Dr Paul Goldsmith is a shareholder and director of Closed Loop Medicine which is developing hypertension and insomnia products according to its website. He owns shares in Summit Inc a drug discovery and development company and Ieso which intends to seek approval for its autonomous digital tools – AI therapy – in future.

Raj Long offers paid “access advisory” services to Huya Bio a Chinese company that aims to enable “faster more cost-effective and lower-risk drug development in the global markets” and is a shareholder in Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis while Amanda Calvert who has been a non-executive director of the MHRA’s board since 2019 is the director of Quince Consultancy whose clients include drug companies.

Haider Husain appointed to the MHRA board as a “non-voting associate non-executive director” is chief operating officer of Healthinnova which provides consultancy services on “how to derive the most value from digital health investments”.

Meanwhile Prof Graham Cooke deputy chair of the MHRA’s board is a paid adviser to two medical device companies and an unpaid adviser to a third – DnaNudge which offers DNA-tailored diet products as well as being a provider of rapid Covid-19 tests.

The MHRA has a strict conflict of interest policy for staff and is currently reviewing its rules for advisers on its expert committees such as the Commission on Human Medicines and the advisory boards for herbal and homeopathic medicines to ensure “experts providing us with advice are independent and impartial”.

But it said last week that it had no plans to review the policies for non-executive board members who currently are permitted to have industry links provided they are declared.

Other regulators such as the Gambling Commission bar board members from accepting payments from or owning shares in companies in the gambling industry.

And last week a non-executive director of the Civil Aviation Authority’s board whose appointment was signed off by the Department for Transport resigned due to a potential conflict of interest because he owns shares in British Airways’ parent company.

Harry Cayton former chief executive of the Professional Standards Authority said it was valuable to have industry figures as board members and that there was “bound to [be] a level of crossover”. “The point is not ‘Are you on the board of the MHRA?’ but are you making decisions that relate to your interests?” he said.

But Prof John Abraham an expert in medical regulation and former policy adviser called for those involved in health regulation to be required to relinquish “all direct and personal financial conflicts of interest” in order to uphold public trust.

“The response by regulators over many years is that they couldn’t get the expertise that they need to advise. That’s just not very plausible because there are so many scientists and experts out there” he said.

In 2020 the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review led by life peer Julia Cumberlege raised concerns about conflicts of interest in medical regulation and called for an “overhaul of the culture” of the MHRA. “Steps should be taken to ensure that the patient perspective and the public interest always takes precedence over the interests of industry” the review said.

The MHRA said non-executive board members were appointed to provide “constructive challenge and advice on the strategic direction of the MHRA” through an “open and transparent process” operated by the Department of Health.

“Conflicts of interest are considered on a case-by-case basis on appointment and at the start of every board meeting” it added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzIyMTEzODM1MjIwMDE3NzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Novel phthalimides regulating PD-1/PD-L1 interaction as potential immunotherapy agents,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383522001770 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzIyMTEzODM1MjIwMDE3NzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

Detailed view of the red line segment in the chart above “Average White-Black Segregation 1968-2022.” Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

What You Need To Know Ragsdale Sutherland Shorthorns has been breeding cattle for 50 years



Kentucky ranks 8th in the nation for the number of beef cows on farms



The USDA recently committed $215 million to support the expansion of meat and poultry processing options

“Well I grew up on a farm my dad managed farms for the Brown family here in Prospect affiliated with the Brown Forman Distillery and I think there were four different farms” David Ragsdale a rancher with Ragsdale Sutherland Shorthorns said.

According to the University of California Davis cattle are the number one agriculture source of greenhouse gasses worldwide. Those researchers say each year a cow will belch 220 pounds of methane.

“Everyone used to think photosynthesis does not have much to do with farming but it has everything to do with farming” Ragsdale said. “If we rotate them and we retain some water on the property we plant trees and we do some other things I think we can benefit.”

Ragsdale’s goal is to offset the methane levels by rotating his herd of 50 cows every 10 days and making their diet easier to digest.

“We have a grass-based product that we feed non-GMO corn to and some soybeans meals. Most of the product that we use in supplementation of the cattle is non-GMO so it’s not been sprayed with Roundup” Ragsdale said.

Between showing cattle and selling beef Ragsdale doesn’t have a lot of downtime. He also knows there’s a need for more local beef processors.

“We’d like to do more but processors are backed up and I understand their dilemma. A lot of them are short of help and more people are processing beef” Ragsdale said. “I think 880 thousand head of cattle last year in the United States got processed by local processors more than the previous year.”

Kentucky ranks 8th in the nation for the number of beef cows on farms thanks in part to its climate.

“We don’t have very bad weather really” Ragsdale said. “We have some storms we have a few cold snaps but generally we can raise cattle on grass nine to 10 months out of the year. If we do it just right we can do it the whole year.”

The USDA recently committed $215 million to support the expansion of meat and poultry processing options. Cattle also counted for $1 billion in sales ranking second behind poultry.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sign up now to receive EE Times Weekend. SUBSCRIBE Stilt Homes Floods and Tinker Toys Deborah S. Ray I remember seeing the house for the first time. It was white with crisp teal-blue trim and it had banana plants growing in the front. No bananas. Just plants. And tall palm trees with pointy fronds waving stiffly in the wind that created shadow figures on the dry sandy dirt below. A long staircase of painted metal steps ran alongside the house going up and up and up until my eyes squeezed closed and my face crinkled up at the sun’s glare. When my watering eyes could open again I realized that we were actually standing under the house in the square of shade it provided on that hot day. What looked like boxes on Tinker Toy sticks to me homes built on stilts were fairly common in Darwin Australia back in the 1970s. A good example of architecture that works positively with the environment stilt construction along with large louvered windows kept air flowing around and through the house. Stilt homes also protected against the region’s many termite species some of which are known to build mounded nests 20 feet tall. They also helped keep the critters out — while wallabies bandicoots and colorful birds were perhaps pleasant surprises to see in the yard a six-foot python saltwater crocodile or three-foot frilled lizard were not. Primarily though stilts served to protect homes during the torrential rains of the rainy season. From December through March temperatures often hover in the 80s with humidity around 80% and are punctuated by monsoonal storms that can drop as much as two inches of rain per hour. Flash floods aren’t uncommon and they can down trees and power lines turn roads into rivers and even stop trains in their tracks — literally. Stilt homes allow such fast-running waters to flow freely below the home. November through April marks Darwin’s cyclone season which brings added risk of heavy rains and floods. Cyclone Tracy is the region’s most notorious cyclone which ravaged Darwin in the early hours of Christmas Eve 1974. Neighbors described clinging to the cyclone fence as 135-mph winds lashed 10 inches of rain down on them in 12 hours. In all 80% of the city was destroyed. Image: National Archives of Australia Photos of the aftermath show that stilt homes were no match for Cyclone Tracy. Interestingly though the stilts themselves survived the ravaging waters better than the houses on top fared the ferocious winds (see figure). Though crippled and crooked and creaking and cracking the stilts in many cases were still upright on their concrete pads. They still sustained the flooring above from falling to the ground. And they supported the weight of the broken homes the rain-swelled materials and the remnants of people’s lives for just a while longer. Now 48 years later I see photos of the destruction and am thankful to have moved back to the States just a few weeks before Cyclone Tracy hit. As for my family’s home the stilts the floor and the walls of just one bedroom — mine — survived and remained upright in the aftermath like splintered Tinker Toys. Power Electronics News Fighting Climate Change with Wide-Bandgap Semiconductors Power electronics is a fundamental pillar of the industry’s response to climate change and wide-bandgap semiconductors are instrumental in that response.

READ NOW What Is a 100-Year Flood? Barbara Jorgensen The 100-year flood standard isn’t exactly how it sounds: Your basement is under water so you have 99 years of grace. The 100-year storm is a precipitation event that has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Because the U.S. uses the 100-year flood as the risk basis for insurance rates it’s worth ahem diving into. The 100-year flood is the likelihood that an extreme precipitation incident such as a flood will reoccur every 100 years. Statistical techniques through a process called frequency analysis are used to estimate the probability. The problem of course is that floods don’t respect deadlines. A 100-year flood can happen two years in a row. Global warming is tied to extreme weather occurrences that can cause flooding such as heavy rainfall earthquakes (tsunamis) high tides cyclones and hurricanes. The melting of polar ice caps is raising sea levels. In order to gauge a 100-year flood baselines have to be established such as data about rainfall tides and river stage. Ten or more years of data are required to perform a frequency analysis for the determination of recurrence intervals. The U.S. Geological Survey explains it this way: Assume there is a 1-in-50 chance that 6.60 inches of rain will fall in a certain area in a 24-hour period during any given year. Thus a rainfall total of 6.60 inches in a consecutive 24-hour period is said to have a 50-year recurrence interval. Likewise using a frequency analysis there is a 1-in-100 chance that a streamflow of 15000 cubic feet per second will occur during any year at a certain streamflow-measurement site. Thus a peak flow of 15000 cubic feet per second at the site is said to have a 100-year recurrence interval. Rainfall recurrence intervals are based on both the magnitude and the duration of a rainfall event whereas streamflow recurrence intervals are based solely on the magnitude of the annual peak flow. The five worst floods since 1900 as measured by loss of life are: 1931: Yangtze River and Huai River China

1938: Yellow River China

1975: Banqiao Dam (Ru River) China

1935: Yangzte River China

1971: Red River Delta Vietnam In the U.S. the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was created by Congress in 1968. The NFIP shares the risk of flood losses through flood insurance and reduces flood damages by restricting floodplain development. It’s mandatory in designated areas. The Odd Story of Ravenser Odd Sally Ward-Foxton Spurn Point is a narrow spit of land sticking out into the North Sea from the North East coast of England at the mouth of the river Humber. Today it is a nature reserve popular with tourists but few know that this area once had a thriving port which was consumed by floodwater in the 14th century. “Yorkshire’s Atlantis” properly known as Ravenser Odd dates back to about 1235. Some accounts suggest the town was on an island composed of naturally accumulated sand and stones while some accounts refer to a sandy road from the headland. But unlike prehistoric Doggerland which sank into the North Sea thousands of years ago Ravenser Odd was a prosperous medieval port. Known for “forestalling” where ships bound for ports further up the river would instead be persuaded (sometimes by unscrupulous methods) to land at Ravenser Odd the town became a bustling metropolis by the standards of the time with houses warehouses a court a prison and a chapel. It had a town mayor and two members of parliament. At its peak the town had gained national importance with the king even chartering ships there to send supplies for his war in Scotland. Why then has nobody ever heard of it? While the town was already beginning to lose ground to the sea in the early 14th century on Jan. 16 1362 northern Europe was hit by a terrible storm called the Grote Mandreke (the “great drowning”). In England vast areas of agricultural land were deluged with waves of up to 30 meters crashing through sea defenses. Numerous towns and ports including Ravenser Odd were lost for good. Today a new study of the seabed is in progress using sonar; a professor of sedimentology at the University of Hull Daniel Parsons is hoping to find Yorkshire’s version of Atlantis. The study aims to find evidence of a harbor or sea wall that should still be intact under the waves and help raise awareness of the effects of coastal erosion and climate change on the region. LoRaWAN Saves Flood-Prone Town Deborah S. Ray Like many cities along the southeast and eastern areas of the U.S. the Town of Cary North Carolina receives a lot of rain each year — roughly 45 inches. And like many cities in those same regions the Town of Cary also has many flood-prone areas that are impacted by heavy rains and often exacerbated during hurricane season. Until recently it wasn’t uncommon for stormwater drainage systems to become overwhelmed turning streets into rivers turning basements into bathtubs and washing away properties. In 2019 town officials wanted to find a way to predict floods and better manage them as part of other smart-city initiatives. Two challenges quickly came to light: Sensing water levels and rise rates proved to be a challenge. Some of the creeks were monitored with cellular-based river-level monitors powered by tiny solar panels and batteries but after days of bad weather they would go offline due to a lack of sunlight to charge the batteries.

The town had already adopted a number of IoT solutions and had in place hundreds of siloed solutions that needed to be streamlined and scalable. The answer was end-to-end connectivity using a LoRaWAN infrastructure made up of sensors gateways and base stations. The LoRaWAN protocol uses LoRa technology as the physical layer that launches data packets from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. LoRa and LoRaWAN have been designed to work together and marry long-range transmission with the lowest possible energy consumption. This technology is perfect for small packets of data such as sensor readings and the lower radio signal is incredibly robust to interference. In addition LoRa-based battery-operated sensors are easily installed and can be used for a variety of solutions including water-level rainfall and flow-rate monitoring for flood predictions. LoRa devices wake up make a measurement and go back to sleep. Because they spend most of their life asleep they can last for an extremely long time on a battery. Architecturally the solution is a repeatable framework. It’s secure standardized and scalable. And rather than having 300 siloed solutions sensors can easily be added and analytics then provide insights needed to predict and manage heavy rains. Enjoying EE Times Weekend?

My first job was working for IBM Research in Yorktown Heights. When I graduated with my Ph.D. I could go into academia or industry. My dad was a professor but I didn’t want to become a professor as that was too similar. It’s a great and noble profession but I’m not the professor type. I chose something in the middle which was like an industry but a research arm of it. At that time the top two places were IBM Research and Bell Labs. I decided to do research for a few years and then moved into a product group. You can learn a lot in the beginning. Whatever decisions you make work out in the end but it’s good to start doing something more solid that is closer to what you studied. IBM Research was fabulous. We had a lot of famous people who were doing a lot of cool stuff. I learned a lot. If you could travel to any time in history what would you do? We’ve certainly had massive transformation in the past 50 years with semiconductors and computers but a lot of technology change happened in the late 1800s and early 1900s with the invention of electricity and the car. I’ve always been fascinated by technology change and how it affects society so I think that was a very interesting period. There was massive change in so many areas including science physics transportation and electricity. Look at the electric motor one of the most fundamental innovations and its impact on transportation. That would have been really interesting to experience. How would you describe your leadership style? I truly believe that you can predict the success of an organization by its energy and direction. Setting the proper direction for the company and aligning the organization with the right energy to pursue that direction is paramount. While there are many aspects of doing this successfully it’s important to establish a strong team with the best people in the appropriate positions. Management should be empowered to lead their teams with the right energy to achieve goals and objectives. The team is crucial. It’s also important to establish a work culture and environment that is focused on delivering the right technology with excellence. It’s my job to ensure we’re a diverse and inclusive company that recognizes all people contributing to our success and rewards the highest contributors. What book do you read over and over again? I don’t read any book over and over again but I quote a book over and over: “Good to Great” by Jim Collins. It’s a fabulous book when it comes to business. What advice would you give to early-career engineers? Your success depends on your ability and your initiative. Early in your career you can afford to take the most risk. You may be risk-averse as you’re just starting out but that’s when you should do more. Try different things based on a solid foundation of ability — something you’re good at. Even if you make a mistake you have time to recover. I tell my daughter “If you want to do a startup do it early in your career.” Right after college you may not know all the details so a few years at a big company can be useful to prepare you to try something more dramatic.

Ras Al Khaimah one of the smaller and lesser-known of the seven emirates said earlier this year that it planned to make laws about gaming in some resorts. On the same day Las Vegas casino giant Wynn Resorts said it would build a resort approved for gaming or gambling on a man-made island.

The announcements could mark an important moment for the Gulf a part of the Middle East that has traditionally had stricter Islamic rules. Gambling has long been off-limits.

Currently those seeking to gamble go to the likes of Lebanon's Casino du Liban or some Egyptian hotels.

Yet times may be changing.

Two people with knowledge of the issue told Reuters that gambling in some form would be permitted in the UAE. But they added it would be up to each emirate to decide whether and how to make rules about it - similar to how Sharjah does not permit alcohol sales unlike other emirates. They also said the policy change would happen soon without providing an exact date.

Casino and hotel companies that have moved into the UAE could benefit should Ras Al Khaimah make the way for other emirates to follow.

Caesars Palace which opened in Dubai in 2018 and is the only one of American giant Caesars Entertainment resorts without a casino told Reuters that it would examine any possibility of offering gambling in Dubai.

About 10 km along Dubai's coast from the Caesars resort digging has begun on another area to support a new resort by Las Vegas gambling company MGM Resorts International.

When asked whether it would consider introducing gaming at the resort MGM said ""gaming has not been part of the planning and there are no updates to our plans.""

The UAE government media office as well as the media offices of the emirates of Dubai Abu Dhabi and Sharjah did not answer requests for comment on Ras Al Khaimah’s plan to permit gambling and whether they planned to make similar changes.

Competition

The possibility of gambling plays out against a situation of strong competition in the Gulf with the UAE competing with Saudi Arabia to become a popular destination in a part of the world moving away from oil.

The UAE where foreigners make up 90 percent of the population has already moved in other areas to keep first mover advantage over Saudi Arabia.

The Emirates changed to a Saturday-Sunday weekend this year to move closer to international markets. A Friday-Saturday weekend is common in many Muslim nations.

In the past 18 months the UAE has made legal changes including decriminalizing alcohol use and situations in which unmarried people live together.

The country has also found ways to offer some games of chance.

In 2020 it started a national ""Loto."" Players bought a ""collectable"" picture of a UAE scene such as the Burj al Arab hotel for $9.50. The buyers were entered into a draw. Now players seeking to enter the draw buy a bottle of water to be given to a charity to win a top prize of 10 million dirhams.

The game is considered acceptable under Islamic law because there was an ""exchange of value"" in the purchase of the collectable or bottle.

Unclear path

Ras Al Khaimah stressed that its laws being developed by the recently created Department of Entertainment and Gaming Regulation would push for responsible gaming.

The Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority did not answer Reuters questions about how its plans would work alongside the federal laws against gambling.

Vitaly Umansky a gambling industry expert at the Sanford C Bernstein investment company in Hong Kong suggested that gaming in Ras Al Khaimah would likely be limited to foreigners.

The celebrity gossip website citing sources close to the singer says that a deal is close that will bring the residency to Planet Hollywood’s Zappos Theater beginning late in the summer of 2022.

“Sources with direct knowledge of the singer’s plans tell TMZ … she and her team are in serious talks with the people over at Planet Hollywood and will do the show at Zappos Theater — barring any unforeseen setbacks” says the website.

Weekends With Adele had initially been scheduled for earlier this year at The Colosseum at Caesar’s Palace but was called off at the last minute. The singer tearfully claimed the postponement was due to COVID issues causing production delays but rumors have swirled that her own team’s demands were slowing everything down and the show wasn’t ready to go up for its initial start date. Fans were notified just hours before the first scheduled dates with some already travelling to the city when the news broke.

Looking at the schedule for Zappos Theater it seems that the possibility of moving Adele’s showcase to that venue may be a tall order. Weekends With Adele was originally scheduled as Friday and Saturday shows on 12 weekends between January 21 and April 16. Zappos currently has nothing even close to a window of that scale to drop her residency into unless plans are to cancel an existing booking or move it to another venue (Caesar’s Entertainment owns both Zappos and The Colosseum and both are ticketed by Ticketmaster so shuffling shows is at least possible).

Only eight total Friday/Saturday holes exist on the calendar – the first weekend in June four weekends in July and the first three weekends in November. John Legend the Doobie Brothers Rise Against Shania Twain Pitbull and Miranda Lambert otherwise hold all of those dates (with a handful of additional weekends where either Friday or Saturday is open but not both).

The Colosseum at Caesars Palace is booked fairly consistently until early July but is wide open past a July 9 performance by Morrissey save for two weekends in late September held by Rod Stewart and then one weekend in early October with Van Morrison booked. Weekends With Adele is still listed on the page with every date remaining postponed-TBA.

Should the venue and Adele’s team come up with some kind of game plan that shifts the calendar around and brings Weekends with Adele to Zappos there would likely be additional tickets put on sale as it is a larger room than The Colosseum – 7000 compared to 4100. TMZ says part of the negotiation includes a large cut of the ticket revenues going to the singer which could be a monumental sum given the prices being charged when “platinum” surge pricing was turned on despite her use of the Verified Fan system that purports to keep all but fans out of the ticket-buying frenzy during the initial onsale.

Covering the first ever night of racing at Pompano Park which took place Feb. 4 1964 Earl Straight of the Fort Lauderdale News had this to say: “Harness racing has arrived in Broward County and it is going to be with us for a long long time.”

He wasn't stepping out on a limb. With almost no competition for the gambling dollar all forms of horse racing were thriving back then and there was no reason to believe that Pompano would be an exception. It was supposed to be to harness racing what Gulfstream and Hialeah were to Thoroughbred racing the wintertime capital of the sport. And for a time it was. A record was set in 1980 when a crowd of 18451 packed the stands as Pompano pushed its way past dog racing and jai alai to become the favorite nighttime outlet for South Florida gamblers craving action.

Straight didn't exactly get it wrong. Pompano lasted for 58 years but it's highly unlikely that back in 1964 he could have envisioned how harness racing in Florida would limp to the finish line in 2022. At a place like Pompano racing hasn't mattered for years. It became all about the casino and when a bill was passed in May of 2021 that decoupled casino gaming and pari-mutuel betting at Pompano the track's fate was sealed. Shortly thereafter the owner Caesars Entertainment announced that racing would cease at the end of the 2022 meet. The last night of racing was Sunday.

“I wouldn't call it depression to talk about the ending of racing at Pompano it's more like a funeral” harness legend and Hall of Famer Wally Hennessey who has stabled at Pompano every year since 1986 told harnesslink.com. “That's the way I feel. And that you can't control it.”

So what does this have to do with Thoroughbred racing? Plenty. If it can happen to Pompano Park it can happen to any racetrack running any breed. The threat of decoupling is real and it's not going to go away. It is a huge and ominous threat.

Most every casino company that owns a racetrack doesn't want to be in the horse racing business and most don't bother to hide their disdain for the sport. But existing laws in most states still require a casino to hold pari-mutuel racing in order to maintain their casino license.

That's not exactly the case in Florida. First we saw Churchill Downs Inc. find a loophole in the law that allowed them to replace racing at Calder/Gulfstream Park West with a jai alai operation and still keep their casino. The other casino companies in the state kept lobbying for decoupling and last spring they won the battle and the war. A bill was passed that no longer required non-Thoroughbred pari-mutuel operations in the state to conduct racing in order to have a casino.

It is of course significant that the state's two Thoroughbred tracks Gulfstream and Tampa Bay Downs were not permitted to decouple. But neither track was a threat to do so. Tampa Bay Downs doesn't have a casino and Gulfstream's casino is not a big moneymaker. Plus Gulfstream remains one of the most successful tracks in the sport and not at all a candidate to close down. But you can be certain that racino operators outside of Florida have watched the Pompano saga unfold. Caesars Entertainment has provided a how-to book when it comes to getting out of any obligation to hold racing and it's a blueprint others will no doubt try to follow. What state will be next?

The irony of the Pompano story is that from a handle perspective the track has never done better. Track announcer and director of racing Gabe Prewitt wasn't going to let Pompano go away without a fight. Mainly through social medai channels he began a relentless promotion of the racing product at Pompano. He created the #sendItInArmy imploring harness fans to bet on Pompano. According to Harness Racing Update from the track's inception in 1964 through 2014 there were just three instances of Pompano having a race card handle over $1 million. In 2021 handle exceeded $1 million 21 times and a record $1.7 million was bet on the closing-night card in 2021.

Pompano pulled out all stops Sunday ending with a 19-race card and guaranteed pools on its Pick-4 bets. Hennessey was listed to drive in 14 races. At 65 remarkably he is the leading driver at the track entering the night with 100 wins on the season.

Sunday was the last ever night of harness racing at Pompano Park but the casino forges ahead. It's not going anywhere and in time harness racing will be forgotten at a track that was once among the jewels of the sport.

What a shame.

Prat Off To Fast Start at Keeneland

In a Mar. 6 column I questioned why Flavien Prat would want to leave Southern California where he was the dominant rider in the colony. The thinking was that the competition was so stiff in New York and at Keeneland that Prat would descend to fourth or fifth in the standings at his new tracks behind stars like the Ortiz brothers Luis Saez and Joel Rosario.

Seven days into the Keeneland meet I can see that I got this one wrong. Prat will never dominate the standings in Kentucky and in New York like he did in California but he's made it clear that he's not going to take a backseat to anyone. With nine winners from 37 mounts (24%) at the Keeneland meet he is one behind meet leader Tyler Gaffalione and tied with Irad Ortiz Jr. for second. He has three graded stakes wins at the meet including the GI Madison S. and the GI Toyota Blue Grass S. aboard top GI Kentucky Derby contender Zandon (Upstart).

He's won three races for Brad Cox two for Chad Brown and one for Todd Pletcher. One of the keys to whether or not Prat flourishes in New York will be how often he is given mounts by Brown. Brown has started 29 horses at Keeneland and nine have been ridden by Prat.

There are more race dates in New York than there are in California and the purses are considerably higher. Those are among the reasons he decided to come east. He also believes it will put him in a better position to win an Eclipse Award. He took a big chance leaving his comfort zone in California but so far it looks like a good move.

A Huge Day at Keeneland

According to Equibase wagering on U.S. races has increased by 1.09% on the year and dropped by 2.37% in March. It looks like it's going to be a year where handle is relatively stable which is a bit of discouraging news after handle increased by 11.9% and topped $12 billion for the first time since 2009.

Yet the premier tracks keep churning out big numbers. On Saturday Keeneland set new records for handle in the Pick 4 and Pick 5. The Pick 4 handled $1357298 and $1539098 was bet on the Pick 5. The previous marks were set on days when the Blue Grass topped the card. And all-sources wagering for the 11-race card totaled $27304001 the second-highest single-day handle in Keeneland history. The record single-day handle of $28137728 was set during last Saturday's Blue Grass Day.

Yes Keeneland is supposed to do those kinds of numbers on a Blue Grass Day but not on any other day of the meet. It just goes to show you that when you combine good racing big fields innovative bets like the All Turf Pick 3 and reasonable takeouts the customers will respond."

If your frequent flier status leaves much to be desired you may believe that this dream will never come to fruition — but you'd be wrong.

Although each flight is different there are a few common traits that make flight attendants or gate agents pull strings for some lucky passengers.

To help you figure out how to make this magic possible flight attendants shared their top tricks and secrets with Travel + Leisure.

>>Capital One's Venture X rewards were made for the savvy traveler looking to upgrade their next trip like a pro. Those who spend $4000 in the first three months will earn 75000 bonus miles — and 10000 more every year as an anniversary gift. Learn more.

Know When to Ask

The first rule of upgrades is knowing when to ask. Kat Kamalani former flight attendant and creator of viral TikTok travel videos told T+L that passengers should start trying to score an upgrade while at the gate. Talk to a gate agent and let them know that you're interested in moving up.

""Once onboard there isn't anything we can do as a flight attendant"" Kamalani said of her airline.

Gate agents will typically have a list of frequent fliers who are first eligible for upgrades. So make sure to familiarize yourself with your airline's membership upgrade policies. But if there's no one on the upgrade list it could be your lucky day.

But the process may be different aboard different airlines.

""There are times when a flight has a weight and balance issue"" Lia Ocampo flight attendant and author told T+L. ""The flight crew will then ask flight attendants to move passengers from the back to the first-class or middle of the cabin. Then we decide who we want to move to upgrade.""

Passengers who have been kind — and maybe those who are smiling — are generally first to be considered for these last-minute upgrades.

Use Your Assets

Those traveling with a baby may have a better chance of receiving an upgrade. Make sure to touch base with gate agents before boarding and if you're able to get into a Comfort or bulkhead seat flight attendants may also give you a bassinet aboard long flights Kamalani said.

Ocampo shared that passengers should let gate agents know if you're traveling for a special occasion. But drop the information in a casual way if you can. ""Make a friendly conversation with the gate agent and talk about your occasion"" Ocampo said. ""You never know. That may give you and your companion the upgrade you're hoping for.""

Be Thankful

In the air as on the ground being kind and present with other people is the ticket to an enjoyable experience.

""If you just come on board and stick to yourself you're a great passenger"" Kamalani said. ""Even more if you are happy or kind to us. We get a lot of grumpy people that travel and take it out on flight attendants.""

Remember to make eye contact when your flight attendants come around and thank them for their service.

""A passenger who calls me by my name is someone that stands out"" Ocampo said. ""In my airline our names are etched on the flight attendant wings we are wearing and we introduce ourselves at the beginning of the flight. So when a passenger talks to me using my name it creates a culture of respect and recognition.""

Those who are looking to go above and beyond consider bringing a small token of appreciation for flight attendants — it could come back to you in the form of free drinks or snacks.

""Even just a simple candy bar or chapstick goes a long way"" Kamalani said. ""It's not needed but it will definitely get you special treatment."" Ocampo added that gift cards particularly those for a coffee shop are a ""favorite treat"" among flight attendants.

If you're bringing a gift stay away from home-baked goods and anything that could fall outside of dietary restrictions like something with chocolate or nuts. A handwritten note of thanks some flowers or a drawing from a child are all gifts that will stay with flight attendants long after you've deplaned.

Let’s be clear from the start: the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card changed travel rewards forever.

Even if you don’t have the card features on cards you do have are undoubtedly based on some bold bets from when the Sapphire Preferred launched like the end of foreign transaction fees.

But since those triumphant days an endless array of other cards have launched too and like any other business some new comers have brought new and exciting benefits to the marketplace too.

The recent addition of the Capital One Venture X card ushered in a new era of rewards albeit at a different annual fee point and a variety of co-branded cards like the new Aeroplan card are also looking to shake things up.

Which leaves an important question: is the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card “dead” due to all the new offerings? After changes of its own this year it’s not an easy question to answer. An 80000 point bonus worth at least $1000 toward travel may impact things.

Chase Sapphire Preferred Card: Then And Now

In 2021 the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Sapphire Reserve Cards underwent makeovers of their current offerings. Prior to these changes it was probably fair to say that the Sapphire Preferred was still a “good” all around starter travel rewards card but no longer much more than that.

It was getting beaten in earning categories it once championed like dining or airfare and didn’t have any particularly unique features outside of a food delivery pass and its clever travel protections which it still has.

The travel protections like trip delay and lost luggage were arguably the best features.

The 2021 makeover added a $50 annual credit when you book a hotel through Chase Travel — not bad for a $95 annual fee card — and bumped up points earning rates too.

The card now offers: 5X points on travel booked through Chase Travel 3X on dining and delivery services 3X on streaming services and a 10% rebate on the points you earn. In other words if you earn 100000 points you’ll get an additional 10000 each year.

Of course the same lucrative 1:1 points transfer partners also exist which means when it comes time to burn points there’s lots of airline and hotel options.

And — points can be converted into “cash” towards travel at a rate of 1.25X so 100000 points equals $1250 toward travel purchases via Chase Travel.

A key hack with this is that you can then earn airline miles on these tickets when you use points this way since it counts as if you paid cash rather than when you convert credit card points into airline miles to buy a ticket which you don’t get rewards for.

So Where Does Chase Sapphire Preferred Stand?

This is where things get tricky. The Chase Sapphire Preferred now earns 3X on dining which is a formidable opponent of the Amex Gold at 4X on dining. Sure it’s an entire point “per” lower but it’s a $95 annual fee card versus a $250 annual fee card.

The Chase Sapphire Preferred doesn’t offer 5X on “all” airfare like Amex Platinum but again it’s a $95 a year card instead of $695 like Amex Platinum. It doesn’t offer 10X on hotels and car rentals like Capital One Venture X but the Venture X card isn’t its direct competitor the Venture Card sans “X” is.

In reality there are only two close direct competitors in terms of annual fee and that’s the Capital One Venture (not the more premium Venture X) and the Citi Premier. If you have needs for higher earn rates or benefits it’s worth considering going up to annual fee cards at higher levels. If not here’s how these three cards break down…

Travel Earning Rates

Chase and Capital One each offer an opportunity to earn 5X on travel with the Sapphire Preferred and Capital One Venture respectively but only if you book through their respective travel websites.

For direct purchases with hotels or airlines Chase offers the same 2X on airfare of direct hotel bookings made with chains or airlines as Capital One Venture. That’s better than 1X but when you’re making large purchases earning 5000 points for a $1000 flight is nicer than 2000 points.

Citi Premier meanwhile offers 3X points on airfare and hotels booked directly with airlines or hotel chains and you don’t need to book through the Citi website. This is a lower earning rate than what’s theoretically possible with higher fee cards or via the Chase and Capital One Travel booking websites but it gives more flex to booking.

So if it’s purely about across the board earn rate Citi wins for flexibility but if you’re happy booking travel through the new Capital One Travel or Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel the Sapphire Preferred and Venture tie for the win thanks to the 5X earning on airfare hotels and cars.

Travel And Fee Credits

Should you expect big benefits from a $95 annual fee card or do those only really come from more expensive cards? Thanks to robust competition in the marketplace the answer is you can expect some!

Chase offers $50 toward a hotel booking made through Chase Travel each year which can make a big dent in the annual fee. The card also offers a complimentary ‘DashPass’ subscription from DoorDash which retails for $9.99 a month That’s basically circa $120 a year in value if consumed. Together that’s a $95 a year card offering $170 in credits.

Citi Premier for its part offers a $100 credit when you spend at least $500 on a hotel booked through ThankYou.com or by calling the Citi Travel desk.

Capital One has gone a slightly different direction offering (2) lounge passes to its new Capital One Lounges in various US airports and bundled in Hertz “Five Star” elite status as well as dining access. There’s also recently been new fee credits towards travel and lifestyle memberships like GravityHaus with savings up to $300 annually.

Again these are all pretty impressive for $95 a year cards with great earning rates and points transfer partners. A new 80000 point welcome bonus worth at least $1000 does not hurt in the slightest.

Where Does Chase Sapphire Preferred Fit?

The big question for the Sapphire Preferred Card and the others it competes directly against is whether they’re caught in the middle?

The no annual fee Chase Freedom Flex offers many great earning rates on travel and other categories just without the travel perks or points transfer partners and other low or no annual fee cards also push the boundaries too.

On the other end of the spectrum there’s the increasingly premium cards like the Sapphire Reserve Venture X or Amex Platinum which offer potentially $1000’s in annual value albeit with higher annual fees charged up front.

So is there a sweet spot with the $95 a year Chase Sapphire Preferred or is the card somewhat stuck in the fray? That comes down to personal choice as to whether the differences between the “no fee” Freedom are glaring. For someone who just uses cash back the answer is probably that the Freedom does enough.

But for someone who uses points transfers to airlines or hotels or appreciates the protections like primary rental car coverage Sapphire Preferred is clearly better.

Then that leaves the final question of whether you’re a super user and would benefit more from the higher annual fee cards with higher multiples and more in the moment travel perks than the Sapphire Preferred offers. Basically would you be better off with a card offering lounge access and more travel credits?

Where I come out? If you travel relatively infrequently the Sapphire Preferred is a fantastic starter card which is not “dead” in the market. It’s a safe choice with great perks and fantastic travel partners all at a price mosts people can stomach.

If you travel really frequently the other cards may but may not be better. Across the board though the Sapphire Preferred Card is more compelling in 2022 than it’s been in a few years so the only question is whether you need a card that does more for you less for you or whether this is just right.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nvb2wtdGhpbmdzLWRhbGxhcy1sb3ZlLWZpZWxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cool things about Dallas Love Field Airport,"While Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is bigger and offers more flights Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL) has a longer and richer history an impressive list of notable firsts and some hidden surprises.

DAL also hosts its own podcast. And during a recent two-part episode of Love Field Stories – Conversations on the Fly I had the honor of chatting with aviation consultant and historian Bruce Bleakley who shared his insider knowledge about DAL its role in aviation history and its art collection.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Bleakley is the former director of the Frontiers of Flight Museum located on the southeast corner of Dallas Love Field and one of the co-authors of a photo and information-packed book about DAL titled The Love Evolution: A Centennial Celebration of Love Field Airport and Its Art.

Here are seven of the topics we covered and some of the DAL secrets we learned. You can listen to – and watch – Part 1 of our chat here. Part 2 airs May 10).

How did Love Field get that romantic name?

Blueprint of Flight by Martin Donlin. (Photo by El Creative Inc.)

It turns out Dallas Love Field was not named for the emotion love but for a person named Love.

""The airport was started in World War I as a training field for army aviators"" Bleakley said. ""It was the tradition at the time when they established a new flying field to name it after an army aviator who had perished in the line of duty. And the next name on the list was Lieutenant Moss Lee Love who was from a prominent family in Fairfax Virginia. And that's how it came to be named Love Field.""

Today a 79-foot-long glass wall by artist Martin Donlin at the airport includes a portrait of Moss Lee Love based on one of only two known photographs of the aviator.

Dallas Love Field once had an outdoor observation deck

Open air observation decks were once standard amenities at airports. Today they are quite rare. Dallas Love Field had an outdoor observation deck in the late 1950 and early 1960s.

""And that is where a big crowd gathered on July 12 1959 to watch Lady Bird Johnson press the button to start the first engine for the return trip to New York of the first Boeing 707 flight into Love Field"" Bleakley said. There is no outdoor deck now ""but in the passenger concourse there are large floor to ceiling windows where you can look out on the ramp area and see the planes.""

DAL was the first airport to have a moving walkway

The first moving walkways in an airport were installed at the Dallas Love Field terminal when it opened in 1958. The airport had 32 gates back then and the moving walkways took passengers from the main terminal to the first gates of each of the airport's three long concourses.

Unfortunately ""they had teething problems with the first walkways especially with women's high heels as you got on or off the moving walkway. And sometimes extra-long dress"" said Bleakley ""They had to go back and do some redesigns. And for a time they had attendants there to make sure everything was going OK.""

There are still moving walkways at DAL but now they are used by passengers traveling between the terminal and parking garages B and C.

Dallas Love Field had an ice-skating and roller rinks in the terminal

When Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) opened in 1974 all the major airlines moved out of Love Field and over to DFW airport. ""That was part of the agreement they had made"" said Bleakley and only Southwest at that time still a small local carrier and a few commuter carriers were left. ""And there really wasn't much going on in the terminal building. It was a big open space.""

So for a little over a year the terminal was leased to a company that turned the space into the Love Entertainment Complex which had a roller rink an ice-skating rink movie theaters a cabaret and other amusements.

Love Field played a vital role the day JFK was assassinated

Today visitors to Dallas often make stops at the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza and other sites associated with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22 1963.

Dallas Love Field also had a role in that tragic historic day. On that morning Vice-President Lyndon Johnson arrived at Love Field in Air Force Two and per protocol was on hand to welcome President Kennedy when he arrived on Air Force One and became the first U.S. president to fly into Love Field.

After JFK's assassination Lyndon Johnson boarded Air Force One at Love Field to become the first president sworn in on an airplane the first president to take the presidential oath in Texas and the first president to be sworn in by a female judge.

Today there is a bronze plaque and a white light embedded in the spot on the DAL tarmac where Air Force once parked that day. A copy of the plaque which bears the timeline of that day can be found on a wall inside the terminal on the second level looking out on the tarmac. The markers were given to the airport by FBI analyst and JFK historian Farris Rookstool III who as a young boy was at the airport with his parents to greet JFK that day.""

First Love Field Airport artwork had a mistake

Today Dallas Love Field Airport is home to a large and impressive public art collection with many pieces that highlight the history and legacy of the airport. The bulk of the artwork was installed after 2012. But the airport's first piece of art – a terrazzo world map with metal inlay – was installed in 1957 as the terminal was being built. Look for it in the central terminal lobby and see if you can spot the countries that now have new names and the one American city that was misspelled on the map.

In the early 1970s famed artist Alexander Calder created special liveries for two Braniff International Airways aircraft: a Douglas DC-8 bore Calder's Flying Colors of South America artwork and a Boeing 727-200 was painted with Calder's Flying Colors of the United States design.

Calder did not just create the artwork and send it along. For both projects he was on site at Braniff's Love Field maintenance facility painting some sections by hand and supervising maintenance crews transferring designs he had painted on large airplane models to the aircraft.

""He brown-bagged his lunch. And stayed out at the hangar all day to make sure it was done the way he wanted it"" said Bleakley. ""There was one story that during lunch one day when working on the first plane – the DC8 – all the maintenance guys took their lunch break so Calder sat down opened up his brown bag and noticed he was seated next to a mechanic's toolbox.""

Calder had his palette nearby and by the time lunch was over ""he had put an abstract design all around the top and sides of this fella's toolbox"" said Bleakley.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL21qczA2MTM3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Douglas Edward Geiken Obituary,"Let the family know you are thinking of them

The Social Change and Mental Health Services as a government body will operate independently with its own directorate board separate from the Health Department where it previously operated under.

Acting Director for Mental Health Dr. Uma Ambi a dedicated officer with the Service acknowledged the Health Ministry for the recognition with the support of Minister Wong.

Board Chairman Cardinal Sir John Ribat said “It is important that this service for our people is recognized by the government as represented by the presence of the minister to proclaim its important place within the services of health in the country.”

He said he had witnessed many people approaching him for prayer for their family members who are having mental depression and disorder so it is a very important matter.

Cardinal Ribat urged those who are well to make those affected people feel that other people are with them in their moments

“All of us recognize that it is important that we have it standing on its own because we want to do important services for our people and I know you know that our families our friends and members of our community are suffering.

“So this service is to promote good mental health in Papua New Guinea prevent development of mental health problems and mental disorder among children the adolescents adults and the elderly” he said.

Cardinal Ribat added that this directorate would also work towards addressing the drugs that contribute to this.

“The government recognizes this service as important for our community because we are witnessing already within the youths our schools and our communities there is the presence of mental disorder among our people.”

WHO Country Representative Dr. Sevil Huseynova graced the occasion as her third official engagement since her arrival. She opened her remarks by saying ‘there is no health without mental health’.

“If you don’t have a peace of mind it is very difficult for us to function. Just as you know if you are a mother you are not in a position to take care of children your family if you are a father it is the same. You know if you are a son if you are a daughter you don’t have a mental status to be able to take care of your daily life daily work” said Dr. Huseynova.

She explained that there is a difference between those who are mentally sick and those looking for mental wellbeing. As one has a medical condition and the other is coming out due to our life and social circumstances.

Minister Wong took the time to acknowledge Dr. Ambi for their commitment and services to mental health in the country.

“You have to like what you’re doing and I applaud Dr. Ambi for pushing herself and always sacrificing to ensure that this mental health programme is continuing. As a government we fully support the work that she’s doing so that it ensures that our people had a chance for this service” said Minister Wong.

The Minister then signed the Proclamation that the Government has under the Mental Health Act 2015 declared the DSCMHS as a Statutory Authority and is the focal point for Mental Health & Psychiatric Services in PNG.",,,,,,

With the epic Shenzhou-13 mission drawing a perfect conclusion to the key technology verification stage of China's space station Tiangong the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) revealed on Sunday that six more flights will be arranged this year to complete the station's construction. Tiangong will then enter the operational stage that will run for over 10 years becoming a space ""home"" for all mankind.For the next step authorities with the CMSA disclosed at Sunday's press conference that they are developing a next-generation manned carrier rocket and spacecraft which will enable their return capsules to be reusable and support sending seven taikonauts in one go a significant boost in the payload capacity.After having stayed for 183 days in orbit the Shenzhou-13 crew safely returned to Earth on Saturday doubling the previous record set by the Shenzhou-12 to become the country's longest single-flight space mission.Hao Chun director of the CMSA said at the press conference that the success of the Shenzhou-13 signaled a perfect completion of the key technology verification stage for China's space station and six more flights are scheduled to complete the station's construction by the end of this year.With 2022 marking the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the country's manned space engineering project the completion of Tiangong is a key target of the three-step strategy for the project and an important symbol of China becoming a strong space power in the world he noted.The six flights will be the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft another supply run for the next shift to be launched in May; the Shenzhou-14 manned mission in June; the Wentian experimental module in July; the Mengtian experimental module in October; another cargo mission the Tianzhou-5 and a manned mission the Shenzhou-15.The Wentian module is equipped with the same living facilities as the Tianhe core module which includes three sleeping areas a sanitary area and kitchen facilities. Together with Tianhe they can support the docking of two manned spacecraft and accommodate as many as six taikonauts authorities said.

Timeline of the building of China's Space Station

Bai Linhou deputy chief designer of China's space station told the Global Times that the Wentian module is positioned to carry out space science experiments inside and outside the cabin. It has an airlock through which taikonauts can exit and a small robotic arm that can be used alone or combined with the large mechanical arm of the space station.It can also serve as a backup to Tianhe. If a malfunction occurs in the core cabin the Wentian module can replace it immediately improving the reliability of the entire station's operation Bai said.The other lab module the Mengtian has a cargo airlock. The small robotic arm on the lab module can grab payloads via the airlock and install them on the experiment platform outside the cabin.The verification and assembly work of the two modules are progressing smoothly. Upon completion the space station will form a T-shaped structure with a cabin room of more than 110 cubic meters.The Shenzhou-14 and -15 manned missions which will each have three members will meet and stay together in the station for about five to 10 days when the two crews rotate said Huang Weifen head of taikonauts training at the CMSA. It means that China's space station will have for the first time six taikonauts staying in orbit at the same time testing the station's maximum capacity for human stays in the short term.Next year China plans to launch its first large-scale telescope called Xuntian or ""survey the heavens."" It will have a 2-meter diameter lens which according to space.com a professional news website covering space activities around the world makes it ""comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope"" only boasting a field of view 300 times greater than that of the 31-year-old Hubble while retaining a similar resolution.China's telescope will conduct wide-area sky survey observations and carry out frontier scientific research into the formation and evolution of the universe dark matter and dark energy among others.In addition China plans to develop a next-generation manned carrier rocket and spacecraft to support the future routine of two manned missions each year. They will allow seven taikonauts to be sent to the station in one go and the return capsule for both the launch vehicle and the spaceship will be reusable.An extended segment of the space station is also under consideration so as to create better living conditions for taikonauts and better support for scientific experiments in orbit.As the International Space Station will possibly retire after 2024 China's Tiangong is likely to become the only operational space station in the world. In an exclusive interview with the Global Times on Saturday Bai said that China's space station is an inclusive one and has been designed in a way that foreign astronauts can adapt to.Once Tiangong enters the operational phase Bai said foreign astronauts will have two ways to enter China's space station - by a Chinese spacecraft or by their own spacecraft with a docking interface suitable to Tiangong.When asked whether China's Tiangong will become a station shared by all mankind Bai replied with confidence ""absolutely yes.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdnkubWlsL0Rlc2t0b3BNb2R1bGVzL0FydGljbGVDUy9QcmludC5hc3B4P1BvcnRhbElkPTEmTW9kdWxlSWQ9NTIzJkFydGljbGU9MzAwMTY1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USS Mitscher Returns to Norfolk After Surge Deployment,"Mitscher rapidly deployed in January to join the Harry S.

To start do you think of Easter as a literal flesh-and-blood resurrection? I have problems with that.”

That was the start of a conversation published in The New York Times on Easter weekend in 2019 one that still peeves me several years later.

For now let’s set aside the appropriateness of thumbing one’s nose at the premise of the religious faith professed by more than 6 in 10 Americans on that religion’s holiest day. Instead let’s examine what a prominent physician recently had to say about literal flesh-and-blood resurrection in nature.

It involves the butterfly but stay with me. The story is not the same one we’ve known since childhood — the symbolic metamorphosis of the humble caterpillar into an elegant winged creature. That in itself is astounding. But Dr. Milton Packer a Texas cardiologist explained in his essay “Two Caterpillars in Love” that what happens to the caterpillar on a granular level is even more miraculous than is commonly known.

Writing for MedPage Today Packer said that even scientists marvel at the transformation. First a caterpillar spends its days eating to store energy for what’s about to occur. Then when the time is right it is entombed in the chrysalis or cocoon in which it will essentially digest itself.

“During the larval phase the release of enzymes kills the caterpillar and destroys all its organs turning it into a mushy soup with nothing left of its former self. If one opens a larva there is no sign of the original caterpillar; it is gone — except for a few cells (known poetically as ‘imaginal cells’) that survive” Packer wrote.

“Then by some miraculous sequence of events a new set of instructions takes hold and the amino acids in the larval soup are rearranged carefully and meticulously into an entirely new organism. The imaginal cells emerge armed with the genetic instructions for the transformation.”

Things get even more interesting after that.

As the imaginal cells take over what’s left of the caterpillar’s immune system tries to fight off the “invaders.” It is no mere metamorphosis but “an entirely new organism” Packer believes.

“The fact that the caterpillar’s immune system attacks the new cells of the butterfly demonstrates that — biologically — the two insect forms are entirely distinct life forms” he wrote. “So essentially the caterpillar dies and is resurrected.” (The Smithsonian Channel has a short video that shows the process in amazing detail.)

In his essay Packer went on to describe how throughout the course of his career he has had to comfort grieving families saying all the right things so as not to destroy their hope of seeing their loved one again even though his training as a physician led him to believe that death is final.

That’s the belief of many people who point to science when they find it hard accept the claims of Christianity or any other religious faith. Show me the peer-reviewed studies they say. Show me the science. Lately “I believe science is real” has become a cultural thumbing of the nose expressed in yard signs as if people who questioned COVID-19 measures like masking think we are made of fairy dust and not atoms and cells.

There’s nothing with wanting evidence for what one believes. Even the great Christian apologist C.S. Lewis wrote “I am not asking anyone to accept Christianity if his best reasoning tells him that the weight of the evidence is against it.”

But on this Easter weekend anyone looking for hope that a physical resurrection is possible need not rely solely on what is read from the gospels at church services. Believe in science too. Believe in butterflies. Faith can go far on two wings and a prayer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd2ViLnVyaS5lZHUvaXBtLzIwMjIvMDQvMjY2Ny_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winter moth update April 16th,"Winter moth update April 16 2022

Winter moth eggs finished hatching this past week. Now and for the next week or two is a good time to check your apple and blueberry buds for winter moth caterpillars. Caterpillar frass (insect poop) is much easier to find than actual caterpillars. I’ve seen one small apple orchard and one blueberry farm in Washington County that should spray for winter moths within the next couple of weeks. And my two blueberry bushes in Charlestown have many winter moth caterpillars. You need to pry open buds to find frass or caterpillars. Apple buds are easier to check for caterpillars. It’s very helpful to use a magnifying glass to see caterpillars or frass.

Fig 1. Winter moth caterpillar found inside a blueberry bud once the bud was pried open. Caterpillar frass is also visible and often easier to find than a caterpillar.

We don’t have a good threshold to indicate the need to spray apples pears or blueberries for winter moths. Some Nova Scotian guides recommend spraying apple trees when 1-2 caterpillars are found in 20 buds (>5% infested buds).

A good time to spray for winter moths is from tight cluster to bud separation–when the flower buds start separating from the cluster but before blossoms open. So right now is a good time to check buds. If you find more than 5% of buds with caterpillars or frass you may want to apply an insecticide.

All common insecticides labeled for apples and blueberries control winter moth caterpillars well. Bt insecticides (such as Dipel) are also effective. Bt insecticides kill only caterpillars so don’t harm bees and other insects.

Fig 2 & 3. Tight cluster bud stage of apples and blueberries is the time to look for winter moth caterpillars. Blueberry buds are more difficult to check than apple buds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5Y29tbWVyY2lhbC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZXN0eWxlLzIwMjIvMDQvMTYvbW9uYXJjaC1jYXRlcnBpbGxhcnMtbWlsa3dlZWQtbWFydmVsb3VzLXBsYW50LzczMzE4NDIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From the Extension: For monarch caterpillars milkweed is a marvelous plant,"Jamie Daugherty

Milkweed is the host plant for monarch caterpillars making it a must for all butterfly gardens. There are several native milkweeds to choose from in Florida. Some options are listed below.

Pinewoods milkweed (Asclepias humistrata) is perfect for dry planting locations. Blooms March-June with white flowers.

Fewflower milkweed (Asclepias lanceolate) works best in areas with moist soils. Perfect for a rain garden or low area in your landscape. Blooms May-Augusts with red and orange flowers.

Aquatic milkweed (Asclepias perennis) is another option for areas with wet soils. Blooms May-November with white flowers.

Tuba milkweed (Asclepias tomentosa) does well in dry areas in well drained soils. Blooms May-June with yellow/green flowers.

Butterfly milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa) is another option for well drained soils and is available at our plant sale! Blooms May-August with flowers ranging in color from orange to red to yellow.

Tropical Milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) is not a native to Florida though it is often found for sale in garden centers.

There are several drawbacks to tropical milkweed though:

It flowers all year. This can confuse the migrating Monarch butterflies. While there is debate on how bad this is there is a chance the butterflies freeze to death in our winter. There is also an increased risk of diseases to the butterflies if they stay. To combat this cut the plants back in August to mimic the flowering schedule of the native varieties.

The plants available in stores may be treated with pesticides that can kill monarch caterpillars. Read labels carefully before purchasing.

What about pests? Pest management on caterpillar host plants can be difficult. You do not want to harm the desired insects but you do want to manage the less desired insects. One of the most common pests to milkweeds plants is the Oleander Aphid (Aphis nerii).

Before you reach for any pesticides or insecticidal soap check carefully for monarch eggs. Also check for ladybug eggs. Ladybugs are a great option for biological control. If there are no eggs you can use an insecticidal soap to manage these pests. Be aware of home recipes calling for dish detergents as they are not recommended for use on plants.

The detergents can harm or remove the plant's waxy cuticle resulting in the general decline of the plant. Replace the detergent with soap in the recipe or use a premixed insecticidal soap. Avoid systemic insecticides as they will kill the caterpillars and bees on the plant later.

Another option is to leave the pests alone and allow natural predators like ladybugs and predatory wasps to manage these pests. Choose what works best in your garden.

“The Cecropia Moth is North America’s Largest Moth!”

This amazing colorful insect is so big it can cover the palm of a man’s hand. Found east of the Rocky Mountains of North America it spends most of its existence eating as much as it can and then pupating. When it emerges as a moth its one job is to reproduce and die. It doesn’t even have a digestive system! On the other hand its other jobs may be to serve as a meal for a carnivore and/or delight humans with its beauty.

Five Amazing Cecropia Moth Facts!

Here are five things to know about this lovely animal:

The Cecropia is not only the largest moth in size but the heaviest in weight. It can weigh as much as 0.1 pound or 1.6 ounces.

Males are believed to detect pheromones given off by females as much as a mile away.

Bolas spiders mimic these pheromones and when the male arrives the spider kills and eats him.

They are univoltine which means there’s only one generation born each year.

One of the best ways to find a cecropia moth cocoon is to run your fingers through the grass at the base of apple or cherry tree saplings.

Cecropia Moth Species Types and Scientific Name

There are only one species of Cecropia moth. Its scientific name is Hyalophora cecropia. Hyalophora comes from the Greek words hyalos which means “glass” and phoros which means “to carry.” The species name comes from Cecrops I who was a mythological king of Athens.

Appearance: How To Identify the Cecropia moth

The Cecropia moth stands out because it is huge. Females can have a wingspan of five to seven inches. The wings are grayish brown and each one has a kidney-shaped red spot with a white center and red and white postmedial bands. There are patches of red at the base of the forewings. The body of the insect is furry including the legs with red and white bands on the abdomen. The abdomen is especially plump on the female. These bright colors are supposed to signal to potential predators that the insect is poisonous even though it’s not. Even its caterpillar whose body is full of bristles until its fifth instar isn’t poisonous.

The lifecycle of the cecropia moth mirrors the lifecycle of other silk moths. Soon after the female emerges from her cocoon she sends out pheromones to attract a male who is believed to be able to detect them as far as a mile away. He will probably find her and they’ll begin to mate just before sunrise and not finish until night. After this they’ll part ways. He’ll probably be on the lookout for another female and she will look for a good place to lay her eggs.

The eggs are whitish and mottled with red or brown and the female lays them on both sides of a leaf. The first instar of the caterpillar hatches about two weeks later. The insect’s lifecycle is made of five caterpillar instars and each instar looks quite different from the other. The first instar is small and black while the last is a huge frosty green creature with shiny yellow blue and orange knobs all over its body. Each instar lasts about a week.

After this last instar the caterpillar spins a crescent-shaped cocoon on a branch a twig or among blades of grass at the bottom of the host tree. Cocoons that are spun in the grass are larger than those found in the trees for they have more points of contact.

Once inside the cocoon the caterpillar turns into a pupa that will endure through the fall and winter and part of the spring. During this time the caterpillar inside the pupa is destroyed and rebuilt into the beautiful moth that emerges in spring and early summer. Like the caterpillar and the moth the pupa is not poisonous and is indeed a preferred meal for squirrels.

Cecropia Moth: Male vs Female

The sexes of the cecropia moth look very much alike but the male has a more slender abdomen as the abdomen of the female is full of eggs. His antennae are also larger and richly feathered the better to pick up the pheromones she secretes shortly after she ecloses or emerges from her cocoon. Interestingly you can also tell the sex of a moth by looking at the pupa. A female pupa has a slit in the middle of the fourth segment. In the male there’s a bump on the fifth segment in the shape of a kidney.

Habitat: Where to Find Cecropia Moths

H. cecropia prefers a somewhat wet habitat such as a swamp or wet meadow that lies east of the Rockies. Locations where the moth is often found include backyards orchards woods forests and fencerows.

Diet: What Do Cecropia Moths Eat?

This is easy! Cecropia moths have only vestigial mouthparts and expel what’s left of their digestive tracts when they emerge from their cocoons so they simply don’t eat. However their caterpillars spend all summer eating and eating and eating a variety of plants. Some are partial to maple leaves but they’ll also munch on apple cherry lilac wisteria willow elm larch birch sassafras and many other plants.

Those nether spirits were a bit scarce last summer in Lee and Carolyn Halbur's milkweed gardens along Fish Lake in Maple Grove. It was an off year for the monarch butterflies that the family has raised in prodigious numbers in seasons past.

""We were on track to have our biggest year yet but we lost a lot of them"" Carolyn said. ""Some were slightly deformed. It could have been the smoke from forest fires out West or parasites or something else — who knows?""

For the past five years the Halburs have tended to the rust-colored butterflies with bold black stripes on their regal wings. The couple have planted milkweed the monarchs' primary food source all along their .4-acre property.

They have collected butterfly eggs and larvae from the underside of leaves bringing them into their home for safety. Spiders ants and beetles find monarch eggs and larvae delectable. Birds fancy the caterpillars. Wasps chomp on the monarchs themselves.

When the eggs have hatched and it's time to let the monarchs spread their wings and fly they release the butterflies along the lake making a family mini-festival of it. The Halburs' monarch preservation efforts have earned them a Star Tribune Beautiful Garden honor in the paper's annual reader contest.

Passion of a convert

Their passion for butterflies sprung from their own growing environmental appreciation and education. About 20 years ago they initiated a lakeshore restoration project to protect the shoreline of Fish Lake where they have lived for 28 years.

The milkweeds are among the deep-rooted native plants that they use for shore preservation. Carolyn a fashion stylist carries more of the passion for the larger lake where the family often spends happy hours on their pontoon boat and where she water-skis. Lee swoons over the butterflies.

""It's almost a spiritual experience to see the metamorphosis that happens from this tiny speck of an egg to the pooping caterpillar to this beautiful monarch"" Lee said. ""It's a natural thing that's hard to get into words. How do you measure the beauty of a sunrise or sunset? What do you say in front of a great painting?""

If Lee a retired electrical salesman has the passion of a new convert it's partly because he used to have a negative view of their primary sustenance milkweed. He grew up on a farm in the southwestern Minnesota town of Iona. There milkweed was ""like the devil"" he said. ""We wanted to have more beans and corn. So it was something that had to be uprooted and destroyed.""

""Some people still feel that way sadly"" Carolyn said.

But all of that is changing. Monarchs are a charismatic species that migrate hither and yon without passports or visas. They count North and Central America as home and travel back and forth in a journey that's still a marvel. It takes at least four generations of monarchs to complete the round trip.

The cycle begins with a brood in the oyamel fir forests in central Mexico where they carpet trees through the winter. In the spring that generation migrates to the southwestern U.S. where they mate and die in places like Texas New Mexico and Louisiana. Their offspring travel north to Minnesota and Canada reproducing along the way.

Methuselah generation

The last generation is born in mid- to late summer. It is this brood that draws the oohs and aahs from kids and adults alike. These super monarchs which some call the Methuselah generation because they are so relatively long-lived travel all the way from Canada and the northern rims of the U.S. to Mexico's Sierra Nevada the country's highest peaks.

After that journey of up to 3000 miles they overwinter in Mexico then return to Texas and Louisiana the following spring restarting the whole cycle.

Late last August the Halburs gathered with their grandchildren to release the few super monarchs they had raised. Granddaughters Nora Reckinger 8 and Audrey Reckinger 5 were all smiles as the couple opened the cages and let the butterflies fly.

One did not want to go landing in the girls' hair.

""Aah"" Carolyn doted.

Also on hand that day was Kathleen Pomerleau. She and her husband Rich have been raising monarchs for years. They in fact are the ones who introduced the Halburs to the conservation effort and have coached them.

The private lives of monarchs

Kathleen is an expert on monarchs happy to talk about their private lives.

""The eggs are like ivory pearls"" she said. Those eggs are collected and later hatch into caterpillars. That's when the fun starts. Each caterpillar can eat a complete leaf a day excreting frass at the other end. The poop is collected on paper towels at the bottom of the cage. They grow exponentially in five instars or stages between molts before climbing up and forming the letter ""J.""

""In 24 hours they turn from caterpillar to chrysalis a little green pod"" Carolyn said. ""In eight to 10 days they break the pod and a butterfly emerges"" stretching out its soft wet wings.

It is that transformation that has transfixed humans for generations. Once people experience it close up they are won over Lee said.

""It's a natural thing that makes you convinced that there's life after death"" he said. ""Seeing that maggot of mush turn to a beautiful monarch you can't help but know that we're more than just a body. We're a soul.""

But it's not all spiritual wonderment for the Halburs who do get down to Mexico the monarchs' winter home from time to time.

""I probably see enough monarchs in the regular season"" Lee said ""so if I go into the wintertime it's for the beaches and the beer."""

Canada’s Nutrien the largest in the world with a $62.13 billion market cap closed July of 2021 at $59.40 and finished the second week of April at $112.00.

For context the company all retail investors have their eye on amid Tesla boss Elon Musk’s recent takeover attempt Twitter has a market cap of $36.09 billion based on a price inflated after news of the billionaire acquiring a more than 9 percent stake in the Big Tech icon made waves.

The release states that CF was advised without advance notice on April 8 by Union Pacific to reduce its shipments by approximately 20 percent effective immediately and that “noncompliance will result in the embargo of its facilities by the railroad.”

On April 11 Union Pacific issued a public-facing Status of the Railroad missive where it explained “Over the last few weeks our network has experienced some setbacks – including numerous service interruptions crew shortages in select areas and delays to our network – as we have seen our operating inventory continue to climb over the past 60 days.”

Fertilizer Prices reached +94% YoY an all-time high and up from prev. 72%.

While CF states that it “understands that it is one of only 30 companies to face these restrictions” the rail line’s public notice was more ambiguous “We have already identified and notified those customers who can help us manage the current congestion by reducing their rail car inventories.”

“If we do not see reductions to the operating inventory through their voluntary efforts then we will begin metering traffic after April 18th” Union Pacific added.

The story has received little media attention largely limited to a 270-word Associated Press rewrite of CF’s press release.

Industry publication Freight Waves also stated that the disruption wasn’t limited to one railway company. It reported that BNSF Railway Company informed regulatory body Surface Transportation Board (STB) in a March 30 reply to an inquiry by the agency that it had slashed service levels by 2 percent.

The STB’s inquiry was spurned by a March 24 call for help to the federal agency from the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) after farmers became unable to either purchase or supply grain because rail shipping was simply unavailable specifically affecting the ability of the livestock industry to keep animals fed and alive.

“One NGFA member has spent an additional $3 million on secondary freight in the last month to try and keep animals fed” the NGFA stated. “This is additional freight they should not have to purchase and this reduces available freight to others and makes the secondary freight market even more expensive.”

The Association added “Another example is an NGFA member that had to stop selling feed while it waited on a train that sat loaded at origin for 7 days due to a lack of available rail crews.”

The STB has summoned rail executives for an April 26 and 27 hearing to address the issues.

And it’s not just grain and fertilizer being affected. A trade association of ethanol producers recently complained that manifest and unit transportation delays of between 2 and 12 days have been suffered while West Virginia coal producers have complained there aren’t enough rail cars to ship thermal or metallurgical coal at all.

Union wars

BNSF like Union Pacific emphasized a major attributing cause to its service disruptions as being staffing shortages.

The firm’s reply to the STB stated that at the beginning of 2021 BNSF had almost 3000 train yard and engine staff on furlough but has since reduced that number to 450.

November of 2021 reporting by Freight Waves revealed that both BNSF and Union Pacific were in a fight with major labor unions over the implementation of a September Joe Biden Executive Order mandating COVID-19 vaccination for all employees.

RELATED ARTICLES:

By December both companies had suspended the edicts after the Biden administration ran into resistance at the federal court level.

The Federal Railroad Administration lists Union Pacific and BNSF as two of the top seven Class 1 freight railroads in the nation.

However the greater cause elucidated by the vaccine mandate wars may simply be ongoing and overarching disputes between the unions and their employers.

In January a District Court judge prevented Union Pacific employees from striking picketing or conducting a “sickout” over complaints arising from the company’s COVID measures.

In late March BNSF’s unions sought to pursue arbitration after opposing a recently implemented “Hi Viz” (high visibility) attendance policy that deploys a progressive discipline schema in response to various tiers of absences such as weekends holidays or missed calls.

The massive California maritime supply chain crisis in 2021 was likewise attributable to a dispute between the Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshoreman and Warehouse Union coiled around a contract negotiation set to come to a head in mid-2022.

In Canada a March freight disruption that hit Canadian Pacific Railway was also rooted in a dispute with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference whose members walked off the job amid an impasse over contract negotiations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhbWFybGVkZ2VyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzE3L2MtZi1tYWllci1jb21wb3NpdGVzLXVudmVpbHMtbmV3LXByb2R1Y3QtbGluZS1pbi1sYW1hci_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW1hcmxlZGdlci5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8xNy9jLWYtbWFpZXItY29tcG9zaXRlcy11bnZlaWxzLW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0LWxpbmUtaW4tbGFtYXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,C.F.

The Coca-Cola Company Began As An Experiment

The Coca-Cola Company that is today a multinational company was a product of an experiment by American pharmacist Dr. John Stith Pemberton in 1886. Coca-Cola however was incorporated as The Coca-Cola Company in 1892 in Atlanta by Asa Griggs Candler and is currently a public company owned by different individuals and organizations around the world.

How It Was Founded

John Stith Pemberton (July 8 1831 – August 16 1888) was an American Confederate States Army veteran and pharmacist. He is famous for his creation of the original recipe used in the production of coca-cola in 1886. The recipe came from an experiment he began in search of a treatment for his morphine addiction. He had sustained a saber injury to his chest during the battle of Columbus and was using morphine to alleviate his pains but got addicted to it. His plans to create an alcoholic beverage that could serve as an alternative to morphine without containing morphine were thwarted by the Atlanta and Fulton County temperance legislation in 1886.

Prior to the legislation he had created the “Dr. Tuggle Compound Syrup of Globe Flower” using extracts from a toxic plant called buttonbush and also “Pemberton French Wine Coca” created from coca damiana and kola nut. With the temperance legislation in effect Dr. Pemberton decided to develop a non-alcoholic variation of his French Wine Coca which became the renowned Coca-Cola recipe. He enlisted the help of Willis E. Venable an Atlanta drugstore owner while developing and testing this recipe.

The accidental mixing of the concentrated syrup with carbonated water resulted in the creation of the iconic Coca-Cola carbonated drink. Although the experiment did not turn out to be the medicinal alternative to morphine as he had hoped Dr. Pemberton still saw business potential in his accidental creation. This non-alcoholic beverage was sold as nameless fountain drinks until Dr. Pemberton’s staff Frank Mason Robinson inspired by the key ingredients in the recipe which are coca and kola nut came up with the name “Coca-Cola”.

Dr. Pemberton fell ill soon after Coca-Cola made its market debut and was unable to manage and finance the business. In a desperate bid to ensure the continuity of his Coca-Cola legacy and also pressure from his son who was more interested in money than carrying on with his father’s dream of making Coca-Cola a global success the patent for Coca-Cola was sold in 1888 to another pharmacist named Asa Griggs Candler for an estimated $1750. Dr. Pemberton died in August 1888 before Coca-Cola was incorporated. His only child and heir passed away six years later bringing an end to the Pemberton family’s hold on the Coca-Cola brand.

Carrying on The Coca-Cola Legacy

While John Pemberton started the Coca-Cola brand Coca-Cola as a corporation was founded by Asa Griggs Candler. Candler incorporated the brand as The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892. The company was valued at about $100000 at this time. In 1893 he trademarked the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola was being sold in every state of the confederate union by 1895. Candler’s success was attributed to his use of merchandising in his advertising strategies. The company witnessed exponential growth under Candler’s leadership with sales rising from about 9000 gallons of syrup in 1890 to about 370800 gallons in 1900.

The company went from selling syrups in gallons to having its brand in ready-to-drink bottles in 1899 through an agreement with an independent bottling company. This agreement allowed the bottling company to produce bottle and sell beverages under the brand name Coca-Cola. Despite being a huge success The Coca-Cola Company sold to the Trust Company of Georgia owned by Ernest Woodruff in 1919 for an estimated $25 million.

Woodruff’s son Robert Winship Woodruff headed the company as president and chairman from 1923–1955. Meanwhile on 26 August 1919 Coca-Cola was listed for trading on The New York Stock Exchange as a public company with its stock selling for $40 per share. In 1920 the company made its first stock dividend payment to shareholders.

Since then the company has remained the market leader of the soft drink industry. It is the most widely recognized brand in the world as proven by a study carried out by Business Insider which revealed that 94% of people all over the world recognize Coca-Cola’s red and white logo. However the survival of the beverage company is threatened by the continuous increase in health-conscious consumers and less access to water resources.

Notable Mergers and Acquisitions

As a public company Coca-Cola had the financial base to expand its frontiers. This meant that it was able to partner with companies with shared interests and the acquisition of companies and brands struggling in the market. One of these acquisitions happened in 1960 when Coca-Cola took over Minute Maid for an amount that was not disclosed.

In 1982 it made its first non-food asset acquisition when it bought the film studio Columbia Pictures for the sum of $692 million. While it was the owner of the studio Columbia released several hit movies such as The Karate Kid Ghostbusters and Stripes among many others. However Sony later acquired it in 1989 for $3 billion.

In 1993 the number one beverage brand acquired Thums Up an Indian brand of cola and two years later it also acquired Barq’s. The company went on to buy half of the shares of Inca Kola in 1999 for $200 million and eventually took over the brand’s marketing and promotion overseas. In 2001 it parted with $181 million to purchase the brand of smoothies fruit juices and bars known as Odwalla but subsequently announced the brand’s discontinuation in 2020.

In 2007 Coca-Cola acquired Fuze Beverage from its founders for about $250 million. In 2008 it bought a 40% stake in Honest Tea for $43 million and in 2011 it purchased the remaining 60% stake. Two years after the company purchased a coconut water company named ZICO for an undisclosed amount and also spent $2.15 billion to acquire a 16.7% stake in Monster in August 2014 with an option of increasing it to 25%.

The company bought a minority stake in Suja Life LLC a juice manufacturing company in 2015 and on the 30th of January 2016 it acquired a 40% stake in Chi Ltd. Exactly three years later it purchased the 60% stake left in Chi Ltd. Meanwhile in December 2016 it also acquired several of former SABMiller’s Coca-Cola operations. It went on to buy Topo Chico a Mexican brand of sparkling water in 2017 and on the 31st of August 2018 it reached an agreement with Whitebread to acquire Costa Coffee. The deal was eventually concluded on January 3 2019 with Coca-Cola parting with £3.9bn.

Also in August 2018 an undisclosed amount of money was spent by The Coca-Cola Company for the acquisition of Moxie. Also in the same month it became a minority stakeholder in Body Armor and on the 19th of September 2018 it purchased a Willunga Australia-based company named Organic & Raw Trading Co. Pty Ltd known for manufacturing MOJO Kombucha. On the 5th of the next month it acquired a 22.5% stake in MADE Group. The Coca-Cola Company also owns more than half (68.3% precisely) of Coca-Cola Bottlers Africa’s stakes.

Key Takeaways Coca-Cola was founded by American pharmacist Dr. John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta Georgia sometime around 1886.

The name coca-cola was inspired by the key ingredients in the recipe – coca and kola nut.

The Coca-Cola Company is today owned by different investors and companies.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffet is a major shareholder through his investment company Berkshire Hathaway.

James Quincey currently heads the company. He became the President and Chief Executive Officer in May 2017.

Net Worth of Coca-Cola’s CEO and Key Shareholder

The Coca-Cola Company is currently headed by James Quincey who became the President and Chief Executive Officer in May 2017. According to a report on the company’s fiscal year 2020 executive compensation information on the 4th of March 2021 five executives of the beverage company were paid an average compensation package of $8.6 million a 1% reduction compared to the year before.

Among these executives was the British-born businessman James Quincey who reportedly received a total of $18 million a 2% reduction from his 2019 compensation. 62% ($11 million) of Mr. James’s compensation was in stock awards. He was also paid a salary of $1.6 million $3.1 million in option awards a bonus of $960000 a change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings worth $760000 and $473000 in other compensation.

As of September 2021 he was worth an estimated $50 million and all his earnings have come from his salary incentives and benefits he receives for being a member of the management team of the Coca-Cola Company.

On the other hand Warren Buffett who is the company’s major shareholder through his investment company Berkshire Hathaway had a fortune worth over $104 billion until June 2021 when he donated $4.1 billion of his fortune to a philanthropic cause. The donation was in fulfillment of his pledge to give all his Berkshire Hathaway shares which is more than 99% of his net worth to philanthropy.

Even with his most recent donation which has reduced his net worth to $100 billion the billionaire investor is still worth more than two times what he was worth 15 years ago when he started gifting his Berkshire Hathaway stock annually to different foundations. He has donated $41 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock but despite that the Oracle of Omaha is richer than he ever was. According to Forbes he had a net worth of $42 billion in early 2006 but the reason why he is worth much more than that now even after doing away with $41 billion worth of stock is as a result of the massive runup in the value of Berkshire Hathaway stock.

Warren Buffett occupies the sixth spot on the Forbes 2021 list of billionaires. The year before he was among the ten billionaires on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans with the highest philanthropy score of 5 which means that he has given away not less than a fifth of his fortune. However if that was not the case he would have been worth almost $198.3 billion today. This would also have made him the world’s second-richest person behind Jeff Bezos who is worth $201.5 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

During the five-week program program students will break into four groups of three take on a business idea and develop a plan for a company. Later they will pitch their idea to area business leaders similar to a ""Shark Tank"" presentation.

Details of Stark's Youth Entrepreneurship Program

The program's goal is to get students excited about the prospect of starting a business said Leonard Stevens chief executive officer of the Minority Business Association.

As the second session started on Tuesday the students received tools — Google Chromebooks and a backpack — to help them in the program. The laptops are courtesy Spectrum and Charter Communications a partner in the program.

Students also heard words of encouragement from state Rep. Thomas West D-Canton and received some coaching from Nate Chester III a barber and owner of Chester's MopShop.

""I'm hoping and I'm banking that you'll be the next generation of entrepreneurs here in Stark County"" West said.

Crenshaw students embrace the Stark County Minority Business Association effort

This is the first year for the Youth Entrepreneur Program but Stevens wants to see it expanded next year. He hopes that teaching students about entrepreneurship might show them alternatives to college.

The Crenshaw students applied for the program after hearing a presentation from the Stark County Minority Business Association. Applicants were reviewed by a selection committee.

Stevens said the association which formed in 2018 spent two years developing the Youth Entrepreneur Program. Brenda Stevens — Leonard's wife and an educator retired from Malone University — developed the curriculum.

Students meet for two-hour sessions where they receive instruction and hear from a local business owner who also serves as a coach during the session. Students also participate in games and activities that help them develop their business ideas.

""We want to get they thinking about the community and thinking about the problems that they want to solve"" Brenda Stevens said.

The four teams brainstormed ideas for businesses during the first session and spent the second session selecting a business. The next two sessions will be spent preparing for the presentation which will be on May 10.

Leonard Stevens said he hopes to have four or five judges evaluate the presentations. He's working with Stark County Community Moving Forward to find local business executives who can serve as judges.

Funding for the program is through a grant from the city Leonard Stevens said. The association received $50000 and is using it for this program along with its Expanding Resources for All (ERA) program. This year there are 17 local businesses in the ERA program.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVlbGV5dHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8xNi93ZWxkLXJlLTQtc2Nob29sLWRpc3RyaWN0LWFuZC1jaGFydGVyLXNjaG9vbC1ncm91cC1kaXNjdXNzaW5nLWFkZGl0aW9uLW9mLWstOC1idWlsZGluZy1pbi0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New school in town? Weld RE-4 School District and charter school group discussing addition of K-8 building in ...,"The result of months of dialogue between the Weld RE-4 School District and a charter school group interested in opening a school in Windsor might become clearer this week when representatives of American Legacy Academy address the board of education on opening a kindergarten through eighth grade school in a Windsor neighborhood once designated as a site for an RE-4 elementary school.

American Legacy Academy personnel will appear before the five-person RE-4 board Monday evening during its monthly work session and meeting. The American Legacy Academy’s mission before the board will not only touch on the acquisition of 10 acres on Covered Bridge Parkway in Windsor’s RainDance neighborhood to build a school but also brief the board on an application to join the growing school district in August 2023.

The Weld RE-4 board of education’s work session is scheduled from 5:30-6:45 p.m. Monday and its regular meeting begins at 7 p.m. at Severance High School.

American Legacy Academy Inc. is a nonprofit behind the school which is a tuition-free classical charter with a plan to “offer a back-to-basics education in math economics science and language skills with a firm grounding in civic responsibility and character development” according to the school website www.american-legacy.org.

An American Legacy Academy education will emphasize the traditions of Western Civilization using study of history science math literature philosophy and fine arts also according to its website. The curriculum is based on a classical education model prepared by Hillsdale College in Hillsdale Michigan. The college’s Barney Charter School Initiative is an outreach program focused on the revitalization of public education through the launch and support of classical K-12 charter schools.

Windsor resident Stan Everitt one of the five founders of the academy and a member of the board of directors said late last week the group hopes to deliver the charter school application to the district on Monday.

“We’re trying to alleviate the capacity issue with voters not passing a bond and we’re trying to be an asset to the school district” Everitt said. “Our attempt is to try to unify the community under the component of our education. It’s in a neighborhood and the expectation is that families in the neighborhood will take their kids to the school. Right now those kids go to other schools and are bussed.”

In November 2021 Weld RE-4 voters — encompassing Windsor Severance and west Greeley — rejected a $179 million bond package to fund construction and renovation of schools including two new 73500 square-foot PK-5 elementary schools for 600 students to open for the 2023-24 school year at a combined cost of $63 million. One of those buildings was designated for the 10-acre site in RainDance.

A second American Legacy Academy charter school site in the Tailholt neighborhood of Severance is on hold. The land there is still in the hands of developer DEVCO Investors LLC of which Everitt was previously a partner he said.

In Colorado charter schools are public schools that operate through a contract with an authorizer such as the local school district according to the state department of education. Other potential charter schools apply to the Colorado Charter School Institute an 18-year-old administration created by the general assembly’s House of Representatives to approve or deny charter school applications monitor charter operations and assist in conversion of a school district charter school to the institute.

American Legacy Academy will submit its application to Weld RE-4 because the school district has been granted exclusive chartering authority from the Colorado Board of Education. Status as an exclusive chartering authority means the Weld RE-4 board of eduction approves or denies charter school applications to operate within school district boundaries according to Weld RE-4 director of communications and public relations Katie Messerli. The charter document or contract exists between the district/school board and the charter school.

“Exclusive charter authorization allows us to form a strong partnership with our charter schools and helps ensure that we continue to uphold the high academic standards for which our district is known across all of the public schools in our district (traditional or charter) ultimately for the benefit of our students’ success” Messerli said in an email.

Weld RE-4 has the same exclusive chartering authority over Windsor Charter Academy and other Weld County schools retain exclusive chartering authoring including Greeley-Evans Weld RE-3J (Keenesburg) Weld RE-5J (Johnstown/Milliken) and Weld RE-1 (Gilcrest).

Ascent Classical Academy of Northern Colorado another charter school in Windsor — on South County Road 5 — is authorized by the Colorado Charter School Institute.

A key part of Monday’s meeting will center on consideration of the charter group’s proposal to acquire the RainDance property that has been the subject of much discussion in the school district community dating to last year. While school district staff have recommended tabling the proposal at this point ultimately the board of education will speak on the land matter — which is a separate but parallel issue from American Legacy Academy’s application to start a charter school in the district.

“If the board decided to reject the proposal to obtain the RainDance property with the stipulation then that’s not a reflection of the charter’s application” Messerli said adding district staff has worked with charter group representatives on the application.

Everitt is retired. He was once a residential and commercial developer with the Fort Collins-based Everitt Companies a business started by his father and grandfather.

Everitt said his colleagues on the academy endeavor are chair of the board of directors Julie Babcock a retired attorney; consultant Craig Horton executive director of Academica Colorado a regional office of the Miami-based Academica that manages the establishment and operations of charter schools from building concept to curriculum resources; board member Kate Guden a Fort Collins-based real estate agent with children in the Weld RE-4 district; and board member Cheryl Brown who’s been a teacher and educator for 30 years.

Horton is a retired Fort Collins police officer who founded Liberty Common Charter School and he worked with Sheena McOuat on developing CIVICA Colorado a first-year charter school in Milliken. McOuat’s husband Corey is a board member with American Legacy Academy.

Weld RE-4 school district has long planned for the RainDance property to be the site of a K-5 elementary school. The property is owned by prominent Windsor resident developer and Water Valley Company president Martin Lind. The land is in the process of being deeded to the school district as part of an intergovernmental agreement with the town of Windsor.

In Colorado through intergovernmental agreements developers have two ways to contribute to school districts: by providing land — as Lind is doing with RainDance — or a cash in lieu of land arrangement where the developer would give a district money to buy land in another location.

Lind a Windsor High School graduate is a strong supporter of the charter school moving into the community. In February emails to Weld RE-4 interim superintendent Rod Blunck chief operating officer Jason Seybert and board of education president Russ Smart Lind made clear his desire for the charter to be given a chance in the district or he would again pull his support of a future bond measure.

Emails containing district communication with the charter school group about the RainDance property were obtained through a Colorado Open Records Act request.

Lind wrote in the email that he would deed the RainDance property to the school district with no conditions. Messerli said documentation is still being finalized.

“But be clear and for the record I also told you my companies will not support RE-4 bond issue if charter is not ‘enticed’ with opportunity to succeed in RE-4” Lind wrote. “If charter fails the architectural expectations of RainDance will be enforced or again I will not support a bond issue. I’m going to honor what is said I expect the same from you all.”

Lind opposed the Weld RE-4 bond last fall following an at-times contentious back-and-forth correspondence with school district leaders including former superintendent Dan Seegmiller. Lind said he changed his mind on the bond after watching the arrogance of a “tone-deaf school board.”

“I had to regroup” he said.

Lind said the architectural questions were related to the appearance of RE-4’s planned design for a RainDance building. The district and Lind disagreed on architectural matters Lind said.

Lind said late last week the presence of the charter school could be a path for the school district to successfully win over the community on a new bond. With the district working with the charter group on the land American Legacy Academy might then build a multimillion-dollar school — while saving that cost on a future Weld RE-4 bond Lind said.

“It’s no longer about architecture” Lind said. “It’s about being either dismissive and tone-deaf to the community or reactive and responsive to the community. That’s what this is about. I think if they’re proactive and they find solutions and they find middle ground then I think it’ll be so easy to support a bond and I think there are thousands of people in Windsor who feel the same way.”

According to the American Legacy Academy proposal the charter group will not buy outright the 10-acre RainDance land from Weld RE-4. Instead American Legacy offers a $2 million purchase price on the land. The group will then pay the district a percentage of that total based on the number of in-district K-5 students enrolled in the charter school by a target date in 2029 to be established.

The school district said it believes the land is worth $2.1 million according to an April 13 memo on the charter school proposal from interim superintendent Rod Blunck to board of education members.

“It’s totally appropriate from our standpoint” Everitt said of paying money to the district. “The necessity to deal with capacity issues with the bond failing and a neighborhood school. Charter schools don’t typically go into neighborhoods so we have a built-in student body and that gives the district and ourselves confidence that we’ll hit the numbers.

“It’s part of their trying to support a charter school and have the same fiduciary responsibility to taxpayers.”

Everitt said American Legacy Academy anticipates that by 2029 the school will serve 350 Weld RE-4 students in kindergarten through fifth grades. Blunck’s memo said based on correspondence with American Legacy Academy representatives the proposed initial building will be able to serve a maximum of 462 K-5 students with 25-26 students per classroom.

Blunck’s memo concludes with the recommendation to hold off on the proposal citing the district’s intention to build a needed elementary school on the site to serve 600 K-5 students and 64 preschool students. A new Weld RE-4-built school will relieve capacity issues at Skyview Tozer/Mountain View and possibly Grandview schools according to the memo.

Everitt declined to comment late last week on the school district’s recommendation until the charter group discloses its position to Weld RE-4.

Blunck wrote that the charter school proposal will still require an RE-4 elementary building for that region of the school district. American Legacy’s proposal that it will accommodate 350 Weld RE-4 K-5 students with a total of 462 K-5 students is fewer than the district anticipates it needs in a K-5 building.

The K-8 charter school could open with 300 to 400 students and have a total student population of up to 900 students at full build-out Everitt said. He emphasized those numbers are estimates.

A financial deal between American Legacy Academy and Weld RE-4 appears to represent a deviation from the process of how charter schools traditionally are built and started in Colorado. School districts do not sell or give land to charters according to Windsor resident and real estate appraiser Chris Ruff who was a developer on Windsor Charter Academy’s first building before the school opened in 2001 in the Diamond Valley Subdivision. Two of Ruff’s children attended Windsor Charter Academy and he later served on the school’s board of directors.

Ruff is also the chairman and longtime member of the Weld RE-4 long range facilities planning committee. The committee’s purpose is to advise the board of education on growth trends within the district and the need for new expanded or remodeled facilities to support student growth. The committee is comprised of community members taxpayers staff administration and town planners and managers from Windsor and Severance.

Ruff and committee vice chairman Dave Grubbs the principal at Grandview Elementary in Windsor presented an annual report to the board of education at the board’s March meeting. On the same evening Lind and American Legacy Academy representatives touted their plan for a school in Windsor.

The long range facilities planning report covered the ongoing growth in the district while asking how this growth is managed and what options are available to alleviate capacity issues.

Weld RE-4 schools are at 110.23% capacity in building usage and the rate is 95% when considering modular buildings according to the long range planning committee’s report. Modulars address extra space in classrooms but not in shared spaces such as gyms cafeterias and hallways. The capacity rate is 119.12% in district elementary schools in building usage and 94% in total usage with modulars.

“What are the core values and beliefs of the learning experience and how do facilities support those values?” the report said.

Ruff said based on his knowledge and observation and conversations with the Colorado League of Charter Schools he’s familiar with school districts giving away “old closed schools to charters — but that’s WAY different from giving away a new permit-ready site in a growing neighborhood.”

In Colorado non-charter schools — traditional public schools — are funded through bonds approved by voters. The bonds lead to debt that is repaid by taxpayers over many years.

Charter schools are built privately by the school and any debt incurred is paid by the per pupil funding from the state and district for every student according to information from the American Legacy Academy website.

Non-charter schools also receive per pupil funding for every student in attendance. This money goes toward paying staff and operating costs associated with running a school and educating students. At charters the per pupil funding is also used for staff and operating costs — along with the repayment of any debt incurred from building the school facilities.

These buildings and facilities are not paid by increasing taxes according to ALA.

Ruff said charters usually find their own land or build or repurpose existing buildings “before growing enough to be viable and fund their own facility.”

His entity Windsor Development Group developed the land and built and leased WCA’s first building to the school. WCA eventually purchased an additional parking lot more than a decade ago for $215000 and it purchased its current middle and high school for $8 million from WCA Holdings LLC in 2016 according to the Weld County Assessor website.

Ruff said Tom Roche of Roche Constructors Inc. was the original manager of WCA Holdings. Ruff said WCA Holdings bought the land out of foreclosure from Warren Federal Credit Union specifically for Windsor Charter Academy. Russ said WCA Holdings built and leased the middle/high school facility to Windsor Charter and later sold the building to the school.

Ruff said he does not believe it’s possible for American Legacy Academy to open a school by August 2023.

“There is simply too much process on a local and state level” he wrote in an email referring to design and engineering approvals building permits and state inspections “for either party to accomplish that so it is a false hope.”",,,,,,,,,

Two Texas cities were ranked among the least increasingly diverse cities in America.

According to a recent study Pasadena was ranked #4 right behind El Paso which was considered the very least increasingly diverse. The report conducted by Preply looked at census bureau data to analyze changes in four key factors including racial distribution multiracial as well as bilingual identity and foreign-born residents across 300 of the largest cities in the U.S.

When it comes to long-term investing in the oil and gas sector heavyweights such as ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) BP Plc (NYSE:BP) and Shell (NYSE:SHEL) tend to hog the limelight.

However overlooking mid-cap oil and gas stocks (market-caps between $2 billion and $10 billion) can mean leaving plenty of money on the table. Although these smaller companies tend to receive less analyst coverage as compared to large caps they offer more growth opportunities than large-cap stocks but exhibit less volatility than their small-cap brethren.

Many mid-cap energy stocks have handily outperformed their bigger peers in recent months with some now garnering Wall Street attention thanks to the energy crisis and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

To wit last week Piper Sandler came out with an exceedingly bullish oil note on the oil sector upping the bank's oil price forecast to $100+ through 2025. Though several banks have called for $100+ oil in 2022 consensus overwhelmingly expects prices to fall back to double digits in the coming years. Oil prices hitting records for a brief moment before falling back below $100 would be less impactful to oil stocks than sustained triple-digit prices.

Piper's view is predicated on long-term impacts to supply from the majors exiting Russia as the bank sees the exodus of talent leading to sustained production declines. The bank further believes US shale will take years to ""make a dent in the supply deficit."" Analyst Mark Lear believes US oil stocks are ""priced for $70 oil."" That is to say if oil prices fell ~30% and stayed at $70 forever his stocks would then be fairly valued.

Piper Sandler has recommended four mid-and small-cap stocks: Murphy Oil Corp. (NYSE:MUR) Centennial Resource Development Inc. (NASDAQ:CDEV) Laredo Petroleum (NYSE:LPI) and Berry Corp. (NASDAQ:BRY) raising all from neutral to buy. Murphy Oil and Centennial are true mid-caps with market caps of $6.5B and $2.5B respectively while Laredo and Berry are small-caps with valuations of $1.4B and $977.2M respectively.

All four stocks have posted impressive returns: MUR is up 144.6% over the past 12 months; while CDEV LPI and BRY have rallied 102.6% 129.3% and 40.4% respectively.

Here are the best-performing mid-cap oil and gas stocks during the first quarter.

Operated by the US-based energy corporation Chevron it alone produces about 1250 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of gas which is more than 50 percent of the total national gas production (2370 mmcfd). In fact out of the 20 gas fields in production across the country today 16 fields cumulatively produce only 15 percent of the total daily production while the remaining four contribute 85 percent. Next to Bibiyana stands the Titas gas field which produces about 400 mmcfd just about one-third of what Bibiyana produces daily. While individual wells in the Bibiyana gas field produce about 50-60 mmcfd on an average those in other gas fields produce four to 20 mmcfd.

All this data tells us why Bibiyana is considered a safeguard for our national gas supply chain. Obviously a major production glitch at Bibiyana will cause havoc in our entire gas supply system. This has never been clearer than during the recent gas crisis experienced on the first day of Ramadan. The day before the holy month started sand and dirt appeared alongside gas through the production tube in the gas flow line. This alerted the production personnel and six suspected wells in a single pad were closed to identify the affected well. Production is now down by 400 mmcfd and its impacts are too major to ignore. Many industrial units recorded low to no gas pressure which seriously affected their production capability; several power plants switched to oil for fuel; domestic cooking was disrupted to the frustration of people fasting; the CNG transport vehicles could not function due to the lack of gas at the refilling stations. Production resumed at the suspended gas wells a few days later except for the one well with sand and dirt flowing out with gas. Chevron hinted that gas supply would return to normal in a few days after the well with the sanding problem was fixed.

This is what happened when production from only six gas wells in Bibiyana—which has 26 gas wells in production in total—was temporarily suspended. What would happen if the same thing happened with 10 wells or 15 wells or if the present production plateau started falling gradually or dipped suddenly to a low level as experts have predicted? The consequence of a major decline in gas production at Bibiyana will be disastrous due to the fact that there is no alternative to this gas field in the country at present. In case of such a disaster the only option for Bangladesh to immediately fill the gap would be to ramp up its LNG import.

But increased LNG import will put more burden on our economy as the price of this fuel is still too high and there is no indication that it may go down any time soon. The Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) estimates that the present level of LNG import accounts for only 20 percent of the total gas supply in the country and costs Tk 44000 crore annually while the remaining 80 percent is supplied from local gas fields costing about Tk 6000 per annum. Petrobangla already feels the pinch for paying for the high import bill and has not received the subsidy it requested from the government. The bureaucrats in the administrative corridors do not seem to care much about what kind of economic equation they need to formulate should they need to import LNG double triple or quadruple the amount of the present volume!

Is the sanding in the Bibiyana gas well a wake-up call for Bangladesh? Sanding is the unwanted flow of loose sand with gas from an active gas well. This is a problem which if not controlled properly may cause equipment failure production decline pipeline erosion and so on. Eventually a gas well may cease to produce and have to be abandoned. There are several causes behind the sanding of a gas well among which high production rate also referred to as overproduction is an important one. High rate of production may cause formation damage and lead to sanding.

Is Chevron overproducing in Bibiyana wells? When this question was raised unofficially technical personnel said that Chevron maintained international standards of reservoir management and did not overproduce gas in any Bibiyana well. However data on the daily production of all the gas fields in the country are regularly updated on the Petrobangla website—a practice much appreciated in the public domain. The Petrobangla data shows that Bibiyana has a production capacity of 1200 mmcfd while the actual production is in the range of 1250 to 1300 mmcfd. Is this not a case of overproduction? When this question was asked to the technical person again in an unofficial communication they said the production capacity of Bibiyana was 1300 mmcfd not 1200. Chevron has supposedly given this information to Petrobangla several times and has sent a letter requesting a correction on its website but Petrobangla has not complied yet.

Does Petrobangla accept Chevron's claim that Bibiyana's production capacity is 1300 mmcfd or does it not? It is a very important question because if Petrobangla maintains that Bibiyana's production capacity is 1200 mmcfd then it should direct Chevron not to overproduce gas at that field. This is a crucial technical issue that should be settled amicably between Petrobangla and Chevron. Bangladesh cannot meet its gas demand and supply shortfall runs between 800 and 900 mmcfd. An undersupply gas network system cannot risk overproduction because it may lead to formation damage and eventually the loss of the active gas wells.

Bangladesh seems to be ill-prepared to manage a sudden shortfall in gas supply from the existing gas fields. The main reason behind that is in spite of having highly prospective gas reserves by global standards the country never undertook robust and sustained exploration of gas in potential land or offshore reserves. Bangladesh's success over securing a large sea area from Myanmar and India was followed by joyful celebration only. We have not learnt from Myanmar and India's successful exploration and discovery of large gas reserves in their respective areas in the Bay of Bengal. We have to wake up and do the needful to begin gas exploration to avoid a major energy crisis.

A popular Uptown restaurant is getting attention for more than just its food.

If you’ve ever been to Chipotle on Hennepin Avenue you’ve like driven through the waters of what’s been dubbed ""Lake Chipotle"" in the parking lot.

With the reflection of orange cones passing cars and boney trees if you know you know. But Uptown’s best-kept secret is getting out in a big way. Lake Chipotle formed by a poorly graded parking lot is all the talk.

""I’ve lived here for three years and it’s been a running joke with me and my friends for like two years but I guess everyone has the same joke"" said Grace Vieth.

The Mexican grill actually went lakeside all the way back in 2013 but only recently has Lake Chipotle shown up on Google Maps TikTok and the watery gem now even has its own website.

FOX 9 contacted LC Tourism for an interview and received a statement which said in part:

""Exposing secrets can ruin the magic just as it would with the Easter bunny this coming weekend!

""Tourism at the Lake is managed by one or a team of persons or maybe several raccoons.""

Also adding: ""We have no plans to offer guided tours.""

We’re told there’s hope the lake will be designated a wetland but that the most crucial issue is if it will be preserved in the Hennepin Avenue redesign. Uptowners are hoping it stays forever.

""Something dark would be happening in the world if Lake Chipotle dried up"" said Vieth. ""I’d be concerned.""

Restaurant management might be the only one wishing the lake would dry up but that doesn’t seem likely with it pretty much becoming a year-round attraction now.

The fast-food chain is teaming up with tech startup Miso Robotics to test a new automated coffee brewing system at two restaurants in Nashville Tennessee.

Panera is the first company to pilot the CookRight Coffee system which monitors the volume temperature and time data of coffee. The system combines this data with predictive analytics to assist restaurant staff as they brew batches.

The goal is to help staff monitor and brew fresh coffee at the right time for customers. The restaurant’s plan is to help employees invest more time in other daily tasks like helping customers — not to cut labor costs.

“We never saw this as cost savings or a defense against the labor market at all” Panera’s SVP and chief digital officer George Hanson told CNBC. “I do see the industry very curious about (automation) but maybe in some areas I’ve seen that curiosity come from the cost of labor and that’s just not our filter.”

There are 80 Panera Bread restaurants in New Jersey.

Neither Panera nor Miso Robotics has said whether the test will expand into other cities this year.

“Panera will use learnings from its customers and employees to decide on its deployment strategy” a spokesperson for Miso Robotics said.

The chain isn’t the first fast-food restaurant turning to automation — and Miso Robotics — for food service.

Chipotle Mexican Grill began testing a robot named Chippy to cook tortilla chips in March and White Castle installed Miso’s Flippy 2 robot in 100 of its restaurants in February to fry burgers.

Miso Robotics CEO Mike Bell told CNBC the company has “seen an ever-increasing tidal wave of demand” as the restaurant industry strives to tackle the current labor gap.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

Akan tetapi hubungan itu mendapat cibiran lantaran keduanya diduga memiliki sejumlah perbedaan.

Agnez Mo yang berusia 35 tahun memiliki jarak 13 tahun dengan Adam Rosyadi. Selain itu mereka diduga menganut keyakinan berbeda.

Namun keduanya memilih tidak peduli dengan komentar warganet. Mereka justru membagikan momen kemesraan lewat akun Instagram keduanya.

Baru-baru ini pelantun Patience itu membagikan alasan mengapa ia mengagumi Adam Rosyadi. Ia mengutip perkataan Rihanna tentang hubungannya bersama A$AP Rocky dalam sebuah wawancara.

“Hal yang paling aku suka tentang kita bahwa kejujuran adalah segalanya. Jujur tentang perasaan tujuan hidup kita ketakutan dan rasa tidak aman. Kemampuan untuk mengatakan apa yang kita rasakan satu sama lain” begitu kata Rihanna.

Agnez Mo pun menambahkan tulisan itu dengan memuji hubungannya bersama sang model kelahiran tahun 1999.

“Itu mengapa aku bersama priaku sekarang. Seseorang yang membuatku merasa cukup meskipun aku memiliki kekurangan dan rasa tidak percaya diri” kata Agnez Mo.

Graphic by Francisco Wang

Over 54 billion spam calls were received by Americans in 2020. The average American received about 200 spam calls and 264 spam texts throughout that year. The sheer amount of unwanted communication toward one individual is staggering and it is steadily increasing as technology grows and attackers find new ways to target their victims.

Spam is unsolicited electronic communication from a source that sends repetitive information to a victim. The information that resides in spam is mostly advertisement-based and does not warrant any threat toward the recipient unless they choose to click on links or download files attached to the spam message. This may unfold into other attacks such as Trojans and Ransomware.

Meanwhile phishing is a form of electronic malicious content sent by someone referred to as a “cybercriminal” who impersonates a legitimate source and lures users into a sense of safety to achieve a goal. Once this relationship has been established between the cybercriminal and the victim the next steps are to guide the victim into providing any sensitive information that they can possibly retrieve. If you have ever encountered emails that guarantee a set amount of money a new piece of electronic equipment or a vehicle these would be ways in which phishers would positively reinforce the victims into releasing sensitive information. Their goal generally is to persuade the victim into providing them with personal and sensitive data and credentials.

Spam and phishing differ in the way in which they are generally used in today’s technological climate. Cisco defines spam as being generally used for commercial purposes. In this case companies all around the world utilize spam communication to push out many forms of advertisement at a very low cost. Cisco also reported that what makes phishing a unique entity from spam is that it is specifically and meticulously designed to target an intended individual or group who puts in a lot of effort to make the phishing message as authentic as possible.

Although spam is not necessarily as dangerous as phishing be mindful of both forms of communication. Do NOT click on any suspicious pieces of data such as hyperlinks or downloadable attachments. To prevent yourself from being phished:

Verify the authenticity of the sender. Whenever you receive a suspicious email that looks even remotely authentic verify that the email address that sent the email is one that you know of.

Whenever you receive a suspicious email that looks even remotely authentic verify that the email address that sent the email is one that you know of. This may not always be a concrete solution as many phishing attackers hack authentic email addresses to further prove their validity.

If the email address looks to be the one that you know get in contact with the sender preferably through other means of communication and ensure that they are the ones that sent you the email.

Do NOT download any attachments or click on any links . The attacker will utilize tools like links or downloadable content for the victim to click on. Usually these downloads or links are embedded with malicious software that will steal information from you deny you the use of your devices or accounts and even threaten you with a ransom that you must pay.

“Community Care of West Virginia purchased the former Citizens Bank of West Virginia building in December 2021” Vineyard wrote. “We are planning a significant investment in this building in order to provide superior care for our patients and expand services to the Upshur County community. We will continue to keep our patients and community apprised as the next steps take place.”

Good luck finding the Phillies on television tonight.

Thanks to a busy sports schedule in Philadelphia on Saturday night the Phillies-Marlins game scheduled to start at 6:10 p.m. won’t air on NBC Sports Philadelphia or NBC Sports Philadelphia+. Outside of a handful of small cable providers in the Lehigh Valley and central New Jersey the game won’t air at all on television.

Why? The network just doesn’t have space.

NBC Sports Philadelphia will air Game 1 of the Sixers first round NBA playoff matchup against the Toronto Raptors at 6 p.m while NBC Sports Philadelphia+ will air the Flyers game against the Buffalo Sabres at 7 p.m.

NBC10 which is airing a handful of Phillies games this season is locked into broadcasting the debut of the USFL at 7 p.m. even though it’s a simulcast of the same broadcast on Fox 29.

Instead NBC Sports Philadelphia will stream the Phillies-Marlins game on the NBC Sports app which is available on Apple TV Google TV Chromecast Roku Amazon Fire TV Xbox and Samsung. The game will also stream on mobile devices on the MyTeam app and on your computer on the NBC Sports Philadelphia website. You’ll need a cable subscription to watch any of the streaming options.

Subscribers who normally watch the games using a streaming service like YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV and fubo TV can also authenticate NBC Sports Philadelphia’s streaming options.

The Phillies-Marlins game will be available on television for a handful of cable customers according to NBC Sports Philadelphia:

Service Electric customers in the Lehigh Valley can find the game on Channel 902. Astound Broadband customers in the region can find the game on Channel 994. Optimum customers in Central New Jersey can find the game on Channel 206.

Phillies fans should get used to jumping through digital hoops to watch games since a handful of games will appear exclusively on streaming services this season.

Peacock will show two Phillies games as part of its new Sunday morning package – June 19 against the Washington Nationals and July 24 against the Chicago Cubs. Those games will be exclusive to Peacock where a subscription to its pay tier will set viewers back $9.99 a month.

Fortunately if you’re a Comcast Xfinity subscriber you can get Peacock for free. Anyone else will have to pay.

Apple TV+ will also show a couple of Phillies games according to sources at the MLB Network which is producing the telecasts. So far the streaming service has announced only the first half of its 12-week Friday Night Baseball doubleheader schedule. Apple’s game will be free though you’ll have to create an account on their service.

The project is to be located in the vicinity of the Fatehgarh-III substation of the interstate transmission system in Rajasthan . The project will be set up on a build-own-operate basis with the developer being responsible for securing connectivity and necessary permissions. Land will be provided by the central transmission utility on a right-to-use basis. The developer has to make storage capacity available for two operational cycles per day or two complete charge-discharge cycles a day.SECI will offtake 60% capacity for third-party leasing while 30% will be earmarked by northern and national grid operators for their ancillary services. But industry representatives said the project’s success will depend on viability gap funding from the Centre especially since 500% increase in lithium prices has made batteries expensive and will push up power tariff unviable for entities’ leasing capacity.But the ministry statement said the project is aimed at providing support for developing a market in the energy storage domain. Currently India is considered a low-priority market by global battery makers who are focusing on the US and Europe that are focused on storage-based renewable energy projects.However industry representatives said the timing may not be ideal because of the uncertain geopolitical situation in east Europe which has effected global trade and jacked up commodity prices.The government has set a target of 4000MWh of battery storage capacity as part of the plan to increase penetration of renewable energy in the national grid. A Central Electricity Authority report on optimal generation capacity mix envisages a battery storage capacity of 27000MW or 108000MWh — essentially four-hour storage — by 2029-30.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L3ZpamF5YXdhZGEvbm8tY29tcHJvbWlzZS1vbi1wcm90ZWN0aW5nLWNvbnN1bWVyLWludGVyZXN0LWVuZXJneS1taW4vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTA4Njk5ODMuY21z0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvdmlqYXlhd2FkYS9uby1jb21wcm9taXNlLW9uLXByb3RlY3RpbmctY29uc3VtZXItaW50ZXJlc3QtZW5lcmd5LW1pbi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTA4Njk5ODMuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No compromise on protecting consumer interest: Energy minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy,Vijayawada: Energy minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said the state’s power sector has to be both financially and physically resilient to meet the electricity demand in future and to address the existing challenges.

The company has worked hand-in-hand with the Orthodox Union to insure their drinks are holiday-friendly.

2 Yellow Coca-Cola caps are an indication that the soda is fit for consumption on Passover

What does the yellow cap in a Coca-Cola bottle mean?

Coca-Cola's annual yellow caps are back.

The switch from red to yellow is an indication that the soda is fit for consumption on Passover.

In 1935 Rabbi Tuvia Geffen the rabbi of Atlanta's Congregation Shearith Israel for 60 years worked with the iconic drink company to create a limited edition run of the original recipe for Passover according to Insider.

The caps are stamped with ""O-U-P"" - the Passover kosher certification symbol of the Orthodox Union - making it okay to drink during one of the most important Jewish holidays.

What does 'Kosher' mean?

Jewish organizations work with companies year-round to ensure that the food they produce is kosher and meets the standards of the Torah.

According to the Orthodox Union:

""The Bible lists the basic categories of food items which are not kosher.

These include certain animals fowl and fish (such as pork and rabbit eagle and owl catfish and sturgeon) most insects and any shellfish or reptile.

In addition kosher species of meat and fowl must be slaughtered in a prescribed manner and meat and dairy products may not be manufactured or consumed together.""

Jews observing Passover refrain from eating anything with leavening ingredients made of barley rye oats wheat or spelt.

They also avoid legumes and other grains like corn.

Coca-Cola is certified kosher year-round however its high-fructose corn syrup makes it unfit for Passover.

The yellow cap bottles are made from cane or beet sugar instead to make it Passover-friendly.

What is Passover?

Passover celebrates the liberation of Jews from Egypt known as the Exodus.

It is one of the most sacred festivals in the Jewish calendar and this year it begins on April 15.

The Jewish holiday gets its name from when God told Moses to instruct Israelites to mark their doorposts with lamb’s blood so God would ‘’pass over’’ their homes and let their firstborn sons live.

It is a time when families come together to have a special dinner called a Seder and remember the story of when the Israelites were liberated from slavery.

This year the holiday will be celebrated through April 23.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmludGVuZG9zb3VwLmNvbS9zdXBlci1uaW50ZW5kby13b3JsZC0xc3QtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktY29jYS1jb2xhLXNsaW0tYm90dGxlcy1hbm5vdW5jZWQtZm9yLWphcGFuL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vbmludGVuZG9zb3VwLmNvbS9zdXBlci1uaW50ZW5kby13b3JsZC0xc3QtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktY29jYS1jb2xhLXNsaW0tYm90dGxlcy1hbm5vdW5jZWQtZm9yLWphcGFuL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Super Nintendo World 1st Anniversary Coca Cola Slim Bottles Announced For Japan,"Coca-Cola has announced they will be having a special promotion to celebrate the 1st anniversary of Super Nintendo World in Japan.

A former Coca-Cola manager from Cheshire took more than £1.5 million in bribes of cash and tickets to Manchester United games. Noel Corry was the Enterprises manager at the firm and took bribes in exchange for helping favoured companies win lucrative contracts.

Between 2004 and 2013 the 56-year-old from Lymm provided Boulting Group – now named WABGS Ltd – Tritec Systems and Electron Systems with confidential and sensitive information which gave them an advantage over rivals when bidding for contracts.

At Southwark Crown Court on Thursday (April 14) he was given a 20-month suspended sentence along with Gary Haines 60 a director of Tritec Systems. While Peter Kinsella 58 a contract manager at Boulting was handed a 12-month suspended sentence according to the CPS.

All three have been ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and the companies themselves have been fined between £70000 and £500000 for failing to prevent bribery.

Corry who was a senior engineering manager responsible for identifying electrical services contractors for bottling plants in the UK was forced to sell his family home and hand over his pension savings to repay Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd £1.7 million when his nine-year scheme was discovered.

The court previously heard Corry was given bribes through payments for “bogus” contracts for Coca-Cola Enterprises in which work was never carried out or had the firm pay more than the actual amount charged for real work and was sent the difference prosecutors said.

By the time he was discovered and dismissed Corry had received at least £950000 from Boulting while Tritec Systems and Electron Systems had paid more than £600000 in bribes the court heard. Boulting which was said to have benefited by £13 million received a fine of £500000 while the other two companies were made to pay £70000.

Prosecutors said bribes would be made to Corry in the form of sham payments to a shell company he controlled through family members Trojan Ltd Alpha Windows – owned by his brother-in-law – or Axial Partnership Ltd a company in which he was a partner.

He also received hundreds of thousands of pounds as sponsorship or through other payments to Droylsden FC a football club also run by his brother-in-law and of which he was president.

Corry would also arrange expensive entertainment events through corporate events company Sports Management UK Ltd including one payment of more than £11000 for Manchester United season tickets which would then be paid by companies he favoured.

Corry had pleaded guilty to five counts of corruption; Haines of Market Drayton Shropshire entered guilty pleas to two counts of corruption; Kinsella of Manchester pleaded guilty to three counts of corruption and three counts of conspiracy to bribe. WABGS had pleaded guilty to one count of failure to prevent bribery; Tritec Systems pleaded guilty to corruption and failure to prevent bribery; Electron Systems admitted corruption and failure to prevent bribery.

Alistair Dickson of the CPS said: “Corry had established a corrupt culture in the procurement exercise awarding contracts to those companies whose senior managers were prepared to bribe him for doing so.

“Coca Cola Enterprises were wholly unaware of Corry’s corrupt actions to enrich himself. The contracting companies should have had in place compliance measures which would have prevented the payments being made and led to the corruption being exposed.”

The corruption amounted to £1.5m after the Coca Cola boss accepted cash bribes as well as free tickets to sports and entertainment events.

Noel Corry 56 a senior engineer for the Coca Cola firm took bribes in exchange for helping favoured companies win lucrative contracts from 2004 until he was fired in 2013. Corry from Lymm in Cheshire provided Boulting Group – now named WABGS Ltd – Tritec Systems and Electron Systems with confidential and sensitive information which gave them an advantage over rivals when bidding for contracts.

Corry had worked for Coca Cola in the Electrical and Automation division since October 1996 and was responsible for subcontracting site service work to a number of companies. The senior manager not only influenced the selection process but would personally lead the identification of the appropriate contractors.

Corry was forced to sell his family home and hand over his pension savings to repay Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd £1.7 million when his nine-year scheme was discovered. The court previously heard Corry was given bribes through payments for ""bogus"" contracts for Coca-Cola Enterprises in which work was never carried out or had the firm pay more than the amount charged for real work and was sent the difference prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said bribes would be made to Corry in the form of sham payments to a shell company he controlled through family members Trojan Ltd Alpha Windows – owned by his brother-in-law – or Axial Partnership Ltd a company in which he was a partner. He also received hundreds of thousands of pounds as sponsorship or through other payments to Droylsden FC a football club also run by his brother-in-law and of which he was president.

Involved in the corruption was Gary Haines 60 a former director of Tritec Systems based on London Road in Basingstoke who paid bribes of over £600000 to Corry in hope of further legitimate work. The court heard that Corry authorised payments for contracts between CCE Ltd Tritec and Electron for which in fact no work was carried out at all.

The third man Peter Kinsella was a Regional Manager at Boulting Group Limited (now WABGS Limited) reportedly developed a close relationship with Corry. The Coca Cola manager often awarded contracts to Boulting often when little or no work was actually needed.

Corry also supplied them with confidential competitive tender information about rival bids for electrical work at CCE Ltd sites giving Boulting a commercial advantage over competitors. Between 2008 and 2013 Noel Corry made almost £350000 from his corrupt relationship with Peter Kinsella and in their guilty plea the Boulting Group have accepted failing to prevent Bribery over a two-year period.

The three men appeared Southwark Crown Court on Thursday (April 14) for sentencing. Corry was handed a 20-month suspended sentence and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work and pay costs of £5000.

Haines of Pell Wall Market Drayton in Shropshire was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment suspended for 21 months and 200 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to corruption. Kinsella of Woodsend Road in Manchester was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment suspended for 21 months and 200 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to three counts of corruption and three counts of conspiracy to bribe.

WABGS Ltd of Chapel Road in Warrington was sentenced to a £500000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of failure to prevent bribery. Tritec Systems Ltd of London Road in Basingstoke was sentenced to a £70000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of corruption and one count of failure to prevent bribery.

Electron Systems Ltd of Chester Le Street in Durham was sentenced to a £70000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of corruption and one count of failure to prevent bribery. Each company was also ordered to pay £10000 in costs with each individual ordered to pay £5000 in costs.

Alistair Dickson Specialist Prosecutor of the CPS said: “Corry had established a corrupt culture in the procurement exercise awarding contracts to those companies whose senior managers were prepared to bribe him for doing so. Coca Cola Enterprises were wholly unaware of Corry’s corrupt actions to enrich himself.

""The contracting companies should have had had in place compliance measures which would have prevented the payments being made and led to the corruption being exposed.”

Detective Superintendent John Roch Head of Economic Crime at the Metropolitan Police said: “Corry Haines and Kinsella worked hard to present themselves as reputable reliable and genuine businessmen but in fact they were the exact opposite. Corry’s role was one of power; he was the subject matter lead within Coca Cola Enterprises UK and although he did not make the final decision on competitive tenders his opinion carried considerable influence with both the project managers and procurement team.

Ronin was a juicy target for a hacker. The blockchain project supports the wildly popular Axie Infinity video game which with an estimated 8 million players has drawn comparisons to action-driven collecting games like Pokémon Go.

Axie Infinity is hot and involves substantial sums of money. Players purchase creatures called Axies in the form of NFTs unique digital assets known as non-fungible tokens. The creatures can breed battle and even be exchanged for cold hard cash.

The game has swelled in popularity as players see the potential to earn real money. In 2020 one 22-year-old player from the Philippines reportedly bought two apartments in Manila with his earnings from the game. Last year another player said he earned more through Axie Infinity and other online games than from his full-time job at Goldman Sachs.

But the underpinnings of the game face significant security challenges. To play gamers must move their money from Ethereum to Ronin on a blockchain “bridge” system. Ronin is a “sidechain” of Ethereum – a scaling solution that allows transactions to happen faster than on Ethereum which is congested by the amount of activity it hosts. Hosting the game on this sidechain ensures it can grow without losing functionality. Bridges can hold a lot of money at once so by targeting the Ronin Bridge that transferred players’ assets between blockchains hackers seized control of the assets and took off with the money.

The US government said this week it believes North Korean hackers are behind the heist. But it’s just the latest in a string of brazen high-profile crypto thefts. In 2018 more than $530m was stolen from the crypto exchange Coincheck. In February hackers made off with $320m from the decentralized finance platform Wormhole (though that loot was eventually returned). And in that same month in perhaps the most publicized cyber heist of the year prosecutors charged odd couple Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan – also known for her cringeworthy raps on TikTok under the name Razzlekhan – with conspiracy to launder billions of dollars worth of bitcoin stolen from the crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016.

It’s a trend. In 2021 $3.2bn in cryptocurrency was stolen from individuals and services according to a crypto crime report by Chainalysis a company that provides blockchain data and analysis to banks governments and other businesses. (Ronin is also working with Chainalysis to trace the funds stolen in the hack according to Reuters.) The figure is almost six times this amount stolen in 2020. So far this year more than $1bn has already been stolen according to experts at Chainalysis and other security firms.

Vulnerabilities in smart contracts

The high-profile hacks and substantial sums of money involved have raised questions about how vulnerable the blockchain – long considered a secure place to store assets – is to such breaches.

Some experts say the rise in reports of cryptotheft come as cryptocurrency is more widely used and better understood than ever before.

“You basically have a lot of money on the table and on a very public table” said Nicolas Christin an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University who researches online crime and computer and network security. With large sums of money publicly moving around on these transparent systems it can be enticing for a hacker to pounce.

To understand how these heists are possible it’s important to distinguish between the blockchain and other programs that operate on top of it experts say. The blockchain itself is a decentralized public ledger that allows for peer-to-peer transactions. It’s the foundational layer that bitcoin Ethereum or Solana are built upon.

The second layer – the one that’s frequently exploited – are smart contracts that run on top of blockchains. Smart contracts are agreements in code that automatically execute when the terms of the contract are met. The common analogy is to a digital vending machine – select a product put in the correct amount of money and your item will be automatically dispensed. These contracts are irreversible.

The hackers weasel their way to the money through these second-layer systems by either taking advantage of bugs in the code or getting hold of the private keys that will let them into the systems explained Christin. Some hackers even subvert the smart contracts to redirect the funds into their hands.

In the Axie Infinity hack which targeted the Ronin Bridge the hacker obtained enough private keys to control the bridge and drain the funds. Since so many users had their assets in the bridge the payout was massive.

“Underlying blockchain protocol is secure” said Ronghui Gu founder and CEO of the blockchain security firm Certik. “But the programs – the smart contracts – running on top of them are still like other normal programs which can have software bugs and vulnerabilities.”

It’s common for hackers to try to exploit the code of one of their targets. And it helps that much of the code for blockchain programs is open source making it easily accessible for hackers who want to look over the code and find potential bugs.

“In this world people say ‘in code we trust’ but the code itself is indeed not that trustworthy” said Gu. When he started his blockchain security firm in 2018 Gu explained only a few companies used third-party security services like his to audit and assess their code – a critical security backstop – but he’s seen the number gradually tick up.

Crypto exchanges are also major targets for hacks. Exchanges are like banks they’re central entities that hold massive amounts of their users’ money and transactions are irreversible. Like bridges they are a middleman program that tends to be targeted. “Those big exchanges have a huge target on their back” said Christin.

Victims left with big security burden

Once crypto assets are stolen it can be a challenge for thieves to cash out especially if the heist is in the nine-figure range. That means funds are often left in limbo for years or even indefinitely. During that time the value of the stolen funds can fluctuate due to the volatile nature of the crypto market.

The Chainalysis crypto crime report estimates that criminals are currently holding at least $10bn worth of cryptocurrency the vast majority obtained through theft. Thanks to transparency on the blockchain it’s possible to trace these transactions and holdings but the identity of the perpetrator is hard to nail down until the funds are cashed out.

One can look to the Bitfinex scandal as a case study in attempted laundering. “The funds didn’t move for an extremely long time. And then when they tried to initiate the laundering process this was an opportunity for law enforcement to get involved again because people are following these hacks” said Kim Grauer director of research at Chainalysis.

For victims of the schemes there are few ways to recover assets. “If a bank’s security fails it’s not that bad for the bank” said Ethan Heilman a cybersecurity expert and co-founder of the cloud service BastionZero. “But if you’re a cryptocurrency exchange and someone empties out all your cryptocurrency that’s really bad for you.” Banks have measures in place to protect their clients that the blockchain lacks. If one’s credit card is stolen insurance policies ensure that one will usually receive that money back. On the blockchain however transactions are irreversible – there is no undo button.

That means there is a tremendous security burden on individual users to keep their assets safe. “End users may not necessarily be cognizant of the security risks that they incur” said Christin. “Quite frankly even people in the field don’t have time to necessarily go and review some smart contract source code.”

If one entrusts their keys to the wrong second-layer intermediary it’s possible that they could be a victim of a heist. Collectively most aren’t used to this responsibility.

Crypto companies are beginning to get more serious about security Heilman said but a world without hacks is not realistic he added. “You never become secure you just become more secure” he said. “So given the ease of monetizing a vulnerability in one of these systems I think that it is likely that we will continue to see things get hacked and the question will not be ‘is there a new hack this month?’ It will be: ‘how frequent are the hacks this month?’”

“There are important things that the industry needs to overcome in order to actually really grow and scale” said Grauer “because you can’t have a healthy growing industry if everyone is afraid of getting hacked.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIxNTUzNzUvb3B0aW11cy1lbG9uLW11c2staXMtZGV2ZWxvcGluZy1odW1hbm9pZC1idWRkeS1yb2JvdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk is developing fleets of domestic humanoid “buddy robots”,"Imagine: A humanoid robot in every household ready to fulfill our every want and whim. Chores like tidying up making dinner and mowing the lawn could be outsourced to AI robot butlers that have total knowledge of every family member room and object in the home.

That’s a vision of the near future that Elon Musk outlined at the TED conference this week. The Tesla CEO and Twitter’s wannabe owner said an “interesting prototype” of a robot he’s been developing will be ready this year. He expects production of Tesla Optimus as it’s called to start within two years; and mass adoption to occur in under a decade.

“People have no idea; this is going to be bigger than a car” he said in an interview with TED curator Chris Anderson filmed at Tesla’s new battery and electric vehicle factory in Austin Texas.

Musk says he’s cognizant that having robots with intimate knowledge of every aspect of our lives can lead us down dystopian roads so he’s implementing safety features like a localized computer chip that can’t be updated remotely; and quick commands that will instantly deactivate it. “Mechanically it will be slow enough so you can run from it and most likely overpower it” Musk said when he publicly introduced Optimus last August.

Musk adds that he believes that designing robots to be as human-like as possible will deter the AI from going amok. “It’s a risk I agree” said Musk responding to Anderson’s probe about unintended consequences of having fleets of Tesla bots running our homes. “I’m not saying that I have a certain answer to that risk. What I’m just saying is that maybe one of the things that would be good for ensuring the future is one that we want is to couple the collective human will to digital intelligence.”

“We’re already a cyborg if you think about it. The computer is an extension of ourselves” he said. (Musk also revealed that Tesla is in the early stages of developing a computer chip that could be implanted in human brains to achieve the a full symbiosis between machines and humans.)

Perfecting Tesla’s AI for self-driving cars

Putting a robot in every household is in part meant to help Tesla perfect its autonomous vehicle technology AI. In 2017 Musk said that his driverless vehicles would be able to travel from Los Angeles to New York City without incident by the end of that year. His prediction didn’t happen because the artificial intelligence didn’t develop as quickly as he’d hoped.

“It took me a while to realize that in order to solve self-driving you really need to solve real-world AI” Musk said. “The point you solve for a car—which is really a robot in four wheels—you can just then generalize that to a robot on two legs.”

Musk says the first versions of Optimus will be worker bots that can perform jobs that are “dangerous boring and repetitive.” He brushed away concerns that the bots will take jobs away from humans. “I wouldn’t worry about putting people out of the job thing” Musk said. “We’re actually going to have and already do have a massive shortage of labor.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1cnJpeWV0ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS93ZS1hcmUtZGV0ZXJtaW5lZC10by1tYWtlLXR1cmtleS1vbmUtb2YtdG9wLXRlbi1lY29ub21pZXMtZXJkb2dhbi0xNzMwMzfSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5odXJyaXlldGRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3dlLWFyZS1kZXRlcm1pbmVkLXRvLW1ha2UtdHVya2V5LW9uZS1vZi10b3AtdGVuLWVjb25vbWllcy1lcmRvZ2FuLTE3MzAzNw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We are determined to make Turkey one of top ten economies : Erdoğan,"We are determined to make Turkey one of top ten economies : Erdoğan

ANKARA

We are determined to make the best of these advantages of ours and make our country one of the top 10 economies in the world President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on April 16.

Addressing the opening ceremony of Phaselis Tunnel he said: “As we always say our greatest strength is our nation’s unity solidarity and brotherhood. If we allow no one to disrupt this climate of brotherhood focus together on our goals for 2023 and embrace our vision for 2053 there is no power that can stand in our way.

Erdoğan addressed via videoconference the opening ceremony of Phaselis Tunnel which is located on the Mediterranean coast road and enables easier transportation between the provincial center of Antalya and its western districts.

Drawing attention to the investments and efforts made in Turkey over the past 20 years for development President Erdoğan said: “We possess the means and capabilities to compete and even outperform in many areas developed countries whose infrastructures have worn out and become dilapidated and are no longer sufficient. We are determined to make the best of these advantages of ours and make our country one of the top 10 economies in the world. Cognizant of the fact that there is no gain without pain we see the hardships we are enduring today as the price for the great Turkey which we will achieve in the period ahead. As we always say our greatest strength is our nation’s unity solidarity and brotherhood. If we allow no one to disrupt this climate of brotherhood focus together on our goals for 2023 and embrace our vision for 2053 there is no power that can stand in our way.”

Erdoğan continued his remarks as follows: “Everyone in our country has safety of life and property. Anyone who wants to work is employed. Our state stands by anyone in need. Turkey is now in the most prestigious position of its near history. Things are going well in the production sector of economy too. There will be left no obstacle to prevent us from achieving our goals once we break the back of inflation as well. We see every newly-introduced service as a new step taken in this direction. I once again wish for Phaselis Tunnel to yield auspicious developments for our country and Antalya and thank anyone who has contributed to its construction.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYWJib3R0LWVsZW1lbnRhcnktdHlsZXItamFtZXMtd2lsbGlhbXMtY2FudC13YXRjaC10aGUtb2ZmaWNlLWFueW1vcmUuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Abbott Elementary': Tyler James Williams Reveals Why He Can't Watch 'The Office' Anymore,"‘Abbott Elementary’ star Tyler James Williams who portays substitute teacher Gregory Eddie doesn't deny 'The Office' influence but admits he can't watch it anymore.

Highly praised ABC series Abbott Elementary has garnered comparisons to the award-winning mockumentary-comedy The Office during its first season. However star Tyler James Williams admitted he “can no longer” watch the sitcom.

‘Abbott Elementary’ star Tyler James Williams can’t watch ‘The Office’

Speaking to Variety in an April 2022 interview Tyler James Williams admitted it’s “impossible” for their show not to get inspiration from the critically acclaimed sitcom The Office likening it to the “golden standard” of mockumentary-style comedy.

He also pointed out that a cinematographer and director on the 2005 TV show Randall Einhorn is an executive producer for Abbott Elementary and has directed six episodes. Therefore he understands the comparisons.

https://twitter.com/AbbottElemABC/status/1492196748990816261

However he admitted he “can no longer watch” the Steve Carell-led sitcom “because I don’t want to bring things in that I’m not even cognizant of.” He continued noting he would have to cut his losses with the popular show as he didn’t want to accidentally copy anything from The Office.

Williams compared it to the sports debate about the legacies surrounding Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls and LeBron James on the Los Angeles Lakers. He went on to call it “incredibly humbling” that viewers include them in “the conversation” especially as Abbott is just wrapping up its first season. The actor closed by admitting he liked being compared to a show of The Office’s caliber noting it’s a “fight” he’ll take daily.

Williams plays Gregory Eddie in ‘Abbott Elementary’

In Abbott Elementary Williams portrays Gregory Eddie a first-grade substitute teacher who initially applied for the principal position. However it went to Ava Coleman (Janelle James) who admittedly blackmailed the supervisor into getting the job.

He gets along well with the other co-workers and has seemingly developed a mutual crush on a second-grade teacher and protagonist Janine Teagues (Quinta Brunson).

However she has a longtime boyfriend Tariq Temple (Zach Fox). Throughout the first season it’s revealed that Greg takes himself seriously hates pizza genuinely wants the principal position and has a dad (Orlando Jones) who doesn’t support his career in education.

He has since become a full-time teacher and began dating kindergarten teacher Barbara Howard’s (Sheryl Lee Ralph) daughter Taylor (Iyana Halley).

He previously opened up about portraying Gregory in a 2021 interview

After the premiere episode aired in December 2021 Williams talked to The GATE about his portrayal of Gregory. The Everybody Hates Chris star pointed out the teacher is “a little different” from other roles he’s portrayed due to how seriously Greg takes himself.

He thinks the substitute fundamentally understands his job but brings a “military approach” to teaching six-year-olds. Therefore his character has to learn that teaching requires more than meeting quotas as the teacher has to make the material engaging.

Gregory is super excited about the possibility of spending more time with me tonight on an all new episode of @AbbottElemABC at 9pm on ABC. pic.twitter.com/3CmZrnu5Tf — Janelle James moody clown. (@janellejcomedy) January 25 2022

Additionally Williams spoke about his experience working with James a writer and standup comedian who portrays Ava. The principal frequently flirts with the substitute teacher during the show by calling him names that could border harassment.

Williams admitted it’s hard to keep his composure as his stoic character during these moments because he finds the standup comedian “very funny” as does much of the audience.

Yeah you read that right! Dubbed the “Irish Spring Nice-Smelling Gaming Shower” it is the world’s first product that aims to radically wash away the gaming sector’s dirt. Check out the details right below.

Irish Spring Unveils World’s First Gaming Shower

Irish Spring is primarily a soap and body wash manufacturing subsidiary of the Colgate-Palmolive brand. The company says that “when gamers are in the thick of battle taking down the big boss or competing in an all-out battle royale the last thing they want to do is put down the controller.” As a result many gamers admitted that they skip showering on most days to keep up with their grind. As per Irish Spring one out of five gamers admitted that they skip showers for their gaming needs. Thus the need for a gaming shower pod. . @TheBoiSantana just got to experience the 1st ever Irish Spring Gaming Shower Pod. Stay tuned for more… 🎮👃🚿 #SmellFromANiceSmellingPlace pic.twitter.com/YGf4b2kKhl— Irish Spring (@IrishSpring) April 4 2022

“Irish Spring is building off the momentum from its Big Game debut of the magical nice-smelling world of Irish Spring by creating the first-of-its-kind Irish Spring Nice-Smelling Gaming Shower” Emily Fong Mitchell the General Manager of Personal Care for the North American region at Colgate-Palmolive said in a statement.

So to help gamers take a fresh and relaxing bath without needing to halt their gaming grind Irish Sping has developed the Nice-Smelling Gaming Shower. It is a majestic gaming setup that comes with a transparent dome-shaped plexiglass exterior.

There is a classic gaming chair integrated within a dome-shaped structure. Underneath the chair there is a pool of water that submerges half of the gaming chair. Above the dome there is a wide three-monitor setup hanging from a scorpion-tail-like structure (a-la Acer Predator Thronos Air).

Moreover continuous appreciation of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar and receipt of record high remittances in March also instilled positive sentiments at the local bourse. Resultantly the benchmark KSE-100 index closed the week with a massive surge of 2157 points or 4.85% at 46602-point level.

“The benchmark KSE-100 index posted the highest growth in two years on a week-on-week basis” a report from Topline Securities stated. “This gain can largely be attributed to the of political uncertainty as Shehbaz Sharif was elected Prime Minister in place of Imran Khan who was removed from his office through vote of no confidence that finally took place in the parliament on last Saturday” it added.

The week commenced on a bullish note as the market skyrocketed by around 1962 points during the first two sessions of the week.

The benchmark index posted the highest-ever single-day gain of 1700 points on the very first day of the week as the oath taking ceremony of incumbent Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif marked an end to prolonged political turbulence.

The market players were seen welcoming the development with open arms as they speculated the resumption of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme soon.

On Wednesday however the market witnessed some across-the-board profit taking as investors weighed sentiments ib the possibility of Pakistan posting a record fiscal deficit of Rs6.4 trillion in 2021-22. Consequently the market receded by around 242 points amid volatile trading. The last two days of the outgoing week again witnessed a reversal in sentiments as the market added 436 points cumulatively to end the week in green zone. The remittance inflow in Pakistan surged to all time high of $2.8 billion in March which improved investor interest and triggered a buying spree at the bourse.

Continuous appreciation of the local currency against the greenback in the inter-bank market widely aided the bullish sentiments.

However a fresh round of political turmoil following country-wide protests against the newly-formed government capped the gains at the local bourse.

“We expect the market to remain positive in the upcoming week” stated a report from Arif Habib Limited.

“With commencement of the result season and clarity on the political front certain sectors and scrips are expected to stay under limelight” the report said adding: “Furthermore we are expecting the rollover of Chinese loans worth $2.3 billion and IMF negotiations which will help bolster our foreign exchange reserves.”

During the week under review average daily traded volume increased 213% week-on-week to 477 million shares while average daily value traded inclined 135.6% week-on-week to $66.3 million.

In terms of sectors positive contributions came from commercial banks (395 points) fertiliser (292 points) technology and communication (268 points) cement (241 points) and refinery (129 points).

On the flipside sectors which contributed negatively included real estate investment trust (2.19 points) vanaspati and allied industries (1.55 points).

Meanwhile scrip-wise positive contributors were Engro Corporation (152 points) TRG Pakistan (136 points) Meezan Bank Limited (122 points) Habib Bank Limited (85 points) and Systems Limited (80 points).

However negative contributions came from Colgate-Palmolive (Pakistan) Limited (14 points) Faysal Bank Limited (10.88 points) Fatima Fertiliser Company (4.74 points) Allied Bank Limited (3.18 points) and Dolmen City REIT (2.19 points).

Foreign buying was witnessed this week clocking-in at $1.29 million as compared to a net sell of $3.78 million the previous week. Major buying was witnessed in technology ($2.21 million) and fertiliser ($1.16 million).

On the local front selling was reported by mutual funds ($9.89 million) followed by insurance companies ($7.76 million).

Other major news included SBP’s reserves slipped below $11 billion banks approved Rs180 billion housing loans PTA renewed mobile operator license for $486 million cars sale surged 53.78% in nine months Rs1 billion Islamic finance facility for renewable energy power plants and the weekly inflation witnessed biggest rise since November.

The victim from Royal Palm Beach gave her statement and supporting documents to detectives in January.

She said according to the arrest report “[She] was recently made aware of a credit account in her name that had gone to collections. The collection company [name] was attempting to collect an unpaid debt they had acquired from the original creditor [name]. They told her she owed $5591.97 for purchases made at a [local] jewelry store.

“This collection request seemed odd to her because she did not open any credit account nor purchased any jewelry from [the store] so she began digging into what had transpired. She requested documents from [the collection agency] (which she provided during the interview). Those documents showed the account was opened electronically (online) on 3/18/2020 at 10:56 a.m. The listed lessee was [her name] residing at [an address in West Palm Beach]. The contact information listed an email address: [@gmail]. The items financed under this account were an application fee of $40.00 an XOXO bracelet of $370.00 a chain with Guadalupe charm of $185.68 a wedding trio set of $816.00 a Cz letter M studs for $60.00 and a fancy rope bracelet 8.4 DWT $953.00. (Total purchase on credit account $2591.61.)

“After non-payment the account was charged off on October 30th 2020. Due to [the victim] not living at the address listed on the bill she was not aware of any owed payments or that there was an account was opened in her name. It was only until [the collection agency] could locate her actual address that she was notified of what had transpired. When she was reviewing the documents she remembered [another] collection agency had reached out to her in 2020 about a Comcast account that was $797.13 past due. After [the earlier collection agency] contacted her she reached out to Comcast and was told the past-due bill had an address the same address as the [jewelry store] account listed in West Palm Beach. When she spoke to Comcast initially she thought it was a mistake because of the different addresses and she did not believe this was an identity theft incident. Now that she has received the information from [this credit agency] she is confident the Comcast account was also fraudulent.”

Detectives said the victim told them the Comcast account was opened in her name in 2014 when she lived in Bolivia after her divorce in 2008. She lived at two addresses in La Paz from 2009 to 2015 showed checking account statements from her time there as evidence.

But “After she made the initial report to PBSO she noticed something odd. When she looked at her ex-husband's Facebook page she saw he had a friend on his page named Claudia Molina. That name matched the Gmail account on the past due jewelry account which caused her to believe that this person had something to do with the fraudulent account opened in her name.”

The detectives investigated the address used on the credit application and Claudia Molina's name. They found out the address in West Palm Beach is the victim’s ex-husband’s address and he owns a 2016 Toyota Camry with Claudia Melisa Molina Ordonez 47.

Then they explained “Unfortunately Molina does not have a Florida ID but she did utilize her Honduras passport when they purchased the vehicle and due to this purchase she has some information listed in [a computer] which shows [the same address in West Palm Beach].”

Next they reached out to the jewelry store. The owner called back and told a detective the fraudulent purchase was made at their Military Trail location.

Then detectives got three subpoenas: to Google for the Gmail account to Comcast for their bill and to the collection agency that owns the jewelry store debt.

In March they learned from the collection agency that the credit application in the victim’s name for the jewelry store showed the victim’s information but the West Palm Beach address the other woman’s Gmail address a different phone number a different bank account number “and the listed income source/employer is Palm Beach Airport.”

The detective found out “The phone number listed [the 561 number] is working but what I called it the call was sent to voicemail with the recording stating ‘Please leave a message for Claudia Molina.’ When I did further investigation I found the number belongs to Molina and is a T-Mobile account.” So they got subpoenas for the bank and T-Mobile.

The next week they got results. The bank said the account number wasn’t in its database and T-Mobile said the phone number was active and assigned to Claudia Molina.

On Wednesday “April 13th with all the pertinent information gathered so far I decided to meet with Claudia Molina Ordonez at her residence [which is the West Palm Beach address]. When we arrived Molina Ordonez answered the door and invited us inside the house so we could talk. When we sat down at our kitchen table I confirmed her DOB email address (@gmail.com) and phone number (561-). After confirming that information I read her the Miranda Warning from a pre-printed TBSO card which she stated that she understood it but asked for it to be read to her in Spanish. [Another detective] then read the Miranda Warning in Spanish and after understanding it in both languages she agreed to continue our conversation.”

According to the detectives she said the only other person who had access to her email account was her 12-year-old daughter. Then they started confirming details from the credit application. She said the references were her two sons and identified their phone numbers. Also she verified the bank account her husband’s name and that he works “at the Palm Beach Airport.

After confirming all the information listed on the application I asked her if she remembered purchasing any jewelry two years ago. She said yes she did and it was from a value pawn shop. I questioned if she bought the jewelry from [the specific store] and she said no. She knew of the store and said it was inside the flea market and everyone knows [it]. I then asked her if she had purchased a wedding band trio set. She said yes but denied it was from [that store].

“After denying any knowledge of [jewelry from there] I showed her the application with all the information she had just confirmed with me and questioned her about the application. Eventually she admitted that she did apply for credit under [the victim]'s name and purchased the jewelry. I asked her what happened to the items and she said she pawned them.

“I then questioned her about a Comcast account opened in [the victim]'s name; at first she denied it but when I told her that the account was at our previous address on it [sic] she admitted to only doing that one time. Finally I asked her why she stole [the victim]'s identity and she said she didn't like her and was jealous of her. She was distraught and started to cry while saying she was sorry she made a mistake and was not a bad person.”

After the confession she was told she was under arrest. She was allowed to make arrangements for her daughter and was taken away when the babysitter arrived.

At the substation another detective found she pawned the jewelry.

Molina is charged with identity theft scheming to defraud and obtain property grand theft greater than $5000.

She was booked Wednesday at 2 p.m. and released just after 9 p.m. in lieu of $9000 bond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3RoZWF0aGxldGljLmNvbS80MTc5NzE3LzIwMjIvMDQvMTYvYm9laGx5LWNsZWFybGFrZS1ncm91cC1icmluZy1pbi1mb3JtZXItdWstY2hhbmNlbGxvci1nZW9yZ2Utb3Nib3JuZS10by1haWQtaW4tYmlkLXRvLWJ1eS1jaGVsc2VhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boehly bid brings in George Osborne to aid in bid to buy Chelsea,"George Osborne a former UK chancellor of the exchequer has been brought in to aid the Todd Boehly and Clearlake-led bid to buy Chelsea.

The consortium has hired Robey Warshaw a London-based advisory firm where Osborne is a partner to help try and close a deal for Chelsea.

Robey Warshaw is a specialist in advising on mergers and acquisitions which has worked on deals such as Comcast’s takeover of Sky UK in 2019 and BG Group’s sale to Shell.

Sir Simon Robey one of the firm’s founders is regarded as one of the best in his field.

Osborne 50 served as the chancellor from 2010to 2016 under the Conservative government led by David Cameron.

He is a close friend of Daniel Finklestein a Conservative member of the House of Lords who was brought in to the Boehly-Clearlake bid last month.

Osbourne who was born in London is also a season-ticket holder at Chelsea.

He was the MP for Tatton for 16 years before leaving public office in 2017. Osborne has also worked as editor of the Evening Standard.

Boehly a part-owner of the MLB franchise the LA Dodgers is leading one of three bids to take over Chelsea from Roman Abramovich.

The Ricketts family confirmed on Friday that it would not be submitting a final bid to Raine Group the firm charged with handling the Chelsea sale.

That leaves the Boehly-Clearlake bid along with one led by Sir Martin Broughton and one by Stephen Pagliuca.

Chelsea have been up for sale since March 2 with Abramovich sanctioned by the UK government eight days later.

Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 and has overseen a transformative period for the west London club who are now established as one of Europe’s top teams.

Erik Gruenwedel

Redbox Entertainment reported it lost $140.7 million on revenue of $288.5 million for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31 2021. That compared with a fiscal loss of $69.5 million and revenue of $546.2 million in 2020.

The legacy kiosk DVD rental company said it has been significantly challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic with a lack of new-release movie titles undermining consumer demand. Indeed in 2019 before the pandemic began Redbox reported a net loss of $7.5 million on revenue of $858.3 million.

Indeed Redbox said it released just 57 new DVD rental titles in 2021 compared with 68 in 2020 and 140 movies in 2019.

Throughout the first three quarters of 2021 Redbox released 33 theatrical titles at the kiosk which is typically what would have been released in one quarter pre-COVID. The bulk of the releases for 2021 came in the fourth quarter with 24 releases. Packaged-media rental revenue decreased 57% compared with 2020.

“However as content built throughout the quarter it was still inconsistent week to week and met with challenges from the outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19” Redbox wrote in the 10K filing.

Redbox said it generated $253.4 million in kiosk rental revenue in 2021 down from $506.4 million in 2020. The company realized 62.3 million disc rental transactions down from 146.3 million transactions in 2020. Redbox generated $35.1 million in digital revenue down from $39.7 million in 2020.

Digital revenue was also negatively impacted by the lack of new releases in the period versus a year ago reflected by a decrease of 11.6% in revenue.

Partially offsetting the declines was strong growth in the company’s kiosk servicing business and distribution of original content under the Redbox Entertainment label.

The company which has been aggressively transitioning to digital distribution including transactional VOD and ad-supported VOD now operates about 38300 kiosks nationwide — down from more than 41400 in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZnJhbm9pLmNvbS9wcm9maWxlcy9zcG9ydHMtYnJvYWRjYXN0ZXItZXJpbi1jb3NjYXJlbGxpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sports broadcaster Erin Coscarelli – Fra Noi,"While covering a variety of sports on the way to a pair of plum TV gigs Erin Coscarelli has helped pave the way for women in a particularly male-dominated corner of the broadcasting world.

Fans of the recently minted Las Vegas Raiders have been tuning in to Erin Coscarelli since the team officially made the leap from Oakland in 2020. A year later Coscarelli signed on as a co-host of ABC’s popular “The Ultimate Surfer.” Having blazed a trail in sports broadcasting she has deftly navigated a field dominated by men. But the path to success hasn’t always been smooth and she has faced her share of personal and professional challenges along the way.

Born and raised in a suburb of Los Angeles Coscarelli says her Italian heritage played a major role in her upbringing.

“I’m a second-generation Italian American” she shares. “My grandfather Joseph Coscarelli immigrated to the United States from Calabria. He settled in Michigan where he worked as a tailor before moving to Los Angeles where my dad Bob was raised.”

In the face of pervasive and glaring stereotypes Coscarelli always sought to shine a positive light on her ethnicity and family. “When I was young I was so proud to represent Italia” she says. “I was the kid who had the Italia sweatshirt in class.”

Coscarelli learned to be a fierce competitor from an early age which prepared her for the trials she would face later in life. “I was the baby of the family” she says. “When you have two older brothers you’re trying to constantly get their attention and impress them. I blame them for my obsession with competition and sports.”

Coscarelli credits her mother Linda with teaching her to never give up even when all may seem lost. “In my junior high yearbook the quote below my picture was ‘Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle’” she says. “My mom was battling breast cancer at that time. I was really scared. The more we can be vulnerable and share things we’re going through we may have the opportunity to help make it get better.”

Her mother survived the ordeal and Coscarelli went forth to earn a degree in journalism and communications from the University of Southern California.

She began her broadcasting career as a sideline reporter for Fox Sports West the Pac-12 Network and NBC Sports Network. She also covered the World Series of Poker and the Summer X Games for ESPN.

As an anchor and reporter for Comcast SportsNet Bay Area she covered the Golden State Warriors San Francisco 49ers San Francisco Giants and other professional sports teams. In addition she hosted several shows for the NFL Network and DirecTV on her way to her current positions.

During her rise through the ranks of sports broadcasting Coscarelli’s beloved brothers passed away.

Broadcasting involves two versions of yourself according to Coscarelli: who you are and what you’re projecting in front of the camera.

“The thing about being a broadcaster is that you really must be good at compartmentalizing. Whether you’re struggling with a breakup or a death in the family we’re doing a good job if they don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes” says Coscarelli. “It was especially tough for me to focus after I lost my two brothers.”

In walking that tightrope Coscarelli came to realize she was neglecting herself in the process. Adding to the stress was the additional challenge of being a woman in a male-dominated world.

“You need to be more prepared than the male you’re working with” she explains. “If I get a stat or a pronunciation wrong I’m given less grace than my male counterpart. There is a lot of pressure to look and talk a certain way. Not a lot of people know what it’s like to be in that seat.”

Coscarelli wishes she’d had a female mentor to guide the younger version of herself through her career. As a result she has gone out of her way to provide support to women in various professions.

“For me the women’s initiative is peeling back a layer of myself to let younger women know my stories and my failures” she says. “I want them to know if they’re feeling this way they’re not alone.”

During the height of the pandemic Coscarelli created a live segment on her Instagram account titled “Women Crush Wednesday.” Each week she interviews women in business and other professions around the world allowing them to share their stories with more than 100000 followers.

“Women are a large part of the demographic who own small businesses in the United States” she says. “Whether it’s owning a restaurant a coffee company or a brewery I wanted these women to have exposure from my platform. The pandemic was especially hard on those who owned small businesses so I’m happy to highlight these incredible women.”

Positive feedback on her Instagram segments motivated Coscarelli to expand her women’s initiative to include wellness services. “When you build it they will come” she says. “My best friend Erica Cedeno and I collaborated to create the ‘Love Yourself Women Wellness Retreat.’”

Held at a private residence in Los Angeles the retreats offer a day of self-care that includes yoga meditation and personal development sessions. Each guest leaves with a gift bag containing items provided by female-owned businesses.

Coscarelli needed all the self-care she could muster last year. While the Raiders were going through one of the most tumultuous seasons in team history she was grappling with chaos in her personal life as well. “As the Raiders were going through instability my father was fighting for his life” she says. “I was trying to advocate for my father every day in the hospital.”

Coscarelli’s father ultimately lost his battle with cancer. Although she considers 2021 to be the hardest year of her life Coscarelli has found solace in helping others who are going through similar experiences.

“One of the things that helps heal me through this journey is authentically sharing my story with someone who’s also going through it: helping others feel less alone especially with all we’ve been through collectively these past two years” she says. “We need to lean on one another. That’s why I’m invested in empowering women because I didn’t have that when I started broadcasting.”

As she prepares for the 2022 football season in Las Vegas Coscarelli continues to uplift women across the Los Angeles area. In the process she’s honoring an important part of who she is.

“When you have such a proud heritage you want to represent it the right way” she says. “Having the last name Coscarelli means so much to me because of what it represents. I always want to make my parents proud.”

What is the best way to watch the Blue Jays in Buffalo and will we get a blackout here? — Peter Buffalo.

Peter as you probably know Sportsnet which is owned by Rogers Communications is the Canadian TV home of the Toronto Blue Jays.

The bad news is that Sportsnet is not available in the United States.

The good news is that Toronto Blue Jays games are not blacked out here and there’s an easy (and relatively) inexpensive way to watch nearly every one.

Click Amazon: See Today’s 1-Day-Only Deals!

MLB.TV the league’s online package of out-of-market regular season games is available this season for $139.99. With MLB.TV you will be able to see almost every Blue Jays broadcast including both the feed from Sportsnet and the opposing team. (Not every game is available on MLB.TV because at least a handful of contests will be exclusive broadcasts on Peacock Apple and YouTube or national broadcasts on channels such as Fox.)

And if you just want to watch the Blue Jays games on MLB.TV the league has a single-team option for $119.99. You won’t be able to watch non-Blue Jays games with the single-team plan but you will save $20.

MLB.TV has a seven-day free trial so you can check it out without paying a dime.

Final note: The Blue Jays games are blacked out on MLB.TV in Canada.

For 15 years he has lived in the same apartment — a one-bedroom with an enviable private deck on the top floor of a building on the Upper West Side.

So when a developer the Naftali Group bought the Manhattan building for $70 million last June and told tenants that they had to move Mr. Ozsu made plans to stay. He could not be swayed with a buyout offer of $30000 an eviction notice or even a $25 million lawsuit that Naftali recently filed against him. In April the new landlord placed an industrial air filter outside Mr. Ozsu’s door and the blower has been droning nonstop driving him and his 13-year-old boxer-mix Penelope up the wall.

Still Mr. Ozsu won’t move. “It’s two things: I have the right to be here and I have no place to go” he said.

Naftali Group says Mr. Ozsu is angling for a seven-figure payout and has put its multimillion dollar investment in limbo setting off a landlord-tenant stalemate that is the stuff of legend in New York City real estate. But the pandemic has added a new twist: A renter protection enacted to prevent evictions during the crisis could help drag out the standoff for years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL2VsY29tZXJjaW8ucGUvZGVwb3J0ZS10b3RhbC9zZWxlY2Npb24vc2VsZWNjaW9uLXBlcnVhbmEtZWRpc29uLWZsb3Jlcy1yZWNvcmRvLWVsLWdvbC1kZWwtdHJpdW5mby1hbnRlLWNvbG9tYmlhLWVyYS1pbXBvc2libGUtcXVlLW1pbmEtbWUtYWxjYW56YXJhLXJtbWQtbm90aWNpYS_SAbcBaHR0cHM6Ly9lbGNvbWVyY2lvLnBlL2RlcG9ydGUtdG90YWwvc2VsZWNjaW9uL3NlbGVjY2lvbi1wZXJ1YW5hLWVkaXNvbi1mbG9yZXMtcmVjb3Jkby1lbC1nb2wtZGVsLXRyaXVuZm8tYW50ZS1jb2xvbWJpYS1lcmEtaW1wb3NpYmxlLXF1ZS1taW5hLW1lLWFsY2FuemFyYS1ybW1kLW5vdGljaWEvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edison Flores recordó el gol del triunfo ante Colombia: “Era imposible que Mina me alcanzara”,"Edison Flores se convirtió en un jugador importante en la recta final de las Eliminatorias para el Mundial. El ‘Orejas’ anotó en el triunfo triunfo (1-0) ante Colombia en condición de visita y luego marcó el empate (1-1) frente a Ecuador en el Estadio Nacional. En dicha fecha doble la ‘Blanquirroja’ consiguió cuatro puntos vitales para conseguir el cupo de repechaje.

Al respecto el volante de DC United recordó su gol en Barranquilla y detalló cómo se armó le jugada. “Yo estaba cerrando a Juan Guillermo Cuadrado en el área grande. Recuperamos el balón y yo me voy nomás. Cuando veo que Cueva engancha hacia adentro y sigo” explicó en declaraciones para Al Ángulo de Movistar Deportes.

“Sabía que Yerry Mina venía siguiéndome pero ya estaba muy adelante de él era casi imposible que me alcanzara. En esos momento lo que a mí me ayuda a pegarle fuerte —porque si no le pegaba así no entraba— es que acomodo el cuerpo y le pego al primer palo” añadió.

De la misma manera señaló que no pensó en mandar el balón al segundo puesto: “Había corrido entre 50 a 70 metros y no me daba para cruzar el balón. Para hacer eso necesitaba más fuerza más viada y un poco más de tiempo. Además el traslado iba a ser muy largo”.

This is Giovanni Ferrero.

He is Italy’s richest person with a net worth of $36B.

The source of his wealth is Ferrero Group the Italian confectionary giant which sold $14B of sweets in 2021 (and is the world’s 2nd biggest candy maker). The private business employs 40k+ people and runs 30+ plants globally.

Nutella — the hazelnut spread — accounts for 1/5th of total sales (~$3B) but Ferrero also owns Kinder Surprise Mon Cheri TicTac Crunch Bar Nerds Thornton’s and many more.

While the firm is currently facing a recall for Kinder Surprise Eggs in North America it’s def ringing up the cash register during Easter.

Halloween typically sells the most candy volume of the year but Easter is the Super Bowl for nicely-packaged confectionaries the exact type of products that Ferrero has perfected…this wasn’t always the case though.

The Origin

The OG Nutella was invented in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. At the time the famed French General started a continental blockade against his seafaring foes in the United Kingdom which lead to a cocoa shortage across Europe.

Ever resourceful Italian chefs started using ground hazelnut to stretch their dwindling chocolate supplies. The product they created was called gianduja.

Fast forward to 1946. Europe was dealing with yet another continent-wide shortage of cocoa (and food stuffs in general) following the end of World War II.

An Italian pastry chef by the name of Pietro Ferrero — a native of Alba Italy — whipped out the recipe for gianduja and created a snack aimed at regular folk working on tight purse strings. His version of gianduja was sold as a solid block in gold foil which was sliced like butter and eaten on bread. People loved it.

Why hazelnuts though? Alba is in Italy’s northwestern region where the nut (which comes from the hazel tree) is plentiful. Its high fat content and “nutty” flavor complements bitter chocolate very well (fun fact: a hazelnut’s shell-to-kernel weight ratio is a key quality metric).

In 1949 Pietro passed away. His brother continued to run the business while his son — Michele — joined the firm. Shortly after the changeover the Ferrero clan turned the popular gianduja snack into a spread called Supercrema. According to Forbes sales took off on the strength of “clever tricks”:

They sold it in receptacles like jars and pots so penny-pinched customers could reuse the containers. Rather than distribute it through wholesalers the company used an army of sales reps who went directly to stores helping keep prices low.

Michele took over in 1957 and the hazelnut product would have one final rebrand in 1964. That year the Italian government started to crack down on superlatives in ads. Apparently “super” was too hype of a word to have in a creamy-chocolatey product.

In response Michele chose a new name that evoked the flavor of nuts. It literally could not be more literal: Nutella. With business going well the Ferrero Group matched the name change with a reformulated product that added more sugar and cocoa (AKA made it a lot more addictive).

Michele Ferrero takes the business to new heights

Michele was far from a one-trick pony. He was a real-life Willy Wonka who was addicted to the game (of inventing new snacks). The Ferrero scion spent days on end taste-testing new candy formulations all while sporting a lab coat.

His efforts yielded a caloric explosion of dopamine-inducing sweets:

Mon Cheri (1956) : A cherry-liquor filled chocolate. Michele created a method whereby the chocolate would *not* absorb the liquor filling. It was a huge hit in Germany. (I’m pretty meh on these tbh).

TicTac (1969 ): These little oval mints were apparently named after the sound of opening and closing the container (it’s def smart: the *click* sound is a psychological hack that creates a “Pavlov’s Dog” type of association with the mint).

): These little oval mints were apparently named after the sound of opening and closing the container (it’s def smart: the *click* sound is a psychological hack that creates a “Pavlov’s Dog” type of association with the mint). Kinder Surprise (1974): Michele wanted children to experience Easter everyday so he create a toy-in-chocolate eggs (somewhat crazily Ferrero is the world’s 3rd biggest toymaker).

As he was ripping off one invention after another competitors tried to uncover Michele’s methods. But he went to great measures to protect the proverbial secret sauce.

The Alba factory was mostly closed to outsiders while employees came from multiple generations of the same family who were all super loyal to Michele (when he took over Ferrero in 1957 he told the workers: “I will not rest until I have secured a safe and peaceful future for your children.”)

And a select few of these workers have the incredible role as taste tester. Per Daily Mail the job qualifications are no joke:

To be selected they must correctly identify the flavours of sweet bitter salty and umami… In another fiendish test citric acid kitchen salt sugar and caffeine are dissolved in water. The tasters must then be able to place them in order of greatest concentration. Women between 25 and 40 are best although pregnant women are the most sensitive to taste. Candidates are then tested with raw materials such as milk to see if they can identify the one that is less fresh.

Michele’s greatest technical achievement is the immortal Ferrero Rocher. Launched in 1982 he spent 5 years perfecting the praline (a spherical wafer filled with hazelnut and covered by chocolate…and more hazelnuts).

Who can forget that packaging? The gold foil with a paper basket. As Apple’s Jony Ive once said about the iPhone case: “I love the process of unpacking something. You design a ritual of unpacking to make the product feel special. Packaging can be theater.”

For Ferrero that theatre happens once a year around Christmas. The firm sells 1/3rd of its annual supply of Ferrero Rocher during the year-end holiday. In the lead-up to December 25th the Alba factory makes 900 pralines a minute (running 24/7).

The inspiration for Ferrero Rocher also adds to the story. Apparently Michele designed it after the “the Roc de Massabielle a craggy rock grotto at Lourdes which he visited every year on pilgrimage.”

In the only interview he ever gave — which was published after his death — Michele says all of his inventions targeted one customer archetype. Per the Financial Times this archetype was a hypothetical Italian woman named “Valeria”:

“I think only of Valeria. [She] is the mother who does the shopping the grandmother the aunt the consumer who decides what to buy every day.”

By the mid-1980s Valeria was buying a lot of Nutella and Ferrero was a humming global operation with sales passing the $1B mark.

Preparing the next generation

Just as the business was passed to him Michele prepared his sons — Pietro and Giovanni — to take over the Italian firm. It began at a young age. In one legendary test Michele blindfolded his sons and they had to smell their way out of the factory.

Over the decades the sons worked at Ferrero in different roles across the globe before becoming co-CEOs in 1997 (Pietro was 34 Giovanni was 33). By then the Ferrero empire was bringing in $5B a year.

The transition was going as planned but tragedy struck in the 2010s:

2011 : Pietro died of a heart attack while biking in South Africa (he was only 47)

: Pietro died of a heart attack while biking in South Africa (he was only 47) 2015: Michele died at his home in Monaco (he was 89); thousands attend his funeral in Alba

After Michele’s death the future of Ferrero Group was in question. For decades the firm was bombarded by takeover offers but Michele always said “no not for sale”. He was old school and long refused debt and shunned acquisitions. Italian financiers considered him un-bankable.

Giovanni’s ~$6B bet

After his father’s death Giovanni took full control of the business and made clear that Ferrero Group wasn’t going anywhere. With a healthy profit margin of 10% Ferrero had been stacking cash for years.

Giovanni believed that the confectionary industry was headed for the same type of consolidation as the beer industry where 4 firms (AB InBev Constellation Brands Inc. Heineken MillerCoors) own 86% of the market.

Per Giovanni “someone will emerge as a front-runner” in the confectionary field. Why not Ferrero?

Since 2015 Giovanni has spent ~$6B on chocolate candy and snack brands. One major goal has been to expand Ferrero’s footprint in the US and UK:

Thorntons for $177m (2015) : An iconic UK chocolate brand (with all physical stores shut down since the pandemic).

: An iconic UK chocolate brand (with all physical stores shut down since the pandemic). Fannie May for $115m (2017) : The American chocolate maker was acquired from 1-800-Flowers.

: The American chocolate maker was acquired from 1-800-Flowers. Ferrara Candy for $1.3B (2017) : Acquired from PE firm L Catterton.

: Acquired from PE firm L Catterton. Nestle’s US candy business for $2.8B (2018) : The Swiss consumer giant actually tried to acquire Ferrero Group but was rebuffed. In the end Ferrero acquired Nestle’s classic American brands like Baby Ruth Butterfinger and Crunch.

: The Swiss consumer giant actually tried to acquire Ferrero Group but was rebuffed. In the end Ferrero acquired Nestle’s classic American brands like Baby Ruth Butterfinger and Crunch. Kellogg’s Snacks for $1.3B (2019) : Another acquisition of popular US snacks including Keebler Famous Amos Mother’s and Murray and Little Brownie Bakers.

: Another acquisition of popular US snacks including Keebler Famous Amos Mother’s and Murray and Little Brownie Bakers. Burton’s Biscuit’s for $426m (2021): The deal included Maryland Cookies Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels.

Among Ferrero purists the acquisitions have been polarizing for two reasons:

Lower end : The acquired products (eg. Crunch Butterfinger) are “lower end” compared to Ferrero’s homegrown products. These new product lines can hurt the firm’s margins.

: The acquired products (eg. Crunch Butterfinger) are “lower end” compared to Ferrero’s homegrown products. These new product lines can hurt the firm’s margins. Less healthy: As competing snack giants go healthier Ferrero is doubling down on sugary vices.

Among confectionary giants Ferrero only trails Mars which sells $20B a year of well-known brands including Mars Snickers Twix Skittles and M&Ms. Ferrero ($14B) leads Mondelez ($11B) Meiji ($10B) Hersey ($8B) and Nestle ($8B).

Challenges moving forward

At its size Ferrero Group is the world’s largest buyer of hazelnuts (1/3rd of the world’s annual supply). To secure its supply of the crucial input the firm even acquired a hazelnut factory in Turkey in 2014.

However its management of the crop is a huge source of controversy: hazelnut gathering is backbreaking work and 70%+ of production comes from Turkey where there are charges of child labor (often Kurdish migrants).

The Nutella maker says it wants 100% hazelnut “traceability” but supply chain complexity makes this goal difficult (it faces similar criticism for palm oil sourcing). To help achieve its traceability goals Ferrero bought 2 of the largest hazelnuts traders and is now the world’s #1 hazelnut *supplier* (as well as buyer).

Ferrero also faces questions over the high sugar content of Nutella. For decades it advertised the spread as a part of a “balanced breakfast”. Spoiler alert: it’s not that healthy (you can put the spoon down now). In 2013 Ferrero paid $3m to settle a California false advertising lawsuit related to the claim.

Aside from managing these difficult issues Giovanni — who gave up the CEO seat and is now Chairman — says Ferrero Group is aiming for +7% growth a year (per the rule of 72 sales would double in 10 years). It’s too early to tell if Ferrero’s aggressive M&A will get it there.

Amidst the acquisition spree Giovanni hasn’t forgotten Ferrero’s roots. The firm is (kind of) back to inventing: in 2021 Ferrero unveiled its first ever ice cream stick and chocolate bar.

Links and Memes

Elon update (as of 8pm PT on 04/15/2022): On Thursday Elon put in a $43B bid to buy all of Twitter (he already owns 9.1%). In his offer letter Elon said it was his last and best offer and that Twitter has extraordinary potential that he can “unlock”. The offer is priced at $54.20 (yes I bolded 420) which is currently a 20% premium to Twitter’s stock. Elon further notes that his offer price is a 38% premium to $TWTR stock before he announced his stake on April 1. The stock traded down suggesting the market doesn’t have faith the deal can be done (and that Elon may walk away entirely).

On the same day Musk spoke at TED and said he “doesn’t care about the economics at all” and that he doesn’t think the offer will be accepted (but has a “Plan B”). If Elon does acquire Twitter he wants to prioritize free speech and make Twitter’s algorithm fully transparent.

Twitter responded by adopting a poison pill (a corporate maneuver that triggers if anyone — or a group — owns 15% or more of Twitter; existing shareholders will get to buy $TWTR stock at a discount and dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer..like Elon).While the board has the right to enact the poison pill Elon backers say that the 20% premium to Twitter’s stock price is legitimate value for shareholders (since $TWTR has done basically nothing as a public company). In this view the board is *not* acting in its role as a fiduciary. The rebuttal is that $TWTR’s most recent high was more than $70 (granted that’s a boost from Fed’s insane money printing).

Twitter is exploring deals with other players (eg. PE Firm Thomas Bravo maybe a Disney Salesforce Google or Apple). Meanwhile Elon is speaking with partners that could help him seal the deal (if we live in a simulation the partner will be mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto who happens to have ~$40B in Bitcoin).



Last thing: In a viral thread former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong says that running a social network is brutally hard (and bad for the psyche). Based on Yishan’s own experience he says that Elon’s incredible entrepreneurial talents would better benefit humanity if he continued to build SpaceX and Tesla with all his energy (instead of getting distracted by Twitter).

Succession theme song: Incredible YouTube video of composer Nicholas Britell explaining his thought process for creating the Succession theme song. Britell wanted to combine the “absurdities” of the family interactions with the “gravitas” of the show’s heavy topics by mixing classical and hip-hop sounds together. Mission accomplished.

How is AriZona still only $0.99: Here’s an LA Times piece on billionaire Don Vultaggio and AriZona beverage company which he co-founded. While inflation is hitting every part of the economy the company — which sells 1B cans of $0.99 AriZona Iced Tea a year — has kept its price point.



One reason is that it’s psychologically hard to jump from $0.99 to $1 or more. Another simpler reason is that Vultaggio controls the private company and straight up doesn’t want consumers to pay more: “I don’t want to do what the bread guys and the gas guys and everybody else are doing. Consumers don’t need another price increase from a guy like me.”



Since March 9 a gallon of gas has costed more than a gallon of AriZone Iced Tea (on a very related note: AriZona’s corporate Twitter account dropped one of the greatest corporate memes ever).

And here are some other memes (see y’all next week):",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is because the constellation harbours a nova called RS Ophiuchi or RS Oph.

What Is A Nova?

A nova is an explosion from the surface of a white-dwarf star in a binary star system which occurs when the white dwarf ""steals"" gas from its nearby companion star according to StarDate the public education arm of The University of Texas at Austin's McDonald's Observatory. A white dwarf is the dense core of a once-normal star.

When enough has built up on the surface of the white dwarf it triggers an explosion.

Therefore birthplaces of a nova are systems in which two very different stars live in a parasitic relationship.

In this relationship a white dwarf which is a small burned-out and tremendously dense star orbits a red giant which is an old star that will soon burn up. A teaspoon of a white dwarf's matter weighs about one tonne.

MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes) a system of two telescopes situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma has observed the gigantic thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in the Serpent Bearer constellation. The study led by researchers at Max Planck Institute for Physics in Germany was recently published in the journal Nature Astronomy.

What Is MAGIC?

MAGIC is a system of two 17-metre diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) which are a device or method to detect very-high-energy gamma ray photons.

The two telescopes are dedicated to the observation of gamma rays from galactic and extragalactic sources in the very high energy range which is from 30 gigaelectronvolts to over 250 gigaelectronvolts.

The telescopes detect particle showers released by gamma rays using the Cherenkov radiation which is the light produced by charged particles when they pass through an optically transparent medium at speeds greater than the speed of light in that medium.

What Happens During A Nova?

In the binary star system a dying giant star sheds its outer hydrogen layer and the gas flows into the nearby white dwarf.

The flow of matter from the giant star to the white dwarf continues until the latter overeats or overheats itself. In the newly gained stellar shells the temperature and pressure become too large. This results in a gigantic thermonuclear explosion. The red giant burns up but the dwarf star remains intact. The cycle commences again and the explosion eventually follows.

Such explosions involve high energies according to the study.

What Did The MAGIC Telescopes Find?

The MAGIC telescopes recorded gamma rays with the value of 250 gigaelectronvolts which are among the highest energies ever measured in a nova.

The energy of the radiation is hundred billion times that of visible light.

There were initial alerts from other instruments measuring at different wavelengths following which MAGIC was able to make its observations. In a statement issued by Max Planck Institute for Physics David Green one of the authors of the paper said that the ""spectacular eruption"" of the RS Ophiuchi shows that the MAGIC telescopes' fast response really pays off. It takes the telescopes no more than 30 seconds to move to a new target Green said.

Several shock fronts propagated through the stellar wind from the red giant and the interstellar medium surrounding the binary system following the explosion. According to the study the shock waves work like a giant power plant in which the particles are accelerated to near the speed of light. The gamma rays emanate from energetic protons which are the nuclei of hydrogen atoms the combined measurements suggest.

Green explained that the fact that gamma rays emanate from energetic protons also makes nova outbursts a source of cosmic rays.

He said that nova outbursts however tend to play the role of local heroes. This means that they only contribute to the cosmic rays in the close neighbourhood.

Green said that the big players for cosmic rays are supernova remnants because the shock fronts created from stellar explosions are far more violent compared to novar.

According to the researchers more observations like those reported now will be necessary to fully understand the complicated interplay of violent events with the Interstellar medium in the Milky Way galaxy.

The authors noted in the study that the MAGIC collaboration will therefore continue to look for ""restless"" objects in the Milky Way galaxy and beyond.",,,,,,

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 haven’t been on sale in the United States for very long and already a bunch of them have been crashed and have ended up for sale through Copart and IAAI. If you’re a fan of either EV these images don’t make for a pretty sight.

The type of damage sustained to the Ioniq 5s and EV6s available online varies quite a lot as does their mileage. One of the most damaged Ioniq 5s with just a mere 88 miles on the clock is an SE variant painted white and has suffered front-end damage and significant damage to both sides.

It’s clear that the driver’s side has sustained the most damage with the doors and quarter panels heavily dented. The EV’s entire front fascia is also missing while on the passenger side we can see that damage has been sustained to the wheel arches and the wing mirror.

There are a couple of Ioniq 5s that should be much easier to repair. One matte grey model available through IAAI an SEL variant still runs and drives and appears to have only suffered some dents across the front bumper passenger-side front quarter panel and hood. If these parts are replaced it should look as good as new.

A handful of wrecked Kia EV6s have also found their way online. One example on Copart suffered an impact on the driver’s side badly denting both doors and causing damage to the rear wheel and suspension components. The side curtain airbags have also been deployed but the car should be repairable.

A second EV6 is available through IAAI with 288 miles under its belt. It is a GT-Line variant and images show significant damage across the front end and passenger side.",,,,,,,,,

The Oscar-winning actor 65 threw out the first pitch at the Cleveland Guardians' home opener at Progressive Field against the San Francisco Giants on Friday where he was joined by his very special costar from the 2000 film Cast Away.

Decked out in Guardians attire Hanks made his way onto the field to throw out the ceremonial first pitch to Larry Doby Jr. the son of the late Larry Doby a past member of the Cleveland team who was the first Black player in the American League.

At the mound Hanks held Wilson over his head showing off the volleyball and its signature red handprinted face on one side and the Guardians' logo on the other.

After placing Wilson on the ground in preparation to perform the inaugural pitch the ball moved around on the field — seemingly by remote control — which caused Hanks to laugh and watch on in delight.

The actor then threw a baseball to Doby Jr. ringing in the official start of the Guardians' 2022-2023 season (The Giants would go on to beat the Guardians 4-1).

Friday evening's game marked the first time the Guardians went by their new name since the Cleveland baseball team announced they would be changing mascots due to their former branding being criticized as racist.

The Ohio sports group previously announced their new team name in a video featuring Hanks and the Black Keys which was shared on social media in July 2021.

The name 'Guardians' references statues on the city's Lorain-Carnegie Bridge which have been called the ""Guardians of Traffic.""

In December 2020 Cleveland first announced the change to the 105-year-old name after starting the conversation earlier that year.

""In our statement in June 2020 we acknowledged the importance of taking a leadership role in diversity equity and inclusion efforts across the community and enhancing our support for underserved and under-represented groups"" the team said in a statement at the time.

""As part of that commitment we heard from individuals and groups who shared a variety of views and opinions on the issue. We are deeply grateful for the interest and engagement from Native American communities civic leaders leading researchers fans corporate partners players and internal teammates devoted to these formal and informal conversations"" they continued.

The official name change to the Guardians came after the Cleveland team removed the Chief Wahoo logo from game jerseys and caps years ago. The league said that the logo which featured a smiling Native American is not appropriate for field use.",,,,,,,,,

In early 2020 when the virus was rapidly spreading throughout the world Costco like a majority of essential retailers implemented the special hours for shoppers who were more likely to get sick from the virus as well as health care workers and first responders.

In July 2021 the membership-only warehouse club reduced its special operating hours to two days a week rather than dropping them entirely. Since then warehouses in the U.S. and Puerto Rico have been holding special shopping hours from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Fortunately they landed on YouTube the morning after it aired.

One sketch which was actually themed to YouTube starred Chris Redd and Bowen Yang as a duo singing about how they watch YouTube while eating dinner. “Food and YouTube” brought Lizzo in as a special guest — The Algorithm — toward the end of the tune.

Explore Explore Lizzo See latest videos charts and news See latest videos charts and news

“I am The Algorithm and I’m here to help/ B—- I know you better than you know yourself” Lizzo rapped. “Oh you watch travel vids? I can show you the world/ Here’s the 10 most savage moments from The Golden Girls/ I’ll take you down roads that you never seen/ B—- I’m the architect of y’all’s reality.”

A second sketch the return of SNL‘s “Costco Meeting” (a bit that originally starred Kim Kardashian back in October) had Lizzo joining the “bop factory” Glitter Revolution in bubble gum pink. This time the musical trio appeared with bops aimed at getting 9- to 12-year-olds spending money at the big-box retail store.

Trending on Billboard

Lizzo chimed in with quips about about free “Bagel Bite on a tooth-a-pick” samples and “smoothies served in a ketchup cup” for Glitter Revolution’s first new tune for kids before singing about how perfect their lives will be after visiting the eye doctor at Costco. Then they introduced their soon-to-be hit “Bore Store” a diss track for Costco rivals.

In the photo taken by Bas Bogaerts the Princess is seen holding the Royal Family’s two dogs in the Royal Domain of Laeken surrounding the Palace of Laeken near Brussels.

Princess Eléonore Fabiola Victoria Anne Marie is the youngest of King Philippe and Queen Mathilde’s four children. Her older siblings are Princess Elisabeth Duchess of Brabant (b. 2001) Prince Gabriel (b. 2003) and Prince Emmanuel (b. 2005).

She was born in Erasmus Hospital in Brussels in 2008 to then-Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde while her grandfather King Albert II was still on the throne. The Princess was christened on 14 June 2008 in the Royal Chapel of Ciergnon Castle. She counts Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden Princess Claire of Belgium (her aunt) and Count Sébastien von Westphalen zu Fürstenberg as godparents.

Eléonore is fourth in line to the Belgian throne and attends a Dutch-speaking primary school Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege. She lives with her family at the Royal Palace of Laeken.

Bin Shaaban seeks to restore the columns of Leptis Magna the historical city located between Tripoli and Sirte. The columns were stolen from the temple of Augustus in 1817 by British imperial officers Hanmer Warrington and William Henry Smyth.

Bin Shaaban is representing the state of Libya and the Libyan Ministry of Culture in pursuing the return of the architectural remains which currently lie on the crown estate managed by the National Trust.

Speaking to the New Arab news website he said ""We've told the crown: If you have evidence that these Roman antiquities were legally removed from Libya then please provide it. If you don’t please return them to Libya.""

The legal team behind the Leptis Magna campaign said they have learned from experts that the remains are at risk of critical damage due to prolonged exposure to British weather.

The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Surface Transportation Board on Thursday announced that it had approved the merger which was nearly two years in the making.

Pan Am owns rail lines and provides rail service on a freight rail network in New England that stretches as far north as Mattawamkeag and as far south as Springfield Massachusetts and west to Schenectady New York. The new ownership will not affect the operations of Amtrak’s Downeaster service which offers passenger service on private tracks from Brunswick to Boston.

The deal should improve Pan-Am’s rail network because CSX has more capital to invest in the tracks and customers will benefit from being able to ship their goods across the region on a single railroad the Associated Press reported. There may also be environmental benefits from the deal because CSX uses newer more efficient locomotives.

In the Bangor region it is another chapter in the history of railroads in the area one that has seen many rail companies change hands and has seen the demise of passenger rail service north of the Portland region.

The history of rail service in the Bangor area stretches back nearly 200 years to 1836 when the first rail service began just six years after the first common carrier railroad opened in the U.S. in 1830. The Bangor Old Town and Milford Railroad also known as the Veazie railroad was the first railroad in Maine and ferried passengers and freight from Milford to Bangor between 1836 and 1869.

Many more railroads operated out of Bangor in the ensuing decades before two companies emerged as the main players in the latter half of the 19th century: Maine Central Railroad and the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad.

Both rail companies operated for more than a century connecting people and companies in eastern and northern Maine to the rest of New England and Atlantic Canada. Both companies operated several well-known passenger lines until around 1960. They included the Flying Yankee which ran from Bangor to Boston; the Gull which connected Bangor with Canadian cities including Saint John and Halifax; the Aroostook Flyer which ran from Bangor to Van Buren and the Bar Harbor Express which traveled seasonally between Bar Harbor and Bangor. Bangor’s grand train station Union Station was torn down in 1961.

At its peak in the first half of the 20th century rail service in the Bangor region employed hundreds of people and the sprawling railyard and associated fuel storage facilities along the Penobscot River dominated Bangor’s waterfront for a century.

Throughout the late 1960s 1970s and 1980s the area fell into disuse. A cleanup effort began in the late 1980s and by the mid-2000s the area had been turned into a park and marina. The later addition of Hollywood Casino in 2007 and the waterfront concert venue today known as the Maine Savings Amphitheater in 2010 further cemented the transformation away from industrial uses toward recreational ones.

Passenger service on all those lines had ended by the early 1960s but freight service continued. In 1981 Maine Central Railroad was sold to Guilford Transportation. In 2006 Guilford changed its name to Pan Am after purchasing Pan American World Airways in 1998.

In 2002 Bangor and Aroostook went bankrupt and in 2003 was sold to Rail World which incorporated its lines into its Montreal Maine and Atlantic Railway (MMA). In July 2013 an MMA train carrying crude petroleum derailed in Lac Megantic Quebec and the ensuing explosion destroyed much of the city’s downtown and killed 47 people. Following the disaster the company filed for bankruptcy and was sold in 2014; its Maine lines are now owned by Canadian Pacific Railway.

After the merger of Pan Am and CSX is complete in June CSX will operate the majority of rail lines in Maine. Other operators include New Brunswick Railway Company Limited owned by J.B. Irving Limited which operates lines from Vanceboro to Brownville Junction and several in Aroostook County. Canadian Pacific operates freight lines in western and central Maine and St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad operates a freight line between Portland and Montreal.

Though operators of what will soon be CSX’s Maine lines say they have no plans to make major changes to current operations some towns are hoping for some such as the decommissioning of the dormant rail line stretching from Bucksport to Brewer. Town officials in Bucksport are exploring the possibility of repurposing that line should it be decommissioned into a recreational rail trail.

And in Bangor some city and state officials hope to someday bring passenger rail service back to town. Legislation signed by Gov. Janet Mills last June calls for a feasibility study examining whether a new passenger line between Bangor and Portland would be worthwhile. Though the rail line is still a longshot it would be the first passenger rail service north of Portland in more than 60 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseS1qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jc3gtZ2V0cy1hcHByb3ZhbC10by1hY3F1aXJlLXBhbi1hbS1yYWlsd2F5cy9hcnRpY2xlXzkxMjhjM2FjLWJjZDAtMTFlYy1hMGExLTM3ODZmODE5YjY0ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CSX gets approval to acquire Pan Am Railways,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Cummins Inc’s stylish cantilevered steel-and-glass office tower in Indianapolis looks more like the headquarters of a tech company than a business that lives on diesel fumes. The incongruity continues in Columbus Indiana where Cummins was born a century ago and where the company’s foundation funded cutting-edge designs by IM Pei and Eero Saarinen for schools fire stations and a library.



That the leading US maker of diesel engines happens to be run by a Silicon Valley native with a Stanford engineering degree is another surprising twist. It’s also entirely relevant: The battle for the truck engine market will be fought on environmental territory with Cummins taking on seemingly greener upstarts offering electric trucks.





(This story appears in the 22 April 2022 issue of Forbes India. To visit our Archives click here.)

Bring it on says Thomas Linebarger Cummins’ chief executive for the past decade.“Teslas won’t drive our economy” he says. “They’ll drive rich people.” Cummins is thriving precisely because it has been adept at meeting the ever more demanding environmental rules imposed on diesel engines. And when the day comes for battery-powered or hydrogen-fuelled trucks to displace diesel entirely Linebarger will be ready.The lanky 59-year-old executive began laying the groundwork for an evolutionary shift at Cummins six years ago acquiring companies with battery hydrogen and fuel-cell expertise and setting up a new division focussed solely on next-gen powertrains. Linebarger is betting that those moves and Cummins’ large global customer base can help it lead the market for cleaner trucks buses boats trains mining equipment and generators through the 2020s and beyond.“We need solutions that will get things to market—get your mattress delivered deliver your flowers all this other stuff that goes on out here” he says pointing out a large conference room window as a heavy winter rain soaks Indianapolis. “One solution isn’t going to do it. Nobody understands the range of those solutions more than we do.”A variety of approaches is necessary because the company’s product line is vast. Annually Cummins supplies more than a million heavy-duty engines to power buses Dodge pickups Kenworth semi trucks Bradley M2 Army vehicles Siemens trains fishing trawlers mining machines and backup generators for data centres.The environmental challenges of diesel are considerable. Besides carbon dioxide the fuel emits black soot a cause of heart and lung disease and precursors to smog and acid rain. California is demanding that by 2024 commercial fleets begin replacing diesel trucks with zero-emission models. The US Environmental Protection Agency intends to phase in stricter requirements for heavy trucks starting with 2027 models.So far Cummins’ ability to develop cleaner diesel systems to meet tighter pollution rules over the past 20 years has helped it thrive. Analysts estimate it had $2.2 billion of net income in 2021 on revenue up 21 percent to $24 billion. Its market cap is $33.5 billion.Transitioning the heavy-duty vehicle market from diesel fuel won’t be fast or cheap. And the winner in the long-haul market may not be the battery-powered trucks that Elon Musk is promising. It might be engines burning hydrogen from renewable sources. Taking into account the lithium mining for a battery and the partly fossil-fuelled grid used to recharge it it’s quite possible that someday Cummins’ trucks will be greener than Tesla’s.Running a manufacturer wasn’t a likely outcome for Linebarger. He grew up in a working-class Silicon Valley home at a time when the region was defined by IBM and Hewlett-Packard rather than Apple and Google. His parents divorced when he was young and at one point his mother turned to food stamps. “She went back to college finished her occupational therapy degree at San Jose State and kind of just kept us moving.”Good public schools helped Linebarger get into Claremont McKenna College and Stanford where he got undergraduate degrees in management and mechanical engineering. He took an internship at Cummins while completing a combined MBA and master’s degree in manufacturing science at Stanford. “I wanted to build companies not finance them” he says.Linebarger’s strategy to attack carbon and further cut exhaust pollution is multipronged mixing conventional and high-tech options. Cummins’ engineering team plans to keep improving the efficiency of its diesel engine and generator lines while also designing them to burn cleaner fuels including natural gas and hydrogen made from renewable sources. They’re also readying hybrid options that like Toyota’s Prius boost fuel efficiency without the huge battery of an all- electric truck “Today with the techniques we have with big data and analytics we can design efficiency into the system in a way that we couldn’t 10 or 15 years ago. We have a target to improve the efficiency of our engines by 20 percent or 25 percent by the end of the dec­ade” Linebarger says. “The next step is mostly fuelling; it’s not really much else to do with the engine at that point. Once you are perfectly efficient it’s hybridisation and fuel.”Linebarger created a New Power division at Cummins in 2018 to design battery and fuel-cell power systems and hydrogen generation technology that may supplant its diesel business by the 2030s. To shore it up Cummins bought fuel-cell and hydrogen developer Hydrogenics took a stake in Sion Power to develop lithium-metal batteries and started a joint venture with Chinese oil company Sinopec to produce hydrogen from renewable sources. Led by Amy Davis New Power will initially focus on batteries and motors for light and medium trucks and hydrogen fuel-cell systems for rail applications and stationary power generation. Long-haul hydrogen-fuelled power­trains for semis are in the works but won’t likely be a core business until the late 2020s she says.With advances in battery packs and offerings for lighter commercial vehicles fleet operators are “getting their head around last-mile trucks” but are concerned about replacing diesel systems in semis and heavy-duty trucks Davis said while she and Linebarger were in Scotland for the climate-change conference in November. Cummins’ customers have concerns that battery-only systems—like Musk’s planned semis that go up to 500 miles—aren’t realistic. It isn’t just the size of the battery that gets in the way. It’s the paucity of charging stations.Davis described customers asking “What about my long haul? I couldn’t even charge three of my trucks at once given the system that’s out there for charging. So what are we going to do?” Her answer: “The fuel-cell electric drivetrain can be quite complementary with the battery work that’s going on.”Along with truck makers including Daimler Volvo and startup Nikola Cummins sees battery power as a viable option for heavy trucks that need only 200 miles of daily range such as rigs hauling cargo from ports or running fixed delivery routes. For trucks needing to travel 300 miles between fuelling hydrogen power looks more attractive particularly since a fuel-cell system that converts the element to electricity is lighter than a battery pack. Hydrogen’s refuelling time can be comparable to that of diesel.Cummins expects to report sales from the New Power unit reached as much as $130 million last year. That number would be a fraction of total company revenue but greater than the combined sales of commercial EV makers Rivian Arrival and Nikola which are just starting fleet deliveries.Matthew Elkott who covers Cummins for Cowen & Co says the path Linebarger has laid out—blending steady efficiency gains for conventional engines and readying next-generation technology—looks right. “We don’t know yet what’s going to be the most ubiquitous technology 10 or 20 years from now but [Cummins is] going to help migrate a lot of those customers toward whatever the future looks like.”Tesla has lined up thousands of potential customers for the Tesla Semi that was unveiled in 2017 and is at least two years behind schedule. Given the EV maker’s lack of experience working with big fleets Elkott is sceptical about how big a player Tesla or Nikola which is also advocating for both battery and hydrogen power will be in commercial trucks.“The advantage [Cummins] has over someone like Tesla is this installed base of customers worldwide” many of whom have dealt with it for decades Elkott says. If the company says it has a compelling hydrogen-powered product and the fuel needed to power it that’s likely to be taken seriously by companies it’s already supplying. “If I was that customer I am more likely to choose Cummins than someone new to the market.”Like other long-lasting global manufacturers such as Ford Toyota and Harley-Davidson (on whose board Linebarger serves) Cummins sees engineering innovation as core to its history. Co-founded in 1919 by Clessie Cummins to advance Rudolf Diesel’s revolutionary engine the company initially licenced a design from a small Michi­gan firm before developing its own direct-injection diesel engines that could run pumps grind grain or power a saw. By the 1930s Cummins pushed into the truck market with the Model H engine that became an industry standard.“Cummins has done best when innovation is required” Linebarger says. “As soon as the industry kind of settles on a technology then you’re just competing for scale and cost.”The US Clean Air Act of 1970 which forced diesel makers to clean up their products ultimately boosted business for Cummins which was rapidly able to bring cleaner engines to market. Linebarger expects a similar outcome as carbon dioxide becomes the enemy.“I look at decarbonisation and say that’s a growth opportunity for Cummins because now innovation is going to matter a lot” he says. “Innovation is what we do—and then we don’t have to compete so much on the lowest price times a million units.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYXUubGlmZXN0eWxlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9ob25leS1iYWRnZXItbmljay1jdW1taW5zLWJhYnktMDAwMjQxMTU2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Bachelor's Honey Badger shares unexpected baby announcement,"Nick ‘Honey Badger’ Cummins dropped a major bombshell on Sunday announcing that he’s expecting a baby with his socialite girlfriend Alexandra George.

This classic muscle car is incredibly rare…

It’s always great to hear amazing barn find car stories but the tale behind this 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS is one of the best we’ve heard in a long time. You can hear the complete story in the included video which we strongly encourage you to check out because it’s really something. Let’s just say if you were to find a car like this it’s a one in a million golden opportunity.

Watch the latest Motorious Podcast here.

This Chevelle might not look like much with its weathered Desert Sand paint and black vinyl roof. The interior does have saddle bucket seats which is a nice feature but that’s not enough to get overly excited. The fact this is a numbers-matching car is a huge plus; but wait there’s more.

And while anyone knows a ’70 Chevelle SS is a special car this thing has the LS6 under the hood. From the LS6 Registry we learn this vehicle came from the Atlanta Georgia assembly plant. Only 47 other cars from that plant had the LS6 which is amazing. Even more incredible according to the registry this is the earliest documented LS6 car to surface in recent history from Atlanta. Earlier examples might be out there or they might have been crushed long ago.

While finding a car like this is similar to sitting on the needle in a haystack the cherry on top is that it still runs. After not being used for 35 years they were able to fire up this Chevelle. That’s pretty incredible but definitely not unheard of.

Even if you’re not a Chevrolet lover there’s no denying the iconic nature of the Chevelle particularly the 1970 model year. A revised design looks more sculpted and muscular plus the LS6 V8 made the car absolutely legendary. To see one has survived after being parked uncovered for 35 years is enough to warm our hearts especially since it still runs.

Saweetie donned a matching outfit that consisted of a red printed halter top and minskirt. The set is reminiscent of a ‘90s Coogi sweater but its reinterpretation into this outfit had a modern and trendy twist. The top had green strings for a pop of unifying color and the skirt had a thick red elastic waistband for security.

Halterneck tops feature an open back with straps that secure around the neck exposing the shoulders.

A worker has won a $450000 compensation case after colleagues went against his wishes and threw him an office birthday party setting off his anxiety and ultimately leading to him losing his job.

Kevin Berling was hired as a lab technician at Gravity Diagnostics in Covington Kentucky in 2018. According to his lawyers he had asked the company to avoid its typical birthday celebration when his came around due to concerns it would trigger his anxiety disorders.

According to his complaint against the company the office manager forgot about Mr Berling’s request and planned his office birthday party in August 2019.

The employee was left overwhelmed and had to leave the celebration to spend lunch hour in his car according to the filing.

After the party incident management held a meeting with Mr Berling about what had happened setting off another anxiety attack.

A few days later he was fired with managers citing concerns about his perceived anger and potential to become violent.

The firing meant Mr Berling missed out on the company’s rapid growth during the Covid pandemic where some employees saw raises as much as 300 per cent his lawyers said.

On Friday a jury unanimously awarded Mr Berling a $450000 judgment against the company finding that he was entitled to $120000 in lost wages and benefits $30000 in future wages and $300000 for “past present and future mental pain and suffering mental anguish embarrassment humiliation mortification and loss of self-esteem” according to court documents.

The company could still appeal the decision.

The Independent has reached out to Gravity Diagnostics for comment.

""This may sound cliche to say that the money was really secondary in this thing” Tony Bucher the former employee’s lawyer told Local12. “It was a big step for someone who doesn’t like that kind of attention to stand up in front of 12 jurors and stand up for himself.""

The attorney said that the company had misinterpreted the situation and that Mr Berling was doing what he needed to calm himself down and was not being violent.

""They started giving him a pretty hard time for his response to the birthday celebration actually accusing him of stealing his co-workers’ joy” Mr Bucher added."

The verdict which came after two days of deliberations marks a resounding defeat for government prosecutors who had targeted the dialysis giant’s non-poaching agreements with rival companies in an unprecedented criminal conspiracy case. The Department of Justice (DOJ) argued that the agreements are anti-competitive and violate the Sherman Antitrust Act. It's the first criminal trial for labor-related antitrust violations.

The Sherman Antitrust Act dates back to 1890 and is a federal statute prohibiting activities that restrict interstate commerce and competition in the marketplace.

The DOJ had alleged in the case that both DaVita and Surgical Care Affiliates LLC required senior-level employees who sought to work for them to notify their current employers that they were job hunting.

“Congratulations to the defendants condolences to the government” U.S. District Senior Judge R. Brooke Jackson said once the jury was dismissed The Denver Post's Sam Tabachnik reported.

In a statement issued Friday DaVita executives said “We appreciate the jury’s decision and are grateful to put this matter behind us. We remain committed to operating with integrity and upholding the highest standards of law.”

If convicted DaVita would have faced a maximum penalty of a $100 million fine for each of the three counts and Thiry would have faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine per count.

A federal grand jury indicted Denver-based DaVita and its ex-CEO on three counts of conspiring with competing employers to not hire one another's senior-level employees. The dialysis giant and Thiry allegedly struck anti-poaching agreements with two other healthcare companies.

The DaVita verdict marks the second defeat for the DOJ's Antitrust Division this past week. The antitrust division lost its first criminal no-poach trial and its first criminal wage-fixing trial dealing a major blow to the government's new strategy of enforcing antitrust laws in labor markets by attempting to hold executives criminally liable.

""This has to be the most devastating week of losses for the criminal program in the history of the antirust division"" Ann O’Brien a partner at Baker & Hostetler and former DOJ antitrust division manager and prosecutor told Fierce Healthcare. O'Brien attended the trial in Denver as an observer.

""Acquittals across the board for all defendants on all charged Sherman Act counts. In addition the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division [Jonathan Kanter] had to fly across the country and stand before a federal judge in Denver who repeatedly questioned the judgment of the antitrust division that the interests of justice will be served by putting defendants through a third trial after two hung juries"" said O'Brien.

In the criminal wage-fixing trial a Texas jury acquitted the owner of a physical therapy staffing company and its clinical director on charges that they violated the Sherman Act in a federal wage-fixing case.

The staffing company owner Neeraj Jindal was found guilty on a single count of obstruction of Federal Trade Commission proceedings. The government charged Jindal with conspiring with competitors to lower pay and recruit others to the scheme.

""The DaVita case was a well-tried case by both sides"" O'Brien said. Copious evidence was presented by the defense through cross-examination and an economic expert about the strategic business reasons for such agreements the actual movement of employees and the lack of effect and harm of such agreements she noted.

""The antitrust division attempted for the first time ever to push the bounds of the Sherman Act and try no-poach conduct as a per se criminal offense. The defense lodged a rule of reason defense including extensive expert economist testimony. The jury seemed attentive and intelligent. In the end the jury had the last word and justice was done"" she said.

The verdict is expected to have significant repercussions on how the Sherman Antitrust Act is used to regulate free competition experts say.

""What we are seeing in these trial defeats for the antitrust division is the culmination of a years-long effort to find 'labor market' cases and push the boundaries of Section 1 of the Sherman Act to criminalize conduct that has never before been treated as per se criminal conduct"" O'Brien said. ""Juries have spoken as have judges in their jury instructions and they do not agree.""

She added ""Unfortunately other defendants still face trials and investigations of conduct the division has so far failed in its efforts to criminalize.""

The DOJ's case against DaVita

DaVita owns and operates outpatient medical centers that focus on dialysis and kidney care. It operates a network of 2816 kidney dialysis centers in the U.S. and 339 more in 10 countries worldwide.

According to the DOJ DaVita and Thiry struck an anti-poaching agreement with Surgical Care Affiliates that was designed to prevent each company from recruiting the other's senior-level employees. DaVita had similar no-poaching agreements with Hazel Health and Radiology Partners the prosecutors allege. All three companies were headed by former DaVita executives according to media reports.

The charges were the result of an ongoing federal investigation conducted by the antitrust division and the FBI.

The first count charges DaVita and Thiry for conspiring with Surgical Care Affiliates not to solicit each other’s senior-level employees from as early as February 2012 until as late as July 2017. The second count alleges the company and the former executive conspired with another healthcare company from as early as April 2017 until as late as June 2019 to allocate employees by agreeing the other healthcare company would not solicit DaVita’s workers.

The prosecution in its closing arguments Wednesday afternoon cited “overwhelming evidence” that Thiry and DaVita used these agreements with rival companies to “cheat employees out of job opportunities"" Tabachnik reported.

The executive would also use his influence and personal relationships to retaliate and block employees trying to leave DaVita the government’s attorney Anthony Mariano told the jury Tabachnik wrote.

The government brought nine witnesses in the week-and-a-half trial including former DaVita executives an FBI agent and a former midlevel employee BusinessDen reported.

The defense brought one witness an economist who testified that a data analysis of compensation and turnover rates did not show economic evidence that competition had been stifled through any agreements according to the BusinessDen report.

The DOJ has taken an aggressive antitrust enforcement strategy especially as it relates to labor issues and worker pay. The department has brought a series of criminal cases against employers for colluding to suppress wages including prosecutions of employers of home health aides nurses and aerospace engineers.

Defense attorneys have questioned the wisdom of the antitrust division’s fixation on so-called “labor market cases"" O'Brien said as the criminal cases create confusion about labor agreements.

""Right now companies are even more confused than ever about what they can and can’t do in terms of labor movement and restrictions. Business leaders and the counsel who advise them want clear guidance not failed criminal cases. And the antitrust division has probably made its job of enforcing hard-core criminal per se antitrust conduct harder going forward"" she said.

It might have been on brand at the John Deere Classic but Jordan Spieth had to contest with an unlikely four-legged playing partner at the RBC Heritage on Friday.

The former world number one was lining up his swing during the second round of the South Carolina PGA Tour event when a deer broke from the trees and proceeded to prance down the Harbor Town Golf Links’ fairway.

Any hopes of the special guest making par were dashed as the deer ended up in a bunker its brief cameo at the event capped by a trot back up the fairway before a return to the bushes it had emerged from footage tweeted by the PGA Tour showed.

Cue the most unusual of bunker raking duties for Michael Greller and Jim ‘Bones’ Mackay caddies to Spieth and Justin Thomas respectively as the pair worked to smooth over the hoofprints left in the sand by the visitor.

It wasn’t the only time that Spieth who at 5-under trails leader Patrick Cantlay by four heading into Saturday’s third round had to contest with mother nature on Friday.

Earlier during the session the American was about to follow through on his swing when the winds blew a stray leaf inches past the ball throwing Spieth off. Greller was on hand with a towel before Spieth eventually teed off.

DAL,Delta Air Lines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpZXIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvZGVsdGEtZG9lc250LW93ZS1tZS1tb3JlLWxlZ3Jvb20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Doesn't Owe Me More Legroom,"I have traveled so much over the last few months that I’m recognized at the Delta check-in counter at the Birmingham airport. This travel has given me ample time to think about what airlines owe their customers. Airlines take flak periodically when they try to charge extremely obese passengers for two seats and I have some notes I made years ago when there was a similar dust-up about leg room (or the lack of it) for tall passengers. As a tall guy (about 6’5”) I know the discomfort of sharing a row with another big passenger. Isn’t it outrageous that they cram us into those tiny seats to increase their profits? Don’t the airlines owe us comfortable rides?

No and no. It’s clear when we ask what airlines would have to give up. It might seem callous to write “Big passengers who value comfort could pay to sit in first class or the ‘comfort’ seats.” We did not choose to be this way however. Why should the big and the tall pay more especially when we are that way through no fault of our own?

The answer is pretty simple: It costs more to serve big-and-tall passengers. It’s not because we ask for a refill on coffee (which I do) or because we take too many snacks. We cost more because we take up more room. An obese passenger spilling over into the next seat so much that no one can sit there costs the airline the revenue they would have enjoyed by selling the seat to another passenger. I don’t see how this is fair to the workers and shareholders who rely on the airline’s prosperity for income. A single obese passenger taking up two seats for which passengers would pay $500 each costs $1000—the airline’s revenue from selling tickets to someone else– to accommodate. It might be an injustice in a cosmic sense but it’s unclear why this is the other passengers’ problem.

Legroom is like that too. Airlines could offer more legroom but they would have fewer seats per plane if they did. The revenue they would have to give up to provide the more comfortable seats is the cost of accommodating taller passengers. But again it’s not clear why my height (and girth truth be told) are the responsibility of teachers in California whose pension funds might own Delta stock. Should they accept lower profits and less-comfortable retirements because I want more legroom?

Let’s come back to “If you want it pay for it” because it illustrates how people respect one another’s choices in free markets. Airlines offer more legroom and wider seats for people willing to pay for them. But time and again we passengers reveal through our choices that we’re not willing. If I wanted to guarantee myself a lot of space I could do so by booking a seat in first class or Comfort+. I usually don’t do this though. Instead I pay the basic economy fare and essentially enter into a lottery where because I fly Delta pretty regularly I occasionally get bumped up to Comfort+ or first class. I could pay for guaranteed legroom but I’m not usually willing to. I grumble when I fold myself into a tiny seat with no legroom next to someone my size. I remind myself however that I could have paid a little extra to be more comfortable but decided I preferred other things instead.

Why isn’t travel more comfortable when it easily could be? Simple: Passengers aren’t willing to pay for it. By offering bigger seats and more legroom airlines are essentially asking if we’re ready to cover the cost of providing the additional comfort. When we choose cheaper less comfortable economy class seats we’re saying “No thank you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8xNi9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lLXBpbG90cy1mYXRpZ3VlLXNhZmV0eS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNC8xNi9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lLXBpbG90cy1mYXRpZ3VlLXNhZmV0eQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fatigue is starting to put safety at risk pilots say,"CNN —

Pilots at Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines say pilot exhaustion is on the rise and they’re pressing the airlines treat fatigue and the mistakes that result as a safety risk.

“Fatigue both acute and cumulative has become Southwest Airlines’ number-one safety threat” the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association or SWAPA told airline executives in a letter this week.

The causes the pilots say include cancellation chaos caused by severe weather and climbing demand for air travel testing the mettle of still-recovering airlines.

Passenger numbers are about 90% of 2019 levels this month according to Transportation Security Administration data but major US passenger airlines are about 3000 employees short from that time period according to Bureau of Transportation Statistics data. Thousands of pilots retired – either by choice or aging out at 65 – during the pandemic and research presented by the Regional Airline Association says 2000 pilots reach mandatory retirement age this year. Mandatory retirement numbers are expected to grow over the next 6 years.

Southwest executives identified staffing as one of their key priorities this year setting a goal of hiring 8000 new employees. Forty percent of those will be flight crews.

More hiring alone will not solve the fatigue issues SWAPA president Casey Murray says.

“A lot of our delays and issues that we’re having have to do more with scheduling and connecting pilots with airplanes” Murray told CNN in an interview. “It is inefficient scheduling processes that are affecting when we work in a very dynamic environment.”

The union wrote in the letter to executives that the number of pilots who reported being unable to work because of fatigue skyrocketed last fall including a 600% spike in October and hit “another staggering 330% increase” last month. “April is already setting fatigue records” SWAPA wrote.

Federal rules set baseline limits on hours pilots may work and require rest periods. The limits for major US airlines include 30 hours of flying time each week and at a minimum 9 hours of rest between shifts.

But pilots report the stresses of the job and changes because of storms can leave them worn out before hitting those benchmarks.

Southwest Airlines acknowledged a climb in fatigue reports filed last month – 35 reports for every 10000 duty periods compared to 10 reports for the same metric in March 2019. Spokeswoman Brandy King said the numbers show an effective system.

“The increase is expected as it’s common to experience an elevated level of fatigue calls during irregular operations and in March the industry faced weather and airspace delays that resulted in disruptions across the network” King wrote in a statement to CNN. “The March increase in Pilot fatigue calls is a result of the system working as designed allowing Crew to determine if they are too fatigued to fly.”

Delta Air Lines pilots are holding a series of demonstrations at airports this month drawing attention to their fatigue concerns.

“Our pilots are tired and fatigued” Evan Baach a captain at Delta and official with Air Line Pilots Association or ALPA told CNN affiliate KSL at a Salt Lake City airport protest. He said pilots are working “longer days with shorter nights at home.”

Jason Ambrosi chairman of the Delta group at ALPA said that pilots are responsible as “the last line of defense” in aviation safety but “too often we are being pushed to our limits as Delta tries to add back flying and capture revenue.”

ALPA wrote in a message to Delta members last month that the pandemic presented “several opportunities for Delta to re-set its broken pilot staffing issue.” As air travel rebounds now the union wrote unresolved problems are becoming more apparent: The number of pilots available to step in and cover for an issue caused by weather maintenance or a sick colleague is significantly smaller.

“Delta Flight Operations continues to run the operation at red line” the union note reads. “So if it feels like you are working more and seeing less control over your schedule – you are right; you are.”

Delta told CNN that its scheduling follows federal rules for pilot work and rest hours.

“We continuously evaluate our staffing models and plan ahead so that we can recover quickly when unforeseen circumstances arise and the resilience of the Delta people is unmatched in that regard” spokesman Morgan Durrant said. “All of our people including our pilots are working hard to restore our airline and deliver for our customers as we emerge from the pandemic. We are grateful for and proud of their efforts.”

Last year pilots from all carriers filed about 60 reports of mistakes or other incidents involving fatigue to the federal Aviation Safety Reporting System. The reports are posted to a federal website anonymously without identifying names or airlines.

Some pilots wrote they were tired after handling training responsibilities. Others said airline managers asked them to handle too many extra flights because of short staffing.

“Both of us were yawning and eye rubbing halfway through our 6+ hour flight… I was physically unable to keep up” one captain wrote in November despite having “appropriate average sleep the night before.”

“But ‘we’ press on - don’t we?” the pilot continued. “Our threats are threefold of the pre-Covid environment. We’ve been facing delays shortages planning and staffing issues that are NOT being taken into account in building schedules. Why? Because we pilots are counted upon to make it work.”

– CNN’s Pete Muntean and Raja Razek contributed to this report",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbXlub3J0aHdlc3QuY29tLzM0MzcxNzAvZGVsdGEtYWlybGluZXMtcGlja2V0LXNlYS10YWMtbG93LXN0YWZmaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Airlines pilots to become latest to picket at Sea-Tac citing strain from low staffing,"In early April Alaska Airlines pilots at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport picketed to protest what they say is an outdated labor deal all while grappling with low staffing. Now Delta Airlines pilots are voicing similar concerns with a picket of their own planned for Tuesday April 19.

The union representing Delta’s pilots claims that the airline is currently “trying to operate more flights with fewer pilots leaving no wiggle room for weather delays and operational strain” and that they have been logging “record amounts of overtime” in the process.

“Pilots are mission-oriented and want to deliver the best service in the industry but we are also humans with limitations” Delta Master Executive Council Chairman Capt. Jason Ambrosi said in a news release. “Not every day is blue skies. Weather disruptions and other operational issues can cause flight delays and cancellations. Our customers deserve better.”

Alaska Airlines cancels at least 71 Sea-Tac flights as pilots picket

Ultimately Delta pilots are hoping to have “management come to the table to discuss scheduling concerns.”

That will have the airline’s pilots picketing on Tuesday at Sea-Tac marking the fifth different travel hub where they will have done so.

Meanwhile Alaska Airlines pilots are continuing to warn of a shortage of pilots following a slew of cancelled flights. Ultimately the airline was forced to scale back its flight schedule starting in June to account for ongoing staffing difficulties.

Talks between the airline and the union representing pilots have been ongoing since 2019 but were paused for a year “as the industry weathered the pandemic” the company notes. Alaska says that it filed for mediation in October of 2021 with a session scheduled for late April.

SOUTHWEST and Delta pilots are warning that the number one risk to plane safety is on the rise.

The issue has repeatedly been reported to the federal Aviation Safety Reporting System.

1 Pilots are reporting a major safety risk is on the rise

“Fatigue both acute and cumulative has become Southwest Airlines’ number-one safety threat” the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association wrote in a letter to airline executives this week.

Cancellations and delays due to severe weather are cited as contributing factors to fatigue according to pilots.

Demand is also an issue with many airlines still rebounding from Covid and millions more people traveling.

New data from the Transportation Security Administration shows passenger numbers sitting around 90 percent of 2019 levels.

However US airlines don't have the same number of employees they did back then.

In fact they have about 3000 fewer employees according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

Many pilots retired or aged out at 65 during the pandemic.

On top of that the Regional Airline Association says another 2000 pilots will hit the mandatory retirement age in 2022.

Southwest has said hiring more employees is a priority this year.

The company plans to hire around 8000 new staffers with 40 percent being flight crews CNN said.

SWAPA says the number of pilots unable to work due to fatigue spiked significantly last fall and another increase occurred just last month

“April is already setting fatigue records” SWAPA wrote in the letter to executives.

Meanwhile Delta pilots have been staging demonstrations at airports across the country this month to call attention to their concerns.

Last month the Air Line Pilots Association sent a message to Delta members writing that there were “several opportunities for Delta to re-set its broken pilot staffing issue"" during the pandemic.

The ALPA also noted that coverage for pilots experiencing fatigue due to weather changes or illness is harder to come by.

“Delta Flight Operations continues to run the operation at red line” the letter states.

“So if it feels like you are working more and seeing less control over your schedule – you are right; you are.”

There are federal rules and regulations around work hours and rest periods for pilots.

Most major airlines have a limit of 30 hours of flying time with a minimum of nine hours of rest between flights.

Pilots from all airlines filed 60 reports of incidents or mistakes attributed to fatigue according to CNN.

To achieve this target carbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a vital role with the help of petroleum engineering and geoscience skills. Companies need to leverage existing assets and technology to establish a successful low-carbon venture technology. Strategic areas that companies could potentially invest to succeed in a low-carbon venture technology are

Successful Field Projects

Gorgon CO 2 Injection Project. Chevron’s Gorgon CO 2 injection project in Northwest Australia is one of the largest CO 2 injection projects in the world. Gas that is being produced from the formation contains CO 2  which is separated compressed and geologically stored in the Dupuy formation. The integrated facility of the Gorgon project can be seen in Fig. 1. Dupuy formation is a Jurassic saline reservoir deep beneath Barrow Island (Flett et al. 2008). There are nine CO 2 injection wells and 4 water production wells to manage the reservoir pressure (pressure management wells).

When CO 2 gets injected and the pressure builds up water production wells are evacuating water so that the accumulation of high pressure gets released. The produced water is being injected into a different formation as shown in Fig 2. A 3D-seismic analysis was conducted as a function of time to observe how plumes are forming and growing. There are few observation wells equipped with downhole pressure gauges to monitor pressure readings continuously. As a result of this effort 3.4–4.0 million tons/year of CO 2 is being injected into the Dupuy formation and a significant cut in the overall CO 2 emissions was observed. Also an integrated reservoir surveillance plan was adopted to monitor the injected CO 2 and study the subsurface uncertainties (Denney 2013).

Agbami Oilfield Miscible Natural Gas Injection Project. Agbami field is a $5 billion deepwater natural gas injection project in Nigeria which holds about 1 billion bbl of recoverable oil. The field was discovered in 1998 and has been producing for the past 12 years. All the produced gas from the field is being injected back into the formation and no gas is being flared. The FPSO vessel in the Agbami field layout (Fig. 3) was built by South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering. The field (Fig. 4) is producing around 220000–240000 bbl/day of light sweet crude with an average value of 47 °API.

The bottom of the reservoir consists of water injection wells and the top of the reservoir consists of natural gas injection wells. The gas is being injected at the top pushing the oil down and water is being injected at the bottom and pushing the oil up. This process is known as the “Double Displacement Process” and the oil gets squeezed out of the reservoir by the creation of an effective drive mechanism. Oil and the injected gas are miscible in first contact and thus miscible gas displacement process is taking place effectively in the field.

CO2 Injection Projects

CO 2 EOR is a proven process and more than 166 CO 2 EOR projects are currently active around the world producing more than 450000 bbl of oil per day (McGlade 2018). These numbers are expected to increase to more than 1.2 million bbl and 1.64 million bbl of oil per day in 2030 and 2040 respectively (IEA 2019). During the tertiary recovery phase i.e. CO 2 EOR (Fig. 5) CO 2 injection helps in repressurizing the reservoir and with miscible displacement generates significant incremental oil production.

Fig. 5—Different phases in the oil and gas production.

The first notable CO 2 EOR project is the SACROC project in the Permian Basin (Crameik and Plasssey 1972) and the first commercial-scale anthropogenic CO 2 EOR project is Petra Nova in Texas (2017). Technically SACROC was the first anthropogenic project started by Chevron in 1972 in the US as CO 2 from the neighboring gas plants was collected and transported to the field for CO 2 EOR. Chevron Denbury Resources Devon Energy ExxonMobil Kinder Morgan and Occidental Petroleum are some of the major companies performing CO 2 floods.

Commercial/Social:



Oil price

CO 2 price

price Tax incentives in different countries (45Q in the United States)



Currently the industry is injecting more pore volumes of CO 2 than earlier. There is more emphasis on maintaining wellbore conditions and improving sweep efficiency. Companies are targeting ROZ located below oil/water contact and far from the main pay zone (Harouaka et al. 2013). Chevron Hess Oxy and ExxonMobil have their ongoing CO 2 EOR ROZ projects in the Permian Basin in San Andres pay zone (Melzer et al. 2006). Various EOR field trials are being performed in the unconventional reservoirs particularly in Bakken and Eagle Ford formations (Thakur 2019).

Conclusion

CO 2 EOR is a proven technology and it has demonstrated success over the past 50 years in conventional reservoirs. Anthropogenic CO 2 capture and storage projects for EOR are growing and being implemented all over the world. CO 2 and natural gas EOR for unconventional reservoirs has the potential to double the recovery factor. There is additional potential for deep saline aquifers and ROZ/TOZ in Permian Basin. Retention of CO 2 is a concern that most companies have and we must work as a multidisciplinary team including geoscientists field operations personnel environmental scientists and others to address them. By running injection profiles and pressure tests and having a rigorous injection well management and surveillance approach companies can eliminate this concern. CCUS and CO 2 EOR can help to meet the demand for oil and gas in the future. According to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute there are currently 23 large-scale CCS facilities in operation or under construction around the world to capture around 40 million tons of CO 2 per year.

Some interpreted the cheeky messages as an effort to intentionally “troll” Coachella which the rapper was supposed to headline before he was dropped last December in light of the Astroworld tragedy.

The billboards come exactly five months after the fatal Astroworld disaster in November which resulted in the deaths of 10 festival attendees. Their cause of death was compression asphyxia or suffocation from the unregulated crowd surge during Scott’s performance. Scott has been heavily criticized for his conduct during and after the incident about how he handled – or failed to handle – the tragic losses essentially refusing to admit any responsibility or liability for them.

Scott’s Utopia billboards ahead of this weekend’s Coachella are problematic on two main fronts: First they’re too soon; and second their poor execution perpetuates his apathetic insensitive and guiltless stance on what happened to the victims and their families.

Last week the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences announced that they will ban Will Smith from attending any and all events – both IRL and virtual – hosted by them for the next 10 years. Although this can’t be directly compared to the Astroworld calamity a decade-long ban over a slap is a stark contrast to Scott’s imminent comeback just five months after a catastrophe of arguably much graver proportions. Under the negligence of Scott and his team actual lives were lost and hundreds more have been left injured and traumatized.

Will Smith’s “slapcident” and the tragedy of Astroworld are wholly different in that the former was a fully intentional – although shortsightedly spontaneous – act carried out on Smith’s own accord while the latter was an accident. The Academy was also able to reach a swift disciplinary decision for Smith because he violated the board’s delineated code of conduct whereas the conversation on how Scott should be held accountable treads on murkier waters. It is difficult – impossible even – to set a moral standard by which to appropriately punish or restrict Scott in this case.

It’s also worth noting that Smith’s Academy ban is not a “cancellation.” He may still be nominated for the Oscars and go on to make movies. He might even make more buzz and win more popularity post-slap. But the core issue with Scott is not whether we should jump to cancel him now – it’s about his unconcerned behavior thus far and our collective passivity or even acceptance of it.

Even without setting any subjective moral standards on the “reasonable” amount of time for Scott to grieve and go on hiatus the Coachella-targeted PR stunt is still ill-timed. They come in the middle of the rapper’s ongoing mass injury lawsuit a giant multidistrict litigation consisting of at least 387 claims for nearly 2800 alleged victims. This lawsuit should be to Scott what the Academy board was to Smith: The courts have to decide whether and how if at all the disgraced musician should be held accountable. His choice to erect billboards with such playful and ironic messaging in the midst of this court battle is a carefree gesture that disrespects those who were permanently scarred by Astroworld. Imagine: Would he be able to pull the same billboards in Houston the site where the fatal tragedy took place? Placing them in California does not make them any less horrid.

More trouble looms ahead with the impending Astroworld documentary Concert Crush which is already garnering a lot of controversy on its own.

The Astroworld casualties have been most compared to the 2000 Roskilde Festival where nine people were trampled to death in a mosh pit during a performance by Pearl Jam. And while this comparison yields haunting similarities between the two misfortunes what sets them apart is how the artists reacted afterward. Pearl Jam canceled their subsequent shows and invested in programming that actually improved safety protocols of music festivals throughout Europe. On an emotional level the band seriously considered disbanding and never playing again but when they did release another album two years later they dedicated a heartfelt song to the nine Roskilde victims. To this day Pearl Jam continues to pay their respects to them.

Last March a month before the Utopia billboards showed up Scott unveiled Project HEAL a charitable initiative “addressing challenges facing today’s youth” and a “tech-driven solution for event safety.” But their exact intentions and actions remain vague as they’ve yet to propose a concrete preventative solution to future concert mishaps. Attorneys representing the alleged Astroworld victims in Scott’s lawsuit actually argued for a gag order on the rapper when he revealed the project citing that it’s just another PR move to sway potential jurors.

Scott did pull himself out of the Day N Vegas Festival which took place a week after Astroworld. But he was far from stepping down from his other more lucrative deals like the 2022 Coachella stage and Dior collaboration until he was booted by both of them first (Scott might have still received a cancellation fee for Coachella). Another drastic contrast from the self-reflective actions set forth by Pearl Jam two decades prior and even those of Will Smith who voluntarily resigned from his Academy membership before any disciplinary decisions were made.

All this is to illustrate that Travis Scott has shown little to no remorse over the death of his fans a trauma we must not forget regardless of who is at fault. It is very possible that he and Live Nation will be found not guilty on their charges of negligence. But until that judgment is made and the victims’ families are properly compensated and/or apologized to it’s extremely insensitive even offensive for Scott to be putting up such billboards.

Yet when the tongue-in-cheek Utopia boards showed up last weekend and when Highsnobiety shared the news on our own feed the overwhelming reactions in the comments sections were anticipation and excitement over the forthcoming album. Despite and after all this is Travis Scott so culturally invincible that he can just move on along with his all-too-eager fans? Is he ultimately uncancellable and if so what allows him to be?

Of course Scott is far from the first or only controversial figure in pop culture who is seemingly shielded from the Cancel Culture chopping block. Although for different reasons arguably just as problematic is Kanye West whose unpredictable and erratic pattern of harassment is disturbing to witness through his “work.” The example of Ye is also interesting in that he’s associated with Scott and other even more controversial people like Marilyn Manson. For these musicians does their “uncancellability” also stem from their support of each other?

What is it that stirs the public to accept different levels of accountability from different people? Is it the subject’s diehard loyal fanbase their star power and cultural capital financial wealth or all of the above? What standards should we set when questioning if and how to hold them accountable?

Scott is a free man and has the right to express what he pleases. And if he could be legally absolved of this controversy he should absolutely go on to continue making music. But as a public figure he has the duty to act with maturity and moral integrity if not for the lives that were lost then at least in light of his lawsuit.

It remains to be seen what Scott will do with his Utopia proceeds; for all we know he may have plans to donate most or all of it to the bereaved families. But his lighthearted Coachella billboards were not the right move. He can and should do better. We the people must also think twice before jumping to support him so fast and other situations of this nature and look back on the magnitude of the real issue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdydW5nZS5jb20vODM0NTQxL3RoZS1teXN0ZXJ5LW9mLXRoZS10YW9zLWh1bS1vZi1uZXctbWV4aWNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Mystery Of The Taos Hum Of New Mexico,"The Mystery Of The Taos Hum Of New Mexico

Imagine hearing a persistent hum. You can't get it out of your head and worse you can't find the source. You lose sleep perpetually uncomfortable. ""I'd find myself with my ears pressed to walls and floors"" Yvonne Conner told the Financial Times. ""I used to sit in our front room after tea and at around seven o'clock every night I'd go 'It's coming.'"" It's frustrating. Not everyone can hear the hum leaving the people who can hear it to defend their experience. ""When nobody else can hear it you think you are going nuts and it just wears you down"" a person in Cambridgeshire England told The Guardian.

According to Discover Magazine many people around the world — somewhere between 2% and 5% — hear a continuous low-grade sound often described as a hum. Seldom taken seriously by scientists ""hum hearers"" continue to suffer. ""Eventually it starts to just eat away at you in your head"" Conner continued. However she and others like her have found solace in online forums or in community groups of others who also hear the hum.

Maha Mumbai Kabaddi League is round the corner. SportVot in association with Abhinav Kala Krida Mandal has launched the tournament with an aim to celebrate the sport of kabaddi and explore and empower the gen-next athletes. The tournament is a testament to the changing attitude of the youth of India towards their career choices.

These days youth are craving newer & better opportunities and fresher platforms to showcase their talent. The number of people looking at sports as a profession is growing and that is a positive sign but it is also disheartening to see the lack of opportunities and lack of exposure available for these talented young individuals.

SportVot felt the need to create a platform where players from grassroots levels will be empowered not just by providing them with the exposure to showcase their talent but also by helping them monetize their game and thus back them financially to pursue the sport as a profession! And that’s what has been the soul behind reviving and expanding the Maha Mumbai Kabaddi League. A league that was started in 2018 by Abhinav Kala Krida Mandal is now entering its third season all decked up to celebrate the sport.

There are more than 60000 registered Kabaddi players with 1200+ clubs and 6000+ teams in the financial capital of the country. Such a large pool of talent is going unnoticed because of the lack of opportunities. The Maha Mumbai Kabaddi League is designed to address and eliminate this issue.

The league is structured in such a way that every player no matter where he/she comes from or which club or team they are representing currently; will get selected on the basis of their talent. The process of choosing players is also going to be through auctions thus ensuring that fair chances are given to every team and every athlete.

Maha Mumbai Kabaddi League is held by SportVot in association with Abhinav Kala Krida Mandal. SportVot as a company is built on the idea of providing grassroots players and sporting associations state of the art facilities to take their game forward.

“The Maha Mumbai Kabaddi League is designed for the development and upliftment of grassroots players. We at SportVot have streamed more than 7500 kabaddi matches and have created digital player identities for more than 35000 kabaddi players PAN India; and we have now taken up the baton in association with Abhinav Krida Mandal to safeguard and enhance the future of Kabadi in Mumbai” says Sidhhant Agarwal the Founder and CEO of SportVot.

He further added “The league was launched on the 12th of April and within a span of four days we have already sold four franchises. The response we are getting for this league is overwhelming and we hope it continues to be so. The revival of the Maha Mumbai Kabaddi league is a matter of extreme pride for us and we can’t wait to share all the details about the tournament and are more than excited to witness the games.

—————

With inflation at a 40-year high to start 2022 consumers are more aware of the rising food and fuel costs. In a recent earnings call Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts the retailer would hold the line on prices to continue growing its grocery share.

“During periods of inflation like this middle-income families lower-middle-income families even wealthier families become more price-sensitive and that’s to our advantage” McMillon said. “So we’ve been through this before and we run with inflation around the world all the time. But inflation is a different environment in the U.S. right now than it has been in recent times for sure.”

“Everyday low prices” is at the heart of Walmart’s business model and McMillon said merchants are having more talks with suppliers to mitigate inflationary pressures on the business.

Walmart did see same-store sales rise 5.6% in the fourth quarter. The company reported grocery comps increased by the high single digits in the period with sales growth and market share gains aided by slightly wider price gaps than pre-pandemic levels expanded digital offerings. Walmart was seen as taking market share in grocery in the fourth quarter ending Jan. 31.

To test price gaps in Walmart’s home market of Bentonville the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal conducted on March 30 a price comparison against Aldi and Dollar General. The comparison results show Walmart does not have the lowest price on at least 19 grocery and consumable staples. The shopping list included store brands and a few national brands. The basket included eggs milk bread bacon canned tuna frozen chicken canned green beans canned chili deli ham mayo peanut butter saltine crackers cereal trash bags laundry detergent toilet paper toothpaste aspirin shampoo and conditioner.

The Walmart basket of the 19 items cost $64.16 16% more than the same items at Aldi. The Aldi basket cost $55 and had the lowest prices overall on 16 of the items compared. Aldi was the low price leader overall saving a shopper $9.16.

Dollar General’s total basket cost was $62.55 after coupons which was 2.5% less than the Walmart basket but 13.75% more expensive than Aldi. The most significant price gap between the three discount competitors was for a gallon of 2% milk and a dozen large eggs. The milk at Aldi was $2.27 compared to $4.03 at Walmart and $4.25 at Dollar General. The eggs cost $1.43 at Aldi compared to $1.91 at Walmart and $2.95 at Dollar General. Black Forest ham for sandwiches also showed wide price gaps between Aldi and the other discounters. The 8-ounce store brand of ham costs $2.99 at Aldi whereas the Great Value ham in the same size costs $4.78. Hormel ham sold at Dollar General costs $3.98 for 8 ounces.

The price gaps were closer between the competitors on branded items such as Tide detergent Jif peanut butter and Honey Nut Cheerios. Aldi had a small price gap with Dollar General and Walmart on the 28-ounce jar of Jif Creamy Peanut Butter costing $3.98. The same item cost $4.15 at Walmart and $4.25 at Dollar General. The large Honey Nut Cheerios cost $3.49 at Aldi compared to $3.98 at Walmart while Dollar General had the cereal on sale for $3.50 with a 75-cent digital coupon. Other national brands such as Tide Crest and Hellman’s mayo showed tight price gaps between the competitors.

Simply Tide detergent was priced at 14.7 cents per load with the Walmart bottle costing $3.24 for 22 loads. The same product bottled for 20 loads costs $2.94 at Aldi the same 14.7 cents per load at Walmart. Dollar General had a digital coupon for the Simply Tide product which took the final cost down to $2.75 per bottle. The Dollar General bottle came out to 13.75 cents per load at the coupon price. Without the coupon the Dollar General price was $3.25 for 20 loads and more expensive than the other two retailers.

The large tube of Crest toothpaste was cheaper at Dollar General because of the $1 coupon. The large tube cost $2 at Dollar General $3 at Walmart and $3.12 at Aldi for 0.2 more ounces than sold at Walmart.

Pantene 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner cost $3.47 at Walmart for 10.4 ounces. That equates to 33.3 cents per ounce. A 12-ounce bottle at Aldi costs $3.79 which comes to 31.5 cents per ounce a slightly better value than the smaller Walmart bottle. For the best value Dollar General’s 17-ounce bottle of the same product costs $5 equating to 29.5 cents per ounce.

Frozen chicken was another area where Aldi beat Walmart. A 48-ounce bag of Great Value skinless boneless chicken breasts was $8.37 at Walmart and $6.99 for the same size bag of Kirkland’s chicken brand at Aldi. That’s a savings of 19.7%. Dollar General sold a smaller bag of chicken a Tyson Foods brand which cost $6.95 for 32 ounces.

Toilet paper and other nonedible consumables like trash bags were closer in price among the three retailers. Using the Great Value store brand at Walmart Aldi’s store brand and Dollar General’s store brand that each compares to Scott’s 4-roll package the cost was $4.88 at Walmart $3.99 at Aldi and $3 at Dollar General which had the best overall value. Walmart had the best value on store-branded large kitchen trash bags at $6.92 for 50 bags. The comparable item at Aldi had 40 bags selling for $6.49 and Dollar General sold similar bags for $7. The cost per bag at Walmart was 13 cents compared to 14 cents at Dollar General and 15 cents at Aldi.

Scott Benedict an executive at Rogers-based WhiteSpyder and a former Walmart buyer said it’s sometimes hard to tell if product quality is equal when looking at private brand products. He said Walmart has worked to improve its Great Value private brand quality. Aldi is also known for high-quality private brands.

Benedict agreed that Walmart might not have the lowest cost on a basket of goods on any given day. Still the retail giant does offer shoppers more variety various size packs and a broader assortment of many grocery items. Aldi and Dollar General offer a limited inventory because they operate smaller formats. Walmart also has the edge in online ordering and pickup convenience at no added costs. Aldi partners with Instacart and there are delivery costs with online orders. Dollar General also offers online order pickup through the retailer’s mobile app that allows customers to apply coupons at checkout a feature Walmart does not provide.

Benedict said the item pricing game takes constant attention and retailers like Dollar General will use coupons to stay competitive on certain items. He said Aldi is a deep discounter with limited assortments but they are stout competitors in dairy fresh food and other categories. He also said pricing is relevant to locality and the competition in a specific market.

A birding paradise isn’t likely the first thing that comes to mind as you approach Dutch Gap Conservation Area. Located in Chester adjacent to the vast artery that is Interstate 95 the area is packed with industrial warehouses and Dominion Energy’s Chesterfield Power Station complex. In fact if it’s your first time visiting you’d probably think you were lost. But once you get past these sections you are magically transported into a different world.

Dutch Gap is situated around Henricus Park (one of the oldest English settlements in the U.S.) and the canal begun there during the Civil War still sees shipping traffic today. In 2000 the Dutch Gap Conservation Area as we know it came to fruition on nearby Farrar’s Island thanks to the Richmond Audubon Society which helped to make it more accessible to the public.

While Chesterfield County is responsible for the grounds the Richmond Audubon Society does its part to maintain the area as a bird paradise. As a result of the society’s work the land has become a sanctuary for avian creatures ranging from majestic bald eagles to playful hummingbirds. And following them are a multitude of bird-watchers hauling telephoto lenses field journals and binoculars who immerse themselves in this oasis made up of wetlands a swamp and the James River.

Julie Kacmarcik has been banding Dutch Gap birds for both the Richmond Audubon Society and the MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship) program since 2007. During the spring she and her friend Bob Harris grab their nets canoe and other essential tools to build and monitor the prothonotary warbler nesting boxes in the park. They’ll also check the condition of the boxes many of which feature an ingenious design created by Dr. Bob Reilly the founder of Dutch Gap’s prothonotary warbler research sites. Similar to a bluebird box the warbler home has a small trap on the back with an arm-like contraption that can be pulled to lift its plexiglass cover. When a warbler flies in Kacmarcik and Harris close the cover via remote control and then quickly paddle over to the box to check and band the birds. This mission will continue until about the end of July.

Kacmarcik explains that there are more than 125 boxes at Dutch Gap and she can tell when the warblers make their debut simply by hearing their calls. “They’re very vocal and the males love singing” she says. “It’s an exciting time when you find the first prothonotary warbler of the season.”

As they work volunteers need to watch out for aggressive tree swallows that might claim the boxes cunning snakes and even the occasional massive carp that could jump into their canoe (a true story Kacmarcik laughingly recalls).

As Mary Elfner president of the Richmond Audubon Society notes without volunteers working tirelessly to build and sustain bird boxes Dutch Gap’s bird population wouldn’t necessarily be as abundant. Mark Battista a naturalist for Chesterfield County Parks & Recreation says volunteers help park staff with tasks that would otherwise be difficult to keep up with. He estimates that in the past few years about 600 to 800 warbler hatchlings have lived in the boxes.

Kacmarcik also helps collect data from May to August at the Dutch Gap Banding Station for MAPS — a small shelter built by a local Eagle Scout. The structure holds large mist nets that the group carefully sets up to catch passing birds. Most of the time common backyard birds such as cardinals and robins will be found but sometimes unusual ones will be too including pileated woodpeckers and yellow-billed cuckoos. As Kacmarcik notes “MAPS has done a lot for community outreach. A lot of people come out to observe and many start developing an interest in birding when they experience the process firsthand.”

While the birds love the grounds there are some concerns about the health of the landscape due to its location near the Dominion power station and its two basins that store coal ash a byproduct of burning coal that contains heavy metals and other toxic pollutants. A 2018 study conducted at Dutch Gap Conservation Area by the James River Association and Southern Environmental Law Center found “there are elevated noncancer hazards and cancer risks for recreational visitors who interact with areas where contamination from the coal ash ponds is migrating into Dutch Gap Conservation Area.”

Local outcry following the study’s release pushed the Virginia General Assembly to pass legislation in 2019 requiring Dominion to remove 15 million cubic yards of coal ash from the ponds within the next 15 years — a process the company is currently undertaking. And while it might seem that there would be tension between the power plant and the Richmond Audubon Society Kacmarcik notes that Dominion has been very supportive of the group’s endeavors — a hint of birds bringing all sides together.

While the full environmental impact on the birds isn’t fully known one thing is certain: They love the habitat thanks not only to its diverse environment but also to the surrounding community that works tirelessly to make it a comfortable haven for them. Kacmarcik says “It’s a great place to go and clear your head take pictures and listen to birds.”

In August 2007 North Carolina adopted the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (REPS) which requires investor-owned utilities in the state to acquire up to 12.5 percent of their energy mix from renewables starting in 2021. Poultry and swine waste which can be used to produce biogas are counted among renewable energy sources along with solar wind geothermal and others.

The adoption of REPS spurred energy partnerships between waste-to-energy producers and utility companies like Duke Energy one of the main investor-owned utilities and a long-time supporter of biomass.

Under REPS utility companies buy renewable energy credits (RECs) from the companies that produce energy from swine and poultry waste. A renewable energy credit is one megawatt-hour of electricity produced by a renewable source and supplied to the grid. The utility companies buy the credits in order to meet the renewable energy targets stipulated under the new standard.

In its 2021 report the North Carolina Utilities Commission which oversees energy-related matters reported that the companies producing electricity from poultry and swine waste had been missing their energy generation targets since 2014 because of persisting technological and operational problems.

As a result the commission has been revising its yearly estimates of energy from biogas and biomass-powered energy sources saying that the technology is still in the early stages of development and that the projects have experienced operational challenges.

In North Carolina an estimated 2000 industrial hog operations raise a total of 9 million hogs annually. The state is ranked second in poultry production after Georgia with over 5700 farms raising more than 500 million chickens and turkeys annually according to the North Carolina Poultry Federation. Advocates view the state’s backing of biogas from poultry and swine waste which the livestock operations generate in enormous quantities as an industry-approved response to the challenge of waste disposal and management that also allows commercial operators to make more profit.

But environmental and citizen groups argue that using the animal waste for biogas produces more ammonia emissions and increases the risk of water and air pollution with adverse human health impacts. The stalled waste-to-energy projects provide a renewed opportunity to demand that the state stop providing incentives for “dirty energy” advocates say.

Biogas is mainly composed of methane—a potent greenhouse gas—and produced by the decomposition or conversion of biomass sources such as poultry and swine waste wood chips and waste from landfills. A byproduct of fossil fuels biogas and biomass are considered by many clean energy advocates to imperil communities and contaminate the environment.

Since REPS became the law the commission has repeatedly allowed utility companies to postpone their compliance with waste-to-energy targets because the producers could not supply enough electricity.

As a result the waste-to-energy target from animal waste for all utility companies operating in North Carolina was lowered from 700000 megawatt hours (MWh) to 500000 MWh in 2019 and the 2021 target increased only moderately to 900000 MWh the commission reported.

“Swine biogas and woody biomass look—at least on the surface—like easy ways to help achieve North Carolina’s goals of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions” said Dr. Ryan Emanuel an associate professor at Duke University.

The state’s 2019 clean energy plan he noted leans hard on both biogas and biomass. “To admit that these energy sources don’t perform as expected—or that they perpetuate environmental racism calls into question some aspects of the energy plan” Emanuel said.

He added that companies that hope to use swine biogas claim that they are addressing the problems the waste poses for nearby communities by collecting and processing the methane from the animal waste.

“But the new process still does not address air and water issues” he said adding “These operations exacerbate existing disparities in the distribution of environmental harms because they force us to hold on to models of food production that saddle vulnerable and marginalized communities with pollution.”

Duke Energy one of the main investor-owned utility companies operating in the state has already indicated that it is unlikely to meet its future waste-to-energy targets citing continuing difficulties in generating electricity from poultry and swine waste experienced by the power plants it has contracted with.

In the compliance plan Duke Energy shared with the utilities commission the utility said it was anticipating problems in meeting the targets because “suppliers have either delayed projects or lowered the volume of RECs to be produced.” The plan also noted that that one facility was offline for repairs and modifications and was unlikely to generate electricity until 2023.

Duke Energy expects a new poultry waste-to-energy project to become operational in 2022 and three others to start functioning in 2023 according to the utilities commission report. But the commission has expressed skepticism about Duke’s aspirations saying that start-up issues and other operational challenges could frustrate the utility’s waste-to-energy targets.

Dominion Energy—the other utility company operating in North Carolina—also expressed frustration with producers generating electricity from swine waste in the compliance report it filed with the state utilities commission. The utility said it was searching for opportunities to buy sufficient poultry-powered electricity from within North Carolina and from other places in the United States to meet its 2021 to 2023 requirements under REPS.

Dominion has already invested in a $500 million biogas joint venture known as Align Renewable Natural Gas or Align RNG with the country’s largest pork producer Smithfield Foods. The project involves laying more than 30 miles of pipeline connecting 19 hog farms spread across eastern North Carolina’s poorest counties Duplin and Sampson. The methane captured from swine waste will be piped to a central processing facility for processing and then sold as natural gas.

The prospect of new waste-to-energy facilities compounding the existing environmental problems has alarmed community groups and advocates who argue that the increased development of the energy sources goes against Gov. Roy Cooper’s stated commitment to a clean energy transition. Profiting from outdated waste management practices known to contaminate the environment and endanger public health advocates argue also negates efforts by the Biden administration to address longstanding environmental injustice in low-income communities that are disproportionately harmed by industrial pollution.

Roy Lee Lindsey chief executive officer of the N.C. Pork Council responded that the waste-to-energy facilities make sense financially and environmentally.

“While the market has been slower to develop than many anticipated biogas remains a viable and promising technology that is supported by the EPA and the NC Clean Energy Plan. Continued investment in RNG projects makes sense from both an economic and environmental standpoint” Lindsey said. “The ability to generate renewable energy on North Carolina hog farms is gaining traction and provides many tangible benefits including fewer greenhouse gas emissions less odor and reduced potential for flooding during hurricanes. Biogas should be embraced by everyone who cares about these issues.”

Duke Energy signed a power purchase agreement to buy electricity from North Carolina Renewable Power (NCRP) the biomass-burning power plant located in Lumberton that is currently idle.

But since June 2020 the utility and NCRP have been embroiled in a dispute with each accusing the other of defaulting on contractual obligations company correspondence filed with the utilities commission shows. In a November 2020 letter to NCRP’s legal counsel Duke Energy claimed that NCRP failed to supply the energy it had promised under the power purchase agreement it had signed with the utility.

“Our requests for information were uniformly met with incomplete information untruths and obfuscations” Duke’s representative said in the letter alleging a lack of transparency in disclosing operational problems that NCRP was experiencing at the time.

Duke Energy is demanding compensation for the damages it claims to have incurred because of NCRP’s “non-performance” and the utility has already indicated its intention to terminate the energy purchase agreement with NCRP citing defaults and accumulated damages.

In its 2020 compliance plan the utility estimated that it would need more than 250000 renewable energy credits (RECs) generated from poultry waste for 2021 and 2022 to meet its compliance obligations under REPS.

Operating in Robeson County since 2015 North Carolina Renewable Power (NCRP) has earned notoriety for violating the terms of its permit including repeatedly exceeding emissions limits for carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 and methane. The company has applied for a new permit a move hotly contested by residents and environmental groups who argue that the plant cannot be trusted to be a good neighbor. The company management said it has decided not to operate the plant until it gets the new permit from North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).

Responding to a request for comments Carey Davis the executive vice president of Georgia Renewable Power which owns NCRP said the company is aware that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality is reviewing the public comments on NCRP’s permit request and that the agency will issue a report and recommendations on the proposed permit based upon its review.

In a response to Duke Energy’s allegations NCRP accused the utility of reneging on its obligations by failing to pay for the energy and RECs it has already purchased. “Duke’s abuse of its monopolistic market position and refusal to pay NCRP what it owes” has prevented the power plant from operating NCRP said in the letter

Randy Wheeless a Duke energy representative said the utility company is in the middle of confidential discussions with the North Carolina facility. “Duke Energy was buying power from the facility from 2015 until it ceased operation in 2020. Because the facility was using poultry waste as a fuel the purchase power helped Duke Energy with its REPS compliance in the state of North Carolina” he added.

NCRP had not responded to requests for comments on the dispute by the time of this article’s publication.

Despite the stalled progress of waste-to-energy projects and the setbacks to the state’s energy targets North Carolina is fast-tracking regulations that would expand the footprint of biogas and biomass energy in the state.

“There’s no doubt that now is the time for an objective review of North Carolina’s renewable energy policy in view of the evidence we now have from the impacted communities” said Donna Chavis senior climate campaigner with the nonprofit Friends of the Earth. She said another reason for re-evaluating the state’s renewable energy matrix is the effort at the federal level to pass the Environmental Justice for All Act. “If it passes the states will have to act anyway. It would be better if did it ourselves instead of forced by federal law” Chavis said.

In Feb 2020 U.S. Reps. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and A. Donald McEachin (D-Va.) introduced the landmark legislation which was followed by a companion bill in the Senate sponsored in July 2020 by then-Sen. Kamala Harris who was elected vice president in November 2020.

Hailed as the most comprehensive environmental justice bill in Congressional history the legislation still moving through committees is aimed at addressing long-standing environmental inequities that have historically harmed low-income communities of color and tribal and Indigenous communities across the country.

“The economic and political power of the utility companies and fossil fuel industry is now combined with the economic and political power of industrial agriculture for the first time on both the national and international levels” said Rev. Mac Legerton co-director of Robeson County Cooperative for Sustainable Development.

He said the handholding between fossil fuels and industrial agriculture poses new and largely unrecognized challenges to the efforts to reduce carbon emissions across the United States. “Eastern North Carolina is ground zero for the incineration of poultry waste and the pipelining burning and emitting of methane gas captured from hog lagoons in the name of renewable energy” Legerton said.

Lisa Sorg of N.C. Policy Watch a media nonprofit said the subject of energy policy in North Carolina is so politically charged that revisiting it could also be problematic.

“We have several state legislators who are very big on natural gas and biogas right now” she said “so you’ve got big fossil fuels and huge agribusiness interests in North Carolina and they want these sorts of waste-to-energy technologies to proliferate.”

The United States is by far the world’s largest producer of nuclear energy. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency active nuclear power plants in the US have the capacity to generate 95.5 gigawatts of electricity annually. In France the world’s second largest producer of nuclear energy production capacity totals just 61.4 gigawatts.

All told nuclear power plants account for about 19% of total electricity production nationwide. While nuclear power is a critical component of the American power grid some states rely more on nuclear energy than others. Over a quarter of the 93 active nuclear reactors in the United States are concentrated in just three states. Meanwhile nearly half of all states have no active nuclear power plants. (This is how much renewable energy your state produces.)

Using data from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission 24/7 Wall St identified the states that are home to the most nuclear reactors. States with the same number of nuclear reactors are listed alphabetically.

Among the 28 states on this list six have just one active nuclear reactor and seven have only two. Meanwhile three states have more than five. Generally states without any nuclear power plants produce electricity through native natural resources. Much of the power consumed in West Virginia for example is generated through coal-burning plants while some Great Plains states like Iowa rely heavily on wind farms. (These are the US wind farms generating the most electricity.)

Though nuclear energy is by far the most reliable and efficient power source available and produces no carbon pollution it is not without drawbacks. Nuclear power plants generate nuclear waste which cannot be destroyed and requires long-term storage. Additionally as accidents at the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine in 1986 and the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011 – not to mention our own Three Mile Island partial core meltdown in 1979 – have demonstrated malfunctions can be catastrophic. Nuclear power plants also have high-startup costs which can reduce their economic competitiveness.

Traditionally the point of camouflage is to blend in. Images of hunters or soldiers crouched down on a forest floor dressed head to toe in neutral-colored splotches typically come to mind when someone mentions the pattern. Well that or the circa-2001 music video for Destiny’s Child “Survivor.” However when it concerns your home’s design Anthropologie is asking you to reframe what camo looks like. Its new Poppy collection with famed interior designer Mark D. Sikes (the creative behind Reese Witherspoon’s home and storefronts) shows us how the method of camouflage can be used to help a space stand out. And no there are no leafy green and sandy beige blobs in sight.

In the campaign images a gridded bookcase is shown positioned against a wallpaper treatment that matches the graph paper–like design exactly. The result is a bit trippy but it instantly adds depth to the room and makes the space extra visually interesting. In another shot we see poppy-print dining chairs in a space with not only a coordinating table but ceiling and walls swathed in the same motif. The pattern play isn’t limited to the furniture. Sikes introduced his signature blue and white combination in the form of gingham dinner plates and paisley side dishes. Just throw in the line’s cobalt blue stemless wineglasses and it’s a recipe for entertaining success.

The season couldn’t have been much better for Isaiah Roby.

The dominos the third year forward needed to fall fell and he got a larger role for the Thunder especially near the end of the season.

While the center position is the biggest hole for Oklahoma City heading into the offseason Roby passed his tests and earned his grade.

Here’s how the young prospect graded out in his third NBA campaign.

Overall grade: B+ Chris Nicoll/USA TODAY Sports When his name was called he answered. That’s the best way to sum up Roby’s 2021-22 season for OKC. His role in his third season was massive at the tail end of the season with Jeremiah Robinson-Earl and Mike Muscala both out long term with injuries. The Thunder needed a big man to handle the load and Roby was the answer. He played in 45 games dealing with injuries himself and stents in the G-League and started 28 of those games. It was a career year for Roby. He set career highs in field goal percentage 3-point percentage blocks per game and points per game. Offense: A Steve Dykes-USA TODAY Sports When Roby scored he scored in bunches and he scored efficiently. Roby scored a career best 10.1 points per game which big picture doesn’t shatter NBA records but for the role Roby was in most of the season his scoring was just what the Thunder needed from him. Roby shot 51.4% from the field this season three percentage points better than in the 2020-21 season. He also posted a 44.4% clip from 3-point range which was the best clip of any key Thunder player. On the board Roby also provided much needed help. While again it wasn’t record breaking he grabbed 4.8 rebounds per game. His biggest help came on the offensive glass notching nearly two offensive rebounds per game second to only Josh Giddey of players who played 20 or more games. Defense: B Thomas Shea / USA TODAY Sports Most of Roby’s impact for OKC came offensively which can be expected from a player who is defending out of his position most nights. However even in defending bigger complete NBA centers most games Roby held his ground and was able to show that he could defend All-Star level centers despite being 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds. Roby would be a power forward for most NBA rosters but for OKC he defended the five and did well. Roby finished the year averaging just under one steal and one block per game. His rebounding ability also helped the Thunder defensively. Roby’s defense mostly due his length and athleticism helped mightily to pass his third year test.

The incident spanned Saturday evening into late Saturday night The Gleaner understands.

Senior Superintendent Dwight Powell said following yesterday's pandemonium the police will have to revisit the issuing of party permits and also its strategy for dealing with traffic.

There was a flood of complaints on social media last night by persons who had to spend several hours in a traffic jam between Ocho Rios and St Ann's Bay as a party at the government-owned property Pearly Beach in the Dunn's River area hosted Festival of Floats.

However Powell said Festival of Floats was not the only contributing event as there were other activities in the area.

“There were many persons visiting the parish yesterday all the beaches were filled. As you know St Ann is a place for holidaymakers so this is the first major holiday weekend since the opening of the country. The influx of people that came in yesterday totally inundated what we had in terms of police” Powell said.

He continued: “On good days we're having challenges already. Yesterday was an extraordinary one for us. Going into the rest of the holiday we're revisiting our strategies as we're expecting some other major events to see how best we can avert situations like what happened yesterday.”

Among the events set for St Ann over the rest of the weekend are Sands set for today (Sunday); racing at the Dover Raceway; Igloo at the Ocho Rios Bay Beach and Ocho Rios Carnival slated for Turtle River Park on Easter Monday.

Andrew Allen who was caught in traffic along the thoroughfare yesterday remarked that there was a lot of chaos and confusion as he tried to make his way off the highway at the Mammee Bay round-about on his journey from Kingston to Ocho Rios.

He said after being stuck at the round-about for approximately an hour he went back on the highway and exited at Golden Grove travelled through Colgate and Fern Gully only to be confronted by another traffic heading towards Milford Road into Ocho Rios.

“General indiscipline of motorists was a major contributing factor it was not just the taxi operators who were at fault. The police just could not cope” he pointed out.

He described his experience as being mild compared to some others.

A drive from Ocho Rios to St Ann's Bay which usually takes about 25 minutes or less lasted up to three-and-a-half hours for some motorists.

Several workers at some places of employment waited in vain for their assigned vehicle to pick them up and had to seek alternate transport. Several others opted to walk for long distances from Ocho Rios to Drax Hall and even to St Ann's Bay The Gleaner also understands.

Peep peep: Springtime’s favorite candy is back now in the form of Peeps-flavored ice cream.

Cold Stone Creamery is selling a chilly twist on the classic chick-shaped marshmallows with Peeps sundaes which you can have delivered to your home for free on Easter.

The treat consists of Peeps-flavored ice cream with whipped topping blue sugar crystals and a yellow Peeps marshmallow candy in the shape of a chick Cold Stone says on its website.

They’re also offering a Peeps-flavored milkshake and fans can add a Peep topping to any ice cream flavor.

Easter season accounts for about 75% of Peeps sales each year and the company often debuts unexpected collaborations during the early spring.

This year in addition to the ice cream fans of the sugary little birds can also buy Peeps nail polish from Sally Hansen; try out pastel Peeps makeup from ColourPop; and pick out stuffed Peeps bunnies at Build-A-Bear Workshop according to Just Born Quality Confections which manufactures Peeps.

Weird? Maybe. But last year Pepsi launched a limited-edition Peeps soda and 7-Eleven served a Peeps latte.

While those options are no longer available fans interested in trying the ice cream can have it delivered to their homes free of charge. Cold Stone is offering free delivery on all orders placed during weekends throughout April.

The ice cream flavor will be available at Cold Stone Creamery until May 1.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdmlkZW9zL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDMvMzAvbXVyZG9jaHMtYWxpc3luLWNhbWVyb3RhLWZveC1uZXdzLXJvbi1jbm4uY25u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Fox anchor on why her same-sex marriage story never aired,"1.

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

For the first time anywhere in the nation a developer builders huge corporations and a power company are coming together to study the homes of the future. This month Innovation Way was unveiled at Babcock Ranch. It features a row of models that highlight some never before used technology along with new technology that is just gaining popularity. Florida Power and Light will study energy use in the homes for two years to see what works best. The builders will look at what buyers want and what is cost effective.

“Innovation Way is a way to change the industry” said Tom Hoban Kitson and Partners’ President and chief investment officer.

Syd Kitson Chairman/CEO of Kitson & Partners is excited about this new venture.

“We talked to all the builders and nobody has done this anywhere else” Kitson began. “That is what is exciting about it. You will see that this innovation works and then you will see it all over the country.”

Kitson stressed that because FPL is collecting data and not the builders it will be non-biased and aimed at looking at what is best for the consumer.

Lennar Pulte and D.R. Horton built the models. Each builder created two homes with the latest innovations. Lennar also built two identical models without the new technology to use as a control. A final model by Lennar is a high tech partly deconstructed home to show how some of the items work from within the walls.

“This is not just for Babcock Ranch” Kitson stressed. “This will improve homes all over the country. When you have these builders that are national brands they will deploy this faster than any other builders because they are literally in all parts of the country.”

While the builders all created smart homes with things lighting and temperature set and monitored from smart phones and devices each builder also installed some items unique to them.

Pulte is proud of its air conditioning system that features circular vents instead of the traditional rectangle or square shape. It also has a different system of duct work. Instead of a large duct that branches off to smaller ducts around the house the Pulte homes have three inch micro ducts that all come out individually from the air handler.

“They all run directly from the air conditioning unit to where they supply air no mixing boxes no air exchanges so it’s a more even temperature” said Nick Crawford Pulte’s director of strategic sourcing.

The exterior walls are made from insulated concrete forms. The Sherman Williams paint has air purifying technology for the interior walls. Alexa can control the kitchen faucets. The Silestone quartz countertops contain innovate bacteria resistant technology and is stain shock and scratch resistant. Artificial turf in the backyard was installed for low maintenance and is environmentally friendly. Permeable pavers for the driveway and walkway allow water to percolate back into the lot instead of into the storm water system. Four batteries in the garage are for power backup instead of a generator.

Pulte also partnered with Ford for one of their models. In the garage is a Ford charging port and a wall of information about the F-150 Lightning Fords new electric truck.

“We had a connection with our corporate marketing team and the Ford corporate marketing team and Ford was looking for a place to showcase it. And being this is a community of the future they though it would be a great partnership” Crawford explained.

Pulte’s two models are the Oakview and the Cobblestone. The Oakview is a two-story five bedroom four bathroom home that spans 3654 square feet under air. The Cobblestone is a one story house with three bedrooms and two bathroom that spans 2408 under air.

“We were super pumped to get started” Crawford said. “We were really excited to reach into our partnerships and our teams to develop the innovation products. Some of these products in both houses are not even available in retail yet so that is so cool.

We learned so much on what we should and shouldn’t offer. Hopefully some of the stuff will be included in our future homes.”

Lennar’s two models with the innovations are the Chestnut and the Redbud. The Chestnut is a three bedroom plus den two bathroom home that spans 2086 square feet under air. The Redbud is a five bedroom four bathroom house modeled as four bedrooms and a den. It spans 3261 square feet under air. Karen Gough vice president of sales is excited to showcase a new type of electrical panel.

“Span reinvented the electrical panel” Gough began. “It’s become a digital control and monitors everything in your home.”

A computer panel shows all the energy use for every source and every room.

The Greyter system is being studied in the Redbud model. That system takes water that has been used in the shower and bath filters it and returns it to be used in the toilet.

“It is more water efficient and environmentally friendly” said Dave Meyers director of operations for Lennar.

John Bell cofounder of Greyter says the system is not only good for the environment it saves money.

“It just makes sense” Bell stated. “The typical family of four saves 9000 gallons per year.”

Lennar is also showcasing a RHEIA small duct system where the HVAC is all run in air conditioned spaces. The system also has a built in ventilating dehumidifier system.

Meyers said Lennar wanted to put a wide variety to innovations into these models to not only test the efficiency but the cost effectiveness of each item.

“With Lennar we don’t just dip our toe in it we go all the way” Meyers stressed.

D.R. Horton built their two models in just 64 days. They put their innovations into the Cordale and the Clearden. The Cordale is a three bedroom two full and one half bathroom house that spans 2000 square feet. The Clearden has four bedrooms and two full and one half bathroom and is 2700 square feet.

Kyle Knight director of operations for D.R. Horton pointed out special innovative features that include smart switches that can make windows and glass doors go from clear to frosted. He called up an app on his phone to demonstrate the smart lighting and temperature settings. Push the away button and the lights go off and the windows darken with the frosted setting. Push home and the windows become clear and the lights go on. In the kitchen two bottom sections of the refrigerator can be set to be refrigerated or freezers. The home has memory foam insulation. A Square D program gives smart information on individual appliances so people can see what is on or off from anywhere at anytime. An energy monitoring system allows a person to see what energy is being used and where.

“It is similar to Span but this is a monitoring system Span is the actual panel” Knight explained. “This is by appliance. You can see what you are doing. Span is monitored by circuits.”

All water that comes through the home is monitored. The system learns the homeowner’s habits in the first 60 days and if something is different it notifies the homeowner of a water usage difference.

Getting so many different companies on board usually isn’t easy.

“How often do you get Lennar Pulte and D.R. Horton to work together?” questioned Kitson. “They are fierce competitors.”

Yet they are competitors that all jumped at the prospect of working together on this project.

“We are the three largest builders in the country building homes side by side” Crawford exclaimed. “Knowing that all three had the same goals in mind we started the process for all three to develop a strategy independently from the other two so we would not all be doing the same thing. It was unique. We probably won’t get the opportunity to do this again.”

“It's fun. I like competition” Knight added. “I have a lot of friends at Pulte and Lennar so it is a friendly competition. We don’t typically do joint ventures so this is something special.”

Manufacturers were also part of the partnership. A lot of the systems in the homes were donated by the manufacturers that wanted to display and show what their product can do.

The houses also feature motion activated faucets. There are voice activated showers where a person can simple say “turn on the water to 85 degrees.” There is a microwave that can power the entire kitchen. A television becomes a picture frame with photos when not in use.

“If you have a teenage kid and they are in the shower too long you can turn the water off on them in the shower or turn the water down to 60 degrees” Hoban explained.

The models are not for sale. They will be monitored by FPL for two years and the data will be used to see what works and what doesn’t and what homeowners want. Even though no one is living in the home FPL can still collect data as if a family was in residence.

“The beauty of Innovation Way is that not only will visitors be accessing the homes and interacting with the various technologies including turning on lights running faucets and the air conditioning etc. but also many of the technologies in these homes are application-enabled which allows us to run simulations without physically accessing the homes” stated Alyssa Ten Eyck Marketing and Communications for FPL.

Kitson is proud to be the first in the nation to create this collaborative innovation testing.

“The innovation and some of things put in these homes are truly remarkable” he exclaimed. “The whole point is to make these homes more efficient and less expensive to operate and we need to prove that and that is what FPL is doing. That is what Babcock Ranch is all about. It is all about innovation and creating things that will better people’s lives. We are the only ones in the country with this test lab.

Babcock Ranch has sold more than 2000 homes and is on pace for another record-setting year. Recognized as the country’s 14th fastest-selling master-planned community in 2021 by RCLCO Real Estate Advisors the town reported 714 homes sold in 2021.

“This is a significant milestone from a development perspective and for the 2000 families who were looking for a better way of life and found it at Babcock Ranch” said Syd Kitson chairman and CEO of Kitson & Partners which is developing America’s first solar-powered town. “They understand the vision and recognized Babcock Ranch as an authentic hometown that emphasizes people community and a healthy lifestyle.”

Created with respect for the natural environment and the philosophy that smart growth and sustainability work hand in hand half of Babcock Ranch’s footprint is set aside as greenways parks and expansive lakes providing recreation and scenic backdrops for homes and the Founder’s Square downtown district.

Residents Lindsay and Justin Graham saw the vision during their first visit.

“As soon as we drove over the bridge we knew we were home” said Lindsay. “It just spoke to us. We saw what it was going to be and wanted to be part of it.”

Encompassing 18000-acres Babcock Ranch is planned for 19500 residences and 6000000 square feet of commercial space. Construction activity continues to accelerate to meet demands with new homes neighborhoods amenities and facilities introducing the next phase of the town’s development.

The completion of the 82640-square-foot Crescent B Commons shopping center last fall brought the convenience of a Publix grocery story restaurants and professional services to residents with more businesses opening in the coming months.

Also under construction are the state-of-the-art Babcock High School planned to open for the 2022-23 school year and a one-story field house which will serve as an emergency shelter and a recreation center for school and community activities.

“Providing shopping education and recreation close to home is important to the Babcock vision as a vibrant sustainable community filled with possibilities” said Kitson.

In August 2007 North Carolina adopted the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (REPS) which requires investor-owned utilities in the state to acquire up to 12.5 percent of their energy mix from renewables starting in 2021. Poultry and swine waste which can be used to produce biogas are counted among renewable energy sources along with solar wind geothermal and others.

The adoption of REPS spurred energy partnerships between waste-to-energy producers and utility companies like Duke Energy one of the main investor-owned utilities and a long-time supporter of biomass.

Under REPS utility companies buy renewable energy credits (RECs) from the companies that produce energy from swine and poultry waste. A renewable energy credit is one megawatt-hour of electricity produced by a renewable source and supplied to the grid. The utility companies buy the credits in order to meet the renewable energy targets stipulated under the new standard.

In its 2021 report the North Carolina Utilities Commission which oversees energy-related matters reported that the companies producing electricity from poultry and swine waste had been missing their energy generation targets since 2014 because of persisting technological and operational problems.

As a result the commission has been revising its yearly estimates of energy from biogas and biomass-powered energy sources saying that the technology is still in the early stages of development and that the projects have experienced operational challenges.

In North Carolina an estimated 2000 industrial hog operations raise a total of 9 million hogs annually. The state is ranked second in poultry production after Georgia with over 5700 farms raising more than 500 million chickens and turkeys annually according to the North Carolina Poultry Federation. Advocates view the state’s backing of biogas from poultry and swine waste which the livestock operations generate in enormous quantities as an industry-approved response to the challenge of waste disposal and management that also allows commercial operators to make more profit.

But environmental and citizen groups argue that using the animal waste for biogas produces more ammonia emissions and increases the risk of water and air pollution with adverse human health impacts. The stalled waste-to-energy projects provide a renewed opportunity to demand that the state stop providing incentives for “dirty energy” advocates say.

Biogas is mainly composed of methane—a potent greenhouse gas—and produced by the decomposition or conversion of biomass sources such as poultry and swine waste wood chips and waste from landfills. A byproduct of fossil fuels biogas and biomass are considered by many clean energy advocates to imperil communities and contaminate the environment.

Since REPS became the law the commission has repeatedly allowed utility companies to postpone their compliance with waste-to-energy targets because the producers could not supply enough electricity.

As a result the waste-to-energy target from animal waste for all utility companies operating in North Carolina was lowered from 700000 megawatt hours (MWh) to 500000 MWh in 2019 and the 2021 target increased only moderately to 900000 MWh the commission reported.

“Swine biogas and woody biomass look—at least on the surface—like easy ways to help achieve North Carolina’s goals of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions” said Dr. Ryan Emanuel an associate professor at Duke University.

The state’s 2019 clean energy plan he noted leans hard on both biogas and biomass. “To admit that these energy sources don’t perform as expected—or that they perpetuate environmental racism calls into question some aspects of the energy plan” Emanuel said.

He added that companies that hope to use swine biogas claim that they are addressing the problems the waste poses for nearby communities by collecting and processing the methane from the animal waste.

“But the new process still does not address air and water issues” he said adding “These operations exacerbate existing disparities in the distribution of environmental harms because they force us to hold on to models of food production that saddle vulnerable and marginalized communities with pollution.”

Duke Energy one of the main investor-owned utility companies operating in the state has already indicated that it is unlikely to meet its future waste-to-energy targets citing continuing difficulties in generating electricity from poultry and swine waste experienced by the power plants it has contracted with.

In the compliance plan Duke Energy shared with the utilities commission the utility said it was anticipating problems in meeting the targets because “suppliers have either delayed projects or lowered the volume of RECs to be produced.” The plan also noted that that one facility was offline for repairs and modifications and was unlikely to generate electricity until 2023.

Duke Energy expects a new poultry waste-to-energy project to become operational in 2022 and three others to start functioning in 2023 according to the utilities commission report. But the commission has expressed skepticism about Duke’s aspirations saying that start-up issues and other operational challenges could frustrate the utility’s waste-to-energy targets.

Dominion Energy—the other utility company operating in North Carolina—also expressed frustration with producers generating electricity from swine waste in the compliance report it filed with the state utilities commission. The utility said it was searching for opportunities to buy sufficient poultry-powered electricity from within North Carolina and from other places in the United States to meet its 2021 to 2023 requirements under REPS.

Dominion has already invested in a $500 million biogas joint venture known as Align Renewable Natural Gas or Align RNG with the country’s largest pork producer Smithfield Foods. The project involves laying more than 30 miles of pipeline connecting 19 hog farms spread across eastern North Carolina’s poorest counties Duplin and Sampson. The methane captured from swine waste will be piped to a central processing facility for processing and then sold as natural gas.

The prospect of new waste-to-energy facilities compounding the existing environmental problems has alarmed community groups and advocates who argue that the increased development of the energy sources goes against Gov. Roy Cooper’s stated commitment to a clean energy transition. Profiting from outdated waste management practices known to contaminate the environment and endanger public health advocates argue also negates efforts by the Biden administration to address longstanding environmental injustice in low-income communities that are disproportionately harmed by industrial pollution.

Roy Lee Lindsey chief executive officer of the N.C. Pork Council responded that the waste-to-energy facilities make sense financially and environmentally.

“While the market has been slower to develop than many anticipated biogas remains a viable and promising technology that is supported by the EPA and the NC Clean Energy Plan. Continued investment in RNG projects makes sense from both an economic and environmental standpoint” Lindsey said. “The ability to generate renewable energy on North Carolina hog farms is gaining traction and provides many tangible benefits including fewer greenhouse gas emissions less odor and reduced potential for flooding during hurricanes. Biogas should be embraced by everyone who cares about these issues.”

Duke Energy signed a power purchase agreement to buy electricity from North Carolina Renewable Power (NCRP) the biomass-burning power plant located in Lumberton that is currently idle.

But since June 2020 the utility and NCRP have been embroiled in a dispute with each accusing the other of defaulting on contractual obligations company correspondence filed with the utilities commission shows. In a November 2020 letter to NCRP’s legal counsel Duke Energy claimed that NCRP failed to supply the energy it had promised under the power purchase agreement it had signed with the utility.

“Our requests for information were uniformly met with incomplete information untruths and obfuscations” Duke’s representative said in the letter alleging a lack of transparency in disclosing operational problems that NCRP was experiencing at the time.

Duke Energy is demanding compensation for the damages it claims to have incurred because of NCRP’s “non-performance” and the utility has already indicated its intention to terminate the energy purchase agreement with NCRP citing defaults and accumulated damages.

In its 2020 compliance plan the utility estimated that it would need more than 250000 renewable energy credits (RECs) generated from poultry waste for 2021 and 2022 to meet its compliance obligations under REPS.

Operating in Robeson County since 2015 North Carolina Renewable Power (NCRP) has earned notoriety for violating the terms of its permit including repeatedly exceeding emissions limits for carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 and methane. The company has applied for a new permit a move hotly contested by residents and environmental groups who argue that the plant cannot be trusted to be a good neighbor. The company management said it has decided not to operate the plant until it gets the new permit from North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).

Responding to a request for comments Carey Davis the executive vice president of Georgia Renewable Power which owns NCRP said the company is aware that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality is reviewing the public comments on NCRP’s permit request and that the agency will issue a report and recommendations on the proposed permit based upon its review.

In a response to Duke Energy’s allegations NCRP accused the utility of reneging on its obligations by failing to pay for the energy and RECs it has already purchased. “Duke’s abuse of its monopolistic market position and refusal to pay NCRP what it owes” has prevented the power plant from operating NCRP said in the letter

Randy Wheeless a Duke energy representative said the utility company is in the middle of confidential discussions with the North Carolina facility. “Duke Energy was buying power from the facility from 2015 until it ceased operation in 2020. Because the facility was using poultry waste as a fuel the purchase power helped Duke Energy with its REPS compliance in the state of North Carolina” he added.

NCRP had not responded to requests for comments on the dispute by the time of this article’s publication.

Despite the stalled progress of waste-to-energy projects and the setbacks to the state’s energy targets North Carolina is fast-tracking regulations that would expand the footprint of biogas and biomass energy in the state.

“There’s no doubt that now is the time for an objective review of North Carolina’s renewable energy policy in view of the evidence we now have from the impacted communities” said Donna Chavis senior climate campaigner with the nonprofit Friends of the Earth. She said another reason for re-evaluating the state’s renewable energy matrix is the effort at the federal level to pass the Environmental Justice for All Act. “If it passes the states will have to act anyway. It would be better if did it ourselves instead of forced by federal law” Chavis said.

In Feb 2020 U.S. Reps. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and A. Donald McEachin (D-Va.) introduced the landmark legislation which was followed by a companion bill in the Senate sponsored in July 2020 by then-Sen. Kamala Harris who was elected vice president in November 2020.

Hailed as the most comprehensive environmental justice bill in Congressional history the legislation still moving through committees is aimed at addressing long-standing environmental inequities that have historically harmed low-income communities of color and tribal and Indigenous communities across the country.

“The economic and political power of the utility companies and fossil fuel industry is now combined with the economic and political power of industrial agriculture for the first time on both the national and international levels” said Rev. Mac Legerton co-director of Robeson County Cooperative for Sustainable Development.

He said the handholding between fossil fuels and industrial agriculture poses new and largely unrecognized challenges to the efforts to reduce carbon emissions across the United States. “Eastern North Carolina is ground zero for the incineration of poultry waste and the pipelining burning and emitting of methane gas captured from hog lagoons in the name of renewable energy” Legerton said.

Lisa Sorg of N.C. Policy Watch a media nonprofit said the subject of energy policy in North Carolina is so politically charged that revisiting it could also be problematic.

“We have several state legislators who are very big on natural gas and biogas right now” she said “so you’ve got big fossil fuels and huge agribusiness interests in North Carolina and they want these sorts of waste-to-energy technologies to proliferate.”

Started in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks WFH is a nationwide program that provides opportunities for first responders including firefighters law enforcement officers and EMTs to meet with lawyers and obtain estate planning documents free of charge. The North Carolina Bar Foundation (NCBF) manages the North Carolina arm of the program holding clinics throughout the year and partnering with local law schools when possible to provide students with the opportunity to hone their skills working with clients and preparing legal documents.

“Meeting with a client interviewing a client assessing a client’s needs and helping to answer questions and provide direct resource information those are really important skills that will serve students well in their day-to-day profession but also help them feel comfortable as they enter practice to continue to serve through pro bono work” said NCBF Senior Director Kim Bart Mullikin ’02.

Prior to the clinic students received training on how to complete the documents. At the clinic in addition to working with an attorney some students acted as witnesses when documents were notarized at the end of each client’s visit.

Madison Santoli ’23 spearheaded this year’s effort building off her “memorable and fulfilling” experiences at Duke Law’s Health Justice Clinic and as a student leader at the Health Care Planning Project. She points to the Health Justice Clinic as an important reason for why she chose to attend Duke Law.

“For me working with clients helps to bring a sense of perspective to everything that we’re doing” Santoli said. “I find that it grounds me in reality. It helps me to remember what this is really all about and what the legal profession can do and how it can serve people.”

Santoli first learned about the WFH clinic from friend Amanda Joos ’23 and then contacted Assistant Dean of Public Interest and Pro Bono Stella A. Boswell to ask if it would be possible to resume the clinic at the Law School. Boswell immediately jumped on board.

“These clients are people whose lives might be at risk in the line of their professional work. And so for them having these things in place might have some additional meaning that maybe not all of us think about as frequently” Boswell said.

At the start of spring semester Santoli reached out to the NBCF speaking with Mullikin and Pro Bono Clinics Attorney Alex Rogers who manages the Foundation’s WFH program.

Rogers said “We were really excited to be able to come to the Law School have the students sit down with the attorney volunteers and actually experience interviewing a client or experience going through the document drafting app itself and seeing everything start to finish essentially.”

The wife of a first responder Rogers said WFH and the individuals and couples helped by the program are “near and dear to my heart.”

“I have first-hand experience understanding the relief that they feel in having these documents prepared and having these matters settled in the event that something does happen in the line of duty” Rogers said.

When the pandemic hit the NCBF adapted its in-person clinic for online sessions. Since then WFH has increased its use of technology offering hybrid clinics and added more volunteer attorneys. As a result WFH has expanded its reach throughout North Carolina with the goal of offering two to four clinics per month and nearly tripling the number of clinics offered annually.

“It’s really allowing us to go all over the state even to the small counties” Rogers said. “In the past we’ve stayed in the larger municipalities. And now a few weeks ago I was in Randolph County in Asheboro and I’ve been in Goldsboro in Wayne County and places where we in the past didn’t have the capacity volunteer-wise with the attorneys or with the technology to be able to serve those areas.”

Boswell said “The students tend to find it really rewarding to meet with a client to get to know the person that they’re assisting and to learn from the supervising attorney who might model for them a better way to ask a question or a better way to explain something without using unnecessary legal jargon.”

Mullikin added: “I truly believe that we as professionals–as attorney professionals as paralegal professionals and as law students who are entering this profession–have a commitment to serve our communities.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50L2FydGljbGUyNjA0MDkyMzIuaHRtbNIBS2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLm5ld3NvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50L2FydGljbGUyNjA0MDkyMzIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Key dates: Explore North Carolina’s recent climate legislation and executive orders,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.newsobserver.com', port=443): Read timed out.

COINING IT Rare error £2 coin sells for £255 on eBay – could the mistake be lurking in your change?

A RARE £2 coin has sold for almost 130 times its face value on eBay and it's all down to a major design fault.

The error £2 is all one colour - but £2 coins shouldn't look like that as they are usually silver in the middle and gold on the outside rim.

2 The coin should be silver in the middle but it's gold all over Credit: ebay

2 Between them five bidders placed 28 bids on the rare coin Credit: ebay

This coin however is gold all-over.

That mistake meant bidders were willing to fork out as much as £255 for the coin though as they battled it out on the online auction site last month.

Between them five bidders placed 28 bids on the rare coin each hoping to claim the copy for their own.

Bidding kicked off at £20 which was already a rate 10 times the coin's face value.

But it managed to rocket by a whopping £235 more in the space of just seven days.

The Royal Mint manufactures between three million and four million coins a day so often things will go wrong - and there's a great possibility that your own change you be worth its own pretty penny.

The original seller of this coin claimed they had found this copy lurking in their own change so it's always worth a look as you could be quids-in.

Could one be lurking in your change?

Error coins are still legal tender so while they may look a little odd there's still a high chance they could turn up in your change.

And even the simplest mistakes could be worth a mint - so keep an eye out.

Often £2 coins will crop up looking a bit like runny fried eggs.

Collectors are super keen to get their hands on the quirky fault though and they can pay hundreds of pounds for a copy of their own.

The error is not meant to be there of course so that means coins like it won't have been made in high volumes.

But that's what gets collectors interested - the harder a coin is to find then the more profit you may stand to make.

Only one rare error Army £2 coin with a misprinted phrase has been spotted for example yet experts say it could be worth £100.

It's the same with limited edition designs that The Royal Mint officially releases with low mintage figures - like the Kew Gardens 50p or anything from the Beatrix Potter collection or the Olympic range.

Because less are circulating they are deemed more scarce and valuable by collectors.

But experts warn that a number of fake coins often end up in circulation so you have to be careful when you're bidding online.

Change experts like Coin Hunter will help you verify if your rare finds are real and they can help place a value on coins you come across.

You can scroll through other eBay listings to get a general idea of how much collectors are willing to pay too.

And usually you can determine if something is the real deal by the number of bidders who were willing to stake their claim on it.

We've often seen bidding wars break out on the most highly sought-after copies.

But keep in mind that a buyer can always pull out of the sale which means it won't have sold for the price that it may say it has.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvbmV3cy9saXZlcnBvb2wtbmV3cy9jb3VwbGUtYnV5LXd3aWktc2hpcC1lYmF5LTIzNjcyODM40gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZXJwb29sZWNoby5jby51ay9uZXdzL2xpdmVycG9vbC1uZXdzL2NvdXBsZS1idXktd3dpaS1zaGlwLWViYXktMjM2NzI4MzguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Couple buy WWII ship on eBay and save it from scrapyard,"A couple who have been renovating a WWII ship they bought on eBay said it's ""physically and mentally draining but we absolutely love it"".

Gemma and Simon Robins who are camper van renovation specialists by trade purchased the 72ft ship called Sarinda in January 2021 after ""falling in love"" with the vessel. After first thinking it was just a ""crazy idea"" the couple made the ship a pandemic project when they found out she had been used in the D-day landings in June 1944.

The couple told the ECHO in April 2021 it was ""a heart over the head decision"" as they didn't have the budget for it. But Gemma and Simon fell in love with the ship after learning it would have been sold for scrap.

The couple spend almost any spare minute they have working on the ship and have already spent around £35000 on the project. Gemma 35 said although it's extremely labour intensive and costly the pair love the boat and have no regrets whatsoever.

The mum-of-two originally from Huyton but now living in Wrexham told the ECHO : ""It's obviously very time consuming and labour intensive especially as we both work all week so can only really do it on the weekend. It's physically demanding but also very mentally demanding as we have to plan out and organise everything we do to ensure we have the right materials.

""We never switch off from it as we're always thinking about what we're doing next and obviously it's very heavy on the wallet. We're just a normal working class family so to put this much money into something has been difficult.

""But it's a passion project as we want to preserve the history more than anything else. We didn't buy it because we wanted a boat - that was never on our radar.

""We read about the history and how she played a big part as a navigational vessel for D-day so we thought it needed to be preserved for as long as possible.""

(Image: Gemma and Simon Robins)

The couple have been documenting the ship's progress on their YouTube channel called 'Ship Happens'. This has allowed them to find friends all over the world and build a community they never thought they'd be part of. Gemma even visited California recently to meet a friend who has been restoring an old cruise ship.

The YouTube channel takes up a lot of the couple's time outside of working on the ship itself but Gemma said it's important as its nice to interact with people and show the importance of restoring wooden boats. She said: ""I didn't realise how much interaction they'd be but to speak with our viewers is really nice.

(Image: Gemma and Simon Robins)

""She's obviously a wooden boat which is rare nowadays so part of our work is to preserve that level of craftsmanship. It's nice to show that side on YouTube as we risk losing traditional craft methods.""

Gemma said the pair are currently undergoing one of their biggest pieces of restoration on the ship so far with the roof being completely stripped and rebuilt. The couple first predicted the work could take them around ten years but they have set themselves a new goal of the 85th anniversary of D-day.

She said: ""It would be really nice to go and take the boat over on the 85th anniversary of D-Day and do the Channel crossing. It'll be a lot of work to do in the seven years but I think that would be an amazing thing to do with the ship.

""It would be a fitting reward for the ship to make that journey all those years later.""

Digital currency acceptance by eBay

In 2021 NFTs a type of blockchain-based digital currency have increased in popularity with artwork sold for millions of dollars.

A growing number of businesses are accepting virtual currencies as payment bringing an asset class that was formerly ignored by big banks closer to the mainstream.

Last year eBay Inc was the first e-commerce company to accept the NFTs selling digital items such as pictures trading cards and video clips on its site.

Its platforms are available via an online experience mobile devices running iOS and Android and application programming interfaces (APIs). The business is divided into segments such as Marketplace.

Marketplace refers to eBay’s online marketplace which may be found at www.ebay.com as well as its regional counterparts and mobile applications.

eBay had previously stated that it would consider accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment in the future.

eBay Inc. which includes its marketplace platform is a global commerce corporation. The Company’s technologies and services are designed to provide buyers with a variety of relevant inventory while also allowing sellers to sell their products virtually anytime and anywhere.

User interfaces buyer seller and developer tools as well as transaction processing database and network applications are all developed by the company to assist users in completing transactions on its sites.

Amazon stands on crypto

Amazon is one of the world’s largest trading platforms. Jeffrey Preston Bezos most popularly known as Jeff Bezos launched the service in 1994.

One of the most pressing topics these days is whether or not Amazon would accept bitcoin as the future of cryptocurrency is dependent on the ability to pay with it. For a variety of reasons Amazon may find it difficult to take cryptocurrencies.

He also hinted that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) might be sold on its e-commerce platform in the future and that NFTs will continue to develop “substantially.”

Bitcoin transactions for example are somewhat slow with around 7 transactions per second whereas Amazon’s greatest number of transactions per second was 600.

Despite this the corporation has yet to make an official announcement about whether or not it would take virtual currency.

WEST JORDAN — Brad Bonham grew up in a family of entrepreneurs but he still describes falling into what has become a highly successful business as ""a little bit of a fluke.""

""I was selling gift baskets and gift products into Walmart retail stores"" he said.

Selling these products taught the CEO and co-owner of Walker Edison the power of leveraging a much larger retailer's consumer base for his own business ventures.

This experience and knowledge eventually led the then college-aged Bonham to the Canton Fair in China — the country's oldest largest and most representative trade fair — where he scoured for additional products to sell in Walmart stores.

""We found this piece of knocked-down furniture and I'd just purchased the same thing from Best Buy for like 250 bucks. When the factory owner told me the (original) price I was like 'Holy cow somebody made that much money selling me this good through Best Buy?'"" Bonham recalled.

With that Bonham ordered a container of furniture ""on a whim"" with his father being his first financial backer paying for the first few containers of product and setting in motion what would in 2006 become Walker Edison a Utah-based e-commerce manufacturing business that provides high quality ready-to-assemble home furnishings shipped straight to consumers' doors.

After a decade of being named to Utah Business' 50 fastest-growing companies in the state Walker Edison this month was named by World Trade Center Utah and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox as Utah's International Business of the Year.

""We're grateful for your business operations in Utah and recognize your fast-paced international business growth. Your team and capabilities have grown and so has your brand in the global marketplace"" Cox said in a statement to Walker Edison. ""Thank you for your Utah headquarters and for your corporate citizenship — for giving back generously to the state's communities and causes.""

Moving to different markets

Bonham isn't shy about the fact that he entered the e-commerce business at the ideal time.

""If you go back maybe even in the history of when you should've started an online home furnishings business I just happened by pure luck to choose the correct time to bring some of these items in"" Bonham said. ""Now the marketplace is pretty saturated with a lot of different vendors. Back then these major retailers were really kind of desperate for more product on their websites.""

Although he got into the business at a good time it still took work for Bonham to expand his business into different markets.

Especially since Bonham said that the local investment community never considered his business of selling furniture on the internet ""super sexy.""

""I had to build this business just through retained earnings"" Bonham said. ""Any dollars that we made my partner Matt Davis and I rolled those dollars back into future inventory purchases and we did that for more than a decade.""

To take the business to the next level Bonham launched what he called ""Operation Moneyball"" drawing inspiration from the 2011 sports drama film where the Oakland A's manager uses analytics to run his baseball team and make personnel decisions.

""I had my management team write every question that they didn't know the answer to on our conference room board"" Bonham said.

Within two hours the board was filled with questions related to inventory stock margins by channel partner and a wealth of other unknowns.

""We didn't know a lot about our business it just so happened that we were in a really high gross space and our stuff sold well — it was pretty unsophisticated at that point"" Bonham said.

These unknowns led Bonham to onboard with American Fork-based Domo a business intelligence software company that allowed Walker Edison to use an aggregation tool to access data.

""The moment we leveraged analytics in our business data became the focal point of how we made decisions (and) that's really when it took off"" Bonham said.

Now Bonham said Walker Edison has sourcing offices in southeast Asia and Brazil warehouses in Canada England and Germany along with a sales and marketing office in London.

Lessons learned and looking ahead

Being named as Utah's International Business of the Year means a lot to Bonham he said.

""It kind of validates our concept that it wasn't just a business plan for us here in Utah or us here in the United States domestically"" Bonham said. ""We know how to do business cross-country and develop and market products that meet the needs and demands of those in other places.""

To reach this accomplishment Bonham said that he invested heavily in company culture referencing the saying ""culture eats strategy for breakfast.""

""I totally subscribe to it because if you have a terrible culture nobody wants to work for you and that means your output is pretty low"" Bonham said. ""If people love working for you and it's not a chore when they get up in the morning they're motivated to succeed and that's really what we want.""

That mindset has permeated throughout Walker Edison and Bonham said that culture is the thread that binds the company together.

""We now sponsor dozens of charities"" Bonham said. ""Every single person in the company gets paid to take time off every quarter and we line up specific charity events that are brought to us by our employees and it has made all the difference in the world as a culture building exercise.""

Despite the recognition and success Bonham said that he still sees ""a lot of runway"" for domestic business in the U.S. but that the fastest growing business segments are overseas.

The moment we leveraged analytics in our business data became the focal point of how we made decisions (and) that's really when it took off. –Brad Bonham Walker Edison founder and CEO

""In the (European Union) and in Canada we continue to seek out opportunities where there's an infrastructure that will allow a business like ours to succeed"" Bonham said adding that they have hundreds of employees spread across the world.

Our Pick: Mwepu (Brighton — CM — 84)

SBCs

Objectives and Misc.

Welcome to the Locker Room. Here we can talk about all of FIFA 22 's Ultimate Team mode news once a week. That includes a list of the Team of the Week cards including our chosen pick as well as the newest SBCs and the objectives for the week.Week 30 is the first week for a while wth an obvious big hitter. Mbappé has a wonderful 94-rated card that might be topped later down the road but it's a beast regardless. Then we have Immobile who has never been my cup of tea but this 90-rated straight-shooter is pretty much a solid striker. The other big hitter is probably Barella. The Inter CM has great all around numbers just don’t shoot with him. I always expect people to overlook him because nothing he does is fantastic but his all-around IGS numbers are truly phenomenal.Brighton's Mwepu has an 84-rated midfield card that has some really incredible numbers on it. The more I look at it the less I can comprehend how on earth it is not a higher rating. 80's all-around gives him those good Ruud Gullit vibes but with a sensational 91 pace he will also skim past most players. He is currently trading at around 22k. Wow!We have picked the currently available SBCs and priced them as per FUTbin 's amazing listings. Chiellini starts proceedings this week with a 92-rated captain card. Indeed if there is a better captain we are yet to see it. This version of his card has everything you need: pace defending physicality dribbing… what more do you want? At 241k this is a steep hill to climb and there are cards with similar numbers but this isn’t a bad place to prepare for an end-of-year team. Jermain Defoe has a 90 rated card for the mighty Sunderland. Just go and get it. It’s Defoe. He made me cry once when he scored one of the most beautiful volleys against Newcastle. It helps that he has actually unreal numbers and is 90-rated. Better still: he’s 80k. João Félix has his POTM card which you can see above. Somehow he is 30k so I guess go and get him for a laugh? His numbers are solid not spectacular but he can turn on a dime and whips out a barnstormer every now and again. He would be nice to pop in the 10 position too.Silver Stars player Billy Sharp and is available as a captain card. That means eight goals six assists and three wins in the silver lounge are required. You also have the majestic Lars Stindl vying for your attention if you head to The Chosen One FUT Friendly. All you need to do is score two volleys score four goals with midfielders win four matches and score in ten separate matches. Not bad for a 89-rated card!

Jews have started Passover celebrations Muslims are marking Ramadan and Easter has arrived for Christians.

It's a time of reflection and a moment to affirm a commitment to faith for believers. But is it also an opportunity for adherents to alter their investment plans and base them on religious principles?

Religious or faith-based investment funds provide one answer. These portfolios all try to provide investors with solid returns without buying stocks or bonds issued by objectionable or ""sinful"" companies though those definitions vary.

Most Americans probably don't invest in this manner though faith-based investing is getting easier to do with the advent of more religious mutual- and exchange-traded funds. These portfolios have professional money managers at the helm who can among other tasks sort through companies based at least partly on the types of businesses they operate.

Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are both examples of broadly diversified portfolios that investors usually can purchase for a few thousand dollars if not less. The two categories vary in a few key respects — one being that people can buy or sell mutual funds only at a single daily closing price while ETFs can be traded at various prices throughout the day.

Not a large grouping of funds

While religious funds have existed for decades they haven't taken the investment world by storm. The funds are still comparatively few in number with relatively small assets under management.

Investment researcher Morningstar doesn't even break out religious funds as a separate category instead lumping them in the larger ESG — or environmental social and governance grouping — which numbers around 600 funds.

Broader ESG portfolios often are more geared to avoiding carbon polluters other environmental violators and companies engaged in animal testing/abuses. Religious funds are more focused around lifestyle issues.

While Christian funds predominate among the religious offerings Islamic funds also have gained a following such as the Amana mutual funds managed by Saturna Capital. The Amana funds steer clear of businesses engaged in liquor pornography gambling and banking. They also avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities favoring dividend-pay stocks for income.

For example large holdings in the Amana Income Fund include dividend payers Eli Lilly Microsoft Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Rockwell Automation and Pfizer.

Another Islam-focused portfolio the Azzad Ethical Fund excludes those types of corporations as well as tobacco producers weapons manufacturers some insurance companies and corporations suspected of being connected to human-rights abuses.

Different areas of emphasis

Even under the same general religious banner faith-based funds differ somewhat in their investment emphasis especially when screening out companies.

The Ave Maria fund family for example favors corporations that follow or at least don't violate anti-abortion Catholic values. The fund group said it avoids investments in several key areas — corporations engaged in or supporting abortion including Planned Parenthood pornography embryonic stem-cell research and companies with policies deemed to undermine the sacrament of marriage.

Incidentally advisers to the Ave Maria funds range from Detroit Archbishop Allen Vigneron to economist/Fox News anchor Larry Kudlow to Lou Holtz the Notre Dame football coaching legend.

By contrast the new FIS Biblically Responsible Risk Managed Fund based in Scottsdale enunciates a longer list. This fund won't invest in corporations believed to be involved in abortion contraception embryonic stem-cell research/human cloning human-rights violations pornography alcohol tobacco armaments or gambling.

""This fund is designed for the broad Christian community"" said manager Steven Nelson a former Catholic youth minister. ""For most Christians our fund will have appeal.""

The fund also seeks to invest in companies that it deems are building a healthier society and acting as responsible corporate citizens.

Much is in eyes of the beholder

But in many cases portfolio managers don't always have a clear-cut decision on whether a corporation would make an acceptable faith-based investment — not just based on business operations but also in terms of which groups or causes a firm supports with its philanthropic dollars or promotional efforts.

For example some Christian portfolio managers will blankly avoid companies that say donate to gay-rights groups or Planned Parenthood Nelson said. His fund also avoids such companies on donations made within the past two years but not longer than that.

It also comes down to context. For example if a company like Verizon gave $5000 to an objectionable nonprofit group clearly reflecting an employee match Nelson said he wouldn't remove or avoid the stock on that basis. ""But some managers would"" he said.

Top stock holdings in the FIS Biblically Responsible Fund which trades under the ticker symbol ""PRAY"" include Palo Alto Networks Apple Medtronic Ecolab and Zimmer Biomet. The fund also holds shares in two Arizona-based corporations — trash hauler Republic Services and GoDaddy the technology-services provider for small businesses.

Do religious funds sacrifice returns?

To the extent that religious funds aren't widely embraced that could partly reflect a perception that by weeding out stocks or bonds in certain industries investors will sacrifice performance.

Yet one study from the Christian Investment Forum showed solid results.

The study tracked the returns of 35 Christian stock funds against other stock funds over the 15 years through December 2020. Christian funds gained 7.1% annually on average over that period compared with 6.3% annually for the other stock funds. The study also attributed a slight performance edge to nine Christian bond funds against fixed-income funds in general 4.2% annually compared with 3.8%.

While based on a relatively small number of both stock and especially bond funds the results offer some support for the religious-investing cause at least for individuals who share similar values.

The study ""dispels some of the long-standing perceptions that incorporating faith-based criteria in addition to traditional investment criteria is correlated to underperformance"" wrote the study's author John Siverling.

Kim — who made her first and only appearance at the music festival back in 2019 to support ex Kanye West's Sunday Service — attended the event for a second time in an outfit that was less of a cliche and more in tune with her personal style.

Putting a sophisticated spin on concert dressing Kim showed up to the 2022 Revolve Festival wearing a monochromatic look that consisted of a gray one-shoulder crop top and a matching high-slit knit skirt. She rolled the skirt's waistline down to show off her toned midriff while the garment's thigh-grazing opening in front expertly showcased her extreme lace-up heeled sandals that criss-crossed past her knees.

When the 811-megawatt plant goes offline May 31 Consumers Energy which buys power from the Entergy-owned plant will lose a resource that currently represents about 10 percent of Consumers Energy's peak load capacity.

Consumers Energy plans to replace that lost capacity with a mix of investments in natural gas plants a massive solar energy capacity electric system upgrades energy efficiency programs and battery storage as part of its broader long-term plan to wean off coal plants and go green.

The headlines of that plan are the investment in 8000 MW of solar by 2040 with solar and wind generating 60 percent of electric capacity at that point.

In the short-term the company plans to buy four natural gas plants to replace lost coal and nuclear capacity while solar and wind resources can be built out. In 2025 Consumers' proposed energy portfolio would be 40 percent natural gas and 35 percent renewable.

""These plans all together will help ensure we are able to continue to deliver reliable clean affordable energy for Michigan during this historic clean energy transformation"" said Joshua Paciorek the company's West Michigan spokesperson.

The Michigan Public Service Commission which is responsible for ensuring Michigan has enough resources to meet electric needs is comfortable with the state's ability to meet electric load needs without Palisades online though MPSC Chair Dan Scripps noted the commission does have concerns about losing Palisades before its operating license expires in 2031.

Palisades is responsible for about 5.6 percent of the state's total electric production and can produce power reliably around the clock and in every season. Nuclear power is also a source of carbon dioxide emissions-free power though it's generally not counted as a ""renewable"" energy source because nuclear fuel must be mined and is only used once (in the U.S. — other countries like France reuse nuclear fuel).

When Entergy and Consumers first proposed a plan to retire the plant in 2018 MPSC didn't agree to allow Consumers to recover the full cost of the buyout of its contract to buy power from Palisades and the deal to close the plant in 2018 fell through.

Scripps said nuclear resources like Palisades seem to be undervalued in the market and the MPSC finds it ""unfortunate"" that market conditions — Consumers has said it can buy electricity more cheaply on the market than from its purchase agreement with Entergy — are causing plants like Palisades that supply reliable carbon-free electricity to close.

""The statewide energy assessment that came after the polar vortex in the winter of 2019 ultimately found that resources like Palisades have a lot of value and that not all of that value is adequately compensated that some of the things it can do providing that baseload power the carbon-neutral piece of nuclear that those just don't show up in the market they're not fully valued at this point"" Scripps said. ""Those concerns continue.""

Pro-nuclear climate activists have protested the shutdown of Palisades and urged Michigan's governor and the state legislature to intervene arguing the state is losing a reliable source of clean energy with the closure.

Consumers — and Michigan overall — has shown it can meet its power needs over the next few years without Palisades.

The company is required by law to submit proof to the MPSC each year that it has enough power lined up to meet demand for the next four years whether from its own generating sources contracts with other power plants or purchases from the market.

It also has to submit its long-term plans for meeting energy needs to the MPSC for their review and approval. Consumers' most recent submittal which calls for the early closure of Port Sheldon's J.H. Campbell plant is currently under review by the commission with a decision expected soon.

However Michigan is also part of a larger regional gird and a red flag for the region appeared this week when the Midcontinent Independent System Operator the organization that operates the electric grid for 15 Midwest states including Michigan announced a 1230 MW-shortfall in capacity in the north/central region which includes Michigan.

The shortfall exposes the area to a ""slightly increased risk"" that power providers would need to implement load shedding or temporary power outages to reduce power demand in an emergency situation according to MISO.

MISO's report dated April 14 notes the region needs to address loss of high-reliability sources like coal and nuclear and their replacement with sources like solar and wind.

""To be clear they're not saying that we're in this position because Palisades is closing but there are a number of units across the region retiring and some retiring faster than anticipated and so we're now in a position where the region as a whole could use the energy"" Scripps said. ""The likelihood across the whole region that we'd experience grid outages blackouts goes up. I don't want to overstate that risk but it's a higher risk than we've seen in the past and it just highlights the role of keeping these types of resources on.""

The high-end sale of the property in the Cliff neighborhood that overlooks Nantucket Sound along the north shore of the island was just the latest exclamation point in Nantucket's super-charged real estate market.

Here's what we know about the sale so far:

The seller was a blind trust that had purchased the property back in 2012 for just over $14 million.

The buyer was listed as Nantucket RE Investors LLC a company registered to a Texas-based corporation controlled by Jay Hebert and Bryan Barrett according to property and corporate records. Hebert and Barrett are both employed by the Keystone Group LP a Forth Worth-based private equity firm led by billionaire Robert Bass.

Great Point Properties co-founder Greg McKechnie was the selling agent but declined to comment on the sale. The buyer's agent was Lee Real Estate.

The $36 million sale was the highest in island history by a fairly wide margin eclipsing the $32.5 million sale of 42 Easton Street on Brant Point last October along with previous high-end sales of $27.5 million for 11 & 15 Cathcart Road in 2010 and the $27.1 million sale of 9 Kimball Avenue in 2014.

""Mega-high-end sales or sales above $20 million typically represent a tiny sliver of annual sales on the island"" said Fisher Real Estate Principal Broker Jen Shalley Allen. ""Over the last 20 years there have been just 17 residential transactions in this price point seven of which occurred in the last two years. It's rare to see these types of trophy properties change hands as they are often held for several generations but that mentality seems to be shifting with the rise in values and shift in motivation on the part of both buyers and sellers.""

The Nantucket Land Bank will receive a cool $720000 from this one sale alone thanks to the island's 2 percent transfer fee on real estate transactions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6Y2VudHJhbC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvb3Bpbmlvbi9vcC1lZC8yMDIyLzA0LzE3L2J1aWxkLXJlbnQtaG9tZXMtcG9wdWxhci1waG9lbml4LWJ1dC1nb29kLzcyOTc2MDgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Build-to-rent homes are all over metro Phoenix but is that really a good thing?,"No commitment required.

The new Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) grant scheme offers up to €25000 towards the cost of a retrofit.

According to a spokeswoman for the SEAI if you opt for a “one-stop shop” retrofit then the amount of the grant will be deducted from your total bill at the outset and you won’t have to find funds to cover this. Instead the one-stop-shop provider will claim the grant back from the SEAI on your behalf.

If however you are doing only one or two energy upgrades as part of your renovation then you will need to have the money to hand. According to the spokeswoman you will typically pay for the costs up front and then claim the grant back yourself from the SEAI on completion of the works.

Bank/credit union loan

It’s one of the quickest ways of sourcing money and typically you won’t need to be a customer of a bank to apply. It’s also popular.

A spokesman for Bank of Ireland says that demand for home-improvement loans jumped ""significantly"" in 2021 compared with 2020 while AIB says such loans account for a quarter of its personal lending in the year to date.

A key advantage is speed. Depending on your circumstances you may find that you can be approved for a loan quite quickly. With AIB for example the bank says it can get a decision within three hours on amounts of between €1000 and €30000 although amounts in excess of this will take longer.

While Bank of Ireland lends for up to seven years with AIB it may be possible to borrow over a term of 10 years – this of course reduces your monthly repayments but does increase your overall interest bill.

Both AIB and Bank of Ireland allow you to take a break from the loan repayments – with AIB you can take one month off a year.

Typically you’ll be able to repay your bank loan early at no extra cost.

The maximum you can borrow through a personal loan is typically between €65000-€75000.

It may not be one of the cheapest methods to raise finance however so it can be worthwhile to shop around.

Given the imminent departure of both KBC Bank and Ulster Bank from the Irish market you can expect less competition but there are still options including Permanent TSB An Post as well as Avant.

The loans tend to be more expensive when you borrow lower amounts; with Bank of Ireland you’ll pay a rate of 8.5 per cent APR on borrowings of up to €10000 dropping to 6.8 per cent on amounts in excess of €20000.

An Post is another option and it lends up to €75000 for such loans while Avant has one of the lowest rates on the market at 5.9 per cent on amounts of between €2000 and €75000 at terms of up to 10 years.

Green loan

You may be able to save money by opting for a green loan although you will have to show evidence that the money being borrowed is going towards retrofitting your home.

Bank of Ireland for example offers a Green Home improvement loan with an APR of 6.5 per cent which is a bit less than its headline rate while AIB’s green personal loan has an APR of 6.4 per cent.

An Post has one of the best green rates on the market at about 4.9 per cent APR on amounts of up to €75000. To qualify for this low rate you’ll have to show that more than 50 per cent of the loan is being used to complete works availing of the SEAI home energy grants.

Opting for a green loan could lead to substantial savings; for example €50000 borrowed over five years will cost €6339 with An Post’s green loan compared with €11677 with AIB based on its 8.95 personal loan rate so savings then of almost €5500.

Your local credit union is also an option. A number of credit unions including Mullingar offer the Greenify home-improvement loan an unsecured loan of up to €50000 at 6.75 per cent APR over up to seven years.

Another initiative is the CU Greener Homes which offers a rate of 4.9 per cent if you can bring your home up to a BER rating of A3 or higher or 7.98 per cent for a BER rating of lower than B2. It’s available across a large number of credit unions including Connect and Core in Dublin and First South in Cork.

Mortgage top-up

In addition to the cost of funds one of the biggest limitations of a personal loan is the amount you can borrow. As anyone who has gotten a quote for substantial work of late will know it’s expensive.

So if you’re looking for a greater amount – or you’d rather put in the effort for a cheaper lending rate – then releasing equity in your home is a popular way of financing a home refurb project.

Liam O’Connor sales director with Irish Mortgage Corporation is seeing an uptick in applicants looking to release equity.

“Predominantly the reason is that people want to add value to their home” he says.

In essence releasing equity means looking at the difference in what your home is worth and the mortgage outstanding. To qualify then you’ll need to have a certain amount of “equity” you can release as banks will typically only lend up to 90 per cent – at best – of the value of your home.

For O’Connor the “best rule of thumb” is 80 per cent LTV.

“You’d be doing well at 90 per cent” he says.

Given price increases of late however this does mean that many people who bought in recent years will qualify for equity release.

So for example let’s say you have a home with a mortgage of €350000 outstanding on it. However it’s now worth €700000 which means you have a loan to value of 50 per cent. This means you may be able to borrow up to €210000 which would bring your LTV back up to 80 per cent.

You will be able to borrow the “top-up” over terms of between five to 30 years (provided you don’t go past a certain age 70 with Bank of Ireland; 68 with AIB) and remember this doesn’t have to be the same term as your regular mortgage.

And you can apply for a top-up even if you’re on a fixed-rate mortgage as a new term/interest rate can apply to the fixed-rate element of the loan.

You may also be able to access a cashback – Bank of Ireland will give you 2 per cent of your new mortgage back (so €4200 in the above example).

The major downside of equity release is that the process is akin to taking out a mortgage; so you’ll have to get all those salary certificates bank statements etc in order to apply.

A spokesman for Bank of Ireland says the conveyancing element “may be more straightforward” if the customer already has their mortgage with the bank.

Moreover lower amounts tend to be more straight forward.

“With the majority of lenders once the equity release is below €75000 it’s a relatively simple process” says O’Connor. “Some lenders will look for specific documentation and confirmation that the work is being done; other lenders will be comfortable enough where the value of works is less than €75000”.

Indeed AIB says that for smaller top-ups where you are not reliant on the property increasing in value the loan can be drawn down in a lump sum.

“Otherwise it is by staged payments against proof of work complete” a spokesman says.

You will need to factor in the costs of a valuation – typically about €150 –as well as the cost of topping up your mortgage protection.

If doing so it may be worthwhile to shop around for a new mortgage-protection policy – remember the cheapest rates are often found with a provider other than your lender.

You’ll also be bound by the Central Bank’s mortgage rules when applying for equity release; this means that you can only bring your total borrowings up to 3.5 times income – although there are exemptions.

“It’s more likely that an exception will be made available to a non first-time buyer” says O’Connor noting that demand is typically less.

In terms of costs borrowing €100000 over 20 years will cost an extra €510.63 a month or €22551.90 over the life of the mortgage based on an interest rate of 2.1 per cent. If you can cut the term to 15 years your cost of funds will fall to €16662 but your monthly repayments will increase to €648.12.

Release equity – and switch

If you are considering releasing equity remember that it may make sense to switch your mortgage at the same time.

As O’Connor notes you can “kill two birds” by doing both at the same time as the conveyancing process will only have to be done once.

It can make good financial sense. On the one hand you might end up saving considerably on your existing mortgage which can neutralise the cost of your additional borrowings to refurb your home. And at the same time you’ll have enhanced the value of the property and may benefit from lower energy costs.

You may find that you’ll be precluded from the best rates however as these tend to be offered to those with loan-to-values of 60 per cent or less and by releasing equity your LTV may be some way north of this.

Even if you don’t want to switch provider it’s worth talking to your bank about a lower green rate if you have done a substantial retrofit to your home. Typically you’ll need an A/B BER rating to qualify.

AIB has a rate of 2.1 per cent for example on its “green mortgage” while Bank of Ireland offers a discount of 0.3 per cent on its fixed rates.

By switching you may also find that you get money towards the cost of legal fees etc from your new lender – and potentially a cashback. AIB offers a €2000 “switcher payment” while Bank of Ireland for example says it will give a cashback of up to 3 per cent of the mortgage value and PTSB offers 2 per cent back at drawdown and 2 per cent on monthly repayments until 2027.

Remember however that if you want to save money opting for the lowest rate – rather than the most generous cashback – might be a better option.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHliaXouY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8yNDc1MjgvaHRnLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1sYWZheWV0dGUtZ2FyZGVucy1uZXctYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1ob3VzaW5nLWNvbW11bml0eS1pbi10YWxsYWhhc3NlZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HTG Completes Lafayette Gardens New Affordable Housing Community in Tallahassee,"Lafayette Gardens delivers 96 new apartments for low-income residents in the state’s capital

Just two days ago the cosmetics firm told the BBC it would not close its stores and cease online sales in Russia because it could not “guarantee that our 700 employees in Russia will not face retaliation”.

But on Friday evening L’Occitane issued a statement confirming its decision to shut Russian operations following approval by its board of directors.

The statement said: “Given the enormous human suffering being caused by escalating military action in Ukraine and to protect our employees worldwide from potential public aggression we have decided to close our own stores and e-commerce websites in Russia.”

According to the company’s latest annual report there are 112 L’Occitane stores in Russia. Its sales in the country topped £42 million in the year to 31 March 2021.

The U-turn comes after customers vowed not to shop at L’Occitane when it initially refused to close its stores in Russia.

Hundreds of people took to Twitter to express their disappointment in the beauty firm.

“L’Occitane I’ve been using your lavender hand cream for YEARS. But I’ll happily switch if you’re really staying in Russia!” one person wrote.

Another said: “I love your products and buy them regularly but I won’t be purchasing anymore.”

I’ve been a loyal customer for 10-years to what I thought was a responsible ethical business. Your @UNICEF Solidarity hand cream is hardly compatible with your choice to be one of the last businesses to refuse to leave Russia. It goes against everything you said you stood for — Marc Hitchens. GrowingBrands.co.uk (@marchitchens) April 11 2022

A third added: “Your U-turn comes too late for me. You only did it because you were losing customers left right and centre – not because it was humane and right thing to do. I’ll never shop with you again.”

Previously French president Emmanuel Macron said it was up to companies to decide whether they wanted to stay in Russia but added that there was a “reputational risk” if they choose to continue trading there.

According to an analysis by Yale University more than 750 companies and brands have ceased operations in Russia since it invaded Ukraine on 24 February.

The firms that have pulled out of the country include fashion brands such as LVMH which owns Kenzo Givenchy and Christian Dior as well as Hermes Chanel and Gucci.

Beauty retailers that have closed Russian stores include the Estee Lauder Companies L’Oreal and Sephora.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy02MTEyNzg4N9IBLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy02MTEyNzg4Ny5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ukraine war: L'Occitane U-turn as it closes Russian shops,,,,,,,,,,

Alex Kittle

In late February Kristi Cassidy logged onto Reddit and made a call to action to people who sell their goods on Etsy . A day earlier Etsy had announced it was hiking fees by 30%. For Cassidy a seller of gothic wedding dresses on the e-commerce platform since 2006 the decision felt like an insult to small businesses who kept the site humming throughout the pandemic by selling their goods. ""I wonder what would happen if on April 11 so many sellers put their shops on vacation mode that Etsy starts [freaking out]"" Cassidy wrote. ""And then they have no choice but to negotiate with us."" Cassidy's Reddit post kicked off a weeklong Etsy seller strike that began on Monday. Thousands of Etsy sellers are putting their digital shops in ""vacation mode"" to protest the fee increase. An online petition outlining their demands had well over 77000 signatures as of Thursday evening. Etsy has 5.3 million active sellers on its platform according to the company's website. The fee increase comes on the heels of a tremendous growth period for Etsy. The company was a big winner during the Covid pandemic as consumers cut trips to the store and flocked to online retailers. Etsy sellers generated gross merchandise sales of $12.2 billion in 2021 compared with $5 billion in 2019. Etsy which is known for its handmade and personalized goods initially saw an influx of shoppers looking for face masks. Now Etsy is trying to keep them coming back to the site while competing with other e-commerce players like Amazon and eBay . Etsy told investors in February that additional revenue from the fee increase will be reinvested back into various initiatives at the company. Raina Moskowitz Etsy's chief operating officer said the company is ""committed"" to supporting sellers and helping them grow their businesses. ""We are always receptive to seller feedback and in fact the new fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in areas outlined in the petition including marketing customer support and removing listings that don't meet our policies"" Moskowitz said in a statement. Investors and analysts who track the company applauded the fee increase and other recent changes. Guggenheim analyst Seth Sigman acknowledged sellers are likely bearing the brunt of higher costs but that the changes should ultimately benefit ""everyone on the platform"" longterm. ""We appreciate the concerns of the sellers. This is their livelihood"" said Sigman who recommends buying Etsy shares. ""But the offset is the company is using this as a lever to reinvest back into the business. Our view is that it should ultimately lead to stronger market share gains.""

Rising fees and resellers

Cassidy and other Etsy sellers interviewed by CNBC said they remain skeptical of whether the fee increase will translate to improvements on the platform. The company last raised transaction fees in 2018 from 3.5% to 5% and the payoff has been minimal Cassidy said. On top of transaction fees Etsy sellers also have to pay listing fees payment processing fees and shipping fees. As part of the company's Offsite Ads program Etsy sellers are also charged an additional fee between 12% to 15% anytime shoppers make a purchase after clicking on an ad for their product. ""The recent transaction fee increase along with the [other fees] has made it harder for smaller creators to turn a profit and make their business sustainable"" said Marie Hart who sells pins charms and art on her Etsy shop. As part of the weeklong strike Etsy sellers are urging the company to cancel the fee increase allow them to opt out of the Offsite Ads and end a recently launched program called Star Seller which they say puts undue pressures sellers.

Soudabeh Rouhandeh an Etsy seller since Soudabeh Rouhandeh

""As a small indie creator who designs and handmakes my merchandise and apparel I'm losing hours of labor and money using Etsy"" said Soudabeh Rouhandeh who runs art and apparel shop Sudibear. Some veteran Etsy sellers are also calling on the company to crack down on resellers which they say have sullied the marketplace. Since Alex Kittle became an Etsy seller in 2010 she said she's noticed an influx of mass-market goods and dropshippers. The shift feels disconnected from Etsy's origins as a platform for showcasing handcrafted one-of-a-kind wares that are often made to order she said. ""For the most part I've found it a fun and eclectic community with both friendly sellers and buyers and a great place to reach my kind of customers (who are often a little nerdy or alternative in their tastes)"" Kittle said in an email. ""In the past few years it's expanded to include larger businesses dropshippers resellers and even scammy shops."" Etsy CEO Josh Silverman told sellers in February the company expects to dedicate more resources this year to removing listings that violate its policies. In 2021 Etsy spent $40 million on expanding the teams and technology focused on marketplace safety the company said. Nicole Lewis who has sold handmade crayons on Etsy for 15 years said she doesn't agree with the premise of the strike. Etsy connected CNBC with sellers who did not participate in the strike. Lewis said she doesn't blame Etsy for hiking transaction fees and that many of the recent changes are a necessary part of growing the marketplace. ""I think a lot of the OG sellers that are upset with Etsy still see it as the Etsy of 2004 2005 2006"" Lewis said. ""It's not that anymore and it can't be. Not in the world we're living in today when there's so many people out there looking to sell their work and we compete with Amazon.""

Kristi Cassidy of Westerly said she couldn't believe the news.

She took to reddit to make a change.



Within weeks the strike was organized and from April 11 through 19 thousands of Etsy sellers put their profiles on vacation mode so no one could buy their products.

""We don't want to do more work for less pay"" Cassidy said. ""We need to unite and fight back.""

Cassidy has been on the site since 2006.

Her online has garnered more than 80000 signatures and counting demanding Etsy do the following:

Cancel the fee increase

Crack down on resellers with a comprehensive plan that is transparent so sellers can hold Etsy accountable

Give ‘Golden’ support tickets to sellers affected by extreme AI actions (account termination 45/90 day holds etc.)

End the Star Seller Program

Give all sellers the ability to opt out of off site ads

""If you look at the details of every platform change that has made been made recently it incentivizes one of three things: either stuff that sells quickly stuff that sells cheaply or stuff that is not made to order"" Cassidy said. ""What it all boils down to is they're trying to turn into Amazon over the years and the business model of an artisan like me is so different from an Amazon seller that it's just incompatible.""



Around 30000 sellers around the world have joined the strike including Cranston's Jeff Palmer.



""A lot of people make a decent living on Etsy and these fee increases are really going to put a dent in their profit"" Palmer said. ""It's a lot of money going to executives and shareholders who are already making millions of dollars.""

Palmer designs and sells block prints and paintings.

He said he discovered the strike online and had no idea a fellow Rhode Islander started it all.



""I felt it was just important to kind of be part of that and let the executives and shareholders know like this is not cool"" he said. ""At the end of the day it's like wow that's a massive chunk to put in strangers' pockets that are not doing anything. They're not the ones making the art.""

Cassidy can't believe how many people have supported the cause.

""Absolutely overwhelming"" she said. ""This is what I hoped for but I'm still in shock.""



In a statement to CNBC Raina Moskowitz Etsy’s chief operating officer said their businesses.

“We are always receptive to seller feedback and in fact the new fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in areas outlined in the petition including marketing customer support and removing listings that don’t meet our policies” Moskowitz said.

Cassidy said they still want the platform to eliminate the new fee structure entirely.

After the strike ends she plans to continue selling on Etsy in addition to her  while working to form an Etsy seller's union.



""We are their brand we are their product they're really going to have to listen to us eventually"" she said.

Palmer on the other hand isn't sure if he'll go back to selling on Etsy.

Organizers say that by noon Saturday 1500 people had come to the city's Delta Hotel to check out the products with vendors selling everything from coffee mugs to homemade cookies.

For a lot of sellers this was the first time they had a chance to network with other Etsy users since the pandemic began.

""In the last two years a lot of people have taken up new hobbies learned how to do new things. So now this may be their first market"" said Kate Hunter team captain with Etsy New Brunswick and one of the people who organized the event.

""We've got seasoned sellers selling with [people] who's never done a market before and there's a little bit of mentorship going on there just within our community online. The promotion the networking has been really wonderful.""

""Just to see people who I messaged over the pandemic through Instagram or Facebook to get to see them in person is really uplifting"" said Tania Pendergast a calligrapher and illustrator who started making art as a form of self-therapy after leaving the army.

Pendergast who besides having an Etsy storefront also sells her artwork to small shops across P.E.I. said she hopes an expected surge of tourists coming to the Island as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted helps her business.

She said that for the last two years she's had to rely heavily on online sales to stay afloat.

""Those shops that have stayed open and moved a lot of their business online have displayed my work online as well"" she said. ""I was able to sell that way along with my Etsy shop. Locals will come and pick up from my house too. So there's been a lot of good local support.""

Artist Danielle White said a lot of businesses who purchase her goods wholesale have cut down on their orders or even closed down because of COVID-19.

White said she hopes events like this indicate things have somewhat returned to normal.

""It certainly feels good to see the community again. That part I've really missed.""

Higher fees

While a lot of sellers said they relied on the online sales Etsy brings the platform has recently been the subject of some controversy.

Earlier this year the company announced it was hiking transaction fees from five per cent to 6.5 per cent causing thousands of sellers to boycott the platform.

White said she understands the frustration adding that the issues go beyond just the fees.

""They've also changed a lot of their practices. So the way that things are searchable the algorithm and the way that they pop up results"" she said. ""We're getting to the point where in order to even be seen on Etsy you need to pay. So there's the fees on our sales but they're also charging for [ads].

""Then also they've introduced another thing where they're doing ads on the Internet. And if you get seen and you make a purchase they take an additional fee. So they're taking in some cases a considerable amount in fees.""

Pendergast said that business owners should compare different platforms but that she's sticking with Etsy because of the community.

Organizers said they did not charge vendors transaction fees to sell their goods in the market and opened up their participation to both Etsy and non-Etsy sellers.

They said they are using the Etsy name because that's where the community started and that's how they know each other.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vc2l0ZXMtY3VzdG9taXplLXBob25lLWNhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 7 Best Sites for Customizing Your New Phone Case,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vc2l0ZXMtY3VzdG9taXplLXBob25lLWNhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMTcvYXJ0cy90ZWxldmlzaW9uL3NubC1saXp6by1mbHV0ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'S.N.L.'

That’s right Expedition Everest has reopened at Disney’s Animal Kingdom but with that reopening comes a huge change! The ride’s Lightning Lane is no longer available as an Individual Attraction Selection (pay-per-ride) through Disney Genie. Instead you can now get Lightning Lane Access by purchasing Disney Genie+ for a limited time!

So how exactly does that work? Well we’ll explain it! You’ll first need to purchase Disney Genie+ on the My Disney Experience app for $15 per day per person. This will get you access to Lightning Lanes for every ride at Animal Kingdom except for Flight of Passage.

Note that Disney World guests can purchase Disney Genie+ on the day of their trip at midnight or can purchase it in advance if they want to use it for every day of their trip.

Once you have Genie+ you can book your Lightning Lane for Expedition Everest beginning at 7AM on the day of your visit to Animal Kingdom. Just look for Expedition Everest on Disney Genie in the app to see when the next available Lightning Lane pass and click on “Book Experience” to reserve your spot!

Once you have your spot saved be sure to arrive at Expedition Everest’s Lightning Lane within your 1-hour reservation window. You’ll scan your MagicBand phone or park ticket at the Lightning Lane line and then you’re all set to ride!

Note that Expedition Everest was actually closed when Animal Kingdom opened this morning but it later reopened with the attraction becoming available via Disney Genie+.

So if you’re headed to Disney World soon and you want to ride Expedition Everest without the long lines Genie+ is one way to do that! And we’ll keep you updated on ALL Disney news so stay tuned to AllEars for more!

Disney World rides close all the time in order to make sure that they’re in perfect condition for guests. This is why it’s super important to check the refurbishment calendar when you’re planning your trip so you know which rides will be open during your vacation. Expedition Everest closed for refurbishment back in January and we saw it being tested in February. Now it’s finally back!

After experiencing technical difficulties this morning resulting in the ride remaining closed Expedition Everest has officially reopened in Disney’s Animal Kingdom! We (safely) speed-walked over when we saw the line was only 10 minutes long!

We weren’t the only ones headed over to the reopened ride though! A crowd quickly started to form as we walked up to the ride.

Even the single rider line was back up and running with a wait of about 15 minutes or less according to a Cast Member (even though it looked a little long to us). This can be a great way to hop on the ride with a shorter wait time as the line had grown to a whopping 70 minutes by noon!

Keep in mind that Expedition Everest is now included in Genie+ for a limited time so you won’t have to pay extra for an Individual Attraction Selection if you’re purchasing the service during your day in the park.

We’re so excited that Everest is back and we’ll keep you updated on everything else happening in Disney World so stay tuned to AllEars for more!

However the game's massive size has become a glaring issue for many players.

With each update new content is added to Genshin Impact which takes up more space on players' devices. Here's how much storage is required to effectively run the game on Android and PC devices in the latest version. Downloading the game is a relatively easier task on all platforms as it's free to download.

Genshin Impact storage requirements on PC

The minimum system requirements for Genshin Impact on PC (Windows) are as follows:

Operating system: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit

Windows 7 SP1 64-bit Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent

Intel Core i5 or equivalent Memory: 8 GB RAM

8 GB RAM Graphics card: NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 1030 and higher

NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 1030 and higher DirectX version: 11

11 Storage: 30 GB of space

Players need to reserve at least 30 GB of space to download Genshin Impact on their PC.

However the game's size increases significantly after downloading and installing it. Hence players are recommended to have 35 GB of reserved storage space as per official instructions.

The extra space is most likely used to install updates and other files that are downloaded after launching the game.

Genshin Impact storage requirements on Mobile (Android)

Running Genshin Impact on mobile devices is a huge crisis for many players owing to its size.

The minimum requirements to run the game on Android are:

Compatibility requirements: Arm v8a 64-bit device

Arm v8a 64-bit device Memory (RAM): 3 GB and above

3 GB and above Supported system: Android 7.0 or above

At the moment Genshin Impact takes over 14.7 GB of data on Android devices. The official website still recommends players to have 8 GB of reserve data but it is because the website hasn't been updated for a long time.

Players must have iOS 9.0 or later to run Genshin Impact. The storage requirements for iOS devices are similar to Android and it is recommended to have at least 15 GB of reserved space.

It is worth noting that the size of Genshin Impact can be reduced on PC and mobile platforms by deleting the voice-over packs in unrequired languages.

Genshin Impact's latest version the 2.6 update will release Ayaka's banner in the second half. The hype surrounding this five-star Cryo Sword character in the game is sky-scraping owing to her explosive damage unique playstyle and interesting lore that players are ready to witness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZGl5L2FkZC1zZWNvbmQtc2NyZWVuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to add a second screen to your computer,"This story has been updated. It was originally published on November 22 2019.

In terms of boosting productivity one of the best upgrades you can give your laptop or desktop computer is not a faster processor more RAM or extra storage space—it’s adding a second screen to your setup. Having double the screen space might not immediately seem like it could revolutionize how quickly you get stuff done but consider how often you have two or more programs open and how long it takes you to jump from one to the other.

Comparing websites spreadsheets documents hard drive folders emails or photos side-by-side is way more comfortable and can save you a ton of time as you replace all those seconds spent clicking dragging and moving the mouse with a near-instant flick of your eyes.

Even better this is an upgrade that’s relatively easy to do once you’ve swallowed the cost of the extra hardware. Both Windows and macOS are set up to immediately recognize and make use of an additional monitor so you won’t have to spend long configuring your second screen.

Buying and using a second screen

Look at these guys—they’re not losing any time switching between programs. One of them even had time to put his hair up. Puhhha / Depositphotos

Monitor prices range from budget to very very expensive so take some time to shop around for the best deal when you’re deciding where to spend your money. Unless you’re working in graphic design or video editing a mid-range budget monitor will do just fine.

The two key specifications to watch out for are the monitor size in inches (how big the screen is) and the resolution in pixels (how sharp the screen is). As with most things the bigger and sharper the better so a good way to choose is to go as high as possible on those two metrics while staying within your budget.

Brightness levels and contrast ratios are important too (again the higher the better) as is the underlying tech that the screen is made from. For general use look for a vertical alignment (VA) LCD monitor though professionals might want to upgrade to an in-plane switching (IPS) LCD display instead. Picture quality varies from display to display but IPS typically offers better-quality blacks at the expense of a wider viewing angle.

[Related: Best monitors for home offices in 2022]

We don’t want to dazzle you with too many tech terms and specifications though because besides the size and resolution this is one of those hardware purchases where you don’t really need to agonize too much over your choices. Checking online reviews or—even better—going out to physically look at computer displays in a store will usually be more informative than a specs sheet.

What is crucial though is that you get a second screen that can connect to your desktop or laptop. HDMI DisplayPort Thunderbolt and USB-C are the key connection standards to look out for so make sure the outputs on your computer match at least one of the inputs on your monitor.

If you’ve set your heart on a monitor that doesn’t match your computer’s video outputs you can often get a dongle or an adapter to get everything working—like this $70 Apple adapter that’ll take the USB-C output from a MacBook and turn it into an HDMI feed compatible with most monitors. You can also get a hub adapter like this one from Anker that for $50 will give you three standard USB ports an HDMI port and an ethernet port.

If you’re adding a second screen to your desktop try to get something that matches the size of your original display—it’s easier on your eyes to keep flicking between two displays with identical dimensions. If you’re using a laptop more screen space on your second screen is usually better within reason.

How to add a second screen on Windows

You can move the displays around and even use your monitor in a vertical orientation. David Nield All you really need to do to add a second display to Windows is to power up the monitor and connect it to your laptop or desktop. Windows will instantly recognize that you’ve added a second screen and extend your desktop wallpaper across the new display accordingly.

If this auto-configuration hasn’t quite worked properly or you just want to fiddle around with your options go to Settings (click the cog icon on the left-hand side of the start menu) then choose System and Display. You should see your two screens represented in the next dialog box labeled 1 and 2 (click Identify to work out which is which). If you don’t you can click Detect to ask your computer to look for the connection.

If you need to click and drag the display icons around and make sure they match your physical setup—so you’ve got the left and the right monitor identified correctly for example. Further down you can set the resolution and orientation of each display (most of the time it’s best to simply leave the recommended settings in place here).

Use the Make this my main display checkbox to set which of your displays counts as the primary one—that is the one that shows the Start menu and the taskbar and where most of the pop-up dialog boxes are going to appear.

With the displays correctly configured you can simply drag open app windows from one display to another to get them correctly positioned. Have one screen for your social media feeds and one for your emails for example; or one screen for watching videos and another for browsing the web. If you maximize any of the windows on screen they’ll take up the entirety of the display they’re currently on.

As an added bonus we’d like to mention DisplayFusion ($30 with free trial). It adds on a host of extra features for multi-monitor setups on Windows including options to duplicate the taskbar on both screens save your open window configurations dim the display that’s not currently in use and more.

Adding a second screen on macOS

Arranging the displays will allow you tp set up how the two displays relate to each other. David Nield

Setting up a second screen on macOS is just as simple as on Windows—power up the second display plug it into your Mac and your computer should detect it. To change the position of the monitors (which is left and which is right) open the Apple menu then choose System Preferences Displays and Arrangement then drag the windows into place.

To see which display is which click and hold on one of the windows and a red border will appear around it (in the dialog box and on the monitor). You can set the resolution and scale of your screens by switching to the Display tab in the same dialog box (actually two dialog boxes will open up one for each screen).

[Related: 23 useful Mac settings hiding in plain sight]

As with Windows just drag your open windows and browser tabs between the displays to move them from one screen to another. Again maximizing any of the open app windows will fill the display it’s currently on.

We’d like to plug another utility here: Magnet for macOS which will set you back $8. It makes arranging open windows much easier whether you’re using them on one display or two. You can swap windows to the sides and corners of the screen for example as on Windows by dragging them to the edges of one of your displays.

Since macOS Catalina Apple has also offered the ability to use an iPad as a secondary display a feature known as Sidecar. You can use the feature wirelessly if your Mac and iPad are on the same WiFi network or you can plug your tablet into your computer with a charging cable. You do need a fairly recent iPad and Mac for this to work—check here for a full list of supported devices.

To enable the second display click the AirPlay button (an arrow and a rectangle) in the menu bar on macOS then choose your iPad from the list. If you don’t see it you might have to go to System Preferences and Displays to turn on the AirPlay Display option. The iPad works just like a second monitor so you can drag windows to and from it and use the Displays option in System Preferences to configure its position.",,,,,,,,,
XOM,ExxonMobil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFicm9la25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMTcvc3VuZGF5L2d1eWFuYS1hbmQtdGhlLXdpZGVyLXdvcmxkL2NyaXRpcXVlcy0yLTMtZXh4b25tb2JpbC1pbi10aGUtY291cnRzLW9mLWxhdy1hbmQtcHVibGljLW9waW5pb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Critiques 2 & 3 - ExxonMobil in the Courts of Law and Public Opinion,"Introduction

Today’s column addresses the second and third focus areas of my present critique of ExxonMobil. These are: 1) its deceitful actions [being adjudicated in the Courts of Law]; and 2) disinformation and framed narratives on global warming climate change and denial of energy transition [before the Court of Public Opinion].

But as indicated last week I start today’s column with two wrap up comments; one briefly illustrating ExxonMobil’s recent significant oil spills and the other expanding also briefly on my reference to moral hazard and insurance in the concluding paragraph of last week’s column. The latter is a topic of intense current public discourse.

Wikipedia’s presentation on ExxonMobil offers a concise brief on the company’s oil spills. This brief is summarized below:

Recent ExxonMobil Oil Spills

1. The Exxon Valdez oil spill is ranked number 1 in terms of environmental damage; which it is estimated will take decades if not centuries to rectify. Eleven plus million US gallons were spilled onto 1300 miles of Alaska coastline

2. Brooklyn oil spills over the period mid-19th century to mid-20th century totaling 12 to 30 million US gallons

3. Baton Rouge refinery pipeline spill 2012; 80000 US gallons

4. Baton Rouge Benzene spill 2012; multiple chemicals including benzene

5. Yellowstone River oil spill 2011; 1500 barrels

6. Mayflower River oil spill 2013; 3190 barrels

7. Sakhalin 1 oil spill Russia Far East

8. New Jersey oil spill

Source: Wikipedia

By moral hazard I refer to the well-known insurance risk management principle which states that economic agents who seek protection from risk by way of insurance coverage may well choose to pursue a riskier pattern of behavior after they are insured! As Investopedia states the paradox is “when a party to a contract does not have to suffer the potential consequences of a risk the likelihood of a moral hazard increases” Let’s hope the noise and nonsense brigade brings no harm to Guyana by their ill thought out pleadings/pressure for insurance as ExxonMobil’s behaviour in cutting corners is certainly not comforting.

Deceiving Investors

In the Court of Public Opinion ExxonMobil has been faring quite poorly in regard to allegations that it has acted with calculation designed to deceive the general public on its stance as well as company practice in promoting environment friendly actions to prevent global warming and climate change as well as promote global energy transition.

In the Courts of Law the corporation has fared better. Lawsuits against the corporation have been going slowly and in one high profile case [New York Attorney General vs ExxonMobil] in its favour. Personally I believe this difference reflects the conceptual and analytical gap between information and analysis as used in politics and social analysis and legal proof based on the principles of the balance of probabilities and/or beyond a reasonable doubt.

Alleged deceit has so far taken several forms including the following: 1) The practice of using different data calculations for internal company use and those given to investors shareholders regulators and the general public; 2) public denial but internal acknowledgement of knowledge of particular types of harm to the environment; 3) organizing disinformation in order to advance and manage rebuttals of activists and academics.

A concrete example might help. It has been alleged that a decade before ExxonMobil admitted publicly to the harmful CO2 emissions from fossil fuels it had already become fully aware of this as a fact. However by feigning ignorance it is argued that surveys reveal this stance has encouraged roughly a half of surveyed Americans to deny climate change and global warming.

Exxon Mobil has provided a spirited response to what I have advanced here. The following statement on its Website in regard to the activist group ExxonKnew speaks for itself.

Exxon Mobil Statement

“ExxonKnew is an orchestrated campaign that seeks to delegitimize ExxonMobil by misrepresenting our position on climate change and related research to the public. For the past several years activist organizations have sought to bring investigations shareholder action legal action and protests against ExxonMobil despite the fact that ExxonMobil is committed and actively working to reduce the risks posed by climate change.”

Framing the Climate Change narrative

The focus of my critique on this topic is a representation of a science and society research article published in One Earth. It is entitled Rhetoric and Frame Analysis of ExxonMobil Climate Change Communications. It was written by G. Supran and N. Orespes and published in Vol 4 Issue 5 May 2021

The research investigates ExxonMobil use of “rhetoric and framing” to steer public climate change and global warming debates. They offer what they claim is ‘an algorithmic corpus comparison and machine-learning topic model of 180 ExxonMobil climate change communications [including research/academic- publications internal documents and advertorials in The New York Times’ The advertorials are investigated using inductive frame analysis.

For our purpose the main finding is that the company has selectively overstated terms and topics while avoiding others. Notably they have used the rhetoric of climate “risk” and consumer energy “demand” to construct a “Fossil Fuel Savior” frame which 1) downplays the gravity of climate change; 2) normalizes fossil fuel lock-in; and 3) individualizes responsibility. This framing mimics the tobacco industry experience of shifting responsibility away from corporations—knowingly selling a deadly product while denying its harms—to consumers. This historical parallel foreshadows the fossil fuel industry’s use of demand-as-blame arguments to oppose litigation regulation and activism.

Conclusion

Next week’s column addresses the fourth and final area of focus for my critique of ExxonMobil. That is “walking the talk”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9jb3Jwb3JhdGUvZXh4b25tb2JpbC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbW9iaWxnYXJkLTU0MC1hY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ExxonMobil Announces Mobilgard™ 540 AC,"[By: ExxonMobil]

ExxonMobil has developed Mobilgard™ 540 AC a premium 40BN marine cylinder oil granted Category II status by MAN ES for use in their Mark 9 and higher 2-stroke marine engine designs. The premium lubricant which has been formulated to deliver advanced cleanliness to meet the needs of these newer engines has received a No Objection Letter from the engine builder following extensive field demonstrations.

“Mobilgard™ 540 AC is one of the first 40BN lubricants to be granted Category II status” said Yannis Chatzakis Global Marine Technology Program Manager at ExxonMobil. “As the latest addition to the MobilGard family of cylinder oils it builds on the brand’s extensive heritage of innovation performance and reliability helping provide peace of mind to vessel operators in a wide variety of operating conditions.”

ExxonMobil’s balanced formulation methodology ensures that Mobilgard™ 540 AC helps vessel operators wishing to simplify lubricant management through use of a single low BN Category II cylinder oil. Operators can gain further confidence in the level of their engine’s reliability through implementation of an onboard scrape down oil analysis programme such as Mobil ServSM Cylinder Condition Monitoring.

The high-performance cylinder oil will be available to order from the third quarter of 2022 in key locations from ExxonMobil’s extensive network of more than 650 ports throughout the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtZGlzaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tc3VpbmctZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWwtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWRpc2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLXN1aW5nLWZvc3NpbC1mdWVsLWNvbXBhbmllcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Suing over climate change: Taking fossil fuel companies to court,"If climate change were a disaster film it would likely be accused of being too over-the-top: wildfires reducing entire towns to ashes hurricanes swamping cities droughts draining lakes and withering fields and raging oceans redrawing the very maps of our coasts. And now many cities and states are asking who's going to pay for all of this?

""This is real; we're on the front line of climate change right here in Charleston"" said John Tecklenburg the mayor of Charleston South Carolina. The city's been battered by an endless parade of floods due to sea level rise. Some desperate homeowners have resorted to raising their homes by several feet.

""In the next 50 years we'll see another two to three feet of sea level rise"" Tecklenburg said. ""The water is our greatest asset; it has also become our biggest challenge.""

So the city is raising large parts of its existing sea wall and the Army Corps of Engineers says Charleston should build another eight miles of wall. The city expects an estimated $3 billion in climate change-related costs.

Charleston S.C. expects to spend an estimated $3 billion to bolster the city's defense against rising sea levels. CBS News

Correspondent Ben Tracy asked ""Can you raise taxes high enough to cover these costs?""

""It's like any big project; you gotta look under every rock"" Tecklenburg replied.

Underneath one of those rocks are the fossil fuel companies. Study after study has shown the companies' carbon emissions from oil coal and gas are major contributors to climate change.

Charleston is one of more than two dozen cities counties and states that are suing these companies (including ExxonMobil Shell Chevron BP and ConocoPhillips).

More than two dozen U.S. cities counties and states are suing fossil fuel companies over their role in the increasing hazards of climate change. CBS News

Tecklenburg said ""I feel if you've contributed to the problem that you should contribute to the solution.""

""So in some ways it is a bit of a money grab?"" asked Tracy.

""Well to the extent that they participated in what created this need; it's a money grab because there's some responsibility for what happened.""

The suits are modeled after the ""Big Tobacco"" cases of the 1990s and accuse the companies and industry groups of making false and misleading claims about climate change.

One of a series of 1991 newspaper ads from the Information Council for the Environment an energy industry group. Internal documents said the goal of their advertising campaign was to ""Reposition global warming as theory (not fact)."" Information Council for the Environment

William Tong attorney general of Connecticut said ""I'm suing ExxonMobil because they lied to us.""

Tong is suing ExxonMobil under the state's consumer protection laws. He said internal company research done by Exxon and Mobil (which used to be separate companies) shows they were aware of the dangers of climate change since at least the 1980s.

""There's a study from I think 1982 in which they produce a chart that shows as the levels of carbon dioxide rise the temperature of our atmosphere will rise"" said Tong. ""And that chart is almost exactly right.""

And the suit also cites a 1988 internal draft memo from an Exxon spokesperson advising the company ""emphasize the uncertainty"" of climate science.

""This is a strategy document from ExxonMobil that basically says 'Let's lie. Let's say the science is not clear. Let's downplay the fact of climate change'"" Tong said.

He points to ads that look like editorials from ExxonMobil as well as their executives' own words including the 1996 statement by Lee Raymond (then the CEO of Exxon) that ""the scientific evidence remains inconclusive as to whether human activities affect the global climate.""

Tracy asked ""Some of these internal memos from the company acknowledge uncertainty about this. Does that strengthen the company's argument that this was not settled science?""

""No it doesn't"" Tong replied. ""Because the fact is that they knew with a fair degree of certainty that there could be serious catastrophic effects from the continued use of fossil fuels. The fact that scientists have questions about their data is unremarkable; that's what scientists do.""

""So your argument is even if they didn't know everything they knew enough?""

""That's right.""

ExxonMobil which is named in all 24 of these lawsuits says ""The claims are baseless and without merit.""

In total the cases accuse more than 40 fossil fuel companies of a disinformation campaign.

Some point to a 1992 video backed primarily by the coal industry promoting the benefits of pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In it Dr. Sherwood Idso states ""A doubling of the CO2 content of the atmosphere will produce a tremendous greening of Planet Earth.""

And an on-camera host declares ""As more and more scientists are confirming our world is deficient in carbon dioxide.""

To watch ""The Greening of Planet Earth"" a 1992 video produced by the Western Fuels Association click on the player below:

""CBS Sunday Morning"" reached out to several of the companies. Some responded writing they are working to combat climate change. In addition ExxonMobil and Shell said these lawsuits do nothing to advance that goal.

Phil Goldberg an attorney with the Manufacturers' Accountability Project (a group helping the fossil fuel industry push back against these lawsuits) told Tracy ""Fighting climate change requires policymaking not lawsuits.""

Tracy asked ""The attorneys in some of these cases though would say that what they're doing is trying to hold these companies liable for deception. Is that fair?""

""This is not an issue of who knew what or when or who said what and when"" Goldberg replied. ""The federal government has had the very same information that they're saying that the energy companies had going back to the 1960s and '70s and '80s. The question is what we're gonna do about it today?""

Richard Lazarus who teaches environmental law at Harvard said ""The scope of the problem is one that requires really a national approach. Cities and counties and states are being the ones left with the problem when the federal government doesn't step up to the plate.""

Lazarus said even if the cities and states prove the fossil fuel companies deceived the public about climate change it doesn't necessarily mean they will win: ""They've done a really good job of showing that the oil and gas industry I think engaged in fraudulent activity. The challenge will be causation to prove that their fraudulent behavior is what prevented the United States from passing the laws we needed to reduce those greenhouse gas emissions.""

So far the industry has filed a series of motions slowing down the cases.

Charleston South Carolina is bracing for a long and uncertain legal battle. Tracy asked Mayor John Tecklenburg ""If you're not successful with this lawsuit what does that mean for what you're trying to do here?""

""We're gonna find a way to fund the improvements that we need"" he replied.

""But I bet you've heard the phrase 'Hope is not a strategy'?""

Tecklenburg laughed: ""Hope springs eternal right?""

But in the meantime the water keeps rising.

To achieve this target carbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a vital role with the help of petroleum engineering and geoscience skills. Companies need to leverage existing assets and technology to establish a successful low-carbon venture technology. Strategic areas that companies could potentially invest to succeed in a low-carbon venture technology are

Direct air capture

CO 2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in conventional and unconventional reservoirs

enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in conventional and unconventional reservoirs CO 2 EOR in residual oil zones (ROZ)

EOR in residual oil zones (ROZ) CO 2 storage

storage Use of CO 2 in plastics biological conversion etc.

Table 1 shows the sources of CO 2 emissions during energy production transportation and consumption. The captured carbon can be disposed of in different ways:

Direct Geological Storage

Injection into deep saline aquifers

Injection into depleted oil and gas reservoirs

CO 2 Utilization

Utilization EOR

EOR in tight oil reservoirs ROZ and transition oil zone (TOZ)

Other possible industrial uses

CO 2 Emission Sources Sources Emissions Oil and gas production Combustion and rotating equipment flaring venting CO 2 and methane Transportation Pipelines vessels vehicles CO 2 and methane Refining and petrochemical production Heaters boilers Primarily CO 2 End use Use of gasoline diesel and coal CO 2

Table1—CO 2 emission sources.

Anthropogenic CO 2 (CO 2 associated with human activities) projects were successful in the past and a few are listed in Table 2.

Table 2—Some of the successful anthropogenic CO 2 projects (Global CCS Institute 2018).

Successful Field Projects

Gorgon CO 2 Injection Project. Chevron’s Gorgon CO 2 injection project in Northwest Australia is one of the largest CO 2 injection projects in the world. Gas that is being produced from the formation contains CO 2  which is separated compressed and geologically stored in the Dupuy formation. The integrated facility of the Gorgon project can be seen in Fig. 1. Dupuy formation is a Jurassic saline reservoir deep beneath Barrow Island (Flett et al. 2008). There are nine CO 2 injection wells and 4 water production wells to manage the reservoir pressure (pressure management wells).

When CO 2 gets injected and the pressure builds up water production wells are evacuating water so that the accumulation of high pressure gets released. The produced water is being injected into a different formation as shown in Fig 2. A 3D-seismic analysis was conducted as a function of time to observe how plumes are forming and growing. There are few observation wells equipped with downhole pressure gauges to monitor pressure readings continuously. As a result of this effort 3.4–4.0 million tons/year of CO 2 is being injected into the Dupuy formation and a significant cut in the overall CO 2 emissions was observed. Also an integrated reservoir surveillance plan was adopted to monitor the injected CO 2 and study the subsurface uncertainties (Denney 2013).

Agbami Oilfield Miscible Natural Gas Injection Project. Agbami field is a $5 billion deepwater natural gas injection project in Nigeria which holds about 1 billion bbl of recoverable oil. The field was discovered in 1998 and has been producing for the past 12 years. All the produced gas from the field is being injected back into the formation and no gas is being flared. The FPSO vessel in the Agbami field layout (Fig. 3) was built by South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering. The field (Fig. 4) is producing around 220000–240000 bbl/day of light sweet crude with an average value of 47 °API.

The bottom of the reservoir consists of water injection wells and the top of the reservoir consists of natural gas injection wells. The gas is being injected at the top pushing the oil down and water is being injected at the bottom and pushing the oil up. This process is known as the “Double Displacement Process” and the oil gets squeezed out of the reservoir by the creation of an effective drive mechanism. Oil and the injected gas are miscible in first contact and thus miscible gas displacement process is taking place effectively in the field.

CO2 Injection Projects

CO 2 EOR is a proven process and more than 166 CO 2 EOR projects are currently active around the world producing more than 450000 bbl of oil per day (McGlade 2018). These numbers are expected to increase to more than 1.2 million bbl and 1.64 million bbl of oil per day in 2030 and 2040 respectively (IEA 2019). During the tertiary recovery phase i.e. CO 2 EOR (Fig. 5) CO 2 injection helps in repressurizing the reservoir and with miscible displacement generates significant incremental oil production.

Fig. 5—Different phases in the oil and gas production.

The first notable CO 2 EOR project is the SACROC project in the Permian Basin (Crameik and Plasssey 1972) and the first commercial-scale anthropogenic CO 2 EOR project is Petra Nova in Texas (2017). Technically SACROC was the first anthropogenic project started by Chevron in 1972 in the US as CO 2 from the neighboring gas plants was collected and transported to the field for CO 2 EOR. Chevron Denbury Resources Devon Energy ExxonMobil Kinder Morgan and Occidental Petroleum are some of the major companies performing CO 2 floods.

CO2 EOR/Storage Challenges

Technical:



Sweep efficiency improvements

Well injectivity improvements

Leakage and concerns along the faults

Fractures in the wells

Retention and recycling of CO 2

Operational:



Corrosion

H 2 S handling

S handling Surveillance and monitoring

Water alternating gas (WAG) optimization

Storage development plan

Commercial/Social:



Oil price

CO 2 price

price Tax incentives in different countries (45Q in the United States)



Currently the industry is injecting more pore volumes of CO 2 than earlier. There is more emphasis on maintaining wellbore conditions and improving sweep efficiency. Companies are targeting ROZ located below oil/water contact and far from the main pay zone (Harouaka et al. 2013). Chevron Hess Oxy and ExxonMobil have their ongoing CO 2 EOR ROZ projects in the Permian Basin in San Andres pay zone (Melzer et al. 2006). Various EOR field trials are being performed in the unconventional reservoirs particularly in Bakken and Eagle Ford formations (Thakur 2019).

Conclusion

CO 2 EOR is a proven technology and it has demonstrated success over the past 50 years in conventional reservoirs. Anthropogenic CO 2 capture and storage projects for EOR are growing and being implemented all over the world. CO 2 and natural gas EOR for unconventional reservoirs has the potential to double the recovery factor. There is additional potential for deep saline aquifers and ROZ/TOZ in Permian Basin. Retention of CO 2 is a concern that most companies have and we must work as a multidisciplinary team including geoscientists field operations personnel environmental scientists and others to address them. By running injection profiles and pressure tests and having a rigorous injection well management and surveillance approach companies can eliminate this concern. CCUS and CO 2 EOR can help to meet the demand for oil and gas in the future. According to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute there are currently 23 large-scale CCS facilities in operation or under construction around the world to capture around 40 million tons of CO 2 per year.

Ties between China and the West have long been strained over trade and human rights issues and the tension has grown following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine according to a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) report last week.

CNOOC International holds a 25% working interest in the lucrative Stabroek Block in Guyana’s waters. ExxonMobil is the operator with 45% interest and Hess has a 30% working interest.

CBC said that companies periodically carry out reviews of their portfolios but the exit being prepared would take place less than a decade after state-owned CNOOC entered the three countries via a $15 billion US acquisition of Canada’s Nexen.

The assets which encompass stakes in major fields in the North Sea the Gulf of Mexico and large Canadian oil sand projects produce around 220000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) Reuters calculations found.

Last month Reuters reported CNOOC had hired Bank of America to prepare for the sale of its North Sea assets which include a stake in one of the basin’s largest fields.

CNOOC has launched a global portfolio review ahead of its planned public listing in the Shanghai stock exchange later this month that is aimed primarily at tapping alternative funding following the delisting of its U.S. shares last October CBC said.

As it seeks to leave the West CBC said that CNOOC is looking to acquire new assets in Latin America and Africa and also wants to prioritize the development of large new prospects in Brazil Guyana and Uganda.

CNOOC is seeking to sell “marginal and hard to manage” assets in Britain Canada and the United States a senior industry source told Reuters."

(WTVF) — In Middle Tennessee on April 16 1998 a tornado outbreak consisting of more than 20 supercells and 10 confirmed tornadoes struck the area. Nashville was hit with three tornadoes — one rated F3 and two rated F2. It was the first time in 65 years that a twister struck downtown.

In the intensive coverage of the city's onslaught a much larger more dangerous F5 tornado in Lawrence County was nearly overshadowed.

In the world of weather reporting tornadoes are rated on a scale — the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale) — from F0 to F5.

When tornadoes reach the level of F5 on the EF Scale it means its winds have reached speeds of 260-318 mph. F5s are incredibly violent.

In the history of Tennessee only four times has any tornado ever been rated F5. Once in 1952 twice in 1974 and finally in 1998. But some meteorologists have successfully argued that only the 1998 F5 has legitimately earned such a ranking.

This makes April 16 the anniversary of Tennessee's only officially documented F5 tornado in the history of the state. Fortunately no one was killed.

The 1998 F5 tornado grew to be one mile wide and touched down in largely rural areas of Lawrence County for 23 miles.

Well-constructed homes in the area were completely leveled with foundations wiped clean. Several trees were debarked and a one-ton pickup truck was hurled more than 109 yards approximately the length of a football field.

The tornado weakened to an F4 once it reached Giles and Maury Counties but it continued to produce damage for 17 more miles.

As we remember the powerful force that hit in 1998 it is important to pay attention to updates when threats arise in Tennessee's peak tornado season.

According to the National Weather Service Tennessee's tornado season peaks in February March and April but the state is more or less accustomed to tornado threats year round. A second fall tornado season is also typical around November.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mass shooting at the FedEx facility on April 15 2021 has led to changes in how the Red Flag law is processed in Marion County. Metro Police officers now directly file every case with the court which usually sets a hearing within two weeks.

The Marion County Prosecutor's office has assigned Rob Beatson to handle every one of those cases.

""Allowing police to take guns from people undergoing mental health crisis has saved lives"" said Beatson.

Beatson is the supervisor of the Strategic Prosecution Unit.

The Red Flag allows law enforcement to seize firearms from people who come to their attention during a mental health crisis.

As of January 1 2022 Indianapolis had 34 active red flag cases involving about 52 weapons.

""They show up in court and they say 'I'm seeing a doctor I'm on medication I'm getting help' that's what we want. But nothing in the law requires respondents to do it. Nothing in the law that provides access to healthcare"" said Beatson.

We spoke with one lady while at the court who asked not to be identified. On March 25 she reached out to a stress center which couldn't help. Police got involved after someone called 911 to report she was experiencing mental health issues. She was found in her vehicle with a gun and police seized her weapon that day.

""I'm not angry. I'm not upset. If you watch the news and you find yourself in this position you have the rationale enough to say 'you know what? He's trying to keep the public safe.' This is not another incident where the judge releases the gun and then the party uses it on themselves or family members neighbors or somebody else"" the woman told WRTV Investigates' Rafael Sanchez.

During her gun retention hearing that day the judge ruled the woman was ""dangerous"".

That ""dangerous"" ruling does two things: It allows police to keep the weapon and places the person's name on a list that bans a federally-licensed gun shop from selling the individual a gun.

""It was a difficult conversation to have"" she told Rafael. ""Just having he word dangerous mentioned to me was very difficult.""

Court 34 is where judgment is passed as people defend their right to bear arms.

In the case of the FedEx shooting the gunman Brandon Hole was no stranger to police or the Red Flag Law.

March 3 2020 Hole’s mother called police saying her son wanted to die by suicide by cop. Officers seized a shotgun and took Hole to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.

Under the Red Flag Law his shotgun was seized.

On March 10 Brandon voluntarily gave up his rights to his weapon.

That's one of the many reasons the Marion County Prosecutor’s office said they did not file a gun detention hearing and that Brandon at the time did not have a history of violence.

With no hearing there was no way for a judge to decide if Hole remained a danger and no opportunity to stop Hole from legally buying the assault-style rifles he used in the FedEx attack.

According to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Hole went on to purchase an assault rifle in July 2020 and another in September 2020. He would later use those weapons to kill eight people and injure five others at an Indianapolis FedEx facility.

This week: FedEx supports STEM exhibits at the new Amelia Earhart museum; Love’s donates to St. Christopher Truckers Relief; and One Tree Planted helps celebrate Earth Day.

Global shipping company FedEx joined by Garmin and Lockheed Martin announced Friday that the three companies have helped the Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum in Atchison Kansas get closer to its fundraising goal to complete construction of the new center that will focus on science technology engineering and mathematics education (STEM) programs as well as Earhart’s legacy.

With FedEx Garmin and Lockheed Martin’s help the museum has raised over $10 million of its $15 million goal.

In partnership with Kansas-based Dimensional Innovation an experience design firm the museum will install STEM-related exhibits with storytelling inspired by the National Curriculum Standards Kansas Curriculum Content Standards and Missouri Standards of Learning.

“We’re thrilled to work alongside the Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum to help tell the incredible story of Amelia and her impact on aviation. Each experience will immerse museum-goers by exemplifying Amelia’s adventurous spirit and showcasing the many generations she positively influenced” said Tucker Trotter CEO of Dimensional Innovations.

The main piece of the museum is Muriel the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E named after Amelia’s youngest sister Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey. The Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart piloted on her final flight around the world.

The museum is slated to open in 2023.

“Our vision to celebrate Amelia Earhart’s world-renowned legacy to defy the odds and pursue her dreams is coming to life. We’re grateful for the generous support we continue to receive as we build this state-of-the-art museum in Amelia’s hometown in Atchison Kansas — where her dreams began and will continue to encourage future generations to imagine their own possibilities” said Karen Seaberg founder and president of the Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum.





Love’s donates $100000 to St. Christopher Truckers Fund

Love’s Travel Stops announced it recently donated $100000 to St. Christopher Truckers Development and Relief Fund as the nonprofit organization continues to support driver wellness programs and provide injured or sick drivers with financial support while out of work.

“We cannot thank Love’s Travel Stops enough for this generous donation. Professional drivers are vital to our everyday lives and it is humbling to see their commitment. Even during this national pandemic they are continuing to deliver the essential supplies we all need. These men and women are the heroes of the highway during this crucial time and we are honored to be here to support them when they need us most” said Shannon Currier director of philanthropy and development for the St. Christopher Relief Fund.

Much like St. Christopher Relief Fund Love’s has been focused on the overall health and wellness of its driver customers.

In an interview with FreightWaves last August Whitman Harson Love’s senior manager of category management and deli said the company began cutting and selling fresh fruit every day in 2011 and still remains one of the only companies on the interstate to do that.

“We make fresh salads every day. We have three salads that we serve now and it is the No. 1 driving item in our fresh foods presentation” Harson explained.

With this donation Love’s can now tackle drivers’ health in partnership with St. Christopher which has helped over 3360 drivers through $3.8 million in donations.

One Tree Planted helps celebrate Earth Month

One Tree Planted a nonprofit that works with logistics and transportation companies to offset carbon emissions through tree planting has launched an interactive map that helps volunteers find events in their local communities to celebrate Earth Month in April.

Designated to help reconstruct an area that county leaders refer to as the “Blue Line Corridor” rather than targeting any funds for a new Commanders stadium.

The bonding authority has no contingency for if the Washington Commanders opt to move out of Landover when their lease at FedEx Field ends in 2027.

“Our community hasn’t received much investment over the years so this is huge. Whether the stadium stays or not” Del. Nick Charles chair of the county House delegation said. “From Largo to Capitol Heights having this type of investment that we’ve never had in that part of Prince George’s County that is huge.”

Hogan also addressed new bonding authority to improve the Baltimore Orioles and Ravens facilities Camden Yards and M&T Bank Stadium respectively.

The new authority will allow the teams to borrow up to $600 million each which is an increase from their current max by approximately $235 million.

The funds granted could support the construction of several facilities such as: a sports field house where residents can play basketball and volleyball as well as have a library a culture center a market hall or a civic plaza.

Although the funds will not be used for the Commanders’ stadium the team is in discussions with state and local officials in Maryland Virginia and the District of Columbia about a new stadium.

We will continue to provide additional details about the Washington Commanders’ hunt for a new stadium as it unfolds.

As all citizens will be enjoying Easter eve your favorite grocery store restaurant and other shops will most likely tweak their opening and closing times.

How about banks in the US and UK? Well do not worry we are here to address your concern in our article today.

Are US banks open on Easter Monday?

Easter Monday falls on the 18th of April this year 2022. Easter Monday is not a federally recognized holiday in the US which implies banks are not required to close this day legally.

While most of the major US banks will be open for business on Easter Monday there is a possibility of a change in business hours because of staffing issues at the bank.

However smaller community and regional banks might be closed or working for a few hours in the day. Please do check with your respective community bank or credit union before you visit the bank.

Below is the list of banks that are open on Easter Monday and this includes big financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co.

Bank of America

Bank of the West

BBVA

BB&T

BMO Harris Bank

Capital One

Chase

Citibank

Citizens Bank

Comerica Bank

Fifth Third Bank

First Citizens Bank

HSBC

Huntington

M&T Bank

People’s United Bank

Regions Bank

Santander Bank

SunTrust

TD Bank

UBank

Union Bank

Wells Fargo

None of the US states consider Easter Monday as a state holiday. However North Dakota celebrates the festival informally along with other cities in New York Michigan and Indiana.

UK Banks’ business hours on Easter Monday

Easter Monday is an official bank holiday in the United Kingdom which implies that almost all major banks will remain closed on this day. Banks will be reopening as normal on the next business day i.e. 19th April Tuesday.

Major UK-based banks like Barclays Halifax HSBC Lloyds NatWest Royal Bank of Scotland Santander and TSB will be closed on Easter Monday.

However Metro bank will be the only bank to function on Easter Monday from 11 am to 5 pm UK time.

Needless to say ATM machines will be available on Easter Monday.

Are retail outlets open for business?

Yes all major retail outlets will be open not only in the US but also in the UK. There is a possibility of a slight change in their business hours on the eve of Easter.

For example the majority of the Morrisons stores will be open for business from 7 am to 8 pm with a couple of stores open until 10 pm local time. Aldi is open from 8 AM to 8 PM while Sainsbury’s Local will be open from 7 AM to 11 PM.

Is the stock market open on Easter Monday?

Yes all major stock exchanges in the US like the New York Stock Exchange Nasdaq and Cboe are open on Easter Monday as U.S. stock markets don’t comply with the Federal Reserve’s holiday schedule.

However in the UK it is a trading holiday for the London Stock Exchange.

Founded by a trio of German friends in 2016 Sono Motors went public in 2021 selling their Sion solar-paneled car which is also a home energy storage system.

Now in partnership with the Munich Transport Company (MVG) a novel solar bus trailer will soon hit the roads carrying passengers in daily operation.

The Sono Solar Technology is offering possible savings—per bus—of up to 2500 liters of diesel each year and a reduction of 6.5 metric tons local CO2.

The bus trailer will be pulled by a conventional bus to provide extra capacity on busy routes. Normally these huge trailers are powered by diesel fuel.

“In summer when the air conditioning is in full use the trailer consumes more electricity than the towing vehicle can supply” a Sono spokesperson told GNN.

The 20 photovoltaic modules on the roof provide over 2000 watts to power the vehicle’s battery and electrical loads such as heating and air conditioning as well as the trailer’s steering system.

“In addition to saving diesel the additional electricity ensures the stabilization of the battery’s energy supply thus extending its service life and reducing maintenance costs.”

“Apart from this specific case Sono Motors Solar Technology can also be integrated into the Bus itself—for supporting the high voltage battery of an electric bus.”

This is the first time that Sono’s solar systems have been used on public transport.

“Especially in times of rising energy prices and increasing urban area emission regulations our solar technology offers great added value for public transport operators” says Laurin Hahn Sono Motors co-founder and CEO.

Technical considerations

For a medium-sized fleet of around 300 buses calculations show the possibility of savings of up to 2000 metric tonnes of CO2 per year. Further increases are conceivable in the future as both the solar cells and the power electronics are expected to become more efficient. This solar solution’s so-called ‘CO2 backpack’ i.e. emissions caused in production amounts to a one-off of approximately 1.5 metric tons of CO2 per bus or bus trailer and could be offset after a short runtime of just less than one year.

The concept for the customized solar bus trailer was developed in collaboration with MVG specifically for use on buses to ensure maximum space utilization and efficiency.

Due to the ultra-fast optimization in the millisecond range and the multi-channel system the PV yields can be transferred to the battery of the bus in the best possible way. The modules cover a total area of 130 sq-feet (12 sq-meters) and supply the 24 V battery with over 2000 watts—and the energy generated can be monitored online using integrated software.

“The question of what energy savings can be achieved by using solar energy are of course particularly exciting against the background of current fuel and energy prices” said a spokesperson for MVG.

Extending EV-bus ranges

Sono Motors’ patented solar technology has been developed so that it can be integrated and licensed into a wide range of vehicles. “When e-buses are factory-equipped with our solar technology additional range can immediately be generated through solar energy on the roof and sides. This not only reduces the standstill times for charging processes but also protects the battery through a constant charging process. As a result the e-bus can be operated longer” explains Hahn.

“I am convinced by the idea as a lot of fuel can be saved here and CO2 emissions can be significantly reduced… and this also has a direct impact on air quality” said Munich’s vice mayor Katrin Habenschaden.

Munich is already working to completely convert their bus fleet to electric drives. Harnessing the power of the sun makes the process even more sustainable while extending the range of the e-buses.

The U.S. military has confirmed years after the impact that a meteorite that hit earth in 2014 was interstellar in origin.

It is believed to be the first known object to travel to earth from outside our solar system.

The meteorite in question caught scientists' eyes even back then due to the high velocity with which it entered Earth's atmosphere (over 130000 miles per hour). As noted in a new paper from Avi Loeb and Amir Siraj such speeds usually originate in a star or star system that would have to be outside our own.

The meteorite's 2014 impact predates 2017's Oumuamua which some believed to be extraterrestrial in origin.

The findings in this paper were withheld until the U.S. military could declassify some data about the meteorite which burned and broke apart upon entering Earth's atmosphere.

Siraj believes pieces of it may be found at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean but finding these would require additional time and resources.

Brightside Solar Facility is the first of seven renewable and energy storage projects across Texas. The Texas-sized package of zero-carbon projects all located within the ERCOT market are part of a near $1 billion capital investment by Vistra first announced in September 2020.

“With Brightside and additional Vistra Zero projects poised to come online across Texas our vision of transitioning our fleet to cleaner electric generation is becoming a reality” said Curt Morgan CEO of Vistra.

Also expected online in spring 2022:

DeCordova Energy Storage Facility Hood County TX – 260 MW/260 MW-hours

Emerald Grove Solar Facility Crane County TX – 108 MW

Brightside is comprised of 147732 photovoltaic solar panels that can generate enough electricity to power approximately 25000 average residences in the ERCOT market. Initial project construction began in January 2021.

Brightside Solar Facility utilizes solar panel technology from First Solar; Burns & McDonnell provided engineering and construction expertise.

But long before the Pluto ""controversy"" other objects moved on and off the official list of solar system planets. Indeed a kindergartener in the early 1800s would have learned that Ceres was a planet.

So while the argument over planethood might seem like a modern astronomical debate 19th century astronomers were bedeviled by this question of how to define what actually counts as a planet.

RELATED: Hubble discovers a Jupiter-like planet forming in a very strange way

And as alluded to Ceres predates Pluto in his controversy. The asteroid belt which sits roughly between Mars and Jupiter is filled with minor planets and asteroids. One of those celestial bodies Ceres has a surface covered in minerals like clay and carbonates as well as water ice. It is an odd world to be sure: because it is not completely frozen and is covered in salt water scientists believe Ceres could harbor microbial life. This places Ceres in stark contrast with Pluto which is on the far side of the solar system and has an entirely frozen surface. In addition whereas Ceres is a dull monochromatic gray Pluto's colors range from white and black to vivid orange.

Yet Ceres and Pluto have one very important thing in common: Astronomers at one point thought they should be classified as planets but then changed their mind. It all comes down to size which in the case of planetary science really does matter.

Flashback to the beginning of the 19th century. An Italian priest and astronomer named Giuseppe Piazzi at the Palermo Observatory had answered a nearly three-decade old question: Why did the orbits of Mars and Jupiter indicate that a planet existed between them even though none could be found? On Jan. 1 1801 Piazzi seemed to answer this question by announcing that he had found a ""star"" which had moved from its position in the Taurus constellation. Scientists soon concluded that this must be the missing planet and assumed the matter was resolved.

Then another ""planet"" was discovered. On March 28 1802 German physician and astronomer Heinrich Olbers discovered Pallas; this was rapidly followed by Juno in 1804 and Vesta in 1807. Each was duly designated as a planet although astronomers began to have their doubts that this increasingly-cumbersome system was working out. Although scientists were given a breather for a few decades a plethora of new discoveries between 1845 and 1852 left the astronomical community with 15 asteroids to account for. None of the new ones were labeled as planets but it was becoming increasingly clear that reforms would be necessary. By 1867 it was clear that Ceres was too small to be grouped in with a body like Earth and so it was given a new designation: Minor planet. And instead of being given fancy names and symbols they would be labeled with numbers based on when they were discovered or their determination of orbit.

This bring us to Pluto. While Ceres has a diameter of 588 miles (compared to the Earth's 7918 mile diameter) Pluto has a comparatively heftier diameter of 1477 miles. Yet this did not save Pluto from getting the axe as a planet when the International Astronomical Union met in 2006. The reason was quite simply that astronomers had decided that there were three criteria for being considered a planet:

So the three criteria of the IAU for a full-sized planet are: It is in orbit around the Sun. It has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape). It has ""cleared the neighborhood"" around its orbit.

Because Pluto did not meet the third requirement — it has not ""cleared the neighborhood"" around its orbit — it lost its status as a planet. Clearing the neighborhood means that the region of space near which it orbits the sun is bereft of larger bodies having been absorbed into the planet. Ceres like Pluto clearly doesn't pass this criteria: the asteroid belt in which Ceres resides is evidence of a ""failed"" planet that didn't clear its neighborhood. Indeed there are multiple other relatively massive bodies — Vesta Pallas and Hygiea — also in Ceres' vicinity.

Pluto had held this distinction of planet for 76 years starting with its discovery in 1930 by American astronomer Clyde W. Tombaugh. The demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet remains controversial and not just among lay astronomers. A team of American scientists published a paper in December in the scientific journal Icarus arguing that a ""planet"" should be defined as any geologically active celestial body. One co-author argued that we should say there are ""probably over 150 planets in our solar system""; the paper claimed that the need to distinguish planets from moons is cultural not scientific and hinders proper understanding of astronomy.

""We found that during the 1800s the non-scientific public in the Latin west developed its own folk taxonomy about planets reflecting the concerns of astrology and theology and that this folk taxonomy eventually affected the scientists"" the scientists explained. They later concluded that ""using the geophysical planet concept with subcategories for the individual features (including gravitational dominance) makes the planet concept both useful and deeply insightful for communicating with the public."" This did not happen in 2006 they assert because ""because adequate time was not taken to sort these issues"" with the resulting vote leading to ""a deeper split in the community.""

Ironically even as Pluto was being demoted Ceres nearly received a promotion. An earlier 21st century proposal for defining a planet would have done so by describing a planet as having enough mass to be nearly round and to orbit around a star without being a satellite of a planet or a star itself. Had this definition been accepted Ceres would have become the fifth planet from the Sun.

Just two weeks later on April 12 wind power beat coal and nuclear again (but still trailing far behind natural gas).

The twin milestones highlight the rise of renewable energy and the fall of coal in the US. The country’s combined wind and solar output doubled in the decade between 2008 and 2018 while coal electricity generation fell by more than half over the same period. Since March 2019 wind and solar output have nearly doubled again according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.

Wind power peaks during spring gusts

Wind power gusted ahead of coal and nuclear on March 29 and April 12 but on most days it remains the US’s fourth largest source of electricity. Yet wind is closing the gap. The US installed a record quantity of wind turbines in 2020 and analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence expect the country to break new records for wind turbine installations in 2022.

This added capacity has put wind within striking distance of coal and nuclear power in terms of daily output. On the windest spring days when wind output is typically highest turbines now produce more power than coal and nuclear plants.

But natural gas remains the dominant (and growing) energy source in the US despite a US goal of net-zero emissions no later than 2050 (and carbon-free electricity by 2035). The US Energy Information Administration predicts renewables will still make up just 44% of the US energy mix by 2050 up from 21% in 2021. If the US net-zero targets are going to succeed the country will need far more months like this past March."

Some even do it after retirement.

But Ed Harrison not only did all that he started a new career in a field usually associated with people much younger. He became a firefighter and emergency medical technician.

To the rescue: Northeast Ohio firefighters practice swift water saves in Cuyahoga River

""He is definitely a unique man to have retired from a career and then have an interest in the fire service become an EMT then an advanced EMT and now a firefighter a diver a shore support member of our team"" said Scott Simmons commander of the Portage County Water Rescue Team and a Kent firefighter. ""He definitely shows our team members that age is just a number and that's what's awesome about him. He's setting a great example of what I would like the team members to be.""

Harrison 71 lives in Paris Township with his wife Diane and it all began innocently enough as a concerned citizen about an issue he wanted to address.

""I had some complaints about some open burning in the township here"" he said.

More:Dozens of animals rescued from flooded farm in Palmyra in Portage County

At that time Harrison was a retiree. He earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Akron while working for FirstEnergy Corp. where he was for 39 years. For the last 20 years before retiring in 2012 he was an environmental engineer for the company mainly putting together implementing and monitoring environmental compliance programs.

So he was worried about open burning taking place and took it to the most logical person in the township.

""I ended up talking with the fire chief in Paris Township and I thought he was probably tired of seeing my face"" Harrison asaid. ""So I said 'Do you need any help with things around here?' Then he said 'Well yeah you could become an EMT and help me.' So that's what kind of kicked it off.""

Township Fire Chief Derek Reed said it is not entirely unheard of for a part-time fire department to have someone Harrison's age on its roster.

""We've got another gentleman on the department now that's probably around the same age as him"" Reed said. ""I mean it's not super common but with us not being career you know we get people from all walks of life.""

Reed said Harrison went through EMT school and was with the department he believes for more than a year before moving on to the Charlestown Fire Department where he remains today.

""He's a really good guy"" he said. ""He's always willing to learn and help out. I mean as far as his willingness to participate that was always a nice thing.""

Harrison said his training as an EMT was at UH Portage Medical Center. He completed basic EMT training in 2019 and then went back to school to earn advanced EMT certification in 2020.

""You go into more depth on differential diagnosis of patient's problems in both medical problems and trauma"" he said. ""So I guess I would say overall you get a better understanding of what to look for with a patient and their problems. So you get more time more ride time with the squads you get more clinical time in the hospital. So I think it gives you a more complete picture of what's expected when you need to treat patients.""

The next and highest level in the emergency medical service is paramedic but that takes much longer and costs a lot more so Harrison said he will probably remain where he is.

""I'm happy with the level I'm at right now"" he said.

But that did not mean he was finished learning. He has also completed the 36-hour basic firefighter training and has passed the state certification test. This allows him to help with the operation of equipment and hoses outside of a fire scene as well as help bring out patients.

Harrison said he is unsure he would move on to more advanced firefighter training because of the presence of younger firefighters with the department.

""For obvious reasons they're better suited to go into like a fully developed fire where rescues might be required"" he said.

But Harrison's training did continue but in a another direction; to the water rescue team.

""Like I have from the start I'm just here I'm participating to learn"" he said. ""I think it's something we do all of our lives. So I've welcomed the opportunity to try something different than I've ever been involved in during my career. And you know I look forward to any other learning opportunities that I might encounter.""

Simmons said Harrison joining the team developed out of his desire to expand on one aspect of the team that is crucial but not one that people would often think about.

""When I took over as commander last year I knew that I wanted to start out by having a shore support class in May"" said Simmons. ""So I sent fliers out to all the fire departments in the county and all the adjoining departments of Portage County asking for anybody interested in joining the dive team to take the two-day shore support class that we had. And he showed up for it.""

Simmons added that Harrison was no stranger to him.

""I thought it was great because I've I've known Ed for a while"" he said. ""He did his EMT ride time with us at Kent Fire Department when he was in EMT school. So he's a very friendly face around our department. He actually even being certified still comes and rides with us because he is kind of like a sponge. He just wants to get more knowledge in the fire service.""

So Harrison joined the water rescue team as shore support personnel in May.

""You interview people find out what the witnesses saw"" he said. ""You try to get some direction as to where a possible victim went into the water. When the dive team arrives you assist them in putting on their equipment in getting to the location. When they're in the water you monitor them direct a search or rescue activity whenever it's required.

""And sometimes you're required to interface with police or park authorities or sometimes family. But this is never just one person. You know you're working with other shore support and working with the incident commander.""

During the summer Harrison became certified as a diver. This does not mean he can go on rescue dives. Both Harrison and Simmons said a lot more training is required for that something Harrison said he does not expect to complete.

""But going through the dive class has made him even better as a shore support member because now he's very familiar with all that equipment and the physics of diving"" Simmons said. ""So as a shore support member helping a diver he really knows what's going on with those divers to be able to help them.""

Simmons said that Harrison knows his limits but those limits are somewhere beyond that of many his age.

""For his age he's in great shape I would say"" said Simmons. ""He was able to get through the dive class. That's physical in itself.""

Harrison said his wife has been on board with his new career.

""She's behind me 100 percent"" he said. ""We've gone to a number of activities and she's been able to meet other firefighters and their families. She's extremely happy to be part of it and included as well.""

Harrison said he is really just getting started. He has found that the fire service is not merely a job or even a career but ""a chance to help other people"" and ""an outstanding community of men and women.""

""I'm very thankful for this opportunity to be involved with the fire department and to be accepted"" he said. ""There's so many times as we get older the doors are closed to new adventures and new opportunities. But everybody that I've been involved with from the time I started at Paris and throughout the education process at UH Portage everybody has opened the door wide open to me.""

No one was giving them a shot in their first-round series with the Milwaukee Bucks. Even the most optimistic Bulls fans were just hoping to see a few good games before heading into the offseason and turning their attention to the baseball season.

Changing the narrative in Game 1 against the Bucks was seemingly imperative if the Bulls wanted to make this a competitive series. But when Giannis Antetokounmpo hit a 3-pointer a minute and a half into the game to give the Bucks a quick 9-0 lead it seemed like the game was decided before the first State Farm commercial

There was no need for any spoiler alerts. We’d all seen this movie before.

But a funny thing happened on the way to a blowout at the Fiserv Forum.

The Bulls bounced back from a 16-point deficit to make it a game only to watch the Bucks hold on for a 93-86 win.

Nikola Vucevic’s 24 points and 17 rebounds weren’t enough as the Bucks breathed a sigh of relief in a wild game. Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 27 points and 16 rebounds dominating like he did in last year’s postseason.

“It’s tough” Zach LaVine said. “After that first little run they had in the first quarter we fought back and we let them know that we were here. I think it’s going to be a good matchup.”

LaVine and DeMar DeRozan both shot poorly scoring 18 points apiece on combined 12-for-44 shooting. Vucevic was 9 of 27 and he and LaVine were a combined 4 of 20 on 3s. That the Bulls were able to overcome that — and a 47-37 disadvantage on the boards — and still have a chance should boost their confidence heading into Game 2.

“It wasn’t just me” DeRozan said of his off night. “All of us. We’ve just got to get that feel. Every shot I took felt good. I guarantee it — me Zach and Vooch aren’t going to miss that many shots again. We’ve just got to keep (doing) what we did defensively and try to take that (shooting) to another level.”

Bulls Nation was well-represented in Game 1 with enough road-tripping fans on hand to loudly boo Grayson Allen when the Bucks guard entered in the first quarter and every time he popped off the bench. You can’t blame Bucks fans for treating this first-round series like an afterthought and putting their tickets on the resale market.

They’re pacing themselves for June and with snow in the forecast for Monday that seemed like a long long way away.

The Deer District — that hot spot outside Fiserv Forum that Milwaukee made famous during last year’s championship run — was largely empty before tipoff. Temperatures in the 30s and an early evening starting time on Easter Sunday were likely factors not to mention an opponent no one in town was taking seriously. Bucks fans at one point began chanting “O-ver-ra-ted” at the Bulls as though they were facing a college team.

Fireworks explode as the Bucks are introduced before Game 1 against the Bulls on Sunday April 17 2022 in Milwaukee.

The Bulls didn’t care about the extraneous noise. They knew the task at hand and that a Game 1 win would mute all the talk about a short series.

If the Bucks were going to lose a game in the series this was supposed to be the one there for the taking. The Bucks were 1-6 in Game 1s over the last two postseasons but Bulls coach Billy Donovan said he didn’t make it a point to “go back and talk about something that happened a year or two or three years ago in a Game 1 of a first-round playoff series and say this is a trend.”

The Bulls shrugged off their dreadful start to pull within eight at halftime trailing 51-43 but Antetokounmpo already had 17 points and 11 rebounds and the Bulls had shot 31.7% from the field and an abysmal 17.6% from 3-point range. The series was playing out as most had envisioned.

“They really hurt us on the backboard and when they are there and we do come down with rebounds we’ve got to be able to run” Donovan said. “We took a lot of rushed pull-up jump shots quick 3s. We’ve got to try to get downhill to the basket and then spray it out.”

But the Bulls slowly chipped away in the third and when Vucevic sank a 3 with 4:39 left in the quarter the game was tied and Bulls fans erupted in unison making Fiserv Forum sound like United Center North. Coby White hit a 3 to give the Bulls their first lead and converted a driving layup on the next possession.

From then on it was a back-and-forth thriller to the end. The Bucks led 87-82 with 21/2 minutes left when DeRozan hit a jumper and rebounded a Brook Lopez miss. A backdoor pass from Vucevic to Alex Caruso led to a layup that sliced the deficit to one.

The Bulls had chances in the final minute but Vucevic missed a putback and LaVine misfired on a 3-point attempt with 30 seconds remaining. Jrue Holiday’s two free throws with 15.3 seconds left proved to be the dagger.

Bucks center Brook Lopez (11) gestures after making a shot and getting fouled in the final minutes of Game 1 against the Bulls on Sunday April 17 2022 in Milwaukee.

DeRozan agreed it was a missed opportunity to steal the opener on the road.

“They did what they were supposed to do at home” he said. “We’ve got another opportunity to steal home court. That’s our goal now.

“We’ve got a lot we can dissect from this game … to clean up and be better at. It definitely sucks to miss an opportunity. But we’ve got one more opportunity in Milwaukee before we go back to Chicago.”

Actually the Bulls headed back to Chicago after the game to sleep in their own beds and practice at the Advocate Center on Monday and Tuesday. Donovan said the short drive home and two-day break could be to their advantage.

“The convenience of location has been good at least from the travel standpoint late in the year” he said. “That’s one thing I thought was great in the bubble during the (2020) playoffs — no travel just the bus from the hotel to Disney and back.

“And there is something to be said for that. If we had a day in between we’d definitely have stayed here. But because we have two days (off) we have a chance to get home at a decent time and those guys can sleep in their own bed practice (Monday) and Tuesday and come back up.”

The Bulls can sleep well knowing they made the Bucks work for their Game 1 win. But if they want to make this a long series they have to do a little bit more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL25iYS9idWNrcy8yMDIyLzA0LzE2L2dpYW5uaXMtYW50ZXRva291bm1wby1raHJpcy1taWRkbGV0b24tanJ1ZS1ob2xpZGF5LWdpdmUtbWlsd2F1a2VlLWJ1Y2tzLWEtY2hhbmNlLWF0LXJlcGVhdC1uYmEtdGl0bGUvNzMzNzkzMjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giannis Middleton Holiday give Milwaukee Bucks shot at NBA title,"No commitment required.

Kachi comprises 705 sq km of leases and lease applications over a brine-bearing basin 20km long 15km wide and 400-800m deep centered.





As we’ve shared Ford is sourcing deeper into the battery supply chain. This is one of several agreements we’re exploring to help us secure raw materials to support our aggressive EV acceleration. —Lisa Drake Ford’s vice president EV Industrialization

Both Lake and Ford see this as an opportunity for a potential long-term agreement with the ability to scale up environmentally responsible production and participate in Lake’s other projects to ensure high-quality lithium products are available to Ford. This MoU with Ford supports Lake’s strategy to be a key independent supplier into global lithium supply chains and ensure the security of supply to customers. —Steve Promnitz Lake’s Managing Director

Lake’s Kachi Project is located in Argentina’s Catamarca Province at the southern end of the Lithium Triangle a world-renowned province responsible for 40% of global lithium production.

Using direct extraction technology provided by Lake’s technology partner Lilac Solutions Lake plans to produce at Kachi a sustainable high-purity lithium carbonate product.

Lilac has developed and patented a new ion exchange technology to extract lithium from brines without the need for evaporation ponds. Lilac produces its ion exchange beads and delivers these beads to brine projects worldwide. The beads are loaded into tanks brine is flowed through the tanks and as the brine percolates through the beads the beads absorb lithium out of the brine.

Once the beads are saturated with lithium hydrochloric acid is used to flush out the lithium yielding lithium chloride. Lithium chloride is the “crude oil” of lithium—the standard intermediary in every lithium brine project today. The lithium chloride is then processed on-site with conventional process equipment to yield a finished product.

In April 2020 Lake announced pre-feasibility study (PFS) results for Kachi showing its potential to become a long-life low-cost operation with an annual production target of 25500 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate using direct extraction technology. The results showed a high margin project with an EBITDA margin of 62% together with competitive capital and operating costs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC9kZXNpZ24tY2hpZWYtYXQtZm9yZC1zYXlzLXRoZS13YXktYXV0b3MtYXJlLWRlc2lnbmVkLWlzLWNoYW5naW5nLWR1ZS10by1lbGVjdHJpZmljYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Design Chief Wants More Concepts To Re-Imagine The Car In The Age Of Electrification,"With the advent of electric vehicles interior design may prove to be more important than exterior styling

Having spent over a decade at Renault helping reinvent the French brand before joining Ford Motor Co. last April as the group’s new chief designer Anthony Lo knows a thing or two about eye-catching concepts.

Now he wants to bring back the magic of conceptual models to Ford and Lincoln as the ongoing electrification of their lineups allows what he described to Autonews during an interview a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to rethink how a vehicle should look.”

“A concept car is not just simply a sculpture” he told the news outlet adding that “it’s a platform for us to test experiences and think ultimately how the brand design language should evolve.”

For most buyers the way a vehicle looks on the outside is the first attribute that produces a visceral reaction. And while that’s not going to change Lo thinks that interior design will take a front seat in the age of high-tech.

“In the past exterior design would always take the lead; it’s part of what attracts you to the showroom” he told Automotive News. “But because of the amount of features within the vehicle that you can control as a user the user interface becomes more and more important. The design process is turning upside down.”

Electric vehicles offer a blank slate as it were. Instead of being constrained to an engine up front or out back oftentimes the battery pack and motors take significantly less space. That frees designers up to change the interior of a vehicle in a dramatic way. For example the Lucid Air has a similar footprint to the Mercedes E-Class but has about the same interior room as an S-Class.

At the same time that flexibility allows the design team to change the body in unconventional ways. Lo says that “A concept car is not just simply a sculpture… It’s a platform for us to test experiences and think ultimately how the brand design language should evolve.”

In just over a week Lincoln will debut its very first all-electric concept one that Lo has played a role in creating. “This is the best way to understand whether this new direction we’ve decided to take is acceptable and if people will fall in love with them” he says. This EV concept is slated to signal the future of the many future electrified vehicles slated for production at Lincoln by 2026.

From what we can tell they won’t look much like any other all-electric vehicles in Ford’s arsenal though we don’t have a lot to go on. Would you be willing to ignore exterior styling if the electric vehicle you’re interested in has the right combo of internal features?

April 16 2022 — A Ford paint peeling lawsuit failed class action certification even though owners claim their Ford Mustang Ford Expedition and Ford Explorer vehicles are equipped with aluminum panels that rust.

The original Ford peeling paint lawsuit included 2013-2018 Ford Mustang Ford Expedition and Ford Explorer vehicles with hoods and other panels that corrode.

This causes the paint to bubble flake peel and blister and the paint warranty is allegedly a ""sham"" because rust and corrosion aren't covered by the warranty.

Instead the paint warranty coverage is limited to perforation of the aluminum panels. According to the class action lawsuit Ford gets out of paying for damaged paint because aluminum doesn't ""perforate.""

According to the Ford paint class action the alleged problems originate from design defects.

""The 'design strategy for the leading edges of the Mustang and Explorer hoods (included in the Class Vehicles) was to seal the hem against moisture exposure and stagnation in an attempt to prevent corrosion initiation at the trim edge.'”

But the plaintiffs claim “[o]n the Mustang and Explorer hoods Ford only applied over-hem sealer to the leading edge of the hoods not the full perimeter.”

“Because there is no drain path from the leading edge hem when water or condensate enters from other unsealed portions of the hood hem and drains downwards to the front hem section it becomes entrapped under the over-hem sealer at the leading edge.”

According to the paint peeling class action lawsuit Ford's design is defective because the hem on the leading edge of the hood cannot be kept dry without a full-perimeter over-hem sealer.

And on the Expedition the class action alleges Ford didn't apply any over-hem sealer and the leading edge is hemmed with a flat-hem design that leaves no path to drain trapped moisture.

The Ford peeling paint lawsuit asserts the automaker issued four technical service bulletins to dealerships regarding the aluminum hoods and panels allegedly showing Ford knew there were rust and corrosion problems.

Ford Paint Peeling Class Action Lawsuit Certification

Following several court decisions in this case that began in 2018 the plaintiffs sought an order from the judge certifying these classes of customers.

Unfair or Deceptive Design Defect Class: All current owners who purchased a new or used 2013-2016 Ford Mustang 2013-2017 Ford Expedition or 2013-2018 Ford Explorer from a Ford dealership in California Florida or New York. Unfair or Deceptive Warranty Class (Perforation): All current owners who purchased a new or used 2013-2015 Ford Mustang 2013-2015 Ford Expedition or 2013-2015 Ford Explorer from a Ford dealership in California Florida or New York. Unfair or Deceptive Warranty Class (Ineffective Repair): All current owners who purchased a new or used 2013-2016 Ford Mustang 2013-2017 Ford Expedition or 2013-2018 Ford Explorer from a Ford dealership in California Florida or New York. Unjust Enrichment Class: All current owners who purchased a new or used 2013-2016 Ford Mustang 2013-2017 Ford Expedition or 2013-2018 Ford Explorer from a Ford dealership in California Florida Illinois Indiana New Jersey New York North Carolina or Pennsylvania.

Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz II denied class action certification because the plaintiffs don't have “standing to bring claims for products that they did not purchase.” The judge also says the plaintiffs are “prohibited from asserting claims under a state law other than that which the plaintiff’s own claim arises.”

As for seven plaintiffs listed as class representatives the judge ruled those plaintiffs cannot serve as class representatives for vehicles none of them owned or leased and they cannot bring a lawsuit under state laws completely disassociated from their own claims.

This means the plaintiffs lack standing to bring suit on behalf of Expedition owners purchasers of Ford vehicles later than model year 2016 and plaintiffs outside the states of California Florida New York Indiana and Illinois.

The judge also found issues regarding claimed warranty repair rates and the class definitions. According to the judge the Ford paint peeling class action lawsuit would include about 800000 owners but the vast majority never had any corrosion or paint problems with their Ford vehicles.

While the plaintiffs tried to prove all the vehicles share a common design defect the judge found there are huge differences not only in models and model years but also in manufacturing techniques within various production runs of the same model and model years.

The judge denied class action certification based on these differences in models and model years.

The shape of the hoods and their varying ability to capture fluids.

The amount and placement of adhesive added to the edges of the panels.

How the panels are stored in racks following manufacture but before installation as the oils and lubricants used in the stamping and hemming process collect in the panels’ cavities.

Cleaning and conditioning pretreatment and painting of the aluminum panels.

The type of aluminum used in the hoods which was switched to a low-copper aluminum alloy beginning in late 2013 models.

The judge says it is ""nonsensical"" for the plaintiffs to ask the court to ignore these differences.

Murdoch has been married four times and fathered six children over the course of his seven-decades long career. Several of Murdoch’s children have followed him into the family business. Murdoch’s penchant for pitting the siblings against each other in a years’ long competition to see who will succeed him as head of News Corp is widely believed to be the inspiration for the popular HBO series “Succession.”

Murdoch’s ruthlessness extends far beyond his family circle. Early in his career he developed the tactic of confronting competition by buying them or running them out of business. Dealings at his British tabloid papers came under scrutiny in 2011 when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals celebrities and crime victims to get their stories. The Murdoch family brand made headlines again when Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations in 2016.

Murdoch still holds the top post at News Corp the second incarnation of the now defunct News Corporation which broke up into two companies in 2013. It is unclear who will lead the company when he passes.

Potential Heirs

Lachlan Murdoch

Lachlan Murdoch 50 is Rupert Murdoch’s oldest son with his second wife Anna. He began learning the family business at a young age through internships at his father’s media outlets. He rose quickly through the executive ranks and by 1997 had become chairman and chief executive of News Ltd. At the time his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent “the first among equals.” His ascension continued smoothly until 2005. That year Lachlan abruptly quit his executive positions at News Corporation after a battle with Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan then launched his own investment company Illyria Pty in Australia. After an extended absence Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 and resumed his position as a potential heir to the empire becoming CEO of Fox Broadcasting and executive chairman at 21st Century Fox. Shortly after Lachlan’s younger brother James was tapped to be CEO of 21st Century Fox in a power-sharing experiment orchestrated by Rupert between the brothers. The experiment proved unsuccessful and Rupert sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019. Lachlan now holds the roles of executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation and co-chairman of News Corp as well as executive chairman of NOVA Entertainment an Australian media company.

James Murdoch

James Murdoch 49 is Rupert Murdoch’s fourth child and second son with his second wife Anna. James’ early career choices was at odds with his father’s conservative newspaper empire. He dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label Rawkus Records. After several years he transitioned into executive roles within News Corporation and assumed the role of corporate company man. After Lachlan quit Fox in 2005 James was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent to his father.

In 2007 James became chairman of BSkyB. In 2011 he was named deputy COO of News Corporation and chairman and CEO of News International. But as James was climbing to new heights within the empire the company became engulfed in scandal when investigators and journalists discovered staff at some Murdoch tabloids in Britain had been hacking the phones of public figures and crime victims to get their stories. James was forced to step down as chairman of BSkyB as a result.

After several years hiatus he rejoined the family business eventually becoming chairman of Sky and CEO of 21st Century Fox co-leading the company with older brother Lachlan who served as executive chairman. The joint leadership arrangement didn’t work out and James left 21st Century Fox in 2019 when the company was sold to Disney and then left Sky when majority control was acquired by Comcast. Long known as the lone liberal of the Murdoch clan James’ political differences with his family came to a head and he resigned from the board of News Corp in 2020 writing at the time “My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”

Elisabeth Murdoch 53 is Rupert Murdoch’s second child the first he had with second wife Anna Murdoch. Elisabeth began her training in the family business early with internships and entry level jobs at Murdoch properties. In 1996 she became managing director of Sky Networks at BSkyB. But several years later she was passed over for the role of chief executive at Sky.

Rupert considers Elisabeth to be most like him but he has been more dismissive of her attempts to take the throne saying at one point she’d have to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company. In 2000 she left the family business and went on to found Shine one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies with shows like “The Biggest Loser” “Master Chef” and “History Cold Case.”

When News Corporation acquired Shine in 2011 Elisabeth attempted to take a seat on the News Corporation board but scrutiny over the phone hacking scandal prevented that from happening. She left Shine after a merger with two other production companies. In 2019 she established a new production company Sister and in 2021 Sister funded the opening of a London branch of Ghetto Film School a non-profit program geared toward introducing young people of color to the entertainment industry.

Wives

Anna Murdoch

Rupert met Anna Torv at his newspaper The Daily Mirror in Sydney where she was working as a reporter. A few months after his divorce from Patricia Rupert and Anna married. They had three children together Elisabeth Lachlan and James now the main contenders to be heir of the Murdoch empire. Over the years Anna published several novels one of which featured a family that bore a striking resemblance to her own. She spent three decades raising their family and acting as Rupert’s loyal partner on the world stage. In the mid-1990’s as Rupert approached conventional retirement age Anna hoped his relentless drive to build the empire would subside and he’d spend more time with her enjoying their golden years. Rupert was completely opposed to that idea. The disagreement led to an irreconcilable rift and the two divorced in 1999 after 31 years of marriage.

Deng 53 Rupert Murdoch’s third wife is mother of his two youngest children Grace Murdoch 20 and Chloe Murdoch 18. Wendi met Rupert when she was working at his Star TV network in Hong Kong. The up-and-comer immediately charmed the media mogul; one former colleague said “She was always someone who was going to do well. We just didn’t realize how well.” They married in June 1999 two years after meeting and only 17 days after Rupert’s divorce with his second wife Anna was finalized. Wendi grew to be one of Rupert’s closest advisers and confidantes but his older children opposed the marriage and viewed Wendi as a potential competitor for control of the Murdoch empire. But after 14 years the marriage fell apart amid allegations of Wendi’s infidelity on which she has declined to comment.

Former supermodel and ex-girlfriend of rock star Mick Jagger Jerry Hall married Rupert Murdoch in 2016 when she was 59 and he was 85. The grown Murdoch children genuinely like Jerry and approved of the union very different circumstances from his marriage to Wendi Deng. The London wedding was a joyful family affair and presented a rare moment of solidarity among the Murdoch clan. In August – 6 years after tying the knot – it was reported that Hall and Murdoch finalized their divorce.

Prudence Macleod is Rupert’s oldest child from his first marriage to Patricia Booker. Prudence never showed much of an interest in running the family business so she has largely stayed out of the succession battle that has ensnared her siblings Elisabeth Lachlan and James. She has held different positions at News Corporation throughout her career and currently sits on the board of Times Newspapers Ltd. She also has a voting share in the Murdoch family trust.

Anderson School Corporation made the decision to review the mascot after amid criticism to a viral TikTok video showing a high school basketball game ritual where two students dress up as an Indian chief and maiden doing a ceremony performance with a pipe and dance according to Fox 59.

Sarah Holba took the video prior to the basketball game and said that while she was disappointed it wasn't surprising.

""It was disappointing but not surprising that it was happening"" Holba said.

More than 700000 people have watched the TikTok video so far and the post has received more than 150000 comments.

Holba said that when she asked how long this tradition has been going on others told her it has been going on for a long time.

""The Anderson student section got really into it. You had the pep band playing"" Holba said. ""I asked some people around me who said ‘oh Anderson has been doing this forever.'""

In response according to the report the Anderson School Corporation Superintendent said that the pre-game ritual is being suspended and said that an internal committee has been formed to review the mascot's usage throughout the system. It will also seek input from leaders from the Native American community before arriving at a decision.

""We’re taking this very seriously"" Superintendent Joseph Cronk said. ""You know it’s always our intent to honor our Native American tradition and maybe that was ignorant. Maybe we don’t know what we’re honoring. Maybe we’re not honoring at all.""

The Anderson School Corporation used the mascot with the blessing of Chief William Anderson's ancestors according to Cronk.

Rachel Thunder director of the Indiana and Kentucky Chapter of the American Indian Movement told the news outlet that the tradition incites a dangerous environment.

She provides straight-ahead coverage of the Supreme Court her beat at the channel and has a nightly newscast airing at midnight on the East Coast.

Bream is never in the line of fire when media critics cite the network for the provocative stances and right-wing rhetoric dispensed on its prime-time opinion shows. But even with a lower profile she has become a best-selling author capturing two slots on the New York Times list of best-selling advice how-to and miscellaneous books for the week ending April 2: Her new release ""The Mothers and Daughters of the Bible Speak"" ranked at No. 2 its forerunner ""The Women of the Bible Speak"" at No. 10.

Both books analyze the stories of female Biblical characters in a conversational style that acknowledges their flaws and shows how faith guided them through crises. Rick Lewis who owns Logos Bookstore in Dallas said many of his customers who purchased Bream's first effort picked up additional copies for a daughter mother or friend.

""I think some people may be intimidated and don't want to pick up the Bible and start reading Genesis or Exodus"" Bream said in a recent interview. ""But these are beautiful and compelling stories and I feel like if we can put them in this format where people get to know and understand these characters and say 'I can relate to what that woman is going through' — it makes them feel less alone.""

Bream's book is the fourth straight title from Fox News Books — an imprint at parent company Fox Corp.'s publishing conglomerate HarperCollins — to hit the bestseller list. Launched in 2020 the outfit offers its books the full promotional clout of the most-watched cable news channel. Its four releases have totaled more than 1 million copies in under two years according to the company.

The imprint is part of a companywide effort to expand Fox News beyond the realm of news and political talk which can be a turnoff to some advertisers. Fox News Media Chief Executive Suzanne Scott and her bosses at parent Fox Corp. have said they want the division — which accounts for around 80% of the company's profits — to be a lifestyle and entertainment brand that appeals to politically right-of-center Americans.

""Transcending news is what this is about"" said Jason Klarman executive vice president for marketing at Fox News. ""Our audience is looking for us to curate other things for them besides the news and opinion of the day. We're using Fox Nation and this imprint to explore that.""

Such a transformation will be a tall order. While provocative hosts such as Tucker Carlson bring the channel its largest ratings dominating the competition from NBCUniversal's MSNBC and Warner Bros. Discovery's CNN they are polarizing. Fox News hosts' commentary on the insurrection and amplification of former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was rigged were factors when its longtime Washington anchor Chris Wallace decided to bolt the channel last year to join CNN's streaming service.

For the record CNN pulled the plug on CNN Plus on Thursday citing poor subscriptions in its first three weeks as the reason.

Fox News meanwhile captures more than half of the audience watching cable news. While it has long been a safe space for Republicans Nielsen data show the channel reaches a substantial number of viewers who identify themselves as Democrats and independents.

In the month before Bream's book was released the author did segments about it on her nightly program and others across the network such as the ""The Five"" which averages more than 3 million viewers a day. Based on Nielsen data the segments reached 22 million viewers at no cost to the publisher. There were also plugs during the channel's commercial breaks on radio feeds and at FoxNews.com while paid marketing targeted church groups and faith-based media outlets.

""Shannon is getting the full support of the Fox marketing machine"" said Klarman.

Marissa Eigenbrood senior vice president of Smith Publicity a Cherry Hill New Jersey-based firm specializing in books said Bream's sales success with a title that delves into Scripture is a testament to Fox News' promotional muscle. ""There is a hungry market for stories that add faith and spirituality but it gets more limited when it moves into the Bible"" she said. ""They have really nailed it in knowing who their audience is.""

Media conglomerates using their TV networks to push books from their publishing divisions is nothing new. Big-name authors for Paramount Global's Simon & Schuster are often featured on the company's CBS News shows including ""60 Minutes"" which is still among the most-watched non-sports TV programs of the week.

But Fox News Books takes the process several steps further. The company's marketing department develops the book ideas matches them up with on-air talent who write them and then features the titles prominently across the network's programs. The imprint is distributed by HarperCollins' Broadside Books which specializes in titles aimed at conservative audiences.

Most of the channel's biggest stars including Carlson Sean Hannity and Greg Gutfeld have their own preexisting deals with other publishers and on-air talent is still free to pursue contracts with outside companies. But Fox News Books is promising in-house authors massive on-air support improving their chances of landing on the bestseller list.

In return Fox News reaps the financial rewards from sales and owns the copyrights to the titles which Fox uses to develop companion shows on its streaming service Fox Nation. The company has up to five titles in the pipeline through next year.

The channel has been consistent in understanding the traditional values held by much of its audience which also happens to buy a lot of nonfiction books. Fox News Books is trying to tap into that worldview with a focus on ""faith family and patriotism"" according to Klarman.

Marji Ross the former head of the conservative publishing house Regnery who serves as a consultant to Fox News Books said the channel's strong connection to its audience is a valuable tool for moving copies off the shelf.

""At Regnery we would often see authors could go on the 'Today' show and not sell as many books as they did when going on a show where the audience trusted and really paid attention to what the host and network is saying"" Ross said. ""The Fox News audience feels respected and appreciated and don't feel like their values are being mocked or criticized or ignored.""

The imprint — which plans four books this year and another four in 2023 — is following the model of Fox Nation the streaming service launched in 2018 that has attracted than 1 million paying subscribers according to analyst estimates with nonfiction programming and films that share a distinctly non-woke perspective.

Fox Nation does stream programs aimed at the Trump-supporting diehards — most notably a widely criticized Carlson-produced documentary that suggested the FBI instigated the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. The service still carries an independently produced series from Lara Logan even though she no longer appears as a guest on Fox News after comparing Dr. Anthony Fauci to Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele.

But most Fox Nation shows are positive celebratory looks at American life. It recently added a special hosted program by Kathie Lee Gifford called ""The Jesus I Know"" in which she interviews other show business types about their Christian beliefs. The company recently signed Kevin Costner to host a four-part documentary series on the 150th anniversary of Yellowstone Park.

It was the Fox Nation series ""Modern Warriors"" that launched Fox News in the book publishing business. Featuring first-person accounts by U.S. war veterans the program was adapted into a book by Pete Hesgeth who served in Iraq and is co-host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend.""

The imprint followed up with a collection of Christmas stories from another ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy and her husband Sean Duffy a former Republican congressman and frequent contributor on the channel.

The book ""All American Christmas"" gathered recipes and holiday traditions from the Duffys and other Fox News personalities — all of whom discussed their contributions on the air. It sold more than 200000 copies.

Bream has already blown through that number with her first Bible-related book which finished 2021 as BookScan's 10th bestselling title with more than 500000 copies sold. The sequel sold more than 56000 in its first week.

Bream is a graduate of Liberty University an Evangelical school and has always been upfront about her Christianity leading Fox News Books to come to her with the idea of writing a faith-based book.

""It was such a smart move knowing that so many people in our audience are very faithful people and this is sort of a gift to them in a way"" said Bream. ""I'm just glad to be sort of the vessel and the messenger for it.""

Klarman said Fox News Books is not depending on bulk purchases by special interest groups or institutions which are frequently used to drive the sales of conservative political books. (While Fox News Books has stayed away from politics titles so far Klarman does not rule publishing them out in the future.)

Fox News did purchase around 10% of its books to offer as premiums to attract Fox Nation subscribers. But that will not be the case with Bream's sequel which has already generated enough sales for the imprint to plan a third Bible related title.

Crowds at Bream's live book appearances have been the largest in places where Fox News is extremely popular — the South Texas and the Florida retirement community known as The Villages. But Bream has also found fans during promotional visits in the deep blue state of California.

""I find it hilarious that people will sort of pull me aside and say almost in a whisper 'Hey we watch you every night' "" Bream said. ""I'm like 'it's OK you don't have to whisper.'

The CNN Original Series airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.

CNN —

Over the past 70 years media mogul Rupert Murdoch built a small Australian family newspaper company into arguably the most powerful conservative media empire in history. With a market cap of $13.50 billion News Corp is one of the most influential companies on the planet.

The story behind the ruthless business tactics political maneuvering and dynastic family battles that have gone into the making of this media powerhouse would be perfect fodder for one of the News Corp news outlets or TV channels if it were not about Rupert himself. Now as the seemingly invincible figure advances into his nineties speculation through the worlds of business politics and entertainment about who will succeed him as the leader of News Corp has reached a fever pitch.

Here’s a look at who’s who in the potential line of succession and the wider Murdoch clan.

Rupert Murdoch

Australian-born Rupert Murdoch 91 is the media magnate who grew the small newspaper company he inherited from his father in 1952 into News Corporation Ltd. the multi-billion dollar global media empire with a presence in cable film television internet satellite sports publishing and other fields. At different points the conglomerate has included the newspapers News of the World the Sun the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal; Twentieth Century Fox film studio; the Fox Broadcasting network; Fox News Channel; HarperCollins publishing and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Murdoch has been married four times and fathered six children over the course of his seven-decades long career. Several of Murdoch’s children have followed him into the family business. Murdoch’s penchant for pitting the siblings against each other in a years’ long competition to see who will succeed him as head of News Corp is widely believed to be the inspiration for the popular HBO series “Succession.”

Murdoch’s ruthlessness extends far beyond his family circle. Early in his career he developed the tactic of confronting competition by buying them or running them out of business. Dealings at his British tabloid papers came under scrutiny in 2011 when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals celebrities and crime victims to get their stories. The Murdoch family brand made headlines again when Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations in 2016.

Murdoch still holds the top post at News Corp the second incarnation of the now defunct News Corporation which broke up into two companies in 2013. It is unclear who will lead the company when he passes.

Potential Heirs

Lachlan Murdoch 50 is Rupert Murdoch’s oldest son with his second wife Anna. He began learning the family business at a young age through internships at his father’s media outlets. He rose quickly through the executive ranks and by 1997 had become chairman and chief executive of News Ltd. At the time his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent “the first among equals.” His ascension continued smoothly until 2005. That year Lachlan abruptly quit his executive positions at News Corporation after a battle with Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan then launched his own investment company Illyria Pty in Australia. After an extended absence Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 and resumed his position as a potential heir to the empire becoming CEO of Fox Broadcasting and executive chairman at 21st Century Fox. Shortly after Lachlan’s younger brother James was tapped to be CEO of 21st Century Fox in a power-sharing experiment orchestrated by Rupert between the brothers. The experiment proved unsuccessful and Rupert sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019. Lachlan now holds the roles of executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation and co-chairman of News Corp as well as executive chairman of NOVA Entertainment an Australian media company.

James Murdoch 49 is Rupert Murdoch’s fourth child and second son with his second wife Anna. James’ early career choices was at odds with his father’s conservative newspaper empire. He dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label Rawkus Records. After several years he transitioned into executive roles within News Corporation and assumed the role of corporate company man. After Lachlan quit Fox in 2005 James was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent to his father.

In 2007 James became chairman of BSkyB. In 2011 he was named deputy COO of News Corporation and chairman and CEO of News International. But as James was climbing to new heights within the empire the company became engulfed in scandal when investigators and journalists discovered staff at some Murdoch tabloids in Britain had been hacking the phones of public figures and crime victims to get their stories. James was forced to step down as chairman of BSkyB as a result.

After several years hiatus he rejoined the family business eventually becoming chairman of Sky and CEO of 21st Century Fox co-leading the company with older brother Lachlan who served as executive chairman. The joint leadership arrangement didn’t work out and James left 21st Century Fox in 2019 when the company was sold to Disney and then left Sky when majority control was acquired by Comcast. Long known as the lone liberal of the Murdoch clan James’ political differences with his family came to a head and he resigned from the board of News Corp in 2020 writing at the time “My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”

Rupert considers Elisabeth to be most like him but he has been more dismissive of her attempts to take the throne saying at one point she’d have to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company. In 2000 she left the family business and went on to found Shine one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies with shows like “The Biggest Loser” “Master Chef” and “History Cold Case.”

When News Corporation acquired Shine in 2011 Elisabeth attempted to take a seat on the News Corporation board but scrutiny over the phone hacking scandal prevented that from happening. She left Shine after a merger with two other production companies. In 2019 she established a new production company Sister and in 2021 Sister funded the opening of a London branch of Ghetto Film School a non-profit program geared toward introducing young people of color to the entertainment industry.

Wives

Patricia Booker

Rupert Murdoch and his first wife Patricia Booker a former department store model and flight attendant married in 1956. She gave birth to his first child a daughter named Prudence two years later. The marriage lasted 11 years; they divorced in 1967.

Anna Murdoch

Rupert met Anna Torv at his newspaper The Daily Mirror in Sydney where she was working as a reporter. A few months after his divorce from Patricia Rupert and Anna married. They had three children together Elisabeth Lachlan and James now the main contenders to be heir of the Murdoch empire. Over the years Anna published several novels one of which featured a family that bore a striking resemblance to her own. She spent three decades raising their family and acting as Rupert’s loyal partner on the world stage. In the mid-1990’s as Rupert approached conventional retirement age Anna hoped his relentless drive to build the empire would subside and he’d spend more time with her enjoying their golden years. Rupert was completely opposed to that idea. The disagreement led to an irreconcilable rift and the two divorced in 1999 after 31 years of marriage.

Wendi Deng

Deng 53 Rupert Murdoch’s third wife is mother of his two youngest children Grace Murdoch 20 and Chloe Murdoch 18. Wendi met Rupert when she was working at his Star TV network in Hong Kong. The up-and-comer immediately charmed the media mogul; one former colleague said “She was always someone who was going to do well. We just didn’t realize how well.” They married in June 1999 two years after meeting and only 17 days after Rupert’s divorce with his second wife Anna was finalized. Wendi grew to be one of Rupert’s closest advisers and confidantes but his older children opposed the marriage and viewed Wendi as a potential competitor for control of the Murdoch empire. But after 14 years the marriage fell apart amid allegations of Wendi’s infidelity on which she has declined to comment.

Jerry Hall

Former supermodel and ex-girlfriend of rock star Mick Jagger Jerry Hall married Rupert Murdoch in 2016 when she was 59 and he was 85. The grown Murdoch children genuinely like Jerry and approved of the union very different circumstances from his marriage to Wendi Deng. The London wedding was a joyful family affair and presented a rare moment of solidarity among the Murdoch clan. In August – 6 years after tying the knot – it was reported that Hall and Murdoch finalized their divorce.

Prudence Macleod is Rupert’s oldest child from his first marriage to Patricia Booker. Prudence never showed much of an interest in running the family business so she has largely stayed out of the succession battle that has ensnared her siblings Elisabeth Lachlan and James. She has held different positions at News Corporation throughout her career and currently sits on the board of Times Newspapers Ltd. She also has a voting share in the Murdoch family trust.

Anderson School Corporation made the decision to review the mascot after amid criticism to a viral TikTok video showing a high school basketball game ritual where two students dress up as an Indian chief and maiden doing a ceremony performance with a pipe and dance according to Fox 59.

Sarah Holba took the video prior to the basketball game and said that while she was disappointed it wasn't surprising.

""It was disappointing but not surprising that it was happening"" Holba said.

More than 700000 people have watched the TikTok video so far and the post has received more than 150000 comments.

Holba said that when she asked how long this tradition has been going on others told her it has been going on for a long time.

""The Anderson student section got really into it. You had the pep band playing"" Holba said. ""I asked some people around me who said ‘oh Anderson has been doing this forever.'""

In response according to the report the Anderson School Corporation Superintendent said that the pre-game ritual is being suspended and said that an internal committee has been formed to review the mascot's usage throughout the system. It will also seek input from leaders from the Native American community before arriving at a decision.

""We’re taking this very seriously"" Superintendent Joseph Cronk said. ""You know it’s always our intent to honor our Native American tradition and maybe that was ignorant. Maybe we don’t know what we’re honoring. Maybe we’re not honoring at all.""

The Anderson School Corporation used the mascot with the blessing of Chief William Anderson's ancestors according to Cronk.

Rachel Thunder director of the Indiana and Kentucky Chapter of the American Indian Movement told the news outlet that the tradition incites a dangerous environment.

""It really incites an environment that is hostile that is dangerous and damaging"" Thunder said.

She provides straight-ahead coverage of the Supreme Court her beat at the channel and has a nightly newscast airing at midnight on the East Coast.

Bream is never in the line of fire when media critics cite the network for the provocative stances and right-wing rhetoric dispensed on its prime-time opinion shows. But even with a lower profile she has become a best-selling author capturing two slots on the New York Times list of best-selling advice how-to and miscellaneous books for the week ending April 2: Her new release ""The Mothers and Daughters of the Bible Speak"" ranked at No. 2 its forerunner ""The Women of the Bible Speak"" at No. 10.

Both books analyze the stories of female Biblical characters in a conversational style that acknowledges their flaws and shows how faith guided them through crises. Rick Lewis who owns Logos Bookstore in Dallas said many of his customers who purchased Bream's first effort picked up additional copies for a daughter mother or friend.

""I think some people may be intimidated and don't want to pick up the Bible and start reading Genesis or Exodus"" Bream said in a recent interview. ""But these are beautiful and compelling stories and I feel like if we can put them in this format where people get to know and understand these characters and say 'I can relate to what that woman is going through' — it makes them feel less alone.""

Bream's book is the fourth straight title from Fox News Books — an imprint at parent company Fox Corp.'s publishing conglomerate HarperCollins — to hit the bestseller list. Launched in 2020 the outfit offers its books the full promotional clout of the most-watched cable news channel. Its four releases have totaled more than 1 million copies in under two years according to the company.

The imprint is part of a companywide effort to expand Fox News beyond the realm of news and political talk which can be a turnoff to some advertisers. Fox News Media Chief Executive Suzanne Scott and her bosses at parent Fox Corp. have said they want the division — which accounts for around 80% of the company's profits — to be a lifestyle and entertainment brand that appeals to politically right-of-center Americans.

""Transcending news is what this is about"" said Jason Klarman executive vice president for marketing at Fox News. ""Our audience is looking for us to curate other things for them besides the news and opinion of the day. We're using Fox Nation and this imprint to explore that.""

Such a transformation will be a tall order. While provocative hosts such as Tucker Carlson bring the channel its largest ratings dominating the competition from NBCUniversal's MSNBC and Warner Bros. Discovery's CNN they are polarizing. Fox News hosts' commentary on the insurrection and amplification of former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was rigged were factors when its longtime Washington anchor Chris Wallace decided to bolt the channel last year to join CNN's streaming service.

For the record CNN pulled the plug on CNN Plus on Thursday citing poor subscriptions in its first three weeks as the reason.

Fox News meanwhile captures more than half of the audience watching cable news. While it has long been a safe space for Republicans Nielsen data show the channel reaches a substantial number of viewers who identify themselves as Democrats and independents.

In the month before Bream's book was released the author did segments about it on her nightly program and others across the network such as the ""The Five"" which averages more than 3 million viewers a day. Based on Nielsen data the segments reached 22 million viewers at no cost to the publisher. There were also plugs during the channel's commercial breaks on radio feeds and at FoxNews.com while paid marketing targeted church groups and faith-based media outlets.

""Shannon is getting the full support of the Fox marketing machine"" said Klarman.

Marissa Eigenbrood senior vice president of Smith Publicity a Cherry Hill New Jersey-based firm specializing in books said Bream's sales success with a title that delves into Scripture is a testament to Fox News' promotional muscle. ""There is a hungry market for stories that add faith and spirituality but it gets more limited when it moves into the Bible"" she said. ""They have really nailed it in knowing who their audience is.""

Media conglomerates using their TV networks to push books from their publishing divisions is nothing new. Big-name authors for Paramount Global's Simon & Schuster are often featured on the company's CBS News shows including ""60 Minutes"" which is still among the most-watched non-sports TV programs of the week.

But Fox News Books takes the process several steps further. The company's marketing department develops the book ideas matches them up with on-air talent who write them and then features the titles prominently across the network's programs. The imprint is distributed by HarperCollins' Broadside Books which specializes in titles aimed at conservative audiences.

Most of the channel's biggest stars including Carlson Sean Hannity and Greg Gutfeld have their own preexisting deals with other publishers and on-air talent is still free to pursue contracts with outside companies. But Fox News Books is promising in-house authors massive on-air support improving their chances of landing on the bestseller list.

In return Fox News reaps the financial rewards from sales and owns the copyrights to the titles which Fox uses to develop companion shows on its streaming service Fox Nation. The company has up to five titles in the pipeline through next year.

The channel has been consistent in understanding the traditional values held by much of its audience which also happens to buy a lot of nonfiction books. Fox News Books is trying to tap into that worldview with a focus on ""faith family and patriotism"" according to Klarman.

Marji Ross the former head of the conservative publishing house Regnery who serves as a consultant to Fox News Books said the channel's strong connection to its audience is a valuable tool for moving copies off the shelf.

""At Regnery we would often see authors could go on the 'Today' show and not sell as many books as they did when going on a show where the audience trusted and really paid attention to what the host and network is saying"" Ross said. ""The Fox News audience feels respected and appreciated and don't feel like their values are being mocked or criticized or ignored.""

The imprint — which plans four books this year and another four in 2023 — is following the model of Fox Nation the streaming service launched in 2018 that has attracted than 1 million paying subscribers according to analyst estimates with nonfiction programming and films that share a distinctly non-woke perspective.

Fox Nation does stream programs aimed at the Trump-supporting diehards — most notably a widely criticized Carlson-produced documentary that suggested the FBI instigated the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. The service still carries an independently produced series from Lara Logan even though she no longer appears as a guest on Fox News after comparing Dr. Anthony Fauci to Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele.

But most Fox Nation shows are positive celebratory looks at American life. It recently added a special hosted program by Kathie Lee Gifford called ""The Jesus I Know"" in which she interviews other show business types about their Christian beliefs. The company recently signed Kevin Costner to host a four-part documentary series on the 150th anniversary of Yellowstone Park.

It was the Fox Nation series ""Modern Warriors"" that launched Fox News in the book publishing business. Featuring first-person accounts by U.S. war veterans the program was adapted into a book by Pete Hesgeth who served in Iraq and is co-host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend.""

The imprint followed up with a collection of Christmas stories from another ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy and her husband Sean Duffy a former Republican congressman and frequent contributor on the channel.

The book ""All American Christmas"" gathered recipes and holiday traditions from the Duffys and other Fox News personalities — all of whom discussed their contributions on the air. It sold more than 200000 copies.

Bream has already blown through that number with her first Bible-related book which finished 2021 as BookScan's 10th bestselling title with more than 500000 copies sold. The sequel sold more than 56000 in its first week.

Bream is a graduate of Liberty University an Evangelical school and has always been upfront about her Christianity leading Fox News Books to come to her with the idea of writing a faith-based book.

""It was such a smart move knowing that so many people in our audience are very faithful people and this is sort of a gift to them in a way"" said Bream. ""I'm just glad to be sort of the vessel and the messenger for it.""

Klarman said Fox News Books is not depending on bulk purchases by special interest groups or institutions which are frequently used to drive the sales of conservative political books. (While Fox News Books has stayed away from politics titles so far Klarman does not rule publishing them out in the future.)

Fox News did purchase around 10% of its books to offer as premiums to attract Fox Nation subscribers. But that will not be the case with Bream's sequel which has already generated enough sales for the imprint to plan a third Bible related title.

Crowds at Bream's live book appearances have been the largest in places where Fox News is extremely popular — the South Texas and the Florida retirement community known as The Villages. But Bream has also found fans during promotional visits in the deep blue state of California.

""I find it hilarious that people will sort of pull me aside and say almost in a whisper 'Hey we watch you every night' "" Bream said. ""I'm like 'it's OK you don't have to whisper.'

However there’s a quaint town tourists would be well advised to make a pit stop at called Bagdad in central Arizona.

Bagdad doesn’t get the same acclaim as some of the other cities in the state but it epitomizes the spirit of a blue collar town whose residents have established a strong commercial foundation in.

The area not only provides beautiful weather year-round but an educational opportunity for curious travelers to broaden their horizons.

History

While the first copper claims in Bagdad were made in 1886 the profitability and effectiveness of the mining did not start to take root until the 1920’s. There were a few different major players who took a stab at mining them for its plentiful supply.

The Arizona-Bagdad Company attempted to go with a leaching solution which essentially entails pouring chemicals into the mine to help extract only the desired minerals from the sediment. The uncertainty of the experiment plus a lack of funding ended up short-circuiting the project’s success.

The Bagdad Copper corporation had a longer run than its predecessor but got off to a slow start in its efforts to top what the Arizona-Bagdad Company had done.

Bagdad Copper took over in 1927 not too much before the stock market crash and eventual Great Depression and had to make difficult business decisions.

They dialed back their efforts in the 1930’s and made a profit of just over a thousand dollars which was not quite what they had hoped for.

In the mid 1940’s a breakthrough in methodology was made that allowed the process to become much more effective.

Open pit mining was introduced and a conveyor belt of sorts was used to transfer ore from the pits to the mill once the former had been crushed sufficiently.

Bagadad’s Claim To Fame

Freeport McMoRan is one of the most accomplished mining companies in the world. They’re based in Phoenix but have a prevalent presence in Bagdad. The area also has an extraction solution that has been in operation since 1970 which is one of the longest running in the country. The Bagdad mine is the third largest in the country and plans to operate until the year 2101.

At its fully functioning peak the ore could produce around 250 million pounds of copper. According to prior reports Freeport McMoRan employed about 900 people in Bagdad for its operation in 2017.

Where exactly is Bagdad Arizona?

The town of Bagdad Arizona can be found in Yavapai County. It is about an hour away from the Prescott National Forest which has 100000 acres of beauty to behold. Bagdad is just over a two hour drive from Phoenix and nearly four hours from Tucson. It is around a six hour car ride to Los Angeles. Bagdad is most closely situated to the US-93 N highway for driving purposes. The city also has a publicly owned airport.

Why is it called Bagdad?

Many individuals might hear the name of the charming Arizona town and associate it with the city in Iraq. It’s an understandable surface-level connection to make but Bagdad Arizona does not have any affiliation with its counterpart(spelled with an additional “h”) in Asia.

The town got its name from a copper claim that was made in 1882. The claimants W.J Pace and J.M Murphy discovered the valuable minerals in the area at that time.

There’s also a legend that a father and son were one of the first to mine the land and that the little man would ask his Dad for a bag to fill with ore(saying “bag Dad?”) as another possible origin of the town’s name.

Bagdad’s Population and Real Estate Information

According to its website the community has around 2500 homes. Projections of the United States census has the population of Bagdad at slightly under 2000 residents.

The town administration provides a rental rate table on its website that lends itself as extremely affordable. For example a studio is priced at $225 per month while a 2008 4 x 2 1900 square foot townsite is priced at $545 per month.

There is a relatively extensive housing waitlist provided on the website as well with pending applications dating back to March 2021. It would seem like this is the primary avenue to become a resident of the town as a Zillow search does not return any homes for sale or rent in Bagdad.

Recreational Tips For Bagdad Arizona

While lessons about American history are certainly enriching a well rounded vacation also includes sampling the local cuisine and relaxing in a manner that may not be available to travelers at home.

Copper Country Bar and Grill is a notable eatery in Bagdad. Their website has a very catchy phrase appropriate for its location; “food worth mining for.”

It has a variety of sandwich burger and entrée options and offers tasty appetizers and side dishes as well. It has actually been a staple of the town for over 40 years with some starts and stops in between.

It opened in 1973 primarily as a place for mining contractors to unwind. However due to a dip in the value of copper in the 1980’s it had to reinvent itself on a few occasions to stay afloat.

From the mid 1980’s to the early 2000’s it exclusively served pizza. In 2006 it reopened as a steakhouse. By 2016 it was rebranded under new ownership and has shown itself to be as tough as the residents who frequent it for a good meal.

The Diner on Main is another establishment tourists might decide to stop into. It has a retro interior reminiscent of a diner from the 1950’s. Tourists would be well served visiting the Diner on Main for breakfast or lunch as information about its hours indicate that it closes at 2pm each day.

Of course it wouldn’t be a true vacation in Arizona without an opportunity to break out the golf clubs.

Regardless of what time of the year you visit Bagdad the Mesa View Golf Course is open weather permitting. The course is just over 30 years old and is a par 30 fittingly enough. A cart can be rented for $5 to get players to the next hole or they can bring their own cart. Be sure to schedule a tee-time in advance of arrival as they are required for all players.

The Bagdad Aquatic Center is another place for exercise-inclined visitors to stretch their legs and break a sweat. It has a plethora of available choices of pool related activities via inclusive classes.

Aqua biking Tai Chi water aerobics and an aqua walk are all available at the facility. They also offer a more well rounded “all in one” aqua fitness program as well.

The Bagdad community website features six churches which are pillars for support including but not limited to healthcare childcare food and clothing.

A few of these houses of worship include the Bagdad Southern Baptist Church the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints United Pentecostal Church and St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only are there several different kinds – from mini dash cams to front-and-rear options and even dash cam mirrors – there are a surprising array of features too including sensors parking modes and different video resolutions.

It's not surprising then that many buyers look to keep things simple with a mini dash cam. These are ideal if you don't have much space to play with and they also tend to be cheaper than their more fully-fledged counterparts. But what are the downsides and drawbacks of these smaller dash cams? And which are the best ones out there? We've put together this guide to help you decide.

What is a mini dash cam?

The mini dash cam is a smaller and more compact version of a standard in-car camera which takes up less space and is usually less obtrusive too. Some of the more conventional dash cam models can be rather bulky and aren’t always as appealing to drivers with confined cockpits to contend with. A mini dash cam is just the opposite.

While any dash cam must be mounted so that it doesn’t interfere with your driving or obstruct your view through the windshield the benefit of a mini dash cam means there’s even less to worry about.

Whichever model you choose they mount in the same way are larger dash cams usually using a self-adhesive pad or a suction mount. The smaller dimensions of a mini dash cam means they can also hide away neatly behind your rear-view mirror.

But there are naturally some downsides. From a lack of bundled accessories and features to the absence of a display you'll need to weigh up whether that added convenience is worth the limitations of mini dash cams.

What are the downsides of mini dash cams?

Most mini dash cams have enough features and power for the average driver but their smaller designs do bring some compromises. Overall there are three main drawbacks to be aware of.

Firstly there's the common lack of a rear screen. Some models do have one (like the Garmin Dash Cam 67W below) but the chances are it’ll be a little on the small side. Luckily this isn't an issue for most drivers as they won't need to review footage on the device itself. Instead there's invariably a companion app that offers the ability to view footage on your smartphone as well as set up the dash cam. This will likely prove to be a more enjoyable experience in the long run.

A bigger limitation of mini dash cams is often their video quality. Because their lenses have been shoehorned into a smaller space you may experience a degree of fisheye distortion from the resulting video footage. If the camera has a less impressive resolution (another common limitation of small dash cams) then this could combine with the distortion to make it harder to make out details in your videos.

Some mini dash cams like the Garmin Dash Cam 67W do have a small screen on the back. (Image credit: Future)

That said an HDR (High Dynamic Range) mode can help compensate in harsh daytime sunshine as can buying a cheap polarizing filter to cut out glare. Both of these are possible on mini dash cams and this can have as big an impact on image quality as resolution and lens quality. Ultimately the better quality the footage the greater the chance you'll be able to use it in an insurance claim.

A third drawback is usually a lack of features compared to larger dash cams. For example our top choice – the Garmin Mini Dash Cam Mini 2 – doesn't come with GPS (so can't track your vehicle's speed) a hard-wiring kit or even a microSD card. That said you can sync it with a Garmin dash cam that has GPS via the Drive app.

Not all mini dash cams lack GPS either – a good middle-ground option is the Garmin Dash Cam 67W which has 1440p video recording wide 180-degree field of view GPS and voice control as well as a 2-inch LCD screen. There are even lane departure and forward collision warnings too.

So if you’ve been looking at standard-sized dash cams and think they’re too big and bulky searching for a mini dash cam could be the way forwards. This is especially the case if you drive a sports car with a small windscreen area. As we've discovered there are a few compromises to be had in terms of performance and features but if space-saving is the main consideration then a mini dash cam makes perfect sense.

What are the best mini dash cams?

If you need a basic dash cam that just does the fundamentals and hides away discreetly behind your rear-view mirror then the Dash Cam Mini 2 is our current top choice.

It’s small with dimensions of just 3.1 x 2.9 x 5.3 cm and weighs in at just 35g. But it still comes with most of the features and functionality you’ll need for monitoring the road ahead. There’s a 140-degree field of view and the video quality while only 1080p resolution is very good for its size.

Voice control also comes as part of the package which is a nice bonus though GPS is missing. If you want the Dash Cam Mini 2 to record videos while you're parked it's also worth noting that you'll need an always-on 12V cable or Garmin's Constant Power Cable (which isn't included). But the Garmin Drive app which is very polished and this is an important part of the experience with mini dash cams.

Another slender dash cam worth investigating is the Thinkware F800 Pro. It's quite pricey but comes packed with clever features – and also offers a front-and-rear bundle which means you’ll be covered in case of a shunt from behind.

The feature set is strong with a stick-on low-profile design GPS tracking and good-quality HD footage. Wi-Fi connectivity means you can hook up your smartphone to the unit plus you get the benefit of a night mode for more effective recording after dark.

You’ll need to hard-wire the camera into your car if you want to make use of its neat Time Lapse Mode though which keeps a watchful eye on your car when you’re not in it overnight.

It isn't quite as compact as Garmin's Dash Cam Mini 2 but the 67W is still only about the size of a matchbox – and it offers a few more features for that higher price tag.

The main difference from Garmin's other compact dash cams is the wide 180-degree field of view (hence the 'W' in its name). This causes some fish-eye distortion but it's useful if you have a larger car or want a dash cam that can see right the way around the front of your vehicle.

The sensor's 1440p footage is crisp while an HDR (High Dynamic Range) function makes sure the footage remains high-quality even in tricky lighting conditions. That extra resolution over the Dash Cam Mini 2 can also be handy for punching into footage to pick out details like license plates.

Some features like the ability to check in your parked car remotely demand that the 67W is hard-wired into your car and connected to a Wi-Fi network. But if you want high-quality footage with a wide angle of view this a great mini dash cam.

CONCORD NH — New Hampshire Fish & Game Conservation Officers were notified of an emergency distress beacon activation through a Garmin device on Friday.

The report came in just after 11 a.m. from the International Emergency Response Coordination Center (IERCC) of an injured backcountry snowboarder in the Great Gulf in a ski run known as Turkey Shoot. The snowboarder identified as Patrick McQuaide 31 of Pelham had been on a solo trip when he fell and tumbled striking rocks according to conservation officers.

The incident was witnessed by another solo backcountry skier identified as John Dwyer 32 of Beverly Massachusetts who immediately skied down to where McQuaide had fallen. There was no cell phone coverage so Dwyer activated his emergency SOS switch on his Garmin device — which sent a message indicating that the McQuaide had suffered serious injuries and was unable to walk. Dwyer and another skier stayed with McQuaide until help arrived. Due to the extreme remoteness of the area and the reported serious nature of the injuries a call was made to the Army National Guard for the possibility of a helicopter rescue. The Guard was able to quickly assemble a crew and flew a Black Hawk helicopter north from Concord.

The Black Hawk helicopter arrived at 1:17 p.m. The pilots could hover the helicopter over the injured snowboarder and lower a medic directly onto the slope. The medic assessed McQuaide and with Dwyer's assistance placed him in a litter and hoisted him up into the helicopter. The total rescue took approximately 25 minutes and the helicopter then flew McQuaide to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon. The injuries and condition of the victim are unknown at this time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3Byb3ByaWV0YXJ5LXdlYXJhYmxlLWNoYXJnZXJzLTMxNTE1NjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We're sick of proprietary charging on smartwatches and fitness trackers,"C. Scott Brown / Android Authority

I’m a firm believer in the value of smartwatches and fitness trackers. They’ve helped me get fit and just last week I was able to use airplane boarding passes without always having to pull out paper copies or my phone. In daily life being able to check notifications or pause podcasts from my wrist is a time-saver not to mention better for keeping me engaged with friends and family.

If there’s something both believers and doubters of wearables can agree on though it’s that the charging situation is a mess. Nearly every device has a proprietary cable dock or puck. That includes the Galaxy Watch 4 every Fossil smartwatch every Apple Watch and every Fitbit. Often chargers aren’t compatible with different models from the same company let alone competitors which is a far cry from the world of phones.

It’s about time that wearable makers settle on a common standard for charging and there are a couple of major reasons why. Our picks: The best fitness trackers

Losing a proprietary charger is a serious problem

Many if not all of us have had a moment with our phone where we needed to top up but didn’t have our usual charging accessory handy. It tends not to be a big deal these days ― for Android owners USB-C cables are plentiful and the USB Power Delivery standard is ubiquitous so the hardest part is finding a port or outlet the latter requiring a matching AC adapter. People regularly share phone chargers with each other.

With wearables misplacing your charger can be a minor crisis. You can’t count on accessories for other devices as backup so there’s a real chance you’ll be stuck watching your device drain down to zero despite the fact that you depend on it for things like work travel fitness or just telling the time.

In the wearable world misplacing your charger can be a minor crisis.

I’m at the gym for a couple of hours every time I go and it’s rough whenever I’m forced to lift without my workout playlist or a way of tracking performance. On trips I’ve occasionally had to put my watch into low-power mode because I wasn’t sure when I’d be able to plug in my charging puck.

You can of course buy extra or replacement chargers but unless we’re talking about the Apple Watch good luck finding those in shops. It’s more likely you’ll have to buy them online and possibly direct from the manufacturer if not from a major retailer like Amazon. If you don’t plan ahead a wearable can run out of juice before a replacement charger arrives. See also: The best phone charging accessories

Proprietary chargers mean planned obsolescence

That brings us to the second problem which is the finite lifespan proprietary chargers impose.

Inevitably companies will stop making a given wearable as they move on to newer and better. They’ll provide legacy support for a while but on a long enough timeline they’re going to stop selling you charging gear if it’s not compatible with recent hardware. So no matter how much you still love your Fenix 3 Garmin doesn’t have you covered and even third-party accessory makers are going to lose interest eventually.

On a long enough timeline companies will stop selling you chargers if they're not compatible with recent hardware.

Effectively it’s planned obsolescence. It’s understandable ― businesses don’t have infinite resources ― but it can knock some products out of commission before they stop being useful. That’s troublesome considering that people tend not to upgrade watches or fitness trackers as often as they do phones.

A corollary of this approach is that most wearables lack niche accessories that make life easier like keyfob chargers or nightstand docks. Sure Samsung for instance sells wireless charging pads that work with the Galaxy Watch but that’s an exception that proves the rule. The luckiest people are Apple Watch owners but even they would probably benefit from more options if Apple (in a small miracle) deigned to support a universal standard.

What’s the answer?

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority Left to right: Garmin Fenix 7 Sapphire Solar Garmin Fenix 6 Pro

Assuming wearable makers ever try to go universal the answer won’t be integrated USB-C ports. There just isn’t enough internal space in most products given the need to cram a processor battery storage and sensors into something wrist-sized. Sometimes there isn’t enough external space either and there’s also the matter of keeping a device water- and dustproof.

Qi wireless would be ideal but wearables require smaller coils with less power than the chargers we use for devices like our phones. A phone-oriented Qi charger will struggle or fail to optimally power most wearables and vice versa. Trying to find a Qi-ready wearable is a challenge in its own right one exception being the HUAWEI Watch GT 2 Pro.

It is possible to build custom-sized Qi chargers but those only work efficiently with specific products unless other manufacturers adopt similarly-sized receiver and transmitter coils. The solution then probably involves industry leaders like Fitbit Fossil Garmin and Samsung getting together and deciding on a common Qi-based wearable format. You still wouldn’t be able to use your phone charger with your watch but you’d at least be able to wander into Best Buy or even a convenience store for a spare watch charger.

What are the prospects for universal charging?

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

There’s no sign that companies will settle on a standard anytime soon. Wearable form factors are constantly evolving and proprietary chargers support this evolution since makers don’t have to worry about a fixed design spec. In the case of chargers that are simply brand-specific they have the (profit) advantage of encouraging platform lock-in. If you’ve got one of those Samsung wireless pads for instance you’re probably going to stick with Galaxy Watches rather than buy a Fitbit.

There’s no reason to change in other words unless there’s some sort of pressure on profit margins. That could mean consumer backlash or a sign that switching to universal tech would improve profits by lowering parts costs.

Industries do sometimes adopt consumer-friendly standards in the hope of expanding the overall market. One of the best examples of this is Matter an upcoming smart home protocol. While only time will tell how well it solves compatibility and networking issues it is an acknowledgement that a rising tide floats all boats. We can only hope that the wearable industry is taking notes. Continue: The best fitness apps to get into shape and stay there

GPS could be better

Watch S1 is the latest Xiaomi smart timepiece. Retailing for $269 it looks gorgeous loosely resembling a traditionally styled watch. In this review I look at its design technical specs functionality value for money and more.

The company introduced the wearable in late March alongside a sporty lower-cost version of the same called Xiaomi Watch S1 Active. They both come with the exact same functionality but S1 is the more premium of the two.

Xiaomi also unveiled Buds 3T Pro at that same launch event. In my review I found them to be a pretty good sounding pair of earbuds. They provide a very comfortable wearing experience and excellent sound – a great option particularly if you own a Xiaomi branded smartphone.

Another wearable we are expecting will land soon is the Mi Band 7. Rumours are Xiaomi will be increasing the screen size of its flagship fitness band once again. Look for that one to drop in the weeks ahead most definitely by early June.

But what about Xiaomi’s latest timepiece? It is not just a looker. The device comes with all day blood oxygen more than 100 fitness modes dual-band GPS and more. It is Xiaomi’s answer to the likes of the Apple Watch Samsung Galaxy Watch and Fitbit high-end devices.

Can it compete against these established players? It’s been sitting on my wrist for the past 10 days. Here’s what I made of it.

The verdict

Xiaomi Watch S1 review: : Design & hardware

Classy masculine design beautifully crafted

High res AMOLED display – great visibility in or outdoors

Calfskin leather and flurooubber strap in the box

12 day battery life which can be extended

Premium look and feel – a masculine watch

Starting off with one of the highlights of Watch S1 – its looks. The device really is beautifully made and looks and feels very premium on the wrist. You could say this is a traditionally styled watch.

It is offered in black and silver 316L grade stainless steel frame options. The choice gets wider as far as straps with black brown and blue Calfskin leather strap variants. Because that type of material is not really suited for exercise Xiaomi has also tucked away in the box a dirt and sweat resistant fluororubber strap. I found myself quickly switching to this option as I found it had better contours around my wrist and was the more hassle-free solution.

Need to look the part for an important client meting or date? No problem. Switch it back to the leather variant. The process is easy thanks to the quick release mechanism so many brands are sporting these days. Move the small pin to the side and the strap goes in or out. It takes about a minute to do the swap. With a bit of practice you can probably cut down this time.

The diameter of the watch is 46.5 mm so this is a fairly sizeable device. Xiaomi puts its depth as 11 mm but in reality it is a millimetre or two thicker as that number doesn’t include local protrusions. I would definitely consider the watch as something more suited for men than a unisex device.

Having said that the weight is not too bad. At 52 grams it doesn’t really feel heavy on your wrist – particularly when you take into consideration its steel frame. But you definitely feel that it is there. It’s worth noting the back of the device is made of plastic which helps to keep the weight down.

Sometimes watches with a steel build move a bit on the wrist as they can be very heavy. That makes it difficult to capture precise stats particularly when you are exercising. I did not find this to be the case with Watch S1.

Stunning AMOLED display

The premium design continues as far as display. You get a very high resolution (466 x 466 pixels 326 PPI) 1.43 inch AMOLED. It is incredibly sharp crisp and clear regardless whether you are in or outdoors thanks to the 60Hz refresh rate. The visibility is also helped by the watch’s auto-brightness adjustment (up to 450 nits).

It is actually one of the best screens I have come across on a smartwatch. Its Sapphire Glass should protect against accidental drops and bumps. Xiaomi says this is one of the most durable watches it has ever made. For info Watch S1 Active uses normal tempered glass which is not as robust.

The Sapphire Glass also helps to protect against smudging. And it has the effect of slightly glittering from every angle which contributes to the overall premium look.

This is actually the same quality display that can be found on Watch Color 2. No huge bezel around but there definitely is one. However it is not an eye-sore as Xiaomi has disguised it well. You hardly even notice it.

The touch-functionality works great and the swipes and taps are very responsive. Zero lag time or glitchiness. Mind you the touch functionality works only when the display is on. And this is achieved by a raise of the wrist or by pushing one of the two physical buttons on the right. The top one takes you to the home page and a screen with shortcuts to all apps. The bottom one acts as a shortcut to the scrolling list of exercises. Both buttons rotate but it’s for show as the rotating doesn’t trigger any actual functionality.

Some of the screens have something akin to the complications you can find on the Apple Watch. Tap on that area of the display to be taken to further information. I also liked the page with all app shortcuts – again Xiaomi has taken a leaf out of the Apple Watch’s book.

All of this is of course stamped with a good water-resistance rating. At 5 ATM you can swim with it down to depths of 50 meters shower with it and run with it in heavy rain or a snow storm worry free.

All the usual suspects under the hood

As far as sensors you get all the usual suspects including PPG heart rate (which also spits out SpO2 data) 3-axis accelerometer 3-axis gyroscope geomagnetic sensor and air-pressure sensor. A complete list that doesn’t really have any glaring omissions.

The company says it has upgraded the hardware and algorithms which contributes to more accuracy. Blood oxygen is around the clock so you don’t need to rely on manual measurements. Sure you don’t get things such as ECG but you are covered with more than just the basics as far as monitoring health and activity.

For more precise tracking of outdoor activity the S1 comes with a dual-band multi-system GPS. In theory this allows for more accurate and faster positioning data. It means that depending on the quality of the signal the chip can tap into and automatically switch between GPS Glonass Galileo BDS and QZSS.

There’s also an ambient light sensor on-board along with a microphone speaker and NFC chip. Apart from that the watch has 5.2 Bluetooth compatibility and Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11b/g/n 2.4GHz.

Battery life

As with all Xiaomi wearables battery life does not disappoint. The watch has a massive 470mAh LiPo battery which allows for 12 days of autonomy and double that in battery saver mode.

I cannot vouch for this figure but it seems do-able. After about a week of wear my watch was down to around 30% at which point I decided to top it up. Which is a rather painless process as it took a little more than an hour to get it back to 100%.

If you’re running low and the charger is nowhere to be found choose power saving mode. This will disable all day heart rate and stress monitoring and some other functionality but it will provide you with 24 days of battery juice.

Of course there are things you can do that will impact the time between charges. One of these is enabling the always-on display. Unsurprisingly this will greatly shorten the battery life. You can also tweak some other options which have an impact.

Unlike Xiaomi Watch S1 Active which only uses a magnetic dock with 2 pin connections its more premium brother has proper Qi charging. So you get more charging options. Overall Watch S1 offers solid battery power.

Xiaomi Watch S1 review: Functionality

Fitness and health monitoring

Supports iOS and Android using Mi Fitness app

Fairly accurate tracking – resting heart rate on the high side

Blood oxygen measurements standing reminders work well

The iOS or Android Mi Fitness app is what you’ll need to download to set up and pair your new watch. This is also the repository of all the fitness and health info. The app feels rather bare bones and I’ve definitely come across better software. But it does the job.

As with most such apps you get a tile-like dashboard which can be customised. Tapping on any widget takes you through to more detailed info.

The general health-tracking features are quite solid. I found the stats to be on par with the Garmin watch on my other wrist.

Steps were within a few hundred on a daily basis sleep tracking was in a similar ballpark and you can also enable all-day stress tracking and all-day blood oxygen tracking for more insight. The last on this list typically averaged between 97% and 98% which is where I’d expect it to be. You can also do manual SpO2 readings.

The all-day heart rate also does a decent job. I found my resting heart rate values to be about 4-5 bpm higher than on the Garmin. But different brands use different algorithms to calculate this metric – it is not an exact science.

You also get info on standing time. Reminders to get up and move around will ping your wrist. If this gets too annoying like it has for me simply switch the functionality off.

I liked the stress metric which is based on heart rate variability measurements. You not only get a chart showing how this is changing throughout the day but you also get an overall daily value with a descriptive classification. This allows you to determine at a glance whether you should take a chill session. To help lower your readings there are guided breathing exercises on the watch that can be tapped into.

Overall I would give health and activity tracking a positive assessment. One area where the app lacks though is in terms of insights. You don’t really get many so are left on your own to draw conclusions. Some might like that others not so much.

Sports tracking

Support for hundreds of sports

Auto-recognition of activity

Heart rate during exercise is accurate

GPS could be better

Little in terms of advanced performance stats

Xiaomi Watch S1 is a comprehensive sports watch with support for a total of 117 different sports modes. Nineteen of these are professional modes with detailed performance statistics. The others you’ll find are not as detailed. They pretty much consist of heart rate derived statistics and workout duration.

The device also comes with auto-recognition for a number of exercises including treadmill outdoor running and walking. This works well. When it detects you are engaged in one of these activities a message will pop up on the S1 asking whether you would like to track it. If you say yes the watch includes retroactive data. So pretty much your full workout is captured.

As far as the satellite connectivity in theory this should be accurate and fast thanks to the dual-band multi-system GPS support. In reality I found that it was slower to connect than my high-end Garmin Forerunner. Sometimes a minute or two slower. To be fair there were times when it was just as quick. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that I was tracking in a heavily built-up area of London.

The GPS accuracy also left a bit to be desired. Here’s a comparison of a 5K run around a London block. As you can see the Garmin had me mostly running on roads whereas the Xiaomi cut corners in places. While neither of the devices was perfect the Garmin was better.

Xiaomi Watch S1 GPS map

Garmin Forerunner 935 GPS map

A glitch that I found was that for some reason the detailed map of my exercise activity did not show up in the smartphone app. I’m not sure why this was the case. Having looked at some of the other S1 reviews they do not mention this bug. So perhaps it was a glitch with my installation. But the device definitely was tracking with GPS as the map did show up when the activity was synched up to Strava. Probably a bug that will be rectified by a software update.

What I was very impressed with. was the accuracy of the heart rate monitor. Typically the average value was spot on as compared to a chest strap for a run lasting at least 5K. There was a slight discrepancy of one or two beats per minute as far as the max heart rate value which is perfectly acceptable.

Just make sure the strap of the watch is nice and tight against your wrist. I typically moved the strap up one notch when exercising then returned it to the looser setting afterwards.

Unfortunately you do not get much beyond the basics as far as run tracking. In the sense that you don’t get advanced performance data such as recovery and Firstbeat-type metrics. What you do get is time calories pace heart rat steps elevation gain and loss cadence and an overview of your heart zone information. Here’s an example.

Smart features

Watch S1 runs on a proprietary operating system especially designed for Xiaomi watches (MIUI Watch 1.0). This is not wearOS-based so you will not have the option to install third party apps. But on the bright side the operating system is slick and blazingly fast as it has been streamlined for the hardware.

The look and feel of the software on the watch appears as a blend of what you’d get on the Apple Watch and Amazfit watches. So not as fully featured as the Apple Watch but with more functionality than on Amazfit watches. You can pick from around 200 watch faces via the Xiaomi Wear app and the user-interface is customisable.

I’d classify the device as more of a fitness watch than a smartwatch. It has some nice elements such as smartphone notification support Bluetooth calls support alarms timers weather and camera shutter control. You can also use it as a flashlight and as a Alexa voice assistant. But features such as mobile payments do not work in all countries. You can only use MasterCard payment types through Xiaomi Pay.

Also there’s no built-in music storage but you are able to control smartphone playback. And you can only read smartphone notifications – you can’t respond to them. The same is the case for calls from your wrist. You can only receive them.

Xiaomi Watch S1 review: The verdict

Xiaomi Watch S1 presents itself as a solid performer if you are looking for a fitness watch. It might be a more attractive replacement for a Fitbit or Amazfit. But purely on the smartwatch front Apple and Samsung still have the edge. Xiaomi though is closing the gap.

There really is lots to like about what is now Xiaomi’s flagship watch. It offers a decent set of fitness and health tracking features at a price that is competitive. This is coupled with excellent battery life and a premium elegant minimalistic design. The high-res AMOLED touchscreen and sapphire glass help to make this a really gorgeous looking timepiece.

The negatives are the lack of advanced performance metrics GPS could be better the app is rather bare-bones and there’s limited smart functionality. So clearly the device has room for improvement.

(Gray News) - An Earnhardt will once again be behind the wheel of the No. 3 car for a NASCAR series race.

Richard Childress Racing announced earlier this week that Jeffrey Earnhardt the grandson of the late NASCAR Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt will be driving his grandfather’s No. 3 Chevrolet on April 23 for the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Talladega Superspeedway.

Jeffrey Earnhardt has competed in all three NASCAR national series. He has 135 Xfinity Series starts and owns a best finish of third-place with Joe Gibbs Racing at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 2019.

“It’s great to have an Earnhardt back in one of our cars” said Richard Childress chairman and CEO of RCR. “We think Jeffrey is a talented young driver and I’m confident he will run well at Talladega.”

Earnhardt 32 is a native of Mooresville N.C. and is eagerly anticipating his first start with RCR.

“What a dream come true” said Jeffrey Earnhardt said. “The chance to be behind the wheel of the No. 3 car for RCR that my pawpaw made famous has long been a dream of mine and now it’s finally happening.”

(Gray News) - Bird flu has been detected in Georgia bald eagles and it is affecting their nesting according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.

In a recent report officials with the DNR said samples from three bald eagles found dead in Chatham Glynn and Liberty counties came back positive for avian influenza or bird flu.

The department also reported that bird flu is likely undercutting nesting success for the eagles in Georgia’s coastal counties.

Officials said about a third of the eagle nests in Georgia are in the coastal counties. Annual aerial surveys of nesting bald eagles have revealed more failed nests than expected with nest success currently down about 30%.

Overall the department reports the bald eagle population in Georgia is strong and initial survey results of eagle nesting outside the coastal region look to be on par with previous years.

Avian influenza has been detected in wild birds in more than 30 states this year according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The viral disease is highly infectious untreatable and potentially lethal to infected animals. However the risk of transmission to people remains low.

Minnette who gained fame for his lead role in the Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why was performing “Pictures of Girls” with his band when he became aware of a member of the crowd in trouble.

“Real quick let’s stop” Minnette said as his band silenced their instruments. “Do we need a medic out here is there someone who needs help?”

The lead singer went on to direct medical professionals toward the person in need leading to cheers and applause from the crowd.

“I did not notice sooner sorry about that” Minnette apologised before advising festivalgoers to “stay hydrated stay cool as possible this weekend”. Temperatures at Coachella have been in the mid-low 30s this weekend.

Musicians have been on heightened alert about crowd safety since a deadly crowd surge during Travis Scott’s performance at the Astroworld festival in Houston last year left 10 people dead and scores more injured.

Among those who have made sure their fans are ok during concerts since the tragedy is Billie Eilish who will become the youngest Coachella headliner in history on Saturday (16 April).

The 20-year-old stopped in the middle of her performance at State Farm Arena in Atlanta in February this year after she noticed a fan having difficulty breathing. She told the crowd “I wait for people to be OK until I keep going” which some people including Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) took to be a dig at Scott.

Munson Healthcare Charlevoix Hospital is the first of four Munson Healthcare hospital sites to receive the new technology.

In addition to Charlevoix Munson Healthcare Cadillac Hospital Munson Healthcare Grayling Hospital and Munson Medical Center in Traverse City are scheduled to receive the devices over the next nine months.

""This project is the result of many years of strategic planning and budgeting"" said Branden Hill system director of radiology services. ""To see this project become a reality and to be able to offer this advanced technology across the system is an extraordinary accomplishment.

""The new technology will greatly improve our ability to quickly diagnose and appropriately treat patients thus improving outcomes and extending long term quality of life for patients.”

Longer term plans include additional CTs at Kalkaska Memorial Health Center Munson Healthcare Manistee Hospital Munson Healthcare Otsego Memorial Hospital and Munson Healthcare Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital.

The GE 256-Slice Revolution CT uses state-of-the-art technology customarily found at comprehensive stroke and heart centers. With this investment patients and providers will have access to advanced life-saving technology at all Munson Healthcare hospitals.

The new CT scanners provide the following:

• Fast and efficient scanning of whole-body images within seconds greatly reducing the time of the scan.

• The lowest possible radiation exposure while acquiring superior images to deliver accurate diagnosis.

• Early identification of active strokes using local technology; previously only available at Munson Medical Center.

• Non-invasive coronary artery imaging with CT angiography available locally.

• Cardiac exams in a single heartbeat without beta blockers.

• Brain perfusion and angiography for stroke protocols.

• Whole brain imaging in less than a second.

• Detailed bone imaging even for patient with metal implants.

• Advanced pulmonary embolism studies.

• A quieter experience due to innovative engineering and can accommodate up to 675-pound person.

• Rapid trauma assessment.

The installation project at Charlevoix is complete and the unit began operations this week. Work will begin at Grayling in mid-April with completion set for the end of June. Munson Medical Center should see delivery of their two units in August and October followed by Cadillac.

With the exception of the Cadillac location mobile CT units will be in place during the two-month installation periods. Use of the mobile units enables CT services to continue uninterrupted during construction so patients may continue to seek convenient care locally.

Munson Healthcare advises patients and visitors to be aware of parking restrictions and constructions vehicles and crews during the installation phase of this project.

The Tribunal decided that it doesn’t. On another point of dispute related to allotment of shares the Tribunal also held the foreign investors to be in contempt of the court.

The case was a dispute between Dr Ravindranath Kancherla promoter of Ravindranath GE Medical Associates (RGE) which operates a hospital chain under the ‘Global Hospitals’ brand and IHH Healthcare Berhad of Malaysia which also offers healthcare services under various brands including Parkway and Gleneagles. It may be remembered that IHH had acquired Fortis hospitals of India in 2018.

In 2015 IHH Parkway picked up 74.76 per cent stake in Global Hospitals (ie. RGE). According to papers filed in the courts by Dr Kancherla the Indian promoter was not happy with the way Global Hospitals was run by IHH Parkway. Revenues fell from ₹1726 crore in June 2019 to ₹927 crore in June 2020. Dr Kancherla believed that IHH was more interested in its other brands in India to the detriment of Global Hospitals and even alleged “poaching” of doctors. In the meantime Global Hospitals need to raise money via a rights issue. Dr Kancherla believed that IHH Parkway proceeded to allot themselves the unsubscribed portion of the right issue despite a court order against it.

On both counts Dr Kancherla has won victories.

IHH Parkway argued that the dispute should never have come to NCLT in the first place because there was an arbitration clause in the Investment Agreement—any dispute should have been referred to an international arbitrator in Singapore.

The other side argued that the ‘oppression and mismanagement’ issue lay outside the purview of the arbitration clause. They said that the case was one of “violation of minority shareholder rights as conferred by the Articles of Association; management affairs cannot be settled by arbitration.”

The NCLT Bench comprising Justice S Ramathilagam and expert member B Anil Kumar noted that the “neither the Memorandum of Association nor the Articles (of Association) contemplate for an arbitration clause;” only the investment agreement does.

Tellingly the NCLT observed: “It is reiterated that in relation to issues pertaining to ‘oppression and mismanagement’ only the NCLT has the exclusive jurisdiction to hear the dispute and the said power is conferred by the statute and the law of the land (emphasis added).”

It further said “The jurisdiction of the Companies Act 2013 being supreme cannot be ousted by any agreement or arbitration clause.”

Allotment of unsubscribed shares

On the issue of IHH allotting to itself the unsubscribed portion of the rights issue it is seen that the NCLT had on November 10 2020 stayed such allotment till November 22 2020 on the understanding that the case would be heard by the Tribunal on November 23 2020. The order used the words “till this bench takes up the interim applications for hearing” and ordered the case to be listed for hearing on November 23.

However due to the pandemic the hearing could not take place.

IHH Parkway took a narrow view of the order and allotted itself the shares on November 23 thereby raising its stake in the company. Dr Kancherla sued for contempt.

It is evident from the Tribunal’s order that it was distinctly unhappy with IHH Parkway. It said: “If the respondents (IHH Parkway) were fair and law-abiding persons they would have approached this Tribunal by way of an application seeking early hearing of the matter.”

IHH Parkway it said acted in a manner contrary to the order of this Tribunal and prejudicial to the interests of justice.” It ordered the respondents to deposit ₹25000 to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund.",,,,,,

Clocked 300MHz above the base part it’s a halo product that looks to squeeze the most out of Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake architecture.

Intel has skipped these special edition CPUs for a few generations and the Core i9-12900KS isn’t a great return to form. It’s a problematic CPU with high thermal and power demands and in many cases it doesn’t offer a benefit over the base model.

I’ll cover everything from specs to benchmarks here but make sure to read our Intel Core i9-12900KS review and Intel Core i9-12900K review for a full breakdown and for why we rank the latter chip among the best CPUs you can buy.

Specs

Core i9-12900KS Core i9-12900K Cores 16 (8 P-cores 8 E-cores) 16 (8 P-cores 8 E-cores) Threads 24 24 Base frequency 3.4GHz (P-cores) 2.5GHz (E-cores) 3.2GHz (P-cores) 2.4GHz (E-cores) Max turbo frequency (single-core) 5.5GHz 5.2GHz Max turbo frequency (all cores) 5.2GHz (P-cores) 4GHz (E-cores) 5.1GHz (P-cores) 3.9GHz (E-cores) Manufacturing process Intel 7 Intel 7 Integrated graphics Intel UHD Graphics 770 Intel UHD Graphics 770 Memory support Up to DDR5-4800 DDR4-3200 Up to DDR5-4800 DDR4-3200 Intel Smart Cache 30MB 30MB Base power 150W 125W Max turbo power 241W 241W

Pricing and availability

Intel launched the Core i9-12900K in November 2021 for a list price of around $589. The Core i9-12900KS arrived in April 2022 for a significantly higher price of $739. Those may be the prices listed by Intel but there’s a big difference with what you’ll actually pay.

The Core i9-12900K runs between $600 and $620 while the Core i9-12900KS sells near $800. There’s a range of prices but you can expect to pay anywhere from $150 to $200 more for the KS model.

It’s important to remember that the Core i9-12900KS is newer so it’s still selling for around $800. I expect it will become much cheaper over the coming months though. At the time of writing I found one in stock for $780 with a $30 rebate — and that’s less than two weeks after the CPU launched.

Performance

I ran the Core i9-12900KS and Core i9-12900K through a suite of benchmarks to see how they hold up. All of our tests were run on an open-air test bench with an RTX 3090 graphics card and 32GB of DDR5-6400 memory. I selected only the most important benchmarks here so make sure to read our full reviews (linked above) for the full results.

Starting with two CPU-focused benchmarks you can see how little of a difference there is between the Core i9-12900KS and Core i9-12900K. In both Cinebench R23 and Geekbench 5 the single-core results are so close that they barely register on the graph. The Core i9-12900KS enjoys a slight 5% uplift in Cinebench which you can easily make up with overclocking.

The differences in our multi-core results are even closer but they favor the cheaper Core i9-12900K. In Cinebench the cheaper part managed nearly a 4% lead. Still raw CPU performance is largely the same between the two chips.

Real applications show a clearer difference. In creative apps like Adobe Premiere Pro and Photoshop the Core i9-12900KS is quite a bit faster than its counterpart. It enjoys nearly a 5% increase in Premiere Pro while maintaining a massive 12% lead in Photoshop. Those are impressive gains but it’s important to remember that they don’t apply across all applications.

Gaming is a prime example of that. My testing revealed only a 2.2% difference between the Core i9-12900K and Core i9-12900KS in games at 1080p. That difference actually favors the Core i9-12900K with it putting up higher frame rates in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla while barely lagging behind in Forza Horizon 4.

The only gaming benchmark the Core i9-12900KS clearly won was 3D Mark Time Spy but even then it was only a measly 1% faster. If you’re concerned with gaming something like AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800X3D is your best option right now.

Thermals and power draw

Both the Core i9-12900K and Core i9-12900KS have high thermal and power limits. The faster KS model is just hotter and more power-hungry thanks to its 300MHz boost.

During a stress test the Core i9-12900K peaked at 84 degrees Celsius while the Core i9-12900KS climbed all the way to 101 degrees. I actually had the Core i9-12900KS under a 360mm all-in-one liquid cooler — I used a 240mm for the Core i9-12900K — which illustrates how much hotter this special edition chip is.

The Core i9-12900KS is hotter and it draws more power. Both chips have a rated wattage of 241W but the Core i9-12900KS peaked at 274W during the stress test — and that was with Intel’s power limits enabled. The Core i9-12900K on the other hand drew 210W of power. Removing the limits the Core i9-12900K climbed near 300W largely matching the special edition with power and thermals.

The Core i9-12900KS is basically an overclocked Core i9-12900K and that shows up with increased power draw and thermals. It also means the Core i9-12900KS has less overclocking headroom unless you elect for elaborate custom liquid cooling or extreme LN2 overclocking.

Save your money

The Core i9-12900KS isn’t worth the extra $200. Although Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake architecture has been a revolution for Team Blue the Core i9-12900KS is the worst showcase of it. It offers peak performance but those margins are thin and they come with massive thermal and power concerns.

On the other hand the Core i9-12900K is a remarkable processor. It’s cheaper than the best AMD has to offer right now while offering much better performance. And with a little CPU overclocking it can even put the Core i9-12900KS back in its place.

Some days ago CD Projekt Red announced the delay of the highly-anticipated next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. As expected this announcement had some believing that development on the update isn't going as planned. Luckily for the fans as confirmed by the developer this isn't the case at all.

""I've been looking at the headlines that popped up here and over the Internet and I've seen one that really drew my attention which is The Witcher 3 next-gen delayed indefinitely which sounds like the game is in some sort of development hell"" VP of Business Development and Board Member Michał Nowakowski said during an earnings call. ""I want to say this is not the fact.""

So while we're still eagerly waiting for the next-gen patch for the game YouTuber 'Digital Dreams' released a new next-gen The Witcher 3 showcase in 8K and plenty of mods. Needless to say this stunning showcase has us thirsting for the next-gen update even more although we're pretty sure that it won't look as good as this heavily-modded version of the title. Check out the new video down below:

Photo Credit: ABC Craig Sjodin

On April 17 actress Inga Cadranel (“General Hospital”) was featured in Maurice Benard’s MB “State of Mind” podcast on mental health.

Cadranel is known for her portrayal of Harmony Miller on the hit ABC soap opera “General Hospital.”

In addition Cadranel has had recurring roles in “Lost Girl” “Orphan Black” and “The Strain.”

Cadranel opens up to three-time Emmy winner Maurice Benard about growing up in Toronto Canada as well as her immigrant parents (an Icelandic mother and Spanish/Egyptian father) who were both artists.

They talk about her friend group on the co-op and her need to leave in order to spread her wings. They both share a little bit about their journeys which include “anxiety issues” and caring about what other people think; moreover they concur that people go through these things in their lives to only come out stronger on the other side.

These days she acknowledged that she is a whole new person than when she first started out in the business. “I’m more calm steady I love going to work” she admitted.

Benard reassured her that it is quite liberating when you stop caring about what other people think. “That was my problem my whole life” Benard said.

Their entire informed conversation may be heard below.

Between the Mass Effect Legendary Edition and the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition plenty of era-defining classics have recently undergone the remaster or remake treatment. In the ongoing race for photo-realistic graphics even relatively recent games are eligible for a facelift - if rumours of a The Last of Us remake prove to be true.

There’s one major franchise that yet seems to have associated itself with this trend: Assassin’s Creed. Developed by Ubisoft Montreal Assassin’s Creed was launched as an open-world action-adventure stealth title in 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Whilst the latest instalment Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla is undoubtedly a great game it’s Altaïr’s trails through the Holy Land that triggers true nostalgia.

Itching for more Assassin's Creed content? We did a deep dive into the series' latest expansion Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok.

Given how popular remasters are it’s surprising that Assassin's Creed is yet to receive an overhaul but a new mod has now shown us what an updated Assassin's Creed could look like and cor blimey … it’s good.

Advert

The remaster is the work of YouTuber and digital artist Digital Dreams who adjusted the game’s textures and shading to offer a glimpse as to what Assassin's Creed could look like with 8K visuals and the difference is huge. Side by side visuals prove that without a nostalgia-lens Assassin’s Creed was an underwhelmingly dull looking game aesthetically.

As this mod exclusively singles out Assasin’s Creeds’ visuals the eight-minute demo includes some clunky animations present in the original game but Digital Dreams’ work is just a teaser of what we could expect from a full remaster. Personally I’d love to see Assassin's Creed get the full remake treatment as the gameplay itself would certainly benefit from an overhaul but for now I’ll watch this remaster on repeat and dream.

Morocco is looking at options to replace its ageing armoured vehicle fleet including VAB armoured vehicles manufactured by French Arquus.

Rabat land forces have over the years relied heavily on the VAB 6×6 armoured vehicles which entered service in the late 1970s.

Around last decade Morocco began an initiative to expand the capability of its various military sectors this increasingly showed its commitment to developing its armed forces as part of a 2030 Modernization Plan.

The effort relies on and emphasises the growth of the domestic defence sector to safeguard its security. In this regard Morocco’s defence budget for 2022 will increase by almost 5% from the previous year (now estimated to reach $6.5 billion).

Morocco operates around 400 75 VAB VCI and 320 VAB VTT armoured vehicles they had been modernised and upgraded locally under the name “ifrane.

The VAB VTT (Véhicule Transport de Troupe) is a 4×4 APC version capable of carrying a crew of two and ten passengers and standard pintle mount for various compatible machine guns while the VAB VCI (Véhicule de Combat de l’Infanterie) is a 6×6 IFV version equipped with a turret mounted 20 mm gun for fire support missions.

For the new acquisition of next-generation armored personnel carriers will enhance its land defense capabilities and several defense companies were approached including American General Dynamics’ and French Nexter.

Nexter reportedly intends to offer its VBCI infantry fighting vehicle. The VBCI (French denomination of “Véhicule Blindé de Combat d’Infanterie)”) is a wheeled armoured infantry fighting vehicle designed and manufactured by the French Companies Nexter Systems and Renault Trucks Defense.

Around one hundred vehicles are being produced annually for France but the assembly line could deliver at a significantly higher rate to meet any possible export requirements. Says Nexter.

On the other hand General Dynamics may be asked to supply it’s Light Armoured Vehicle (LAV) series of armoured vehicles which is a license-produced version of the Mowag Piranha.

Morocco appears to be more interested in the Stryker version if the LAV III which strikes a balance between heavy armor and infantry. General Dynamics is leveraging of it’s earlier business dealings with Morocco to supply the Stryker armoured vehicles.

General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) in 2020 was awarded a contract to upgrade 127 of Morocco’s M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks to the M1A1SA “Special Armor” configuration.

In any case Morocco still has eyes for Arquus vehicles particularly the new VAB MK3 6×6 due to its commonality and ease of transition with previously owned Arquus armoured vehicles.

In 2020 Morocco confirms its plan to acquire ARQUUS VAB Mk 3 6×6 armored vehicles as part of a larger order which includes French-made surface-to-air defense systems Mistral and VL Mica from MBDA 155mm self-propelled howitzers CAESAR from Nexter.

The VAB Mk 3 is the latest iteration of the family of wheeled armored vehicles. It was unveiled in June 2012 during the international defense exhibition that was held in Paris France.

According to Arquus the VAB Mk 3 is not just a simple upgrade of the previous VAB but a new vehicle design that is fully adapted to new threats on the battlefield such as IEDs and mine blast. It has more firepower mobility and protection.

Although the layout of the VAB MK3 is similar to the standard version of the VAB with the engine at the front the crew compartment in the middle and the troop’s area at the rear but it features a new modular design and monocoque hull structure.

Owing to its modular nature the vehicle can be easily configured as an armored personnel carrier (APC) infantry combat vehicle (ICV) command post (CP) ambulance 120mm mortar carrier and ISTAR (intelligence surveillance and targeting).

The VAB Mark 3 is equipped with new armor which provides protection for the crew and the soldiers Level 4 STANAG 4569 against ballistic threats up to 14.5×114mm AP (Armor Piercing) bullets. The VAB Mark 3 provides also a mine/IED (Improvised Explosive Devices) protection up to Level of a MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicle. The vehicle can carry 3 crew members and 7 infantry soldiers.

Arquus has earlier carried out several business with the Moroccan military like the supply of 36 (formerly Renault Trucks Defence) Sherpa light scout 4×4 armoured vehicles for use by its special forces.

Arquus also supplied 300 units of its Véhicule de Liaison de Reconnaissance et d’Appui / Liaison Reconnaissance and Support Vehicle (VLRA 2) 4×4 light tactical vehicles to the Royal Moroccan Army for it’s logistics component.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcXVpbmN5aW5zdC5vcmcvMjAyMi8wNC8xNy9ob3ctcGVudGFnb24tY29udHJhY3RvcnMtYXJlLWNhc2hpbmctaW4tb24tdGhlLXVrcmFpbmUtY3Jpc2lzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Pentagon Contractors Are Cashing in on the Ukraine Crisis,"Co-authored by Julia Gledhill

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought immense suffering to the people of that land while sparking calls for increased military spending in both the United States and Europe. Though that war may prove to be a tragedy for the world one group is already benefiting from it: U.S. arms contractors.

Even before hostilities broke out the CEOs of major weapons firms were talking about how tensions in Europe could pad their profits. In a January 2022 call with his company’s investors Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes typically bragged that the prospect of conflict in Eastern Europe and other global hot spots would be good for business adding that “we are seeing I would say opportunities for international sales… [T]he tensions in Eastern Europe the tensions in the South China Sea all of those things are putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there. So I fully expect we’re going to see some benefit from it.”

In late March in an interview with the Harvard Business Review after the war in Ukraine had begun Hayes defended the way his company would profit from that conflict:

“So I make no apology for that. I think again recognizing we are there to defend democracy and the fact is eventually we will see some benefit in the business over time. Everything that’s being shipped into Ukraine today of course is coming out of stockpiles either at DoD [the Department of Defense] or from our NATO allies and that’s all great news. Eventually we’ll have to replenish it and we will see a benefit to the business over the next coming years.”

Arms to Ukraine profits to contractors

The war in Ukraine will indeed be a bonanza for the likes of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. First of all there will be the contracts to resupply weapons like Raytheon’s Stinger anti-aircraft missile and the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin-produced Javelin anti-tank missile that Washington has already provided to Ukraine by the thousands. The bigger stream of profits however will come from assured post-conflict increases in national-security spending here and in Europe justified at least in part by the Russian invasion and the disaster that’s followed.

Indeed direct arms transfers to Ukraine already reflect only part of the extra money going to U.S. military contractors. This fiscal year alone they are guaranteed to also reap significant benefits from the Pentagon’s Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program both of which finance the acquisition of American weaponry and other equipment as well as military training. These have in fact been the two primary channels for military aid to Ukraine from the moment the Russians invaded and seized Crimea in 2014. Since then the United States has committed around $5 billion in security assistance to that country.

According to the State Department the United States has provided such military aid to help Ukraine “preserve its territorial integrity secure its borders and improve interoperability with NATO.” So when Russian troops began to mass on the Ukrainian border last year Washington quickly upped the ante. On March 31 2021 the U.S. European Command declared a “potential imminent crisis” given the estimated 100000 Russian troops already along that border and within Crimea. As last year ended the Biden administration had committed $650 million in weaponry to Ukraine including anti-aircraft and anti-armor equipment like the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin Javelin anti-tank missile.

Despite such elevated levels of American military assistance Russian troops did indeed invade Ukraine in February. Since then according to Pentagon reports the U.S. has committed to giving approximately $2.6 billion in military aid to that country bringing the Biden administration total to more than $3.2 billion and still rising.

Some of this assistance was included in a March emergency-spending package for Ukraine which required the direct procurement of weapons from the defense industry including drones laser-guided rocket systems machine guns ammunition and other supplies. The major military-industrial corporations will now seek Pentagon contracts to deliver that extra weaponry even as they are gearing up to replenish Pentagon stocks already delivered to the Ukrainians.

On that front in fact military contractors have much to look forward to. More than half of the Pentagon’s $6.5 billion portion of the emergency-spending package for Ukraine is designated simply to replenish DoD inventories. In all lawmakers allocated $3.5 billion to that effort $1.75 billion more than the president even requested. They also boosted funding by $150 million for the State Department’s FMF program for Ukraine. And keep in mind that those figures don’t even include emergency financing for the Pentagon’s acquisition and maintenance costs which are guaranteed to provide more revenue streams for the major weapons makers.

Better yet from the viewpoint of such companies there are many bites left to take from the apple of Ukrainian military aid. President Biden has already made it all too clear that “we’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead.” One can only assume that more commitments are on the way.

Another positive side effect of the war for Lockheed Raytheon and other arms merchants like them is the push by House Armed Services Committee chair Adam Smith (D-WA) and ranking committee Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama to speed up production of a next-generation anti-aircraft missile to replace the Stinger. In his congressional confirmation hearing William LaPlante the latest nominee to head acquisition at the Pentagon argued that America also needs more “hot production lines” for bombs missiles and drones. Consider that yet another benefit-in-waiting for the major weapons contractors.

The Pentagon gold mine

For U.S. arms makers however the greatest benefits of the war in Ukraine won’t be immediate weapons sales large as they are but the changing nature of the ongoing debate over Pentagon spending itself. Of course the representatives of such companies were already plugging the long-term challenge posed by China a greatly exaggerated threat but the Russian invasion is nothing short of manna from heaven for them the ultimate rallying cry for advocates of greater military outlays. Even before the war the Pentagon was slated to receive at least $7.3 trillion over the next decade more than four times the cost of President Biden’s $1.7 trillion domestic Build Back Better plan already stymied by members of Congress who labeled it “too expensive” by far. And keep in mind that given the current surge in Pentagon spending that $7.3 trillion could prove a minimal figure.

Indeed Pentagon officials like Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks promptly cited Ukraine as one of the rationales for the Biden administration’s proposed record national-security budget proposal of $813 billion calling Russia’s invasion “an acute threat to the world order.” In another era that budget request for Fiscal Year 2023 would have been mind-boggling since it’s higher than spending at the peaks of the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam and over $100 billion more than the Pentagon received annually at the height of the Cold War.

Despite its size however congressional Republicans — joined by a significant number of their Democratic colleagues — are already pushing for more. Forty Republican members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have in fact signed a letter to President Biden calling for 5% growth in military spending beyond inflation which would potentially add up to $100 billion to that budget request. Typically enough Representative Elaine Luria (D-VA) who represents the area near the Huntington Ingalls company’s Newport News military shipyard in Virginia accused the administration of “gutting the Navy” because it contemplates decommissioning some older ships to make way for new ones. That complaint was lodged despite that service’s plan to spend a whopping $28 billion on new ships in FY 2023.

Who benefits?

That planned increase in shipbuilding funds is part of a proposed pool of $276 billion for weapons procurement as well as further research and development contained in the new budget which is where the top five weapons-producing contractors — Lockheed Martin Boeing Raytheon General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman — make most of their money. Those firms already split more than $150 billion in Pentagon contracts annually a figure that will skyrocket if the administration and Congress have their way. To put all of this in context just one of those top five firms Lockheed Martin was awarded $75 billion in Pentagon contracts in fiscal year 2020 alone. That’s considerably more than the entire budget for the State Department dramatic evidence of how skewed Washington’s priorities are despite the Biden administration’s pledge to “put diplomacy first.”

The Pentagon’s weapons wish list for FY 2023 is a catalog of just how the big contractors will cash in. For example the new Columbia Class ballistic missile submarine built by General Dynamics Electric Boat plant in southeastern Connecticut will see its proposed budget for FY 2023 grow from $5.0 billion to $6.2 billion. Spending on Northrop Grumman’s new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent will increase by about one-third annually to $3.6 billion. The category of “missile defense and defeat” a specialty of Boeing Raytheon and Lockheed Martin is slated to receive more than $24 billion. And space-based missile warning systems a staple of the Trump administration-created Space Force will jump from $2.5 billion in FY 2022 to $4.7 billion in this year’s proposed budget.

Among all the increases there was a single surprise: a proposed reduction in purchases of the troubled Lockheed Martin F-35 combat aircraft from 85 to 61 planes in FY 2023. The reason is clear enough. That plane has more than 800 identified design flaws and its production and performance problems have been little short of legendary. Luckily for Lockheed Martin that drop in numbers has not been accompanied by a proportional reduction in funding. While newly produced planes may be reduced by one-third the actual budget allocation for the F-35 will drop by less than 10% from $12 billion to $11 billion an amount that’s more than the complete discretionary budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since Lockheed Martin won the F-35 contract development costs have more than doubled while production delays have set the aircraft back by nearly a decade. Nonetheless the military services have purchased so many of those planes that manufacturers can’t keep up with the demand for spare parts. And yet the F-35 can’t even be properly tested for combat effectiveness because the simulation software required is not only unfinished but without even an estimated completion date. So the F-35 is many years away from the full production of planes that actually work as advertised if that’s ever in the cards.

A number of the weapons systems which in the Ukraine moment are guaranteed to be showered with cash are so dangerous or dysfunctional that like the F-35 they should actually be phased out. Take the new ICBM. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry has called ICBMs “some of the most dangerous weapons in the world” because a president would only have minutes to decide whether to launch them in a crisis greatly increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war based on a false alarm. Nor does it make sense to buy aircraft carriers at $13 billion a pop especially since the latest version is having trouble even launching and landing aircraft — its primary function — and is increasingly vulnerable to attack by next-generation high-speed missiles.

The few positives in the new budget like the Navy’s decision to retire the unnecessary and unworkable Littoral Combat Ship — a sort of “F-35 of the sea” designed for multiple tasks none of which it does well — could easily be reversed by advocates from states and districts where those systems are built and maintained. The House of Representatives for instance has a powerful Joint Strike Fighter Caucus which in 2021 mustered more than one-third of all House members to press for more F-35s than the Pentagon and Air Force requested as they will no doubt do again this year. A Shipbuilding Caucus co-chaired by representatives Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Rob Wittman (R-VA) will fight against the Navy’s plan to retire old ships to buy new ones. (They would prefer that the Navy keep the old ones and buy new ones with more of your tax money up for grabs.) Similarly the “ICBM Coalition” made up of senators from states with either ICBM bases or production centers has a near perfect record of staving off reductions in the deployment or funding of those weapons and will in 2022 be hard at work defending its budgetary allocation.

Towards a new policy

Coming up with a sensible realistic and affordable defense policy always a challenge will be even more so in the midst of the Ukrainian nightmare. Still given where our taxpayer dollars go it remains all too worthwhile. Such a new approach should include things like reducing the numbers of the Pentagon’s private contractors hundreds of thousands of people many of whom are engaged in thoroughly redundant jobs that could be done more cheaply by civilian government employees or simply eliminated. It’s estimated that cutting spending on contractors by 15% would save around $262 billion over 10 years.

The Pentagon’s three-decades-long near $2 trillion “modernization” plan to build a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers missiles and submarines along with new warheads should for instance simply be scrapped in keeping with the kind of “deterrence-only” nuclear strategy developed by the nuclear-policy organization Global Zero. And the staggering American global military footprint — an invitation to further conflict that includes more than 750 military bases scattered on every continent except Antarctica and counterterror operations in 85 countries — should at the very least be sharply scaled back.

According to the Center for International Policy’s Sustainable Defense Task Force and a study of alternative approaches to defense carried out by the Congressional Budget Office even a relatively minimalist strategic rethinking could save at least $1 trillion over the next decade enough to make a healthy down payment on investments in public health preventing or mitigating the worst potential impacts of climate change or beginning the task of narrowing record levels of income inequality.

Of course none of these changes can occur without challenging the power and influence of the military-industrial-congressional complex a task as urgent as it is difficult in this moment of carnage in Europe. No matter how hard it may be it’s a fight worth having both for the security of the world and the future of the planet.

One thing is guaranteed: a new gold rush of “defense” spending is a disaster in the making for all of us not in that complex.

The MQ-25™ Stingray will be the world’s first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft and provide aerial refueling and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities that enhance capability and versatility for the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) and Carrier Strike Group (CSG). Integration of a persistent sea-based tanker into the CVW will make better use of our combat strike fighters and extend the range of our aircraft carriers. The system will be a critical part of the future CVW and is central to the Navy’s strategic Unmanned Campaign Framework laying the foundation for all future carrier-based unmanned systems and pioneering the cutting-edge manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) operational concept. The Navy plans for all NIMITZ and FORD-class carriers to eventually be MQ-25 capable.

Why is the FDA investigating Lucky Charms cereal?

Lucky Charms is a breakfast cereal that has been produced by General Mills Inc. since 1964. The cereal is mostly oat pieces with marshmallows in various shapes and their mascot is a leprechaun named Lucky who frequently appears in Lucky Charms advertisements. The marshmallows are supposed to represent Lucky's magical powers and come in eight different varieties.

Per CBS on April 16 2022 the FDA launched an investigation into complaints related to Lucky Charms cereal. The FDA reported that they have received over 100 complaints related to Lucky Charms so far this year especially on the food safety website iwaspoisoned.com. Complaints from the website included nausea vomiting and diarrhea after consuming Lucky Charms.

General Mills Inc. is a Minneapolis-based company also responsible for cereals such as Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs. Thankfully the company is aware of the food poisoning reports and told CBS that they investigated the matter themselves although their investigations did not find evidence of illness directly caused by Lucky Charms.

Can you get Salmonella from cereal?

If you think that any potential Lucky Charms outbreak of food poisoning seems highly unlikely you might want to think again. Although it's gross to think about Salmonella bacteria can get into cereal. For example Live Science says that contamination may occur if the grains are grown in a field near where animals defecate.

Contamination can also occur anywhere food is made especially if bacteria such as Salmonella get on equipment being used to make food. In February 2018 Benjamin Chapman an associate professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University spoke to Live Science to talk about food poisoning in cereal. ""A dry heat actually makes [Salmonella] more persistent in a food or ingredient"" he said.

Among these is the GM BT1 platform which according to GM is considered neither a unibody platform nor a body-on-frame platform.

During a recent interview regarding the new Chevy Silverado EV between GM Authority Executive Editor Alex Luft and GM Chief Engineer Battery Electric Trucks Nichole Kraatz Kraatz was asked about the Silverado EV’s underlying architecture which was confirmed to be the BT1 platform. When asked whether BT1 was considered body-on-frame rather than a unibody architecture Kraatz responded by saying:

“It is not a unibody and it is not a body-on-frame. We’ve designed a different type of architecture where we have a body that has a floor but also the Ultium battery structure is actually a good portion of the structure and those two are connected after the body exits the body shaft. So we’ve defined kind of a new category of vehicle that doesn’t have that traditional body-and-frame approach.”

When asked if there was a specific term to describe the BT1 architecture Kraatz said that she “actually used the term UltiBody to my team the other day because we have yet to assign one.”

To note the “Ulti” prefix is a reference to GM’s Ultium brand which includes the GM Ultium battery and the GM Ultium drive motor tech.

The GM BT1 architecture underpins GM’s battery-powered pickup trucks and SUVs including the Chevy Silverado EV GMC Sierra EV GMC Hummer EV and the forthcoming all-electric variant of the Cadillac Escalade.

Conversely GM’s new BEV3 platform is used to underpin the automaker’s all-electric crossovers and sedans including the Cadillac Lyriq Cadillac Celestiq Chevy Blazer EV and Chevy Equinox EV.

Jim graduated from Lapeer High School with the class of 1965. After graduation he entered Ferris State College where he received his Associates Degree in Automotive Technology. Later followed a position with General Motors Corp. where he met his future wife Deanna White from Swartz Creek MI. Shortly thereafter the young couple enlisted in the U.S. Air Force together. A Personnel Specialist was his chosen field. While serving in the Air Force (1976-1979) Jim earned his Bachelors Degree in Business Management from Texas Lutheran College. After discharge from the military they returned to Michigan and Jim became a devoted father to a son. Jim continued working for General Motors for over 30 years before retiring in 2006.

Jim was an avid car enthusiast and especially loved hot rods and attending drag racing events nationwide. A devoted husband he cherished spending time with his wife Deanna both in their motorhome and hiking together outdoors. With their son raised and on his own Jim enjoyed traveling and lived in many states after his retirement. Deanna was a travel nurse who continued to work until retiring when they settled finally in Northern Nevada. Jim would be by her side gallantly carrying her bags always to the next assignment somewhere.

Jim is survived by his wife of 47 years Deanna West; son James West of Revere MA; four grandchildren Henry Oliver Lilianna and Madeline West of MA; brothers Richard (Darlene) West of Lapeer and Darrell (Judy) West of Kissimmee FL; sister-in-law Shirley West; and many nieces and nephews. Jim was preceded in death by his parents Russell and Leona West; his brothers Thomas West of Lapeer and Roger West of CO; his niece Denise West of Lapeer and nephews Michael West and Dean West. A ceremony with military honors will be held for Jim on May 11 2022 at 12 p.m. at the American Legion Post 16 1701 W.

This ended up being the Chevrolet Citation (and its Oldsmobile Omega Pontiac Phoenix and Buick Skylark siblings) introduced to the world in 1979 as a 1980 model. While better than 1.6 million Citations were sold you'll have a hard time finding one today; today's Junkyard Gem is the only (non-X11) 1980-1985 GM X-Body I've ever seen with both the optional V6 engine and the base four-on-the-floor manual transmission.

On paper the Citation looked like just the car to put GM back on top of the world giving Ford and Chrysler a beating about the kidneys with a tire iron while repelling those pesky Japanese and European invaders. It offered fuel economy interior space and ride comfort far superior to that of the 1960s-vintage Nova it replaced while looking like a genuine slab of Detroit iron. On top of that the '80 Citation cost just a few hundred more dollars than the '79 Nova and far less than cramped import front-drivers such as the VW Rabbit and Datsun 310. This car should have been the biggest General Motors hit since the '55 Chevy.

Unfortunately all that great engineering and marketing work got undermined by a series of highly publicized manufacturing defects and recalls during the first few model years. Better than 1.2 million Citations were sold during the 1980 and 1981 model years… and then sales fell off a cliff and never recovered. For 1983 through 1985 Citation sales never topped 100000 units per year. Meanwhile Lee Iacocca at Chrysler had masterminded the creation of a vast array of modern sharp-looking front-wheel-drive cars based on the K platform which hit showrooms starting in late 1980 and promptly lured away countless potential Citation shoppers; an all-new front-wheel-drive Toyota Camry showed up soon after. By 1986 the Citation was gone replaced by the Corsica/Beretta the following year.

I happen to know a bit about this car's history. It was one of more than 250 vintage vehicles (including 38 classic Mustangs) auctioned off near Denver last fall and quite a few winning bids were placed by LKQ Pick Your Part. A salvageable '66 Mustang coupe went for $540 and this Citation got the auctioneer's hammer at an even 500 bucks.

It's pretty rusty (by Front Range Colorado standards) in the usual spots so it was unlikely that any Citation restorers would have wanted to rescue it. They seek coupes and X-11s anyway.

The base engine in the Citation was the Iron Duke 2.5-liter straight-four essentially one cylinder bank of the Pontiac 301 V8. In 1981 the Duke made 84 horsepower which wasn't much in a car weighing close to 2500 pounds but got the job done. This car has the optional 2.8-liter V6 rated at 110 horsepower and costing an extra $125 on a $6523 car (that's about $410 and $21270 in 2022 dollars).

Nearly every Citation buyer who opted for the big engine also paid the additional $349 ($1140 now) for the three-speed automatic but this one has the base four-speed manual. Americans could buy new cars with four-on-the-floor stick shifts all the way through 1996 and a three-speed manual was still available on new Malibus and Camaros in 1981 ... but this was still considered a fairly outdated transmission by the dawn of the 1980s. No five-speed manual was ever offered from the factory on a Citation.

Even most buyers of late-1970s Novas got the automatic with a split-bench seat but this car's cabin was old-school by 1981 standards.

It lacks air conditioning but it does sport the nice Delco AM/FM stereo radio with its unusual vertical orientation. This was a $100 option which comes to about $325 after inflation.

It was a nightmare to get an aftermarket radio in that vertical dash slot plus thieves targeted cassette players with great efficiency during the 1980s. That's why this car's owner installed an Audiovox cassette deck in the glovebox. I did the same with my 1968 Mercury Cyclone during the middle 1980s but the radio still got ripped off.

The upholstery appears to be the ""Sport Cloth"" option in the color GM called Camel. This stuff is scratchy but long-wearing.

This rear seat would have been right at home in a 1961 Biscayne.

Excitation yeah! Transportation uh-huh! Recreation yeah!

Citation's Working Woman was a superhero in thick glasses who dropped everything to flirt with her suave office manager.

Samsung and Google made headlines last week after announcing that they would follow Apple’s lead with their own self-repair programs and would sell smartphone components directly to end-users. Better yet both companies have partnered with iFixit — a reputable source of repair guides and smartphone spare parts. While this may sound like a victory for the right-to-repair movement the unfortunate reality is that these programs aren’t as user-centric as they seem on the surface. Our picks: The best phones you can buy

Replace not repair: A flawed and expensive strategy

Ease of access to a device’s key components — especially failure-prone ones like the charge port or battery — is one of the most important aspects of repairability. However many modern electronic devices are simply not designed to be easily serviceable.

Case in point: most Samsung smartphones — including the Galaxy S22 series — ship with batteries glued to the display housing. While this isn’t an uncommon practice by itself virtually every other smartphone manufacturer includes a pull tab or two for easy removal.

Without pull tabs however safely removing your smartphone’s battery requires copious amounts of isopropyl alcohol to soften the adhesive. Lithium-ion batteries don’t react well to physical stress (think back to the Galaxy Note 7 debacle) so carelessly prying one out can be extremely dangerous.

Samsung sells replacement batteries combined with display assemblies causing higher repair costs and additional e-waste.

Samsung perhaps realizes that it cannot expect all of its users to safely replace the battery. So what has the company decided to do? Not sell replacement batteries as part of its self-repair program. Instead you can buy an entire display assembly with a glued-on battery. Needless to say this inflates the cost of repair tremendously especially on flagship models with high-end displays. Many users would rather buy a new device than pay hundreds of dollars to replace a perfectly functional screen.

It’s not just Samsung that makes devices with limited scope for repair. Every MacBook in recent memory has used rivets to secure the keyboard to the bottom chassis. Most other laptops use screws instead. In practice replacing a MacBook keyboard is nearly impossible — requiring either unreasonable amounts of brute force (pictured above) or careful hammering to remove each individual rivet.

Replacing a MacBook’s keyboard takes so much time and effort that even Apple won’t do it. The company’s own repair policy is to simply replace the entire bottom half of the laptop which also includes a brand-new trackpad and glued-on battery. If your MacBook has run out of warranty replacing the top case can end up costing you hundreds of dollars perhaps more than the device is even worth. The same will likely be true for parts sold through the upcoming self-repair program.

Despite all the sustainability claims the fact is that we’re still dealing with deliberate anti-repair design choices.

Despite all of the sustainability claims that we’ve heard from manufacturers over the years the fact is that we’re still dealing with deliberate anti-repair design choices. And as you’d expect the practice extends far beyond the two examples or even companies listed here. Read more: Should we tolerate hard-to-repair devices?

Serialized hardware and software locks

Rita El Khoury / Android Authority

Serialized hardware is another worrying trend that self-repair programs likely won’t affect much if at all. In a nutshell serialization refers to the practice of pairing displays batteries cameras motherboards and other components from the factory. In many cases only authorized repair centers have the ability to pair new hardware to devices essentially restricting users from swapping in their own replacement parts.

The practice of serializing components severely restricts who can and cannot repair a device.

While user safety is often cited as a common reason for serialization it’s always been a rather weak argument. Thankfully public backlash has forced companies to disable software locks on several occasions even as recently as last year. That said manufacturers could just as easily reinstate them since the hardware already exists in every device.

While serialized hardware may not sound like a big deal keep in mind that many repairs involve the use of donor devices rather than brand-new replacement parts. After all many discarded devices still have perfectly functional batteries charge ports and mainboards that can be salvaged for future repairs. This kind of repair can be both cost-effective and environmentally friendly. However it obviously isn’t possible if each component is locked to a specific device.

A self-repair program will require manufacturers to release their proprietary pairing software to the general public. The Pixel 6 already has such a system in place for fingerprint sensor calibration but it hasn’t worked for months at this point. Moreover there’s no stopping other manufacturers from imposing restrictions while technically allowing select few users to perform repairs.

Google's fingerprint sensor calibration tool for the Pixel 6 has been broken for months. Thus access to replacement hardware alone does not guarantee a fix.

For example access to the software tool could be locked unless the customer proves that they’ve procured a spare part from an approved source. In fact this is already happening right now. According to iFixit Apple-authorized technicians use a cloud-based program to verify and sync serial numbers of replacement parts with Apple servers.

It’s worth considering how contrived this practice is. If your car needs repair you usually don’t have to think about buying a “genuine” part nor do you typically have to use a proprietary piece of software that’s connected to the internet just to pair a new battery or set of tires to your vehicle. There’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t hold our personal electronics to the same standard. See also: Android phones should have a private repair mode

Self-repair for some but not for everyone

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

Even if you’re willing to put up with all of the aforementioned hurdles none of the self-repair programs we’ve seen so far seem particularly comprehensive.

Apple’s program will include 200 parts for the iPhone 12 and 13 series. But what if you own an older device or the iPhone SE? Based on what we know so far you won’t have access to parts until much later. The company has only offered a vague commitment to expand the program’s reach to the Mac and other products but it’s anybody’s guess as to when that will happen. And even though nearly six months have passed since the initial announcement you still can’t buy anything yet. Our opinion: Apple’s self-repair program sets the bar for Android OEMs

Samsung’s program is somehow even more restrictive. The company will initially only sell parts for the Galaxy S20 S21 and Tab S7 device families. That’s not a very long list especially given that Samsung launches dozens of smartphones and tablets every single year.

Google appears to be doing a little better than either company in this regard pledging to offer parts and support going back to the Pixel 2 series from 2017. However it’s unclear whether or not that commitment extends to mid-range devices like the Pixel 5a.

It’s unclear why these programs support so few devices and are only available in a few markets.

Availability is another potential concern. Google has stated that it will make spare parts available in most western markets. Apple’s self-repair program however will only launch in the US initially. And while Samsung hasn’t specified availability its press release hints at a similar North American focus too.

It’s unclear why these programs support so few devices and aren’t available in more regions. While some will blame logistical hurdles or supply constraints manufacturers already have parts on hand to not only assemble new devices but also service existing ones at official repair centers all over the world. Besides iFixit already has a distribution channel in place for aftermarket spare parts and tools so it’s not something brands need to create from scratch.

Does self-repair help the right to repair movement?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

While everything we’ve discussed so far points to a dire future for the electronics repair industry there may be a silver lining to this whole situation.

After years of apathy tech giants have finally succumbed to pressure from the right-to-repair movement. Regulators around the world are considering legal intervention too and could end up forcing manufacturers to give up anti-repair practices like glued batteries. The European Parliament for one recently voted in favor of banning non-replaceable battery packs. The move may coerce Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers to finally change their product designs and embrace true repairability.

In summary then even if self-repair programs don’t make much practical sense in their current form they’ve succeeded in bringing an important topic to public attention. One can only hope that we continue to head in this promising new direction. Up next: To solve the smartphone e-waste problem we need fewer disposable devices

Planet founded in 1985 in Galway was reportedly initially created to help international shoppers get money back after shopping overseas. This helped to streamline a process that had been complex — and the company later went on to add the Double Sale System getting rid of back office administration for merchants.

Per the report the new jobs in Ireland will be a blend of hybrid and remote working roles covering several sectors like product development technology and finance. The company expects to create 500 new jobs globally over the coming months including the 100 Ireland-based roles.

Hildegarde Naughton the Minister of State at the Department of Transport said the jobs “will have a great impact on the city and further excel Galway’s reputation as a great city for business and innovation.”

Planet’s business expanded in Europe in the 1990s hitting France as well as other places like the United Kingdom Italy Switzerland Spain Austria Belgium the Netherlands Germany and Poland. The report added that the company also expanded globally for decades after that and acquired various payment services.

In March 2022 Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) published a response to submissions received to its consultation on review of the ePayments Code. In its response ASIC proposed various revisions to the current voluntary code including that scam payments will no longer be regarded as “mistaken internet payments” and reporting requirements for unauthorized transactions will change.

In more detail

The ePayments Code (Code) is a voluntary code of practice that regulates electronic payments including automatic teller machine (ATM) transactions online payments EFTPOS transactions credit/debit card transactions and internet and mobile banking. ASIC is responsible for both administering and reviewing the Code.



The main objective of ASIC’s review is to clarify specific areas of the Code and to modernize it. ASIC has made the proposal to extend the scope of the Code to New Payments Platform (NPP). In light of industry feedback ASIC’s response is to extend the Code specifically to NPP and Bulk Electronic Clearing System (‘BECS‘) and will not make the Code to be platform neutral. While it is recognized this will reduce flexibility as new platforms emerge it will prevent other frameworks from inadvertently being captured.

A significant change to the updated Code will also be the clarification that:

the definition of ‘mistaken authorized internet payment’ will only cover mistakes in inputting the account identified and does not include payments made to a scammer; and

‘unauthorized transaction’ provisions will only apply where a third party has made a transaction on a consumer’s account without their consent and does not apply where the consumer has made the transaction themselves.

The response to these clarifications in the Code has been diverse. While industry feedback supported these changes consumer groups strongly opposed it and felt it would result in a decrease in consumer protection and a regulatory void in relation to scam losses. In response ASIC intends to move forward and implement the proposal. The reasoning provided by ASIC is that the existing framework in the Code is not appropriate to deal with the complex and evolving problem of fraud and scams. While ASIC recognized that there is a gap in regulatory architecture relating to scams in Australia it did not oppose regulations being created outside of the Code that are better equipped to achieve the best outcomes for consumers as a whole. At present ASIC is prioritizing providing clarity to the Code and removing any ambiguities.

While a major recommendation has been for the Code to be mandated the updated Code will remain voluntary. The Government intends to commence consultation on this issue later in 2022.

ASIC will engage with a range of key stakeholders in to the technical details of a draft updated Code. ASIC seeks to have an updated Code published in April 2022. There will be a 12 month transition period however subscribers will be encouraged to comply with the updated Code earlier if possible.

Two-way star Shohei Ohtani went deep for the second straight day Saturday belting his third home run scoring three runs and driving in three in the Los Angeles Angels' 7-2 win over the Texas Rangers.

After ending his longest start-of-the-season home run drought Friday with two blasts Ohtani hit a two-run shot as he clobbered reliever Derek Holland's first-pitch breaking ball over the right-center-field wall at Globe Life Field in the eighth inning.

Ohtani plated the game's first run in the third with an RBI groundout. The reigning American League MVP had his first hit of the day in the seventh with an infield single and went on to steal third.

""The team as a whole has the mindset to turn each chance into a run and that is leading to good results"" Ohtani said. ""(My home run) just barely got over the fence and I'm happy it did.""

Ohtani went 2-for-5 and improved his batting to average .231. He had 46 home runs and batted .257 last year.

Seiya Suzuki ran his hitting streak to seven games since Opening Day going 2-for-3 with a walk for the Chicago Cubs in their 9-6 loss to the Colorado Rockies.

Suzuki who also has three home runs in his first MLB season after joining from the Hiroshima Carp came close to his fourth homer when his drive struck the wall in dead center at Coors Field for a double.

Suzuki singled in the seventh and scored twice as he improved his batting average to .409.

When an X-ray of Mike Trout’s left hand came back negative the Angels and their fans could exhale.

Trout was hit by an 81 mph slider from Rangers right-hander Spencer Patton in the fifth inning. He was visibly in pain as he walked around the plate and toward first base. After a few minutes with head athletic trainer Mike Frostad and Manager Joe Maddon Trout came out of the game.

About 45 minutes later the team announced the results of the X-rays and said that Trout was day to day. Maddon said Trout would “more than likely” also miss Monday’s game but otherwise there’s no timetable for when he’ll return.

“Just take it day to day and see how I feel tomorrow” Trout said after the game adding that he already felt better than he did when he was hit.

“It feels all right” Trout said. “Just one of those things.”

Trout said he couldn’t see very well at that time because the shadows from the roof of Globe Life Field which was open were crossing right between the plate and the mound.

When he got hit he felt a mix of pain of frustration at the fear that he might have suffered another serious injury.

“It could have hit me anywhere else but it hit me in my hand” Trout said.

The Angels lost their three-time MVP last season for all but 36 games when his strained calf turned out to be more serious than expected. Much of their hope for improvement in 2022 was hanging on the idea that they would get a full season out of Trout.

Trout was off to a good start too with a pair of homers and a .972 OPS.

Brandon Marsh took over in center field after Trout came out of the game and he will presumably man the position until Trout is ready to return. Taylor Ward and Jo Adell can play the corners.

The Angels are about to begin a three-game series in Houston against the division-favorite Astros who took three of four last weekend in Anaheim. Since that series the Angels rebounded by winning five of six games against lesser competition the Miami Marlins and Rangers. The Angels won the last three games of the four-game series in Texas.

The Rangers played a particularly ugly game on Sunday.

The Rangers made three errors and had a passed ball which allowed a run to score. Shortstop Marcus Semien also dropped a throw from right fielder Adolis Garcia in the first inning when they would have had Shohei Ohtani out trying to tag up from first on a fly ball.

The Angels also drew seven walks and five of those led to runs.

It all covered up a day in which Angels starter José Suarez wasn’t sharp allowing three runs in 4-1/3 innings. The Angels also made three other outs on the bases although Maddon said he doesn’t mind aggressive baserunning. Marsh was doubled off when he lost track of the ball on a fly ball to right field. Ward was picked off first and Tyler Wade was caught stealing.

On the bright side for the Angels the bullpen was sharp. Mike Mayers picked up the final two outs of the fifth and then Jimmy Herget worked two scoreless innings striking out five. Jaime Barria worked the final two innings allowing the Angels to go to Houston with all of their top relievers fresh.

The Angels lineup also produced with each of the starters getting at least one hit or walk.

“It was just another game where everybody contributed” Maddon said. “And that’s the fun part about when you win a series like this and everybody feels a part of it. It makes a difference.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9yYW5nZXJzLzIwMjIvMDQvMTcvcmFuZ2Vycy1zaG9ydHN0b3AtY29yZXktc2VhZ2VyLWdpdmVuLXN1bmRheXMtZ2FtZS12cy1hbmdlbHMtb2ZmLWZvci1yZXN0L9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmFuZ2Vycy8yMDIyLzA0LzE3L3JhbmdlcnMtc2hvcnRzdG9wLWNvcmV5LXNlYWdlci1naXZlbi1zdW5kYXlzLWdhbWUtdnMtYW5nZWxzLW9mZi1mb3ItcmVzdC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rangers shortstop Corey Seager given Sunday’s game off for rest,"ARLINGTON — Citing “normal wear and tear” the Texas Rangers gave shortstop Corey Seager on Sunday the ninth game of the season off. It should serve as a reminder that even though the Rangers signed Seager to a 10-year $325 million deal there is some need for preventative care.

Seager has spent time on the IL in three of the last four seasons and averaged only 85 games per season over the last three 162-game seasons. His longest streak of consecutive starts with the Dodgers was the last 21 games of the season as Los Angeles was locked in a tight race with San Francisco in the NL West.

After three multi-hit games to start the year Seager is 4 for 22. He had played all eight games on artificial surfaces in Toronto and Arlington.

“He was a little sore and we talked about it” manager Chris Woodward said. “He’s been really honest with us. So let’s do the right thing here and get him off his feet a little bit. We have to be able to do that to keep him healthy. And he’s had an injury history. We never really planned on close [to] 162 for him. We want to make sure we look after him.”

With Seager out Marcus Semien started at shortstop. Semien was charged with an error when trying to field a pop up in the vacated third base area in the sixth.

Trout was struck by a 1-1 slider from Rangers right-hander Spencer Patton leading off the fifth inning. Trout said he had difficultly picking up the 81 mph pitch in the shadows on a day when Globe Life Field's roof was open and that he lowered his hands to protect his midsection.

""Like a normal day I probably just turn like this [pivoting his left shoulder inward] and just get hit'' Trout said.

Trout jumped around and shook the hand in pain. He initially walked toward the visiting dugout and then marched about halfway down the first-base line where he was met by Angels trainer Mike Frostad and manager Joe Maddon. Frostad checked to see if Trout could squeeze the hand and then walked him off the field and back to the clubhouse.

Maddon said he could immediately see Trout was in more pain than expected on that type of pitch and took him out.

""I just decided let's get it looked at get some ice on it and get you back sooner'' said Maddon who added that he will ""more than likely'' sit Trout for Monday night's game at the Houston Astros.

Trout is hitting .267 this season with two home runs and two RBIs. He doubled on a flair to short right field during the Angels' three-run third inning on Sunday in which they took a 4-1 lead.

Trout said he initially feared the hand was broken and that he was frustrated with where the pitch struck him. ""Could have hit me anywhere else but hit me in my hand'' he said.

Trout 30 played only 36 games last season through May 17 because of a calf injury and he hasn't played more than 140 games in a season since 2016.

Trout had surgery in 2017 after tearing ligaments in his left thumb on a slide into second base.

Almost exactly one year ago Gary Gensler was confirmed as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Senate approved him in a 53-to-45 vote with nearly all Republicans opposing Mr. Gensler a former Goldman Sachs executive and veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations who had voiced support for tougher reporting rules for public companies.

Since then the chairman has roused the ire of retail stock traders and crypto enthusiasts as he has raised alarms over market developments like the gamification of trading and the proliferation of unregistered cryptocurrency tokens. He is also under fire from a variety of industries for what they say is overreach on issues like proposed climate disclosure rules and scrutiny of shell companies and for the sheer amount of agency activity overall on his watch.

As the nation’s top markets regulator Mr. Gensler was always going to be busy. But he was nominated during the unexpected trading frenzy in so-called meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment which was driven in part by commission-free trading apps. He was confirmed for a five-year term on the day the crypto exchange Coinbase went public a sign that the once-fringe industry was rapidly moving into the mainstream.

“No one could be really prepared for a job like this” Mr. Gensler 64 told DealBook in an interview this week. That said he took over the S.E.C. after 18 years in banking and had served at the Treasury Department led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission helped produce financial legislation for the Senate and got to know every S.E.C. chair before him since the 1993 appointment of Arthur Levitt.

Global investors are looking to put billions of dollars into Indian real estate again as they see improvement in both residential and commercial segments.

From Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) to Goldman Sachs to CPPIB a number of global investors are either tying up with Indian fund managers or developers to take part in India’s real estate sector.

ADIA one of the biggest sovereign funds globally is looking to invest in the new fund structure of Kotak Investment Advisors the private equity arm of Kotak Mahindra group. The fund will lend to residential projects and developers sources in the know said.

According to sources ADIA which held assets under management of $829 billion at the end of 2021 could invest as much as $1 billion (Rs 7600 crore ) in the Kotak fund.

“Given the pick-up in residential sales both investors think it is a right opportunity to invest in residential projects” said sources.

When contacted ADIA spokesperson declined to comment. A mail sent to Kotak did not elicit any response.

ADIA has an exisiting relationship with Kotak. In 2019 Kotak Investment Advisors raised $500 million from ADIA as an anchor investor for a distressed assets fund.

ADIA is also a primary investor in the $1.88-billion H Care-3 affordable housing fund of HDFC Capital. The initial close of the fund was announced in January this year.

Another global investor Goldman Sachs is looking to invest $2-3 billion in Indian real estate in the next three years said sources.

Goldman Sachs is also in advanced talks with developers in Mumbai and Bengaluru to set up investment platforms in residential and commercial real estate sources said.

“GS wants to do both equity and debt deals though it has done mostly debt deals in the last couple of years in real estate” sources said.

Goldman Sachs has hired Mukesh Tiwari from Actis to head its Indian real estate business and is expanding the real estate team sources said.

An e-mail sent to Goldman Sachs did not elicit any response.

Earlier this week Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announced a new joint venture with Tata Realty & Infrastructure to develop and own commercial office space across the country. The joint venture will target ready and development assets aiming to reach over Rs 5000 crore in assets under management.

In March this year CPPIB also floated a second JV with Bengaluru-based RMZ group to set up and hold office spaces in key cites in the country. CPPIB said it will invest Rs 2650 crore in the joint venture with RMZ

“The funds are encouraged by an increase in demand in residential data centre and warehousing segments and corporates returning to offices. Hence putting large sums in the Indian real estate market” said Sanjay Dutt managing director at Tata Realty & Infrastructure which announced a JV with CPPIB recently.

Dutt added that the way India managed Covid overall and a sharp rise in economic activities and related hiring giving a boost to job markets have helped.

Saurabh Shatdal managing director capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield said the success of the three REITs (real estate investment trusts) has helped the sector weave a very strong story globally. “REITs have not just institutionalised the space but also emerged as a strong value-creation strategy for investors. This has helped the sector attract variety of pools of global capital to look at Indian RE favourably” Shatdal said.

Residential sales have picked up significantly across cities and developers have reported strong pre-sales numbers this quarter. Commercial leasing was close to 12-13 million sq ft in Q1 which is signalling a strong revival in the space he said.

First quarter of the year (January-March 2022) has seen quarterly sales attain a four-year high of 78627 residential units despite the third wave said consultant Knight Frank India in a recent report

Shatdal said that investors have always preferred platform-level trades to deploy capital because platforms help investors participate in assets that are across the development cycle thus balancing the risk-return matrix. Investors today are ready to back developers who have a strong delivery track record professionally managed business and high levels of corporate governance.

Shobhit Agarwal managing director of Anarock Capital said that apart from the remarkable return from the housing market India now has a firmly established REIT market which is very interesting for investors. “Moreover the logistics and warehousing sector has picked up tremendously after Covid-19 boosted the e-commerce sector. Data centres as an asset class is another exciting emerging sector. There is every reason for both foreign as well as domestic investors to look at Indian real estate very seriously now and in the future” Agarwal said.

He expects that the Indian real estate market will attract $7-8 billion from global investors annually."

Its urgent care centers have lower costs than hospital ...,"As Hartford HealthCare extends its reach across Connecticut the number of its urgent care centers that offer patients an alternative to costly emergency rooms is growing too.

The 28 centers are far afield from Hartford stretching north to Enfield south to Branford and West Haven and east to New London and Norwich. In January Hartford HealthCare opened an urgent care center in Milford its first on Connecticut’s shoreline.

“It’s a more purposeful move to disrupt ourselves” said James P. Cardon Hartford HealthCare’s executive vice president and chief clinical integration officer.

Urgent care centers treat illnesses and injuries that aren’t life-threatening provide X-rays and offer COVID-19 evaluation and testing. Patients may walk in or reserve a place and pre-register online. Hartford HealthCare describes its GoHealth Urgent Care centers as an “on-demand consumer-centric care platform that serves as the digital and physical front door” to its health care system.

“We recognized years ago that we needed to provide new ways to both improve access for urgent care outside of the primary care office while at the same time give better options for those who would have gone to the more expensive emergency department for that care” said Jeffrey A. Flaks president and chief executive officer of Hartford HealthCare.

Emergency rooms the ‘most expensive place’ for health care

Spencer Perlman managing partner and director of health care research at Veda Partners in Bethesda Md. said the industry has focused on urgent care for a while.

“No doubt receiving care in the emergency room is the most expensive place you can receive it” he said.

By keeping overhead lower than at an emergency room urgent care centers can be profitable for the provider Perlman said. Urgent care centers boost profitability because they don’t require the same level of staffing and types of equipment that must be on hand in emergency rooms he said.

Hartford HealthCare in 2020 posted $274.7 million in operating revenue for its Hartford HealthCare Medical Group which includes urgent care centers primary care surgical care and specialty medicine. It was down from $330 million in 2019 before COVID-19. Its 2020 revenue accounted for about 6.5% of Hartford HealthCare’s $4.3 billion in revenue.

A 2021 study by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services analyzing data from six states estimated that the cost savings from switching emergency department care to urgent care centers could save about $3.3 billion annually according to Hartford HealthCare.

The study cited $570 in copays and $250 out-of-pocket for emergency department treatment of the same conditions that would cost $156 in copays and an average $50 out of pocket at urgent care centers.

Hartford HealthCare says visits to emergency departments declined 10% or 38000 fewer patients between 2016 and 2019 before the pandemic as patients had access to expanded urgent care.

The cost difference between an emergency room visit for routine care that did not require hospitalization and an urgent care visit is more than 80% Hartford HealthCare said.

For example most Hartford HealthCare urgent care centers use mobile X-rays that are more convenient and less expensive than imaging equipment in hospitals.

Encouraging employees to use alternatives to the ER

Employers are encouraging their workers to use alternatives to emergency rooms. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2020 reported that 79% of firms with 10 or more employees offering health benefits cover health care services at retail clinics such as those in pharmacies supermarkets and retail stores in their largest health plan.

Among firms with 10 or more employees covering health services in retail clinics in their largest plan 17% provide a financial incentive for workers to use a retail health clinic instead of visiting a traditional doctor’s office.

Cardon said that for life-threatening emergencies such as heart attacks a high level of training from physicians and proximity to a hospital are “all those things that make emergency rooms important.” Strep throat a sinus infection or twisted ankle is not an emergency and using hospital emergency rooms is a waste of time and money he said.

Hartford HealthCare has an aggressive growth strategy adding the Hospital of Central Connecticut in New Britain in 2011 Backus Hospital in Norwich in 2013 Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington in 2018 and St. Vincent’s Medical Center in Bridgeport in 2019.

It added the Southington Surgery Center in 2014 opened the Bone and Joint Institute in Hartford in 2016 and the Connecticut Orthopedic Institute in Meriden in 2017.

A new urgent care center followed at least one of those initiatives: St. Vincent’s Medical Center had five urgent care centers and Hartford HealthCare added a sixth last year.

Hartford HealthCare’s expansive strategy won’t necessarily lead to more urgent care centers Cardon said.

“The goal has always been to move away try to provide services in the community where they live” he said. “It depends where the need is. There are no pre-set numbers. We look at the communities.”

Hartford HealthCare’s growth has drawn a federal lawsuit by St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford accusing it of jeopardizing competition and limiting consumer choice. It’s seeking unspecified damages and an order prohibiting Hartford HealthCare from continuing its acquisitions.

Asked if Hartford HealthCare’s urgent care centers help steer patients to its hospitals or other facilities a spokeswoman said patients and their providers determine care and where to seek health care.

“It’s a piece of this puzzle to address the total cost of care” Cardon said.

On June 20 1999 police in Hartford Connecticut responded to a call reporting a woman had been found dead on a back porch on Garden Street.

“She had serious head trauma including a crushed skull and injuries around her neck and head” Lt. Mark Pawlina of the Hartford Police Department told “Mark of a Serial Killer” airing Saturdays at 8/7c on Oxygen.

Those chilling telltale marks would become a familiar sight for police in the city in the year or so that followed.

The medical examiner determined the homicide victim identified through fingerprints as 28-year-old Ladawn Roberts had been dead for less than 24 hours.

Her mother told authorities that her daughter had fallen on hard times. Roberts was also pregnant when she was killed. With a lack of leads the case turned cold.

Ten months later the body of 33-year-old Aida Quinones was found partially unclothed with serious head trauma suggesting “she’d been the victim of somebody’s rage” investigators told producers. The medical examiner determined her skull like Roberts’ had been crushed.

Detectives found a possible clue close to the body. Newport cigarette butts were collected and processed for DNA evidence. The autopsy also indicated there’d been a sexual assault. DNA evidence was sent to the crime lab for analysis.

Investigators learned from Quinones’ brother that she lived out on the street they told “Mark Of A Serial Killer.”

To help elicit leads the State’s Attorney office offered a $30000 reward. The strategy failed to produce viable information.

In June 2000 the body of Rosalind Casey 32 was found under a bridge in Asylum Hill. Some items of her clothing had been pulled off.

Like the other two victims Casey’s skull had been crushed. It appeared that the killer had stomped on her head. A serial killer seemed like a strong possibility and the community was understandably scared.

“This is a guy who is so filled with rage” said Dr. Joni Johnston forensic psychologist. “This is somebody I think based on what we’re seeing who has felt that rage for years ... the mark of crushing a skull tells me this is somebody who wants to be so close to his victim that he doesn’t put a weapon in between them. This is somebody who just enjoys the physical act of annihilating another human being.”

In August 2000 the body of 32-year-old Rosali Jimenez was found in an abandoned building on Cedar Street. One pant leg had been pulled down and a shoe had been removed. Jimenez’s head was crushed almost beyond recognition.

""She very clearly was stomped on. It was probably the worst case out of all the cases we had seen previously” Pawlina told producers.

Blood was found underneath her fingernails and analyzed at the crime lab. Newport cigarette butts also were found near the body. DNA evidence found on the victims was cross-checked for commonalities — and it turned out Quinones and Jimenez had matching DNA on their bodies.

Police compiled a list of known offenders with a history of sexual assaults and violence against women. They found 11 homicides that had some similarities to the current cases but after a deep dive none could be connected to the current investigations.

In July 2001 the body of 37-year-old Alesia Ford was found. Like the other victims her head was crushed some of her clothing had been removed and Newport cigarette butts were scattered near her body. In a new twist a bloody boot print was found on her torso.

Forensic analysis determined the footwear in question to be a size 11 Timberland boot said Dr. Henry Lee forensic scientist. DNA found on Ford’s body matched up to evidence found on Quinones and Ford.

“A lot of these victims have fallen on hard times” said Shannon Miller a reporter for NBC Connecticut adding that some struggled with drugs. “They're used to kind of walking the streets which makes them even more vulnerable.”

In January 2002 the case took a major turn when the DNA database turned up a match for evidence found on the cigarette butts and victims’ bodies.

The individual’s name: Matthew Steven Johnson who had an extensive criminal record involving violence against women. He also had a fraternal twin brother Mark who lived in Florida. Police were able to rule out any link between Mark Johnson and the murders.

Matthew Steven Johnson's mugshot in Mark of a Serial Killer.

Investigators learned that Matthew Steven Johnson’s scrapes with law enforcement began in his teens. In 1980 he was sentenced to four years behind bars for beating an Asylum Hill woman who was pregnant until she miscarried. Upon his release his crimes continued and he was sent back to prison.

Police eventually tracked Matthew Steven Johnson to a homeless shelter where he was arrested without incident. At the shelter authorities collected the suspect’s belongings including a pair of size 11 Timberland boots and Newport cigarettes.

At the station house police hoped for a confession. But the suspect steadfastly denied any guilt.

There was not enough evidence to link Matthew Steven Johnson with every case including Ladawn Roberts whose murder remains unsolved. He was charged with the murders of Aida Quinones Rosali Jimenez and Alesia Ford.

The case proceeded to a trial and in 2004 he was found guilty of the three murders. Matthew Steven Johnson 40 was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences.

HAS,Hasbro,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzE3L2hhc2Jyby1kb3VibGVzLWRvd24tb24tZHVuZ2VvbnMtYW5kLWRyYWdvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hasbro Doubles Down on Dungeons and Dragons,"Wizards of the Coast spotted a dragon-size opportunity -- and pounced.

On February 25 2022 Hasbro (HAS 0.41%) COO Chris Cocks leveled up to become the company's CEO.

Prior to that date Cocks had served as president of the company's red-hot Wizards of the Coast (WotC) business the division responsible for such hits as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and Magic: The Gathering (MtG). And he's done a phenomenal job with both divisions. Over the past two years alone data from S&P Global Market Intelligence confirms that WotC grew its revenues 72.5% to $1.4 billion -- twice Hasbro's overall 36% revenue growth rate. What's more overall Hasbro profits grew only 17% over the period -- but WotC profits skyrocketed 85%.

So does WotC sound like the kind of business that you'd double down on if you were Hasbro's CEO? Especially if you were personally responsible for the growth in that division? Of course it does.

And as it turns out this is exactly what Hasbro is doing.

Playing 4D digital D&D

Last month if you recall an activist investor in Hasbro urged the company to spin off and divest WotC as a way to unlock shareholder value in Hasbro stock. Hasbro declined and not just that but last week Hasbro announced it will expand its exposure to Dungeons & Dragons by buying D&D Beyond from its parent company Fandom and officially bringing D&D Beyond under the WotC corporate umbrella.

Players of the popular role-playing game may have thought D&D Beyond was already a Hasbro property but it wasn't being rather a subsidiary of Fandom and a sub-sub-subsidiary of private equity firm TPG Capital. D&D Beyond built its business as a distributor of licenses to various WotC rulebooks game modules and other resources in ""digitized"" form and also provided other online tools for playing the game.

As it turned out these tools proved especially valuable in the midst of a global pandemic that had millions of people working and playing from home. Now with the world slowly returning to normal it's logical to assume that D&D Beyond is slowing down after a period of hypergrowth -- a fact that may have given Hasbro an opportunity to negotiate a nice price to acquire the property: just $146.3 million.

Why buy a reseller?

Why would Hasbro want to own D&D Beyond outright? Over the past four years explains the company D&D Beyond has:

Grown to a staff of 80 creators.

Attracted a fan base of 10 million users.

Contributed to millions of campaigns played.

Built a database of millions of characters.

All of these are impressive numbers -- but the last may be the most important.

Consider: Tying 10 million Dungeons & Dragons players a bit closer to the company by bringing tools that they already use in-house may help boost customer loyalty. But bringing in-house the millions of characters that those users have devoted hours (days weeks and years) to developing and playing and getting attached to all creates a huge ""sunk cost"" that benefits Hasbro. It creates a strong disincentive to players for later switching to use some other online toolset for playing D&D.

And in fact Hasbro spoke directly to this assuring its customers that ""we have no plans to stop supporting D&D Beyond. The purchases you've made the characters you've created and the campaigns you've run aren't going anywhere."" All of that time and effort will continue to live on on WotC servers.

What it means in dollars and cents

Now was $146.3 million a fair price to pay? I think so. Although at its most basic level D&D Beyond is free to use the company charges for ""tiers"" of service costing up to $6 a month -- $72 a year or potentially as much as $720 million across a field of 10 million customers. Precisely how much revenue D&D Beyond actually collected hasn't been disclosed but Hasbro confirms that ""the royalty paid to Hasbro by D&D Beyond"" for the right to resell licenses to Hasbro properties ""has represented a significant contribution to the fastest growing source of revenue for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.""

Going forward Hasbro will get to keep all of that money. It will have the ability to hike prices and make even more money. And with D&D Beyond's technology in-house Hasbro should be able to duplicate the successful platform to support other role-playing games potentially creating even more revenue streams.

No wonder then that Hasbro was able to assure investors: Not only will the $146.3 payment to acquire D&D Beyond ""be immaterial to revenue and earnings per share in 2022"" but it will be ""accretive to earnings per share in fiscal year 2023 and beyond.""

Thanks to this acquisition Hasbro has the potential to grow to level 20...and Beyond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWNrZXJpbmdteXRoLmNvbS9oYXNicm8tdW52ZWlscy1uZXctdHJhbnNmb3JtZXJzLWdlbmVyYXRpb25zLWxlZ2FjeS1maWd1cmVzLWFuZC1zaGF0dGVyZWQtZ2xhc3MtdWx0cmEtbWFnbnVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hasbro unveils new Transformers: Generations Legacy figures and Shattered Glass Ultra Magnus,"Hasbro has unveiled the latest additions to its Transformers: Generations Legacy line which includes Elita-1 Tarantulus Knock-Out Wild Rider Blitzwing Jhiaxus and Motormaster figures along with an alternate universe Shattered Glass Ultra Magnus.

The vehicle joined the company’s “Classics” line which previously offered more retro toys including all four Ghostbusters the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and Slimer.

If you somehow managed to come away from the release empty-handed you’ll want to listen up as we’ve just caught wind of a restock beginning to arrive in-store at Walmart locations across the United States!





Ghostbusters News Instagram follower @viva_90s was the first to send us the news and provide the following photos.

The restock is pretty baron unlike last year which saw a wide assortment of Hasbro Ghostbusters toys being released alongside the Ecto. From what can be seen there’s no designated area for the vehicle so if you find yourself in the Walmart toy isles best be searching high and low!

With no new toys revealed since March of last year we’re still awaiting confirmation regarding the future of Hasbro’s Kenner Classics Real Ghostbusters line.

For some added fun we got our hands on a second Kenner Classics Ecto-1 turning it into Ghostbusters II’s Ecto-1A. You can find out complete conversion overview below.

It started with paper towels and toilet paper and sooner or later seemed to touch every merchandise category at least at my local supermarket.

It still does. Where has all the Tropicana orange juice gone? And the Jarritos pineapple and lime soda? A couple of weeks ago I went looking for golden Sun-Maid raisins and found those shelves empty. Not only were the golden ones missing. So were the more common dark raisins.

But I didn’t suffer – there’s usually some workaround even if it’s not one’s favorite brand – until it came time to purchase my annual supply of Easter candy. My philosophy is why wait until April? It’s never going to get any fresher than it is in February; right after chocolate bunnies and their brethren replace Valentine’s hearts on store shelves.

I’ve been advised particularly by my judgmental wife and children that commercial sugarcoated candy doesn’t promote good health. So I foolishly didn’t purchase my entire season’s supply back then. I abstemiously bought one bag of Hershey’s milk chocolate eggs one box of yellow marshmallow Peeps and -- I can kick myself now – no more than three or four Russell Stover milk chocolate marshmallow Big Bunnies.

Don’t get thrown off by the name. At two ounces the bunnies couldn’t be considered big anywhere other than in the warped imagination of corporate America’s merchandizing and marketing mavens. But I wasn’t going for big. I wanted the prudent post-dinner treat. In that regard the Russell Stover Big Bunny does not disappoint. It’s essentially – not essentially it just is – marshmallow swaddled in surprisingly generous qualities of milk chocolate. Or to put it another more pedestrian way it’s a chocolate bunny with a marshmallow filling.

By the way we’re talking vanilla not chocolate marshmallow. Why do I feel the need to make the distinction? Simply as a public service. Russell Stover also manufactures a chocolate marshmallow Big Bunny. That’s chocolate marshmallow coated in milk chocolate. I’ve never gone for that configuration. In my opinion the chocolate in the marshmallow competes with the milk chocolate coating. I’ve never understood the fuss about chocolate ice cream either. I don’t care how chocolaty it is it’s never going to provide the concentrated flavor of actual chocolate.

But I’m talking as if I had a choice. I suffered a near panic attack on my first February foray to the supermarket when I couldn’t locate the Big Bunnies. I feared some executive in the home office probably a fruit eater had decided to cut back on the variety of Easter merchandize not realizing that Russell Stover had managed to catch lightening in a bottle with the milk chocolate vanilla marshmallow Big Bunny.

It was only after I rooted around the novelty holiday candy aisle – not to be confused with the year-round candy aisle – that I found what I was looking for. It was shoved in the back of the shelf out of sight and there were only a few left. If I’d known those were the lone survivors of the species I would have bought every last one.

The next time I returned all trace of them had vanished. Obviously other shoppers know a good thing when they see it. The rabbits hadn’t been restocked and Easter was still a month or two away. What gives? Or rather gave? Was it a supply chain bottleneck or something darker? The problem may rest with the manufacturer underestimating consumers’ appetite for Big Bunnies because I haven’t been able to find them anywhere else. Believe me I’ve tried. CVS. Duane Reade. Other supermarkets. Both in New York City and upstate.

Big Bunnies aren’t the only treats conspiring to deny me Easter candy bliss. I believe I mentioned marshmallow Peeps. In the same way that I consider chocolate marshmallow chocolate bunnies sacrilegious I just can’t get myself to consume peeps in any color other than yellow. I’m knowledgeable enough a consumer to know there’s probably no flavor difference between a yellow peep and a purple blue red or green one. It’s all food coloring. But any color besides lemony yellow just doesn’t feel authentic.

Aren’t real live chicks yellow? Isn’t that the point the model the avatar the paragon? Why am I raising the issue? Because when I returned to the supermarket again and again not only were the Russell Stover milk chocolate Big Bunnies all gone. So were the yellow Peeps. Catastrophe piling on catastrophe. I’m sorry but I’d rather go without than sink my teeth into a Peep sporting some otherworldly hue.

Fortunately I’m not totally dependent on commercial Easter candy. The supermarket stuff is merely an amuse bouche an opening act. I buy my solid chocolate bunnies – and I’m taking dictionary definition “Big Bunny” -- at Vasilow’s an old-fashioned tin ceiling candy store in Hudson NY. They’re not just for me; I’ve got children to think about. Having said that it’s hard to pry a Russell Stover Big Bunny from my hands no matter how much I love you. I also stock up on Vasilow’s eggs. I already have enough Hershey’s eggs to get me through the Fourth of July. It’s just that Vasilow’s foil wrapped eggs are so pretty.

You may get the biggest candy haul of the year on Halloween but many Americans agree Easter actually has the best candy.

According to a recent Instacart survey of more than 2000 Americans more than half of respondents (65%) say Easter has the best seasonal candy. But which treats are the best of the best?

Instacart delved into its data to create a ranking of America’s Favorite Easter Candies and chocolate treats are hopping away with the majority of spots.

The top spot on the list belongs to a treat that will forever be associated with Easter: the Cadbury Creme Egg. It’s followed by Reese’s Peanut Butter Eggs which some swear are actually better than a standard Reese’s cup.

Starburst’s Easter Jelly Beans were the most popular non-chocolate option at No. 3 followed by Brach’s Jelly Bird Eggs at No. 8 and PEEPS Yellow Marshmallow Chicks at No. 9.

The 10 most popular Easter candies according to Instacart are ranked below.

Cadbury Creme Egg Reese’s Peanut Butter Eggs Starburst’s Easter Jelly Beans Cadbury Chocolate Mini Eggs Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Kisses M&M’s Easter Milk Chocolate Candy Lindt Milk Chocolate Bunny Brach’s Jelly Bird Eggs PEEPS Yellow Marshmallow Chicks Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Candy Eggs

If you break it down state by state 24 claimed the Cadbury Easter Creme Egg as the best Easter candy. Reese’s Peanut Butter Eggs were close behind the favorite of 20 states. Together the two candies accounted for the most popular sweets in 88% of the U.S.

Graphic courtesy of Instacart

There’s a clear divide across the country too. The West Coast and much of the South appear to prefer Cadbury Creme Eggs but Midwesterners clearly love their Reese’s Peanut Butter Eggs.

While Cadbury and Reese’s eggs were the clear favorites a handful of states preferred Starburst Easter Jelly Beans (Five) and Cadbury Chocolate Mini Eggs (two).

PEEPS and jelly beans appear to have more haters than fans though. A third of Americans (33%) said marshmallow chicks are among their least favorite Easter candies while 24% said jelly beans are among their least favorite. Both marshmallow chicks and jelly beans however saw the biggest sales growth in the two weeks leading up to Easter growing by 111% and 109% respectively according to Instacart.

Instacart’s survey conducted by the Harris Poll also found 77% of Americans will either “absolutely” or “probably” buy Easter candy this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZ3VpbHR5ZWF0cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8xNy84LWJlc3QtZm9vZC1tYWtldXAtY29sbGVjdGlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Makeup: 8 of the best foodie inspired beauty collections,Next.

While families around the world celebrate Easter Ramadan and Passover for many Palestinians there will be empty seats at the dinner table. For Um Nasser Abu Hmeid from Amari Camp in Ramallah four of her sons are missing as they languish in Israeli jails.

This Palestinian Prisoner’s Day the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC) the largest coalition in Palestinian society proudly reaffirms our unwavering solidarity with all Palestinian political prisoners in apartheid Israel’s prisons and detention centers.

We call on our supporters to take meaningful action today by escalating all BDS campaigns to isolate apartheid Israel’s regime of oppression and to pressure corporations that are deeply involved in Israel’s violations of prisoners’ human rights.

We especially call for escalating the #BoycottHP and #StopG4S campaigns. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) continues to provide services to Israeli prisons despite full knowledge of Israel’s grave human rights abuses. G4S owned by Allied Universal continues to be complicit in violations of international law through its 25 percent stake in Policity Corporation Israel’s national police training centre which trains officers in violent militarized tactics aimed at repressing Palestinians including tactics that lead to abuse and torture.

We also call for an end to the Deadly Exchange programmes between Israeli and US law enforcement entities in which “worst practices” are shared to promote and extend violent discriminatory and repressive policing in both countries. These include racial profiling massive spying and surveillance deportation and detention and attacks on human rights defenders.

Palestinian political prisoners in numbers:

According to the latest figures from Addameer the Palestinian Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association there are currently 4450 Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli prisons and detention centers.

This number includes approximately 530 “administrative detainees” denied due process and arrested on “secret evidence” that neither they nor their lawyers are permitted to see or refute in court. We salute the boycott of Israeli military courts by Palestinian administrative detainees.

Also held in Israeli dungeons are 160 Palestinian child prisoners from the ages of 12 - 17 and 32 Palestinian female prisoners - many of whom are mothers.

Mass arrests:

Since the beginning of the year apartheid Israel’s occupation forces have inflicted a campaign of collective punishment via violent mass arrest on the city of Jenin in the north of the illegally occupied West Bank. More than 200 of the city's residents have been arrested with 100 arrests taking place in March alone. According to the Palestinian Prisoners Club there are approximately 500 Palestinian political prisoners from Jenin in Israeli jails including three women and around 10 children.

Mass arrest of Palestinians is nothing new. According to a 2017 report by Addameer over the past 50 years more than 800000 Palestinians have been imprisoned or detained by Israel this figure is now believed to be closer to 1 million. This means that about 40% of Palestinian men and boys living under military occupation have been deprived of their freedom. Almost every Palestinian family has suffered the imprisonment of a loved one.

Take action:

Against this backdrop we have hope! With your help BDS campaigns are thwarting Israel’s brutal objectives and contributing to the creation of a more beautiful and just world.

To show meaningful solidarity with Palestinian Prisoners take the following 5 actions:

Lobby your government or parliament to impose a security and #MilitaryEmbargo on Israel. This includes cutting military funding in the case of the US and a ban on arms and spyware technology from Israeli companies such as NSO Group. Take the first steps towards declaring your community trade union association church workplace student government/union city council business or other organization an Apartheid Free Zone (AFZ) by excluding companies that are complicit in apartheid. These include companies listed in the UN database for involvement in illegal settlements and others like HP Caterpillar IBM AXA Hyundai Heavy Industries and G4S/Allied Universal. Boycott Israeli and international brands complicit in Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity. This includes all Israeli banks (Leumi Hapoalim etc.) and major multinationals such as: Elbit Systems HP G4S/Allied Universal AXA CAF PUMA Caterpillar General Mills/Pillsbury Hyundai Heavy Industries JCB Volvo Barclays Bank Alstom Motorola Solutions IBM and CEMEX. Boycott all academic cultural sports and tourism engagements in apartheid Israel or supported/sponsored by Israel (or its lobby groups and complicit institutions). Join a BDS campaign or a strategic Palestine solidarity group near you to act collectively and effectively.

Channel your anger strategically and mobilize to #DismantleApartheid and all forms of racism and oppression.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hlYmxvZy5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLXF1Yml0LWdhbWUtcXVhbnR1bS1jb21wdXRpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Qubit Game Lets You Click Into the World of Quantum Computing Directly from a Web Browser - TechEBlog,"

But it doesn’t stop there as the Hilton Group can even deliver customer vehicles to any specified location including race tracks and for motoring holidays abroad. The concierge service can have the vehicle ready for whatever the client desires anywhere they desire.

I wanted to offer a little context around this stay and review. After spending the day at a meeting and working in New York City my departure out of Newark NJ on United Airlines had been delayed several times and then ultimately canceled late in the evening. I wasn’t anticipating a stay in New Jersey initially but circumstances forced that outcome a common hazard of traveling.

As such this was not a calculated planned nor intentional stay – it was a consequence of traveling during thin operations. Had I intended to stay in the hotel this review would have likely involved more aspects of the property. However I assume that for this specific hotel many guests will find themselves spending a limited amount of time at the property and often unexpectedly following a flight cancellation.

Location

The longest mile and a half from Newark Liberty International Airport the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Newark Airport offers a free airport shuttle on the half-hour from 6 AM to midnight. It’s also accessible by car. Pickup for the shuttle service is at P4 on the AirTrain though drop-off is at the departure terminal for your flight.

I say that it’s the longest mile and a half because of the circuitous road routes the shuttle was forced to take around the airport. Even for avid walkers I would not recommend reaching the hotel by foot and taxis and rideshares will not be pleased with such a short run after waiting in a long line for a fare. The shuttle is the best option but if there aren’t enough seats you’ll be waiting another 30 minutes for the next one so be advised.

Property

This full-service hotel features a bar and restaurant an indoor pool (drained for renovations at the moment) and a fitness center. As a typical business hotel it offers room service free wifi for Hilton Honors members and parking for a fee for those who have a car rental or drive their own.

Hilton recently switched its breakfast benefit to a flexible daily credit that can be used in the evening. While I normally aim to use these benefits I arrived at the close of the Gateway City restaurant the night before and slept through the breakfast hours in the morning. I was given a room on the Executive Level which would have provided a continental breakfast regardless.

“Select Hilton Honors Members staying on the 12th floor will be able to start their day off right with complimentary Continental breakfast at our Newark hotel. The continental breakfast at our hotel in Newark is perfect for everyone. Join us Monday to Friday morning.” – Hilton

Starbucks operates a franchised location on-site.

Reflective tint on the windows and a mostly glass facade are showing their age (more on that shortly.) Some rooms feature an interior atrium view of the hotel while others can catch planes arriving and departing Newark’s runways.

Guest Room

At the front desk I was recognized for my Hilton Honors Diamond status. Available room choices for my stay were limited to two double beds or a king room I chose the latter. I was given a preferential floor and though I would have been granted an early check-in and check-out time of 2:00 PM I was only able to utilize the latter.

Upon entering the room I found a standard layout with updated room furnishings. The bathroom was to my right (as well as a closet.) For what it’s worth the bed was comfortable the desk was spacious and there were waters waiting for me in the room in addition to the pair of waters I received at the front desk.

In the light of day this window was initially terrifying. After getting a closer look I could see that the tint had an adverse reaction to the sun no doubt attracting a lot of heat. Oddly it was just this one pane but no doubt the hotel should swap this out if for nothing more than match the rest of the refurbishment of the room.

Bathroom

The bathroom was updated clean but plain. I prefer no tub at all and a glass door if I’m being picky. There was a secondary elevated soap bar ledge that seemed unnecessary. There’s no real complaints about the bathroom but it could be better. I probably wouldn’t have chosen this hotel based on design or out of an abundance of choice but in the prediacment I was in I didn’t hold that luxury.

Value

During my particular stay I had the choice of $152/night or 30000 points though I have seen the rates as high as $202. That gives a valuation of 0.5-0.67¢/point which is above my target of 0.4¢/point so this is a good (though not great) value to spend points rather than cash. If your Hilton Honors balance is high spend the points but it’s not a steal either.

In short the stay was brief and if I am stuck in Newark again I would consider this property but I am not racing back either.

What do you think? Have you stayed at this property? Do you have a recommendation for a better property at the same approximate price range?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdpcmVzLmNvbS9lbWJhc3N5LXN1aXRlcy0tLWVpZ2h0LW5ldy1leGNsdXNpdmUtcHJvcGVydGllcy1ieS1oaWx0b27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Embassy Suites - eight new exclusive properties by Hilton,"Bonnie Campagnuolo global head at Embassy Suites by Hilton declared:

Paris Hilton and her husband Carter Reum apparently still want to continue honeymooning across the globe. The couple married in November of last year and took off on a rather extensive honeymoon. Still very much in love the couple make it a point to celebrate their monthiversary. Of course it helps that with Paris’ last name comes exclusive access to top of the line hotels.

Paris used her connections to spend a couple nights at the Conrad Tulum Riviera Maya the new Hilton brand hotel in the region. By the way the fact that Hilton and Reum spent their 28 monthversary in the hotel puts to bed some of the rumors that indicated she didn’t spend nights in Hilton owned hotels.

Private Cenote Experience & Tips From Paris

Paris enjoyed quite a few perks throughout her stay including a private swim in a Tulum cenote. Although in the promotional video that she shot for the hotel it didn’t specify which cenote she was swimming at it was clear the area was closed off to ensure that she wouldn’t be disturbed. The hotel also organized a firework show on the beach at night for the couple. To allow them to commemorate their 28th monthversary.

In the video Paris gave out a couple of tips to still look like a Queen when you head to hot beach cities. Paris recommended that travelers bring wetsuits if they want to swim in Tulum cenotes. According to her it’s a great way to not get too cold. She also recommended bringing a sparkling headband so that even after a hot day at the beach you still look like a queen. While on the subject of dealing with a hot day another thing that can help is having an electric fan on you at all times.

Hilton Is Betting Big In The Tulum Region

The Conrad Tulum Riviera Maya hotel that Paris stayed at is one of the newest hotels in the region. It only recently opened its doors at the start of the year. The property features 349 rooms and the guests staying at the resort are going to be able to enjoy 5 pools directly on campus.

Also guests will be able to choose from a multitude of dining options. The resort is said to feature over 11 different restaurants and bars. Knowing this Paris seems like a perfect spokesperson for such a high end property. As mentioned the Hilton brand is betting big on the Tulum region.

It plans to open yet another property in the region by the summer months. This new property though may not get the Paris Hilton endorsement. The Hilton Tulum all inclusive resort is set to open this June. It’s expected that the price tag for rooms will be much lower than the rates that the Conrad Tulum is currently offering.

How Much Would It Cost To Vacation Like Paris?

The promotional video that Paris Hilton shot for Conrad Tulum is likely to have paid for her expenses on the property. How much would it cost though to vacation just like Paris? If you want to book the presidential suite which is likely the room Paris stayed at you can expect to pay around 3767 dollars a night. For that price you’ll get access to the 2000 square foot property that features a pool table and dining room area as well as a kitchenette and bar.

It’s a one bedroom suite but it’s understood that if you book the suite the hotel will allow you to have friends over. If not then why would the suite feature a dining room that sits up to eight people? If you’re on a lower budget you can book a suite on property for as low as 664 a night. You’ll be sacrificing some amenities with this lodging option though.

The upcoming location at the old Sweetbay Supermarket will look similar.

Lotte Plaza Market has filed plans with the City of Tampa to renovate the former Sweetbay Supermarket off Bruce B. Downs (BBD) Blvd. next to the Home Depot as it prepares to open what will be New Tampa’s largest Asian marketplace.

The renovation project on the 49432-sq.ft. building roughly 11000 square feet of which will be storage and cooler space will transform the inside of the former grocery store into a marketplace that sells Korean Chinese Japanese and Vietnamese food items and ingredients a wide selection of meats and fresh fish and seafood and a huge variety of fruits and vegetables not found at American grocery stores.

The Lotte Plaza Market also will include at least three restaurants in its food court as well as a bakery and a tea stand.

The renovations will cost roughly $4.5 million according to the plans. The owners of the small Maryland-based ethnic grocery store chain focusing on Asian groceries and goods purchased the old Sweetbay Market for $7 million in January of 2021.

The Sweetbay building closed in 2013 and has been unoccupied since. KNK Tampa Ltd. bought it in 2001 and leased it to Kash n’ Karry for a 20-year term beginning in November of that year. Kash n’ Karry operated under the lease until June 14 2006 when its Belgian parent company Delhaize America Inc. converted it into a Sweetbay. But despite its rebranding Sweetbay never gained the popularity of nearby Publix or Walmart stores.

In October of 2013 Jacksonville-based Bi-Lo Holdings bought 72 Sweetbay stores plus the leases to 10 other underperforming Sweetbay locations that had already been closed. One of those leases belonged to the New Tampa location which had six years remaining on it but Bi-Lo Holdings declined to do anything with the property other than pay the rent until the deal expired in 2020.

Founded in 1976 Lotte Plaza Market is considered to be one of the premier Asian and international groceries in Maryland and Virginia where it has 12 locations. The mini-chain also has one location in New Jersey and opened the only other Florida location in Orlando on W. Colonial Dr. in February 2019.

Lotte Plaza Market is hoping to open 50 new locations by 2030. — JCC",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vdGNibWFnLmNvbS93aWxsLXdvbWVuLXdpbi1pbi1oeWJyaWQtd29ya3BsYWNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Women Win in Hybrid Workplaces?,"The pandemic spawned a workplace shift that provides more flexibility. But women with C-suite aspirations will need to take greater ownership of their careers.

Sleep Number executive Melissa Barra embraced hybrid work long before the pandemic wreaked havoc on traditional office schedules.

Barra who joined Sleep Number in 2013 has been traveling for the past four and a half years between Minneapolis and Atlanta where her husband Jose is a senior vice president at Home Depot.

Being in a commuter marriage didn’t hamper Barra’s career. In 2020 Sleep Number CEO Shelly Ibach promoted Barra to executive vice president and chief sales and services officer.

“We are focused on creating a culture where everyone can bring their best self to work” Barra says. “We were at the very forefront of hybrid work way back in 2017 when [Sleep Number] moved from Plymouth to our downtown headquarters in Minneapolis.”

Born in Honduras Barra is one of the most prominent Latina executives in the U.S. and among the 4% of women of color who hold C-suite jobs in corporate America. The Women in the Workplace study conducted by McKinsey & Co. and Lean In showed in late 2021 that women occupy only 24% of C-suite positions. Some gender parity advocates are warning that women’s career advancement could be slowed if they take on even more child care and household responsibilities because of the flexibility afforded by hybrid work.

Barra’s sons are young adults. But she’s still aware that even as women enter the corporate pipeline at levels virtually equal to men they face multiple barriers to achieving equal job status at the top of corporations. Within Sleep Number Barra wants to ensure that women and men both will benefit from hybrid work schedules.

“All groups of employees on average prefer some form of hybrid arrangement” according to Kweilin Ellingrud a senior partner in the Minneapolis office of McKinsey & Co. and a national expert on women’s career status.

“Women prefer to spend more days working from home than men do as do employees with children and more junior employees” Ellingrud says in a March McKinsey publication. “The challenge is that if some workplaces make the return to work more flexible those with child care and elderly care responsibilities will likely come into the office less.”

The Women in the Workplace report indicates a higher portion of working women are burned out than men are. “In the past year 1 in 3 women has considered leaving the workforce or downshifting their careers” the report says. Burnout is particularly evident in what the report labels “double-duty caregivers” those caring for children and an elderly family member.

If women go into the office less than their male counterparts do Ellingrud cautions that “being less visible and less top of mind for step-up opportunities and promotions” could put talented women “on a slower career trajectory.”

Claudia Goldin a Harvard University economist says there are career promotion risks to women spending more time than men working remotely. However in a recent Wall Street Journal article Goldin says that working mothers in professional jobs can potentially benefit from schedule flexibility and technology. In particular she notes the pandemic has shown that virtual communication can replace business travel which can free up more time for family life.

At Minnesota corporations the shift to hybrid work gained altitude in the fall of 2021 after employees were vaccinated and took their summer vacations. Twin Cities Business conducted interviews with women executives at four public companies to learn how they are adapting to hybrid workplaces.

The women executives—all of whom have reached top management themselves—discussed what they are doing to leverage hybrid workplaces to help women climb the corporate ladder. They acknowledge that women may have to take more ownership of their career paths and be proactive in their relationships with mentors and sponsors to ensure they can achieve their goals.

At the four public corporations—General Mills Hormel Foods nVent and Sleep Number—women make up one-third or more of the executive management teams.

Creating your own path

While the hybrid environment may require women to be more intentional about their career moves Barra says she’s always been “very deliberate” about choosing companies that align with her values of “high integrity and high focus on consumers and on people.” Sleep Number she says always has promoted a “culture of individuality and inclusion.”

Those characteristics were evident in 2017 she says when Sleep Number introduced an approach called “Work for Your Day.” Employees gained “a significant amount of flexibility and the accompanying accountability to work when and where it made the most sense for their personal and professional productivity” Barra says.

When the pandemic hit the United States in March 2020 it meant that Barra then a senior vice president had to focus on reinventing the sales and services operations that had relied heavily on brick-and-mortar stores.

But Sleep Number employees already had some experience with hybrid work unlike most employees at public corporations. “Back in 2017 it was very much of an individual conversation between a team member and their leader” Barra says. “We didn’t have all of the elements that we have today when it comes to tools technology and practices. We made a big evolution in ‘Work for Your Day’ coming out of the pandemic.” Sleep Number has become more explicit about strategies to balance virtual and on-site work time Barra says and it recognizes that teams are in different stages of maximizing digital tools and schedule flexibility.

During her career Barra has traveled two paths that most corporate women haven’t taken. In addition to being in a long-term commuter marriage Barra stepped out of the workforce for five years after the birth of her first child.

Barra’s sons are now 20 and 22. “Even now 20 years later as I talk to my mentees across the organization or different colleagues and women that are in different parts of their lives I find that hybrid work has enabled them to make different choices” Barra says. “I might have made a different choice if I’d had the opportunity for more flexibility in my working hours.”

When she was ready to reenter the workforce in 2005 after full-time parenting a male manager hired her at Best Buy. “Instead of looking at it as a risk he saw an opportunity” Barra says. “He saw a person with ambition with potential and with a different life experience that would be additive to his team.”

In her business and home lives Barra is quick to adapt to changing circumstances. She was supportive of her husband accepting a job in Atlanta with Home Depot. “The intention was that he was going to commute to Minneapolis while we still had our younger son at home” Barra says. “My younger son decided that he wanted to move to Atlanta because he’s a competitive swimmer so he wanted to swim for a particular school.”

Barra is based in Minneapolis. However in addition to traveling to Atlanta to see her husband she also flies frequently to meet in person with her sales and services employees at Sleep Number stores around the country. She worked closely and rapidly with those employees during the early months of the pandemic. “We equipped them with iPads and different kinds of technology and systems and they used their digital tools to do what we call now ‘sell from anywhere’ ” Barra says. The omnichannel approach has driven growth over the past two years she adds because Sleep Number customers can easily buy products in store online or by phone.

“The pandemic has shifted traditional thinking about how people work” Barra says. “This is the case for men and women. We have transitioned as a society to focus on what is important which is our productivity our impact the outcomes of work as opposed to where the work gets done.”

She stresses that Sleep Number takes a “whole-person approach” with its employees which includes the employee benefits it provides. Among the offerings are paid parental leave parenting education child care services and adoption and surrogacy financial assistance.

“A lot of the investments that we’ve made over the last couple of years have been in making sure that there is sufficient support so that our team members can balance their personal and professional lives” Barra says.

“There is magic in coming together. What we had every team do is actually think about what are those moments that matter.” —Jacqueline Williams-Roll chief human resources officer General Mills

Office time that matters

General Mills reopened its Golden Valley headquarters Sept. 7 2021 with a new approach to employee schedules called “Work With Heart.” It’s designed to give employees more flexibility so they can meet their personal needs as well as carry out their work responsibilities.

“It’s really focused on results. It’s not about face time” says Jacqueline Williams-Roll chief human resources officer. “It is really about how the work gets done not where it gets done.”

Williams-Roll who joined General Mills in 1995 says the company asked every manager to talk with individual team members about the kind of flexibility that would work best for them. Then teams met to discuss when they thought it would make sense to work collectively—that is everyone being in the same physical space at the same time.

“There is magic in coming together” she says. “What we had every team do is actually think about what are those moments that matter—when you need to come together to create or to collaborate or to connect or to celebrate—that really bond us and make our culture special.”

General Mills didn’t mandate that employees be in the office a certain number of days per week. About 10 percent of its workforce was approved for “fully remote” work but Williams-Roll says those employees must come into the office four times a year to be with colleagues.

“We need to create a workplace that allows people to live their lives” she says. What happens if talented young women choose to work remotely more than their male peers? Could women hurt their career progression if their office time is too limited? “That’s a very legitimate concern” Williams-Roll says.

But she maintains that women—with or without children—can take steps in a hybrid environment to put themselves in a strong position to move through the corporate pipeline.

First she says she would ask an ambitious young female employee to define her goals and aspirations and the reasons for them. If the woman wants to secure a particular job she says she’d help her identify the kind of work experiences she would need.

She says she’d also tell the young woman “Here are the individuals who I think are important for you to get to know and for them to get to know you. They have influence in the organization and/or they have the right expertise or the right experiences to help you do what you want to do.”

For high-potential women she says it’s paramount that they can showcase their talents. “You need to be very thoughtful about getting yourself in those positions to demonstrate those experiences” she says.

As young women are building corporate careers she says they need someone who has their back. They also need one or two people who can provide honest feedback so they can learn what’s working what’s not working and what changes need to be made Williams-Roll says.

“I don’t think that you have to be in the office to do all of those things” she says. “I really don’t. But for some of them you do.”

She recommends seeking advice from those who’ve already succeeded in the corporate world. “What a mentor and a sponsor will do is to help you delineate where it’s important for you to be in the office and where it doesn’t matter” Williams-Roll says. “Sometimes it will matter.”

“Even if I’m here [in the office] on a Friday I know they have that ability to work from home.” —Jacinth Smiley executive vice president and chief financial officer Hormel Foods

Pandemic recruiting trip

Sometimes it matters if a business executive flies across the country for an in-person meeting.

Jacinth Smiley chief financial officer for Hormel Foods was on the receiving end of a pivotal meeting a little over a year ago.

A native of Jamaica Smiley had built a successful career in multiple finance roles and was working as a chief accounting officer in Texas. “I was contacted by a recruiter” Smiley says. “I was not looking at all for a role.”

The recruiter reached out on behalf of Hormel Foods and Smiley was intrigued by the job opening because she liked the company’s values.

“The second thing that happened is the fact that the CEO of the company came to Houston where I was” Smiley says. “He came there to encourage me to be interested in interviewing with the company.”

That personal overture captured her attention. She recalls Hormel CEO Jim Snee saying “I am going to sit down with you and look you in the eye because there is going to need to be a level of trust. And I wanted to make sure that I did that.”

Smiley learned from the recruiter that the Houston trip was Snee’s idea. “It was something he wanted to do” Smiley says. “The fact that the CEO wanted to do that with me a person of color in my mind spoke volumes.”

Smiley moved to Minnesota to become Hormel’s group vice president of corporate strategy in April 2021. She was promoted to executive vice president and CFO later in the year.

She notes that Hormel Foods doesn’t simply talk about the importance of diversity but it backs up its rhetoric with action. “The leadership is clear about being intentional about filling [open positions] with underrepresented minorities” Smiley says. “We are unapologetic about wanting to do that because that is the only way you are really going to change the face of the leadership and the face of the company.”

Smiley and Snee regularly work in the company’s headquarters in Austin Minnesota and they illustrate that it’s all right to be in the office daily after corporate America has jumped on a hybrid bandwagon.

‘Work From Anywhere Fridays’

Hormel rolled out a program last fall called “Ways of Working” when it moved to a hybrid work environment. That plan included “Work From Anywhere Fridays” giving people the opportunity to travel on a Thursday night for a long weekend.

“If you need additional flexibility you work it out with your manager” says Janet Hogan Hormel’s senior vice president of human resources. “Flexibility needs are personal. We are not all the same so we wanted people to get the flexibility they need while at the same time being able to progress in their career.”

Hogan says some Hormel employees took advantage of flexible schedules before the pandemic. But as company leaders were making plans to bring people back into the office last fall she says they informed the 1500 or so headquarters employees that flexibility was open to everybody.

Hormel didn’t set any uniform rules on when employees were expected to be in the office. “We wanted to make sure they understood that they could still continue to have flexibility if their children were sent home from school and they needed to be home with them while [the children] learned remotely” Hogan says.

“There are positions that do require people to be in the office more than three or four days a week” she says. “There are other positions where people can work from home four days a week. We allow the manager to make that decision.”

People with the same job descriptions may make different choices about where they want to do their work. “I work best when I’m here in the office” Smiley says. “So I haven’t used the flex Fridays as much as others may have used it.”

But she doesn’t expect her work team to follow her lead on Fridays. “Even if I’m here [in the office] on a Friday I know they have that ability to work from home” Smiley says. “I don’t have in-person meetings with them because I don’t want them to feel the pressure that I am here so they ought to be here.”

Snee Hormel’s president CEO and chairman “never went remote” according to Wendy Watkins senior vice president and chief communications officer. She adds that some other members of the senior management team didn’t shift to remote work in their homes either because it was simpler to work in their offices. Hormel has its own campus leaders could easily be socially distanced and most of them live within 10 minutes of the office.

Snee had another reason to keep working at Hormel’s headquarters which is across the street from the company’s flagship plant. “He wanted to make sure that as our production professionals went into the plant each day they at least saw his car in the parking lot” Watkins says.

“Mentorship meetings can be done remotely. At nVent we actually turn the camera on. It’s not just a phone call.” —Beth Wozniak CEO nVent

Blending work and family

In a St. Louis Park office complex senior executives of nVent a manufacturer that provides electrical solutions returned to their offices in the summer of 2021. They were followed by managers a few weeks later and other professional staff joined them in October.

“What we started communicating is we think on average that people will be in the office three days a week” says Beth Wozniak who became CEO of nVent in 2018 after it was spun off by Pentair.

Immediately top executives got questions about which days of the week employees should come into the office. They responded that their teams should decide what worked best for them.

The company retained designated workspaces for its office employees and didn’t track when employees were in the office. After employees reunited with their co-workers Wozniak says “people quickly saw that power of collaboration that they were missing.”

For her part Wozniak typically works in her office Monday through Thursday and works from home on Friday. “I’m starting to travel again so I’ll be out of the office more” she says.

While all employees can benefit from schedule flexibility Wozniak says it’s especially beneficial for work teams that include young mothers.

That’s the case with a work team led by Lynnette Heath executive vice president and chief human resources officer who has four daughters.

In previous years some women employees who were primary caregivers worried about the need to handle a family matter during a conventional workday Heath says. Now she notes it’s broadly acceptable for a woman to say to her employer: “I need to pivot and focus at home.”

Whether it’s young children or aging parents in a hybrid environment a woman can tend to personal and family needs and still complete her work assignments. “It’s not always going to be in the traditional [work] hours” she says.

“As long as the work is getting done they know it’s OK” Heath says. “I may pop in for a meeting for a couple of hours but then I need to be home and then I’m going to complete the project or task in the evening.”

The pandemic gave women—and men—an opportunity to contemplate what matters to them in their lives. Companies will lose out on employing talented women if they don’t acknowledge that the pandemic has shifted expectations about workplace flexibility and hybrid schedules she says.

Many women are thinking: “Yes I want my career. Yes I want to move up. But oh by the way my family life matters to me” Heath says. “So how do we make that work? Let’s have conversations around what is acceptable. What are the expectations? What do I need to do?”

Promotions in a virtual world

Wozniak is a rarity in the American workplace—a woman CEO of a publicly traded corporation.

A native of southern Ontario Wozniak earned a degree in engineering physics and built a leadership portfolio at Honeywell that spanned 25 years. She was named nVent’s CEO less than three years after she was hired by Pentair in 2015 for a key executive role.

Wozniak describes how she succeeded how she’s helping other women move up the career ladder and how the hybrid environment alters some career strategies.

“When I think about my career” Wozniak says “I was always someone who wanted to take on new challenges. And I knew that in taking on new challenges that I would learn and I would grow.”

A former competitive swimmer she confesses she’s always been a very goal-oriented person. “I knew that driving results or performance did matter. It always starts there for anyone” she says.

After talented women start to prove themselves in the workplace she says they can position themselves to learn from great leaders and to be sponsored by them to propel their career advancement.

“If I think about where we are today in a hybrid work environment I think those same things are very true” Wozniak says. “We have to look at performance and the quality of work.”

However she adds “I think it is up to individuals to ensure they are connecting [with people] and learning.” Wozniak says it would be a mistake for a high-potential woman to simply do good work remotely and fail to place a premium on communicating and interacting with her team colleagues and others in the company.

“One of our values here at nVent is respect and teamwork” she says emphasizing that “we want to grow together and learn from one another.”

Wozniak has mentored and sponsored many women during her career and she thinks connecting with them can be done effectively in person or virtually.

“I’ve mentored different women and I have retained those relationships” Wozniak says. “So often that is just a phone call or a Teams meeting. Whether I see them in a meeting or at a work event those relationships really do continue.”

At nVent she says she’ll follow up with her mentees to see how a new role is working for them compliment them on a presentation or do an overall check-in. When jobs come open Wozniak says she often chooses to sponsor or advocate for some of her mentees to make sure they are considered for career development opportunities.

“Mentorship meetings can be done remotely” Wozniak says. “In our environment at nVent we actually turn the camera on. It’s not just a phone call but you can see someone right? Because we are working in this hybrid way you are seeing someone in their home environment where you are seeing their dog run in. We can actually get to know one another a little bit better than we would have in an office environment.”

Turkey has delivered two T129 ATAK helicopters to the Philippine Air Force in its first delivery to a foreign country.

The attack helicopters were inducted into the Philippine Air Force after undergoing technical inspection and successfully passing flight tests.

In 2020 the Philippines ordered six choppers in a deal worth $280 million.

Turkey has previously exported defense equipment to the Philippines including armored vehicles light arms ammunition and night vision binoculars.

T129 ATAK Helicopter

The ATAK helicopter is a twin-engine next-generation aircraft that can be used in all weather conditions at a cost of over $50 million per unit.

Developed by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) the first flight-testing of the helicopter’s prototype took place in September 2009.

A derivative of the Italian-designed AgustaWestland A129 Mangusta the T129 is equipped with Turkish-developed avionics and weapon systems.

The TAI has delivered over 76 choppers so far to the Turkish forces with the number expected to reach 83 by the end of this year.

Pakistan Deal on Hold

Pakistan also planned to procure 30 ATAK choppers in 2018 however the deal couldn’t be implemented as the export license from the US still awaits clearance.

Turkey requires the export license as the helicopter’s engine has been jointly developed by the US-based Honeywell and British company Rolls Royce making it obligatory to obtain a permit for US military-grade commercial sale.

Turkey’s Booming Defense Sector

Turkey’s defense industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades as the country plans to reduce its foreign dependence in the defense sector.

The annual turnover of the local defense and aviation industry increased from $1.1 billion in 2002 to $10.9 billion in 2019.

Ankara’s defense export revenues also crossed $3 billion-mark in 2021 and are likely to reach $4 billion in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYW55LWNoYW5nZS1pbi1zb2NpZXR5LXN0YXJ0cy1mcm9tLWhvbWUtZm9sdWtlLW95ZWxleWUv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9wdW5jaG5nLmNvbS9hbnktY2hhbmdlLWluLXNvY2lldHktc3RhcnRzLWZyb20taG9tZS1mb2x1a2Utb3llbGV5ZS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Any change in society starts from home — Foluke Oyeleye,"Foluke Oyeleye is a director at Honeywell Group as well as an author.

She tells BLESSING ENENAITE about her 25-year career and book

You studied Combined Social Science as your first degree and also possess a Master’s degree in Business Administration. What informed your decision to study those courses?

As a teenager I was fascinated by history psychology and other social science subjects. So it was a natural path for me to pursue. The MBA on the other hand came after years of working in the corporate world. I knew that Harvard University United States of America (where I bagged the MBA) afforded me the opportunity to learn from the best and network with forward-thinking peers. It turned out to be a great foundation as I have gone on to build businesses and also contribute to strategic leadership at a number of organisations.

As a student were you more of a bookworm or a social person?

My experience in school was enlightening and enriching. I spent years immersed in a different culture and among people from across the world. This greatly expanded my worldview but also made me keenly aware of how blessed Nigeria is. To date I still have close friendships from my university days. Back then I was a bookworm. From an early age I read everything I could so I liked being in school. It was an opportunity to be surrounded by books.

What roles did your childhood or your parents play in your career choice?

My parents encouraged all their children by giving us access to books and the best education they could afford. Through the books I read I developed ideas about what I wanted to do for a career. In this sense I would say they played a great role by expanding my mind.

As a manager with over 25 years experience in telecoms financial and fast moving consumer goods sectors what has kept you going?

I was blessed to have developed a great work ethic even before formally starting my career. As a teenager my parents encouraged me to take on holiday jobs and internships. So I have always worked. Over the decades I have worked across different sectors so my career has always felt exciting to me. I have grown in these places and I have been incredibly blessed to contribute to various organisations. The joy of making positive contributions and also growing professionally is what keeps me going.

How do you combine your day job with your activities as an author in such a way that none suffers?

It is the same way one approaches all of life. One has to make time for one’s different interests even if it means putting in more hours. I have learnt to pursue interests I love while also ensuring my day job doesn’t suffer because I love it too. I believe in giving myself totally to anything I am interested in.

You run a mentorship programme for young people. What are some of the success stories you have recorded with that initiative?

I see mentorship as a two-way street. Rather than share the personal stories of my mentees I would rather talk about what I gain from the process. I consider it a blessing to be able to guide and support my mentees in the same way that others have supported me over the years. I find that mentees have valuable perspectives and insights that I can also draw from when it comes to certain things.

What motivated you to write books?

I have always loved writing. I remember scribbling in notebooks and on loose papers when I was a child. Still writing is a skill and talent one has to develop. While at Harvard I wrote about the late Chief Timothy Odutola (a successful entrepreneur) in an assignment that was later expanded into a Harvard Business School Case Study. HBS cases are used in business schools around the world so that experience was a very exciting one for me. I realised that not only did my writing have something valuable to offer other people it was also a channel for me to express my passion for cultural history. So I started thinking about writing the ‘I Am a Nigerian In…’ book series I am currently working on.

How do you think the reading culture in Nigeria can be improved?

I believe that any change in society starts at the level of the home. Developing a reading culture starts with parents sitting with their children discussing books with them and also letting children see them read. The more engaged parents are with books the more kids are likely to mirror the habit. It is also helpful to engage in non-reading activities that spark curiosity then build on them through books and other reading materials.

What is Tani Series?

It is a publishing company I founded in 2020 to publish books and other reading materials that will contribute to and celebrate Nigeria’s rich cultural landscape history and people.

Tell us more about the books in the ‘I Am A Nigerian In…’ collection?

My first two books are titled ‘I Am A Nigerian In Music’ and ‘I Am A Nigerian In Literary Arts.’ Each book features 15 Nigerians across different ages tribes and generations.

I Am A Nigerian In Music features stories of courage and creativity in 15 musicians including the Lijadu Sisters Oliver De Coque Don Jazzy Dan Maraya Jos and Fela.

I Am A Nigerian In Literary Arts shines the spotlight on 15 avid storytellers such as Chinua Achebe Sefi Atta and Dike Chukwumeje. They are all people whose poems plays and prose have enriched the world.

These are just the first of many books in the collection though I Am A Nigerian In STEM will be released in a few months time and follows the same pattern of sharing stories of Nigerian excellence. Beyond opening up a world of dreamers my books also contain additional information about places sectors and many more things Nigerian. I really want to engage the imagination (of readers) with these books so the stories are accompanied by beautiful illustrations.

What change do you want to effect in society with your books?

I want to build a world of dreamers and doers. I believe that stories of representation are vital in showing children and even adults the strides that have been made by others before them and the riches Nigeria has to offer in culture history and more. Through my books I want to inspire Nigerian children to embrace culture creativity and inspiration.

What would you describe as the toughest decision you have made on the job?

It is hard to pick one really. However I would say it is each time I have had to make a tough business decision because of things out of my control such as harsh economic realities and industry changes. It is often harder because it is not just about business for me. I care about the people who work with me and whose lives are impacted in any way by organisational decisions.

What is that one dream that you are still pursuing?

I am actively pursuing all my dreams and I know that as long as I am alive I will have new dreams as the years go by. When they come I intend to pursue them with all I have because I want to use every talent God has given me.

What is your advice to parents who do not believe in girl-child education considering the high number of out-of-school girls in Nigeria?

Every child deserves good education because it’s not just about learning to read and write. Education helps them learn how to think critically how to engage the world and how to build on the foundations and achievements of others who have gone ahead of them. Education expands one’s mind and worldview and I know that every child—every girl—deserves that.

But women with C-suite aspirations will need to take greater ownership of their careers.

Sleep Number executive Melissa Barra embraced hybrid work long before the pandemic wreaked havoc on traditional office schedules.

Barra who joined Sleep Number in 2013 has been traveling for the past four and a half years between Minneapolis and Atlanta where her husband Jose is a senior vice president at Home Depot.

Being in a commuter marriage didn’t hamper Barra’s career. In 2020 Sleep Number CEO Shelly Ibach promoted Barra to executive vice president and chief sales and services officer.

“We are focused on creating a culture where everyone can bring their best self to work” Barra says. “We were at the very forefront of hybrid work way back in 2017 when [Sleep Number] moved from Plymouth to our downtown headquarters in Minneapolis.”

Born in Honduras Barra is one of the most prominent Latina executives in the U.S. and among the 4% of women of color who hold C-suite jobs in corporate America. The Women in the Workplace study conducted by McKinsey & Co. and Lean In showed in late 2021 that women occupy only 24% of C-suite positions. Some gender parity advocates are warning that women’s career advancement could be slowed if they take on even more child care and household responsibilities because of the flexibility afforded by hybrid work.

Barra’s sons are young adults. But she’s still aware that even as women enter the corporate pipeline at levels virtually equal to men they face multiple barriers to achieving equal job status at the top of corporations. Within Sleep Number Barra wants to ensure that women and men both will benefit from hybrid work schedules.

“All groups of employees on average prefer some form of hybrid arrangement” according to Kweilin Ellingrud a senior partner in the Minneapolis office of McKinsey & Co. and a national expert on women’s career status.

“Women prefer to spend more days working from home than men do as do employees with children and more junior employees” Ellingrud says in a March McKinsey publication. “The challenge is that if some workplaces make the return to work more flexible those with child care and elderly care responsibilities will likely come into the office less.”

The Women in the Workplace report indicates a higher portion of working women are burned out than men are. “In the past year 1 in 3 women has considered leaving the workforce or downshifting their careers” the report says. Burnout is particularly evident in what the report labels “double-duty caregivers” those caring for children and an elderly family member.

If women go into the office less than their male counterparts do Ellingrud cautions that “being less visible and less top of mind for step-up opportunities and promotions” could put talented women “on a slower career trajectory.”

Claudia Goldin a Harvard University economist says there are career promotion risks to women spending more time than men working remotely. However in a recent Wall Street Journal article Goldin says that working mothers in professional jobs can potentially benefit from schedule flexibility and technology. In particular she notes the pandemic has shown that virtual communication can replace business travel which can free up more time for family life.

At Minnesota corporations the shift to hybrid work gained altitude in the fall of 2021 after employees were vaccinated and took their summer vacations. Twin Cities Business conducted interviews with women executives at four public companies to learn how they are adapting to hybrid workplaces.

The women executives—all of whom have reached top management themselves—discussed what they are doing to leverage hybrid workplaces to help women climb the corporate ladder. They acknowledge that women may have to take more ownership of their career paths and be proactive in their relationships with mentors and sponsors to ensure they can achieve their goals.

At the four public corporations—General Mills Hormel Foods nVent and Sleep Number—women make up one-third or more of the executive management teams.

Creating your own path

While the hybrid environment may require women to be more intentional about their career moves Barra says she’s always been “very deliberate” about choosing companies that align with her values of “high integrity and high focus on consumers and on people.” Sleep Number she says always has promoted a “culture of individuality and inclusion.”

Those characteristics were evident in 2017 she says when Sleep Number introduced an approach called “Work for Your Day.” Employees gained “a significant amount of flexibility and the accompanying accountability to work when and where it made the most sense for their personal and professional productivity” Barra says.

When the pandemic hit the United States in March 2020 it meant that Barra then a senior vice president had to focus on reinventing the sales and services operations that had relied heavily on brick-and-mortar stores.

But Sleep Number employees already had some experience with hybrid work unlike most employees at public corporations. “Back in 2017 it was very much of an individual conversation between a team member and their leader” Barra says. “We didn’t have all of the elements that we have today when it comes to tools technology and practices. We made a big evolution in ‘Work for Your Day’ coming out of the pandemic.” Sleep Number has become more explicit about strategies to balance virtual and on-site work time Barra says and it recognizes that teams are in different stages of maximizing digital tools and schedule flexibility.

During her career Barra has traveled two paths that most corporate women haven’t taken. In addition to being in a long-term commuter marriage Barra stepped out of the workforce for five years after the birth of her first child.

Barra’s sons are now 20 and 22. “Even now 20 years later as I talk to my mentees across the organization or different colleagues and women that are in different parts of their lives I find that hybrid work has enabled them to make different choices” Barra says. “I might have made a different choice if I’d had the opportunity for more flexibility in my working hours.”

When she was ready to reenter the workforce in 2005 after full-time parenting a male manager hired her at Best Buy. “Instead of looking at it as a risk he saw an opportunity” Barra says. “He saw a person with ambition with potential and with a different life experience that would be additive to his team.”

In her business and home lives Barra is quick to adapt to changing circumstances. She was supportive of her husband accepting a job in Atlanta with Home Depot. “The intention was that he was going to commute to Minneapolis while we still had our younger son at home” Barra says. “My younger son decided that he wanted to move to Atlanta because he’s a competitive swimmer so he wanted to swim for a particular school.”

Barra is based in Minneapolis. However in addition to traveling to Atlanta to see her husband she also flies frequently to meet in person with her sales and services employees at Sleep Number stores around the country. She worked closely and rapidly with those employees during the early months of the pandemic. “We equipped them with iPads and different kinds of technology and systems and they used their digital tools to do what we call now ‘sell from anywhere’ ” Barra says. The omnichannel approach has driven growth over the past two years she adds because Sleep Number customers can easily buy products in store online or by phone.

“The pandemic has shifted traditional thinking about how people work” Barra says. “This is the case for men and women. We have transitioned as a society to focus on what is important which is our productivity our impact the outcomes of work as opposed to where the work gets done.”

She stresses that Sleep Number takes a “whole-person approach” with its employees which includes the employee benefits it provides. Among the offerings are paid parental leave parenting education child care services and adoption and surrogacy financial assistance.

“A lot of the investments that we’ve made over the last couple of years have been in making sure that there is sufficient support so that our team members can balance their personal and professional lives” Barra says.

“There is magic in coming together. What we had every team do is actually think about what are those moments that matter.” —Jacqueline Williams-Roll chief human resources officer General Mills

Office time that matters

General Mills reopened its Golden Valley headquarters Sept. 7 2021 with a new approach to employee schedules called “Work With Heart.” It’s designed to give employees more flexibility so they can meet their personal needs as well as carry out their work responsibilities.

“It’s really focused on results. It’s not about face time” says Jacqueline Williams-Roll chief human resources officer. “It is really about how the work gets done not where it gets done.”

Williams-Roll who joined General Mills in 1995 says the company asked every manager to talk with individual team members about the kind of flexibility that would work best for them. Then teams met to discuss when they thought it would make sense to work collectively—that is everyone being in the same physical space at the same time.

“There is magic in coming together” she says. “What we had every team do is actually think about what are those moments that matter—when you need to come together to create or to collaborate or to connect or to celebrate—that really bond us and make our culture special.”

General Mills didn’t mandate that employees be in the office a certain number of days per week. About 10 percent of its workforce was approved for “fully remote” work but Williams-Roll says those employees must come into the office four times a year to be with colleagues.

“We need to create a workplace that allows people to live their lives” she says. What happens if talented young women choose to work remotely more than their male peers? Could women hurt their career progression if their office time is too limited? “That’s a very legitimate concern” Williams-Roll says.

But she maintains that women—with or without children—can take steps in a hybrid environment to put themselves in a strong position to move through the corporate pipeline.

First she says she would ask an ambitious young female employee to define her goals and aspirations and the reasons for them. If the woman wants to secure a particular job she says she’d help her identify the kind of work experiences she would need.

She says she’d also tell the young woman “Here are the individuals who I think are important for you to get to know and for them to get to know you. They have influence in the organization and/or they have the right expertise or the right experiences to help you do what you want to do.”

For high-potential women she says it’s paramount that they can showcase their talents. “You need to be very thoughtful about getting yourself in those positions to demonstrate those experiences” she says.

As young women are building corporate careers she says they need someone who has their back. They also need one or two people who can provide honest feedback so they can learn what’s working what’s not working and what changes need to be made Williams-Roll says.

“I don’t think that you have to be in the office to do all of those things” she says. “I really don’t. But for some of them you do.”

She recommends seeking advice from those who’ve already succeeded in the corporate world. “What a mentor and a sponsor will do is to help you delineate where it’s important for you to be in the office and where it doesn’t matter” Williams-Roll says. “Sometimes it will matter.”

“Even if I’m here [in the office] on a Friday I know they have that ability to work from home.” —Jacinth Smiley executive vice president and chief financial officer Hormel Foods

Pandemic recruiting trip

Sometimes it matters if a business executive flies across the country for an in-person meeting.

Jacinth Smiley chief financial officer for Hormel Foods was on the receiving end of a pivotal meeting a little over a year ago.

A native of Jamaica Smiley had built a successful career in multiple finance roles and was working as a chief accounting officer in Texas. “I was contacted by a recruiter” Smiley says. “I was not looking at all for a role.”

The recruiter reached out on behalf of Hormel Foods and Smiley was intrigued by the job opening because she liked the company’s values.

“The second thing that happened is the fact that the CEO of the company came to Houston where I was” Smiley says. “He came there to encourage me to be interested in interviewing with the company.”

That personal overture captured her attention. She recalls Hormel CEO Jim Snee saying “I am going to sit down with you and look you in the eye because there is going to need to be a level of trust. And I wanted to make sure that I did that.”

Smiley learned from the recruiter that the Houston trip was Snee’s idea. “It was something he wanted to do” Smiley says. “The fact that the CEO wanted to do that with me a person of color in my mind spoke volumes.”

Smiley moved to Minnesota to become Hormel’s group vice president of corporate strategy in April 2021. She was promoted to executive vice president and CFO later in the year.

She notes that Hormel Foods doesn’t simply talk about the importance of diversity but it backs up its rhetoric with action. “The leadership is clear about being intentional about filling [open positions] with underrepresented minorities” Smiley says. “We are unapologetic about wanting to do that because that is the only way you are really going to change the face of the leadership and the face of the company.”

Smiley and Snee regularly work in the company’s headquarters in Austin Minnesota and they illustrate that it’s all right to be in the office daily after corporate America has jumped on a hybrid bandwagon.

‘Work From Anywhere Fridays’

Hormel rolled out a program last fall called “Ways of Working” when it moved to a hybrid work environment. That plan included “Work From Anywhere Fridays” giving people the opportunity to travel on a Thursday night for a long weekend.

“If you need additional flexibility you work it out with your manager” says Janet Hogan Hormel’s senior vice president of human resources. “Flexibility needs are personal. We are not all the same so we wanted people to get the flexibility they need while at the same time being able to progress in their career.”

Hogan says some Hormel employees took advantage of flexible schedules before the pandemic. But as company leaders were making plans to bring people back into the office last fall she says they informed the 1500 or so headquarters employees that flexibility was open to everybody.

Hormel didn’t set any uniform rules on when employees were expected to be in the office. “We wanted to make sure they understood that they could still continue to have flexibility if their children were sent home from school and they needed to be home with them while [the children] learned remotely” Hogan says.

“There are positions that do require people to be in the office more than three or four days a week” she says. “There are other positions where people can work from home four days a week. We allow the manager to make that decision.”

People with the same job descriptions may make different choices about where they want to do their work. “I work best when I’m here in the office” Smiley says. “So I haven’t used the flex Fridays as much as others may have used it.”

But she doesn’t expect her work team to follow her lead on Fridays. “Even if I’m here [in the office] on a Friday I know they have that ability to work from home” Smiley says. “I don’t have in-person meetings with them because I don’t want them to feel the pressure that I am here so they ought to be here.”

Snee Hormel’s president CEO and chairman “never went remote” according to Wendy Watkins senior vice president and chief communications officer. She adds that some other members of the senior management team didn’t shift to remote work in their homes either because it was simpler to work in their offices. Hormel has its own campus leaders could easily be socially distanced and most of them live within 10 minutes of the office.

Snee had another reason to keep working at Hormel’s headquarters which is across the street from the company’s flagship plant. “He wanted to make sure that as our production professionals went into the plant each day they at least saw his car in the parking lot” Watkins says.

“Mentorship meetings can be done remotely. At nVent we actually turn the camera on. It’s not just a phone call.” —Beth Wozniak CEO nVent

Blending work and family

In a St. Louis Park office complex senior executives of nVent a manufacturer that provides electrical solutions returned to their offices in the summer of 2021. They were followed by managers a few weeks later and other professional staff joined them in October.

“What we started communicating is we think on average that people will be in the office three days a week” says Beth Wozniak who became CEO of nVent in 2018 after it was spun off by Pentair.

Immediately top executives got questions about which days of the week employees should come into the office. They responded that their teams should decide what worked best for them.

The company retained designated workspaces for its office employees and didn’t track when employees were in the office. After employees reunited with their co-workers Wozniak says “people quickly saw that power of collaboration that they were missing.”

For her part Wozniak typically works in her office Monday through Thursday and works from home on Friday. “I’m starting to travel again so I’ll be out of the office more” she says.

While all employees can benefit from schedule flexibility Wozniak says it’s especially beneficial for work teams that include young mothers.

That’s the case with a work team led by Lynnette Heath executive vice president and chief human resources officer who has four daughters.

In previous years some women employees who were primary caregivers worried about the need to handle a family matter during a conventional workday Heath says. Now she notes it’s broadly acceptable for a woman to say to her employer: “I need to pivot and focus at home.”

Whether it’s young children or aging parents in a hybrid environment a woman can tend to personal and family needs and still complete her work assignments. “It’s not always going to be in the traditional [work] hours” she says.

“As long as the work is getting done they know it’s OK” Heath says. “I may pop in for a meeting for a couple of hours but then I need to be home and then I’m going to complete the project or task in the evening.”

The pandemic gave women—and men—an opportunity to contemplate what matters to them in their lives. Companies will lose out on employing talented women if they don’t acknowledge that the pandemic has shifted expectations about workplace flexibility and hybrid schedules she says.

Many women are thinking: “Yes I want my career. Yes I want to move up. But oh by the way my family life matters to me” Heath says. “So how do we make that work? Let’s have conversations around what is acceptable. What are the expectations? What do I need to do?”

Promotions in a virtual world

Wozniak is a rarity in the American workplace—a woman CEO of a publicly traded corporation.

A native of southern Ontario Wozniak earned a degree in engineering physics and built a leadership portfolio at Honeywell that spanned 25 years. She was named nVent’s CEO less than three years after she was hired by Pentair in 2015 for a key executive role.

Wozniak describes how she succeeded how she’s helping other women move up the career ladder and how the hybrid environment alters some career strategies.

“When I think about my career” Wozniak says “I was always someone who wanted to take on new challenges. And I knew that in taking on new challenges that I would learn and I would grow.”

A former competitive swimmer she confesses she’s always been a very goal-oriented person. “I knew that driving results or performance did matter. It always starts there for anyone” she says.

After talented women start to prove themselves in the workplace she says they can position themselves to learn from great leaders and to be sponsored by them to propel their career advancement.

“If I think about where we are today in a hybrid work environment I think those same things are very true” Wozniak says. “We have to look at performance and the quality of work.”

However she adds “I think it is up to individuals to ensure they are connecting [with people] and learning.” Wozniak says it would be a mistake for a high-potential woman to simply do good work remotely and fail to place a premium on communicating and interacting with her team colleagues and others in the company.

“One of our values here at nVent is respect and teamwork” she says emphasizing that “we want to grow together and learn from one another.”

Wozniak has mentored and sponsored many women during her career and she thinks connecting with them can be done effectively in person or virtually.

“I’ve mentored different women and I have retained those relationships” Wozniak says. “So often that is just a phone call or a Teams meeting. Whether I see them in a meeting or at a work event those relationships really do continue.”

At nVent she says she’ll follow up with her mentees to see how a new role is working for them compliment them on a presentation or do an overall check-in. When jobs come open Wozniak says she often chooses to sponsor or advocate for some of her mentees to make sure they are considered for career development opportunities.

“Mentorship meetings can be done remotely” Wozniak says. “In our environment at nVent we actually turn the camera on. It’s not just a phone call but you can see someone right? Because we are working in this hybrid way you are seeing someone in their home environment where you are seeing their dog run in. We can actually get to know one another a little bit better than we would have in an office environment.”

Now North Carolina’s Retro Designs has taken a C2 Corvette and brought it into the 21st century with a series of significant upgrades and modifications.

The first thing of note about this C2 Corvette is that while it may look like most others you will see out on the road it actually has a custom-built frame using the underpinnings and suspension components from a C7-generation ‘Vette. This new chassis doesn’t just promise to transform the way in which the car drives and handles but it has also allowed Retro Designs to install a 6.2-liter naturally aspirated LS3 V7 with 430 hp coupled to a six-speed manual transmission driving the rear wheels.

A host of other significant mechanical changes have been made. For example the C2 Corvette from Retro Designs has independent rear suspension and upgraded Wilwood brakes at all four corners ensuring that it can brake just as well as it can accelerate thanks to that modern V8. A three-inch stainless steel exhaust has also been fitted.

Viewed from the outside some aspects of the car immediately catch the eye. Most notable are the chrome Beyern Spartan wheels Nitto Motivo tires and the aforementioned rear brake calipers.

Retro Designs didn’t call it quits there. According to the company it also spent hundreds of hours restoring and remodeling the car’s interior trimming it in new black leather and revising the shape of the seats to make them more comfortable. A more modern center console is also featured and the classic muscle car rocks an upgraded sound system with Bluetooth connectivity.

“Our goal at Retro Designs is to bring classic cars back to life and allow clients to enjoy them safely without any of the issues that can come up with driving a vintage restoration” Retro Designs general manager Daniel Valjevac said. “Our new 1965 C2 Sting Ray is a car that came to us from a client that wanted a custom with all the beautiful styling of the C2 in a car that could be driven in modern conditions.”

Best Home Printer

These days even for home printers mere printing just isn’t enough.

For this year’s Home printer category the printers chosen had to be able to meet the modern needs of a typical home user. We looked at All-In-One (AIO) printers able to print copy scan and allow app-based printing and other functionality. They would also have to be priced strategically at about S$400 to please homeowners without too much upfront cost. And while we would like to have ADF functionality we're glad to give it up and relegate that to the SOHO printer category.

Since we only qualify models released in the last 12 months at the time of assessment and that printer brands don't refresh their models as often as they used to we've managed to only qualify two brands in this segment. This year they both happened to be ink-tank based printers that are becoming common as manufacturers are doing more to help reduce running costs.

For this category new assessment areas include sizing up their footprint as space at home could be at a premium. Features and connectivity options were also important criteria. The useability of the app for home use was also key. These are in addition to the overall price of the printer print speed print quality and cost of printing which are all key ingredients of what people want out of a printer.

Nominees:

Canon Pixma G670

HP Smart Tank 720

And the winner is...

What we liked about the HP Smart Tank 720 was the speed its Smart Tank technology and the ease of setting it up. We had no problems connecting it to our test PC and the app itself had features for kids families and adults.

We don't like the limited dual-line display that the HP Smart Tank 720 comes with. That's not to say it doesn’t do the job because it is functional and performs most tasks even though it isn’t a proper LCD screen. We’ve never seen the value of having just two lines of text and information scrolling across the display especially in these days where managing things like network SSID passwords or even traversing options are a hassle. Sure there are now apps to help alleviate these pain points but sometimes you just want to be sure things are right at the source.

As a smart tank printer it uses HP ink bottles for printing. The bottles included with the printer can print 8000 pages in black and 6000 pages in colour. Replacement ink bottles cost S$14.80 for the high-yield black and each colour replacement. The high-yield black can print up to 6000 pages and the colour replacements can print 8000 pages each.

It was the faster printer in our tests and the quality of the prints didn’t disappoint as befitting an HP printer.

Our test results

The image quality was sharp and colours faithful with little bleeding or over-saturation and the text was crisp and sharp.

In terms of print speed the HP Smart Tank 720 was the fastest home printer. The Canon Pixma G670 was clearly slower in our tests but that is because the Canon is more a home photo printer than a home AIO workhorse.

As for scanning we only scanned a single test page as both printers lacked an ADF. The speed was what was expected for a single page where we needed to wait for the device to come out of sleep before starting. The scanned results were found to be crisp and clear.

To sum up the HP Smart Tank 720 churned out results as good as the Canon counterpart but bettered it in important areas like print speed and overall value. As we iterated earlier while we didn't quite like its on-device display the printer had dedicated button options for colour or black copies and to print multiple copies though a proper sized touchscreen LCD makes work so much easier. Probably that's one reason why HP could keep the costs down which worked to its favour in the end. It is the overall best in this comparison had good value and thus our 2022 recommendation for a home printer.

Scoring Breakdown Canon Pixma G670 HP Smart Tank 720 Design 7.0 7.0 Features 7.0 6.0 Print Speed 5.0 7.0 Print Quality 8.0 8.0 Value 5.0 6.0 Overall Score 6.0 7.0 Price S$499 S$359

Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) Communications Director Brock Juarez told Florida Politics Sunshine Health Plan paid the fine April 13 five days before it was due.

Meanwhile the ban on auto enrollment in the Medicaid managed care plan remains in effect Juarez said.

Medicaid Assistant Deputy Secretary Brian Meyer on March 17 sent a letter to Sunshine President and CEO Nathan Landsbaum advising him of the $9092025 penalty and other corrective actions the state was taking against the health plan after failing to pay the providers.

The state levied a $75 fine for each delinquent payment. Meyer said there were 121277 claims from health care providers in which payments were either delayed or not made at all. The claims were identified either through complaints made to the state from providers or by the health plan itself.

The $9 million fine is the largest the state has levied against a Medicaid managed care plan for contract violations since the inception of the Medicaid managed care program. Florida Politics first reported the historic fine on March 23.

Sunshine officials have previously stated that the errors were a result of a software issue following the company’s merger last year with WellCare which at the time of the merger had been the state’s second largest Medicaid managed care plan behind Sunshine. Previous news accounts detailed how for months Sunshine failed to pay providers for some of the state’s severely sick children that receive coverage as part of Medicaid’s children’s medical services portion. At least one provider shut down.

As of March 31 there were more than 5.18 million people enrolled in Florida’s Medicaid program which is an all-time high due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Medicaid rules involving the public health emergency.

Florida has a Medicaid managed care mandate for most people who qualify whether they are young or old. As a result of the managed care mandate there are 4075825 beneficiaries who were enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan as of March 31. No health plan has more Medicaid enrollees than Sunshine Health which dominates the market share with 38% of the enrollees. Sunshine’s footprint in the Medicaid managed care marketplace is larger than that of Humana Medical Plan and Simply Healthcare Plans the second and third largest plans respectively combined.",,,,,,,,,

An icon of America’s post-Vietnam sea power the USS Nimitz will soon leave active U.S. Navy service.

The United States Navy will retire the USS Nimitz a supercarrier and the lead ship of her class. The information came to light via a report from Jane’s.

U.S. Navy officials explained that “USS Nimitz (CVN 68) is planned to be removed from the battle force in fiscal year (FY) 2025 when the ship's Terminal Off-load Program begins with inactivation scheduled to begin in 2027.”

Initially the U.S. Navy had considered extending the carrier’s service life to maintain the Navy’s carrier fleet numbers as the service brings the new Gerald R. Ford-class carriers into service. However America’s sailing service backtracked when the costs of extending the USS Nimitz’s service life became clear.

The carrier has been in service since the mid-1970s and upon decommissioning will be one of the oldest carriers in U.S. Navy service.

“Upon decommissioning Nimitz will have served its country for 50 years spanning from Operation ‘Earnest Will' in the Arabian Gulf to its 11-month deployment in the Indo-Pacific and Middle East regions in 2020–2021” U.S. Navy officials explained.

“As the navy continues to accept Gerald R Ford-class carriers we will remain a ready agile force to compete and win around the world at any time.”

The brand-new Ford-class supercarriers the Nimitz-class’ successor are slowly coming online. The class’ lead ship the USS Gerald R. Ford completed explosive stress-testing late last year and recently took ammunition aboard for the first time.

Compared to the older Nimitz-class ships the Ford-class ships offer several operational advantages. Outfitted with a pair of newer higher-output reactors the carriers generate more electricity than the Nimitz-class is capable of.

And the Fords need more electricity—their electromagnetic aircraft launch system though offering the ships a higher sortie rate consumes a greater amount of electricity than the Nimitz-class steam-powered catapults.

Extra electricity generation will also allow the Ford-class to incorporate some of the U.S. Navy’s most cutting-edge weapon systems in the future—first and foremost laser weapon systems. Though laser weapon technology is highly energy-intensive nuclear reactors give lasers a virtually infinite magazine depth and a very low cost per shot. And though initially designed as a defensive weapon lasers could in theory be employed on carriers as an offensive weapon.

The Navy anticipates the USS Gerald R. Ford’s first operational deployment in late 2022 with the second of the class the USS John F. Kennedy having already been launched.

The shipyard building the carriers Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding has two other Ford-class carriers in production the USS Enterprise and the USS Doris Miller.

On the day IBM announced she’d be stepping down exiting CEO Ginni Rometty called Arvind Krishna “the right CEO for the next era” at the company. “He is a brilliant technologist who has played a significant role in developing our key technologies such as artificial intelligence cloud quantum computing and blockchain” she said.

Indeed Krishna has spent his entire professional career at IBM. The electrical engineering doctorate who has more than a dozen co-author credits on technology patents started at the company’s Watson Research labs in 1990. He stayed there for nearly two decades and later served as head of IBM’s cloud and cognitive software division. He helped orchestrate one of the company’s largest acquisitions in 2018 and took over as chief executive in April 2020.

Krishna’s appointment came after a period of stagnation at IBM—especially when compared with its Big Tech peers. As an early leader in artificial intelligence the company poured money and resources into its Watson division following the technology’s victory over human contestants on Jeopardy! in 2011. IBM also explored various ways to fashion Watson into a tool for doctors that might help them make treatment recommendations for their patients but the technology failed to deliver on its early promises.

IBM sold the assets of its Watson Health unit earlier this year but the company’s work with AI remains in full force. Now IBM is putting AI to work helping its client companies navigate the climate crisis efforts that gained it recognition as a TIME100 company this year.

Krishna spoke with TIME recently about what we can learn from IBM’s early AI missteps and what he sees as the company’s higher purpose.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Arvind I grew up in a town very close to IBM’s headquarters in Armonk New York. And in fact my very first class trip in kindergarten was to IBM’s campus in the early ‘70s. At the time IBM stood for a certain kind of innovation a certain way of working even a certain way of dressing for work. What remains of that old IBM DNA?

John great question and one that I’m really passionate about. I think there are some things at IBM that stand the test of time. You mentioned the people the culture the dressing the innovation. I think the innovation part stays true. The sheer technical expertise of our people that part stays true. But when we think about it you know you look at pictures. I came to IBM in 1990. I think about the ‘70s the scientists in lab coats with a suit and tie under it. That has gone. As a culture—as a nation not just as IBM—we are much more relaxed about how we dress and about all the inclusiveness because that unlocks the most from people.

Now what is new? The technologies that we work on change. Thirty years ago the value came from building physical computers. Now a lot of that value comes from building software and doing consulting meaning deploying the technology on behalf of a client. What has remained constant is technology that helps catalyze our clients’ business the expertise of our people and a lot of the culture of speed and nimbleness.

You’re one of many large-company CEOs who were appointed during the pandemic. Analysts have said that one of the issues with IBM before you took the helm was that top management was dominated by people with expertise in services and sales rather than in technology products. Do you feel like your appointment is an attempt to correct that?

I think the reason I got appointed was I had a clear vision for what the company should become focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. I had an aspiration that we are going to get back to growth. We have committed that this year: we will do 5% growth not counting the revenue from our spinoff of (IT infrastructure services company) Kyndryl. When you look at those aspirations those are more responsible for my choice than simply a background in one discipline or another discipline.

If I think of my role what do I do every day? Yes I spent a certain amount of time on strategy and products and decisions related to that. But I also spend a lot of time with clients and helping to make sure that we get checks coming in the door. I also spend a certain amount of time working with our partners. So it’s always a blend in my position across those different disciplines. The same was true for my predecessors. Now all that being said the speed and acceleration in the technology industry is increasing. So given the nature of the change having more of a depth of understanding of some of the technologies and their implications is probably helpful in decision making.

IBM was seen as a real leader in AI when Watson won Jeopardy in 2011. But then over the next decade or so a lot of the business hopes for Watson fizzled. What happened? And what lessons did IBM learn from that period?

I am one who’s completely unapologetic for what transpired over the last decade. Artificial intelligence is the only technique that we know that can harness and harvest all of the data that’s being produced. We know there is incredible value in all of it. Without AI you might be able to get to 1% of it. Winning Jeopardy was really a milestone. It really put AI on the map. [But] it’s no longer a lab toy. It’s no longer in the domain of a couple of smart professors at MIT or Stanford or Berkeley. It is something that could do something in the real world.

We can take credit for investing for putting hundreds of scientists at work to do that. When you take a technology and you convert it from the lab to doing something useful your imagination begins to run away in terms of all it can do. The market wasn’t quite ready in 2012 2013 2014 to begin to embrace and trust artificial intelligence in some of the more critical domains where we went.

The error we made was in going toward more critical things more things which have an impact on the real economy. Those who succeeded began to apply [AI] more in areas where it could be useful—you know if you make a slightly wrong recommendation for a book or a movie or a website that’s not life and death. I’ll acknowledge maybe we should have applied it to more areas that were less critical. Now that said you learn and you course-correct. Maybe we can help a quick-serve restaurant automate their auto-tagging. Maybe we can help enterprise applications be much friendlier. You need to start in areas that are much more contained not making life and death decisions. Let’s get there. Let’s get people to trust it. And then you can begin to scale like crazy. And that’s what we’re sort of doing now. So Watson is alive and well. But I think we shouldn’t try and do moonshots. We should try and do more measured steps.

(For coverage of the future of work visit TIME.com/charter and sign up for the free Charter newsletter.)

We’re throwing around a term that a lot of people think they know but I want to get your very simple dinner-party definition of what AI is.

Artificial intelligence is a technique whereby you learn from observed data. So think of the simplest example: how humans do pattern matching. And by the way AI is nowhere near as good as a 9-month-old human baby. You show them a dog three times the fourth time they’ll say dog. In AI maybe if you show it a million photographs of a dog the million and one time it would say that’s the dog. If A is observed and B happens and you show it a million such patterns it learns all those patterns together. That’s artificial intelligence.

But AI would not know gravity today. It would observe that an apple falls from a tree you show it a million such videos it will conclude that apples fall in that direction. But it will not conclude that pears fall in that direction. So things like knowledge I think are going to merge together and it’ll take some time.

IBM is doing a lot right now with AI and climate change. Can you talk a little about that?

We believe climate change is one of the topics that is imperative for us—our generation—to help make better for the next. So we have made commitments that we are going to be net zero without offsets but by 2030 not 2050 or 2060. As you begin to apply AI into this the whole question is how good is your data collection? Because if you cannot get all the right data you could be massively under- or overestimating how good you are. Can I maybe discover materials that are going to be much better at carbon sequestration? Also 30% of the energy we create is wasted. Can we optimize and get rid of that waste that will produce so much benefit for all of us? But also can we harness the spirit of open source? Can we create programs that incentivize people to create technology to help on climate change using artificial intelligence? We put those tools out and encourage people to do things we might help some of them get started in their own startups etc. Those are all things that we believe is part of our civic duty to get done.

Is IBM doing anything differently these days to attract a young workforce? Surveys show that many young people want to be working at a company that has a higher purpose. Is there a higher purpose at IBM?

So first some statistics. The last time I looked we have 3 million people in our applicant database. I feel pretty good about that. We do manage to hire tens of thousands each year. You absolutely have to have a purpose beyond the work itself.

Where we succeed a lot is we’re willing to take problems that are really hard and take years of persistence to get things done. An example I’ll take is quantum computing which has gone from being science fiction to where everything is now just science. It’s been a journey of 10 years; it’s also got probably another five to 10 years to go. So if you come to us and you want to work on quantum you know we’ll have the staying power to get through to where it’s very very successful. Back to your example of winning Jeopardy: that was a seven-year project from beginning to end. So if you like working on those kinds of things you love being around really smart people you like solving problems for clients that really make a big difference this is a great place to be. If you want to make a lot of money building the next mobile app or game this is probably not the right place.

The artificial intelligence that powers Amazon’s virtual assistant Netflix Spotify and other digital services use enormous computing resources to plow through massive amounts of data.

Israel’s NeuReality is slashing the high hardware costs and energy consumption required for AI processing. It has partnership agreements with IBM AMD and other computing powerhouses and is set to transform the AI landscape.

“Teaming up with NeuReality which brings a disruptive AI-centric approach to the table is the type of industry collaboration we are looking for” says Dr. Mukesh Khare Vice President IBM Cloud. “The partnership with NeuReality is expected to drive a more streamlined and accessible AI infrastructure which can enhance people’s lives.”

NeuReality has developed a new system architecture to connect the multiple chips used in artificial intelligence. It is designed to make AI processing easier and more efficient while making it affordable to existing AI users new industries and companies.

The technology promises to dramatically reduce the cost of computation and networking chips as well as energy consumption – by a factor of 10 in the short run and 50 in the longer term.

The game-changing platform which will be launched in 2023 targets public safety e-commerce healthcare retail and other high-volume uses of AI.

With its next-generation hardware and software the NeuReality’s architecture slashes the total cost of ownership and improves performance by easing the system bottlenecks created by the current architecture.

The company forecasts initial sales of $2.5 million this year based on its prototype and sees revenue growing to $30 million in 2023. The total market for AI chipsets will reach $75 billion by 2025 according to an estimate by Tractica a market intelligence firm.

A $20 million Series A funding round in NeuReality led by Cardumen Capital and Varana Capital is currently underway. Accredited investors can join the round through OurCrowd the Jerusalem-based venture investing platform.

While we may not think about it AI is everywhere performing tasks that once required human intelligence: smart TVs medical technology autonomous vehicles facial recognition energy grids customer service bots. And it will only grow.

Traditionally the array of chips used in an AI application have been connected by a CPU or central processing unit. Any command to a chip has to go through the CPU. NeuReality’s technology replaces the traditional CPU-centric support with an AI-centric platform allowing components to remotely communicate directly with AI accelerators – as well as connecting those AI accelerators with each other.

Outdated systems

“It’s like if you have an engine that runs 360 miles per hour and you put it in an old Subaru that was not built to handle such speed and can’t hold a 1000-horsepower engine” says NeuReality CEO Moshe Tanach.

“Why do we need to use a CPU-centric server to connect AI accelerators to the network? With our technology the data moves directly to the AI accelerator and we can do everything in the hardware” Tanach says.

A system board with $4000 worth of AI chips currently needs $12000 worth of computation and networking chips to support them. NeuReality plans to reduce this $12000 price tag to $1400.

The company is collaborating with Xilinx – a unit of California-based AMD that designs and develops dynamic processing technology – to deliver its new platform.

AMD’s AI accelerator can detect thousands of images per second says Yigal Shamaev the senior data center manager for the US company. NeuReality’s platform can scale that up exponentially at a fraction of the current price tag he says.

“Let’s say that instead of 5000 images you need 100000 images per second until now you would put in a lot of hardware you’d need a bigger computer and it would consume more resources” Shamaev says. “But with NeuReality’s technology we were able to implement a new component that takes this function and scales it so the customer’s total cost of ownership is much less than before.”

NeuReality is raising a funding round. Accredited investors can participate through OurCrowd the Jerusalem-based global investment platform.

I aim to test a hypothetical model using SEM and AMOS is said to be better for confirmatory research. However I don't want an inflated model (since the data are not normally distributed).

Accordingly I have the following questions:

1. Is SmartPLS a good fit for conducting SEM and path analyses and is that more accurate than Amos for the data that are not normally distributed?

2. Moreover is it better to use VB-SEM?

I asked the second question because VB-SEM is said to be more flexible regarding non-normality.

I sincerely thank the researchers who will answer these questions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL2Npb3NlYS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkva3luZHJ5bC10ZWFtcy11cC13aXRoLWRlbGwtZm9yLWN5YmVyLXJlc2lsaWVuY2Utc29sdXRpb24tdG8tcHJvdGVjdC1jcml0aWNhbC1idXNpbmVzcy1kYXRhLzkwODcyNzc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kyndryl teams up with Dell for cyber resilience solution to protect critical business data ETCIO SEA,Join the largest community of IT industry professionals in Southeast Asia Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.,,,

They needed to rush back immediately: A routine screening called the heel stick test had revealed that Fitz their firstborn baby had Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is a rare condition also known as “bubble boy disease.”

“To be told your perfect-looking baby has something so serious we needed to immediately get to an isolation room at the hospital was devastating” says Fitz’s mother Christina Kettler. “We were stunned at how scary his initial diagnosis was and that it would only get worse.”

Quarantined at birth

In essence Fitz had no functioning immune system. A “killer cold” could be just that and many babies with SCID do not live to see their first birthday. Further testing through Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) at Rady Children’s Institute for Genomic Medicine in San Diego California (US) identified the specific kind of SCID Fitz had known as Artemis or ART-SCID.

The diagnosis was made within 92 hours. In newborn and pediatric intensive care units (NICU and PICU) where ill newborns are often treated according to their symptoms a speedy diagnosis can inform treatment and prevent seizures or other injuries that might aggravate or solidify a disorder. Because the Rady clinicians could name the specific gene mutation Fitz had they knew he was eligible for a gene therapy clinical trial.

Fitz was able to receive gene therapy in San Francisco—a process of extracting his stem cells injecting them with a corrected copy of the SCID-causing gene and infusing them back into his body. The treatment succeeded in creating from scratch an immune system that would function properly and support Fitz.

Celebrating genomics DNA Day and life

In a few months Fitz will celebrate his third birthday as a happy healthy and active toddler. But before that he and the Kettler family will help raise awareness for National DNA Day (April 25) which commemorates the discovery of DNA’s double helix in 1953 and the successful completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003.

Fitz and his family will throw the first pitch during the April 24 San Diego Padres vs. Los Angeles Dodgers baseball game at San Diego’s Petco Park. Tens of thousands of baseball fans (and a contingent of proud Illumina employees!) will come together to celebrate Fitz and the victory of his health. It’s an opportunity to raise awareness for DNA—the unique blueprint of each of us—and its incredible potential to unlock information that improves human health.

Illumina is celebrating DNA Day all month long to highlight the latest advancements in genomic research and honor the genomics all-stars it serves: researchers clinicians and patients around the world.

Chip manufacturers like TSMC have been under the pump trying to deal with demands and disasters and Intel has taken this opportunity to position itself strategically for the future.

An analysis on SemiWiki (via The Hardware Times) talks about the strong lead TSMC has had in terms of logic technology and how Intel will likely overtake that in the coming years. Especially with that brand new next-gen semiconductor fab.

In the mid to late 2010's fabrication companies Samsung and TSMC used four nodes resulting in much higher density than Intel's two node solution. TSMC's were specifically beefy and this has positioned the company to have a fair lead in logic technology for many years.

In more recent years foundries have been slowed by production issues while Intel charged ahead on its CPU roadmap. This sees the company focus on a more modular design for its new chips including the 14th gen lineup with an ultimate goal to take the top spot in logic away from TSMC in the next few years.

Intel plans to deliver five nodes in four years thanks to new technologies like extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) and Horizontal Nanowires (HNS) to make these modular designs.

By 2024 it's expected Intel's 20A (formerly 5nm) chips should be released which will feature the company's proprietary HNS called RibbonFET. It'll also have a form of back slide power delivery called PowerVia to help more easily deliver power to the chip. Next up will be the release of the 18A after which we will see further improvements in EUV technology for making even smaller prints. All of this should help with delivering better performance per watt which is also one of Intel's major goals with these new chips.

With struggling foundries and Intel's current roadmap it seems likely that the company may be putting out the best chips on the market in just a few years. We are still yet to see what TSMC has planned for its own designs for the future but for now Intel is looking very strong. Let's just see how well the company delivers on its roadmap before getting our hopes too high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbC1zYXBwaGlyZS1yYXBpZHMtNTYtY29yZS1lcy1jcHUtaGl0cy0zMy1naHotYXQtNDIwd9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Sapphire Rapids 56-Core ES CPU Hits 3.3 GHz at 420W,"Twitter user YuuKi_AnS has shared several screenshots exposing the information about Intel's upcoming Sapphire Rapids-SP 56-core processor. While there are no benchmarks we get a sneak peek at the chip's specifications.

Like Intel's mainstream Alder Lake processors Sapphire Rapids will feature the chipmaker's Golden Cove cores and Intel 7 node previously known as the 10nm Enhanced SuperFin process. The leaked Sapphire Rapids-SP processor has 56 cores and 112 threads. On paper it looks underwhelming since AMD's EPYC 7003 (Milan) chips span up to 64 cores and 128 threads. Nonetheless it'll be exciting to see Golden Cove go up against Zen 3 in the data center space.

The 56-core Intel chip also has 112MB of L2 cache and 105MB of L3 cache. The highest tier EPYC 7003 has up to 256MB of L3 cache. However Intel is also readying Sapphire Rapids with up to 64GB of HBM2e memory; meanwhile AMD has prepared its Milan-X chips with 512MB of 3D V-Cache.

The Sapphire Rapids-SP processor from YuuKi-AnS is an engineering sample (ES) so don't take the clock speeds seriously. Thus far the 56-core part operates with a 1.9 GHz base clock and a 3.3 GHz boost clock. According to the report the single-core boost clock escalates up to 3.7 GHz.

Image 1 of 2 Intel Sapphire Rapids (Image credit: YuuKi_AnS/Twitter) Intel Sapphire Rapids (Image credit: YuuKi_AnS/Twitter)

The Sapphire Rapids-SP chip (ES2 QYFS) was on Intel's C741 (Emmitsburg) platform with 1TB of DDR5 memory with CL40-39-38-76 timings. The Socket E (LGA4677) motherboard housed the processor.

The processor has a 350W PL1 rating if the information is accurate and a 420W PL2 rating. However the actual enforced power limit from inside the BIOS is at a whopping 764W. The EPYC Milan 7763 the flagship Milan SKU has a 280W TDP. The Twitter user didn't share what type of cooling the Sapphire Rapids-SP processor had at its disposal. However the report revealed that the Sapphire Rapids-SP chip hit 99 degrees Celsius.

Sapphire Rapids was supposed to come out in the second quarter of the year but delays have pushed it to the third quarter. That'll be a big problem for Intel since AMD's EPYC 7004 (Genoa) lineup may arrive around the same timeline. Unlike Milan Genoa will leverage TSMC's groundbreaking 5nm process node and wield AMD's Zen 4 cores. Genoa will also bump EPYC chips' core count from 64 to 96 meaning Sapphire Rapids will contend with a 96-core 192-thread Genoa monster. As a result Sapphire Rapids will have its hand full.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWk5LTEyOTAwa3MtdnMtY29yZS1pOS0xMjkwMGsv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL2ludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrcy12cy1jb3JlLWk5LTEyOTAway8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-12900KS vs. Core i9-12900K,"Following the massive success of Intel’s Core i9-12900K the company followed up with a special edition of its flagship chip — the Core i9-12900KS. Clocked 300MHz above the base part it’s a halo product that looks to squeeze the most out of Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake architecture.

Intel has skipped these special edition CPUs for a few generations and the Core i9-12900KS isn’t a great return to form. It’s a problematic CPU with high thermal and power demands and in many cases it doesn’t offer a benefit over the base model.

I’ll cover everything from specs to benchmarks here but make sure to read our Intel Core i9-12900KS review and Intel Core i9-12900K review for a full breakdown and for why we rank the latter chip among the best CPUs you can buy.

Pricing and availability

Intel launched the Core i9-12900K in November 2021 for a list price of around $589. The Core i9-12900KS arrived in April 2022 for a significantly higher price of $739. Those may be the prices listed by Intel but there’s a big difference with what you’ll actually pay.

The Core i9-12900K runs between $600 and $620 while the Core i9-12900KS sells near $800. There’s a range of prices but you can expect to pay anywhere from $150 to $200 more for the KS model.

It’s important to remember that the Core i9-12900KS is newer so it’s still selling for around $800. I expect it will become much cheaper over the coming months though. At the time of writing I found one in stock for $780 with a $30 rebate — and that’s less than two weeks after the CPU launched.

Performance

I ran the Core i9-12900KS and Core i9-12900K through a suite of benchmarks to see how they hold up. All of our tests were run on an open-air test bench with an RTX 3090 graphics card and 32GB of DDR5-6400 memory. I selected only the most important benchmarks here so make sure to read our full reviews (linked above) for the full results.

Starting with two CPU-focused benchmarks you can see how little of a difference there is between the Core i9-12900KS and Core i9-12900K. In both Cinebench R23 and Geekbench 5 the single-core results are so close that they barely register on the graph. The Core i9-12900KS enjoys a slight 5% uplift in Cinebench which you can easily make up with overclocking.

The differences in our multi-core results are even closer but they favor the cheaper Core i9-12900K. In Cinebench the cheaper part managed nearly a 4% lead. Still raw CPU performance is largely the same between the two chips.

Real applications show a clearer difference. In creative apps like Adobe Premiere Pro and Photoshop the Core i9-12900KS is quite a bit faster than its counterpart. It enjoys nearly a 5% increase in Premiere Pro while maintaining a massive 12% lead in Photoshop. Those are impressive gains but it’s important to remember that they don’t apply across all applications.

Gaming is a prime example of that. My testing revealed only a 2.2% difference between the Core i9-12900K and Core i9-12900KS in games at 1080p. That difference actually favors the Core i9-12900K with it putting up higher frame rates in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla while barely lagging behind in Forza Horizon 4.

The only gaming benchmark the Core i9-12900KS clearly won was 3D Mark Time Spy but even then it was only a measly 1% faster. If you’re concerned with gaming something like AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800X3D is your best option right now.

Thermals and power draw

Both the Core i9-12900K and Core i9-12900KS have high thermal and power limits. The faster KS model is just hotter and more power-hungry thanks to its 300MHz boost.

During a stress test the Core i9-12900K peaked at 84 degrees Celsius while the Core i9-12900KS climbed all the way to 101 degrees. I actually had the Core i9-12900KS under a 360mm all-in-one liquid cooler — I used a 240mm for the Core i9-12900K — which illustrates how much hotter this special edition chip is.

The Core i9-12900KS is hotter and it draws more power. Both chips have a rated wattage of 241W but the Core i9-12900KS peaked at 274W during the stress test — and that was with Intel’s power limits enabled. The Core i9-12900K on the other hand drew 210W of power. Removing the limits the Core i9-12900K climbed near 300W largely matching the special edition with power and thermals.

The Core i9-12900KS is basically an overclocked Core i9-12900K and that shows up with increased power draw and thermals. It also means the Core i9-12900KS has less overclocking headroom unless you elect for elaborate custom liquid cooling or extreme LN2 overclocking.

Save your money

The Core i9-12900KS isn’t worth the extra $200. Although Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake architecture has been a revolution for Team Blue the Core i9-12900KS is the worst showcase of it. It offers peak performance but those margins are thin and they come with massive thermal and power concerns.

On the other hand the Core i9-12900K is a remarkable processor. It’s cheaper than the best AMD has to offer right now while offering much better performance. And with a little CPU overclocking it can even put the Core i9-12900KS back in its place.

With that the company is now readying the next wave of computers with the second generation of its processors.

In a new story from the Wall Street Journal the publication writes a profile of Apple’s Johnny Srouji a former Intel engineer and IBM executive that led Apple’s semiconductor division to ditch Intel for its own silicon.

After years of Mac sales stagnating and the company even having to come public to apologize for the underwhelming reception of the 2013 Mac Pro Apple finds itself in a very different position thanks to the M1 chips on the Mac.

But it wasn’t overnight that the company revolutionized its Macs once again. It’s 14 years of behind-the-scenes work by Mr. Srouji who according to WSJ had built the chip team from 45 people to several thousand across the globe including his homeland of Israel.

“What I learned in life: You think through all of the things you can control and then you have to be flexible and adaptive and strong enough to navigate when things don’t go to plan” Mr. Srouji Apple senior vice president of hardware technologies said in a rare interview. “Covid was one for example.”

In the story the publication interviews Mike Demier an independent analyst who has followed the semiconductor industry for almost 50 years:

“It seemed a little crazy at first that they could actually consider kicking Intel out but It has made them a more dominant platform overall.”

To produce its own silicon Apple also had to worry about this Intel transition as in 2006 the company had struggled to move from PowerPC.

That transition entailed numerous last-minute revisions to the laptop’s main circuit board according to a person involved in that effort. “A lot of people were afraid we were going to have the same problem” this person said. Mr. Srouji acknowledged the change in strategy faced robust debate inside the company (…) a misstep would be embarrassing and costly. “First and foremost if we do this can we deliver better products?” Mr. Srouji said of the debate. “That’s the No. 1 question. It’s not about the chip. Apple is not a chip company.”

By the time the pandemic started Wall Street Journal says that “one of the biggest worries came with the arrival of Covid-19 which threatened to derail years of prep ahead of the M1 chips’ fall 2020 debut.” As it wasn’t an option Mr. Srouji worked to design a new testing process on the fly.

The team set up cameras throughout the labs so engineers could inspect the chips remotely people familiar with the work said. It was the kind of change that would have once been hard to imagine from Apple where secrecy and control are paramount. In part the operation was able to pivot so seamlessly because Mr. Srouji’s team is spread out around the globe already accustomed to conducting business through video calls and working across time zones as they coordinated work in far-flung locations such as San Diego and Munich Germany.

Then Apple unveiled its first batch of M1 Macs with the M1 MacBook Air Mac mini and MacBook Pro – all of them being well-praised. Since then the company announced its first desktop with the M1 chip the 24-inch iMac redesigned the MacBook Pro with more powerful variants M1 Pro and M1 Max and now it has just released its powerful Mac Studio with the M1 Ultra chip which can even surpass the 2019 Mac Pro.

ICE,Intercontinental Exchange,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGUtNzA0NDIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The story of Unilever's war on the Jewish state - opinion,"As states such as North Carolina consider withdrawing public pension funds from Unilever and its subsidiaries over its de facto boycott of Israel it is time to review the story of Unilever’s divestment from Israel.

On July 19 2021 Ben & Jerry’s abruptly informed its Israeli distributor and manufacturer of nearly 35 years American Quality Products by letter that they would not continue the agreement past December 31 2022 effectively ending their presence in the State of Israel.

Ben & Jerry’s and parent company Unilever took this action at the behest of antisemitic activists who seek to denormalize Israel.

Until recently though Ben & Jerry’s continued to do business in Russia; they continue to sell in the occupied Crimean peninsula which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014. In fact on February 6 on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Ben and Jerry’s pushed out a bizarre tweet blaming the United States for inflaming tensions with Russia by sending peacekeeping troops to Europe. On March 8 2022 Unilever announced that it would halt all operations in Ukraine while only halting imports and exports into Russia but “will continue to supply our everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia to people in the country.”

Other nations with atrocious human rights records where Ben and Jerry’s continues to do business include Syria Iran and China. The company also sells in other disputed and heavily oppressed territories including Tibet Western Sahara and Kashmir. Only the Jewish state has been singled out for boycott. WHILE BEN & JERRY’S may only be boycotting east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the ostensible hope that it will lead to an equitable solution for both sides this partial boycott of Israel is of no interest to the BDS leadership. (credit: FLASH90)

While Unilever couched its pressure campaign in terms of attempting to restrict sales only to Israeli territory from before the 1967 Six Day War they did so in perfect awareness that this would violate their commitments. The move violates Unilever’s operating agreement with Avi Zinger Israeli and US law including the US Export Control Reform Act of 2018 which prohibits companies and individuals from refusing or agreeing to refuse to do business for boycott-related reasons.

Many Palestinians shop at the supermarkets and mini-markets to which Zinger distributes Ben & Jerry’s ice cream in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. This is why Palestinian human rights activist Bassam Eid has filed an action with the New York State Division of Human Rights explaining that Unilever’s decision will harm Palestinians.

There is a great irony in Unilever’s decision to target Zinger who over many years has initiated and supported projects that promote coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians and provide educational and occupational opportunities to disadvantaged communities including Palestinians. Zinger’s social mission projects include Fruits of Peace a project initiated by Zinger to strengthen economic cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians by developing new Ben & Jerry’s ice cream flavors using ingredients sourced from Palestinian farmers.

He has also sponsored Jordan River Village an overnight camp and retreat center in the Middle East where Israeli and Palestinian children living with serious illnesses participate together. Other programs supported by Zinger include Kids4Peace a global movement of Jewish Christian and Muslim youth dedicated to ending conflict and inspiring hope in divided societies worldwide and Seeds of Peace an organization that promotes coexistence between Israeli and Palestinian students.

Zinger and his company AQP employ newly arrived immigrants struggling to learn Hebrew refugees from African countries like Sudan LGBTQ+ refugees and disabled individuals. These workers will be unemployed if the business shuts down. Because of their circumstances they will be hard-pressed or unable to find new jobs adequate to support themselves and their families.

The costs of Unilever’s destructive campaign must be maximized so that other companies do not follow suit. Zinger has filed for an injunction against Unilever and its subsidiaries in federal court in New Jersey where Unilever’s US affiliate is based. Furthermore several US states including New York New Jersey Illinois Florida and Texas have divested hundreds of millions of dollars from Unilever because the move violated state anti-boycott laws. The company’s stock has dropped 25% since the announcement of their boycott while the broader market is at nearly the same level. In March Colorado became the latest state to divest shares of Unilever from its pension funds in this case over $42 million.

Now North Carolina is considering invoking its own state BDS legislation passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both chambers in 2017. For the time being the State Treasurer Dale Folwell has determined that the time for withdrawing pension funds – valued at $62.9 million - is not yet ripe. Instead North Carolina will wait until the end of the year to see whether Ben and Jerry’s follows through with ending Zinger’s contract or whether other events intervene; Treasurer Folwell has promised to reevaluate at the end of the year.

As he considers events over the coming months he should heed the words of North Carolina’s Senator Thom Tillis who noted that “while Ben & Jerry’s boycotts our ally Israel the only democracy in the Middle East its parent company Unilever recently invested $112 million in an ice cream factory in Communist China where the regime forces Uighur Muslims into concentration camps.”

If the capture of Unilever by antisemitic radicals is allowed to stand we can assume that many similarly placed companies will bow to pressure and attempt to join in the economic strangulation of the world’s only Jewish state. Supporters of Israel and democracy must stand firm and insist that Unilever stop using ice cream as a cruel means of economic warfare that punishes the very people this boycott purports to help.

Gary J. Smith

Ice War Diplomat arrives at a depressingly timely moment. After 30+ years of the Cold War shrinking in history's rear view Russia's invasion of Ukraine gives renewed urgency to Gary J. Smith's story. Last year this book might have been seen as a runway for another hockey summit series. No one now athlete or ambassador has any appetite for another Canada-Russia hockey tournament.

If history demands the right person in the right place at the right time Gary J. Smith was it. In 1971 he was a young diplomat fluent in Russian newly posted in Moscow. At the same time he was also a passionate player and student of hockey. When Leonid Brezhnev Andrei Kosygin and Pierre-Elliot Trudeau started using hockey to build bridges between Russia and Canada Smith rose to the occasion.

He was not the most senior member of the diplomatic team but he was the one who worked hardest to bring about the '72 Summit Series. Those in the know would probably agree that without Smith Canada's greatest sporting moment might never have occurred. His work – the seemingly endless crisis management and secretive negotiating – is what Ice War Diplomat is all about.

As a prelude to the eight games that thrilled two nations Smith explains how Canadian hockey was introduced to the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Then he contextualizes Russia as our Foreign Affairs department has traditionally seen it.

The history includes "" …purges pogroms starvation policies associated with agricultural collectivization a mass of wealth and privilege at the top and little to nothing at the bottom. Political repression of one kind or another aided by various secret police agencies has been passed down through the ages from the tsars to the communists and beyond.""

Proxy battleground

Millennials might think boomers exaggerate when they say hockey used to be 'war by other means.' In March 1969 international hockey was certainly a proxy battleground between Czechoslovakia and the Soviets. When the Czechoslovaks beat Russia on ice twice that month 500000 people hit the streets of Prague to celebrate. The party morphed into protests against the Soviet military stationed in their country. A local Aeroflot office was torched. Moscow used the ""Czechoslovak Hockey Riots"" as a pretext to remove reformer Alexander Dubček from office and crush the progress of the Prague Spring.

Smith says the Department of External Affairs believed ""the decline of our hockey capability had serious international consequences as it had led to a deterioration of Canada's image abroad especially in Europe. Hockey and Canada's standing in the world were inextricably linked.""

While this story plays out 10000 Canadian soldiers were still in Europe supporting NATO squaring off against Warsaw Pact adversaries.

His first year on office Pierre Trudeau oversaw the creation of Hockey Canada whose purpose was to boost Canadian results in International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) tournaments. In 1971 when Smith arrived in Moscow part of his job was to pave the way for Trudeau's controversial tour of the USSR.

When Russian Premier Alexei Kosygin returned the visit in Canada anti-Soviet protestors dogged him. But when Kosygin went to a Vancouver-Montreal NHL game the applause from hockey fans was the warmest welcome he had ever received outside Russia:

""The light went on for Alexei Kosygin that October night in Vancouver. If the Soviet Union wished to improve its relationship with Canada and enhance co-operation the way to do it was through hockey.""

Negotiations commence

Boris Fedesov – a sports writer for Isvestia published a 1971 piece arguing that Russian hockey teams should play Canadian pros which had never happened. Reading the article Smith realized that Fedosov must have gotten approval from government censors. He ran down the Embassy halls and urged his higher-ups to start talking with Russian counterparts.

The Summit Series negotiations kicked off with mirth on the communist side of the table because capitalist Canada had permitted union boss Alan Eagleson to lead its delegation. Eagleson agreed that Harry Sinden the former Boston Bruins coach would run the Canadian team. Sinden brought John Ferguson on board as assistant.

There would be four games in Canada which no Russian fans would be allowed to attend. Then four in Moscow for which 1400 package trips went on sale to Canadians. Those sold out in a hurry. For a young diplomat nearly 3000 Canadians landing in Moscow was cause for some concern. Every room was bugged and searched daily. Every hockey tourist was under surveillance. At 90 cents a bottle Russian vodka amped up the potential for trouble.

Diplomacy required at every turn

Diplomacy was needed to pull the Canadian team together. Tensions flared between the CAHA the NHL and the NHLPA. American team owners were not keen to lend Canadian players to an event in which all the publicity and money would stay in Canada.

The NHL saw definite value in playing the Soviets just as the World Hockey Association was eyeballing European expansion. The WHA's big salaries had recently won over players like Bobby Hull Gerry Cheevers Derek Sanderson and J.C. Tremblay none of whom could play for Sinden's all-NHL team.

Smith took Toronto Maple Leafs coach Johnny McLellan and chief scout Bob Davidson to watch the Soviet national team scrimmage. Smith had seen the Russians play before and he thought they were holding back on this occasion. A 20-year-old Vladislav Tretiak was in net. He had already won two world championships and Olympic gold but on this occasion Tretiak was stopping almost no shots.

Smith commented that the play looked strangely weak. McLellan and Davidson did not suspect a ruse. They were both roundly criticized later for their scouting report which downplayed the Soviets' skills and grossly undervalued the phenomenal goalie.

On Aug. 30 1972 an Aeroflot jet left Moscow for Montreal. There were 36 members of the Russian team and delegation aboard and one Canadian: Gary J. Smith. As they took off all Russians had been following an epic chess match. The defending world champion Boris Spassky was hours away from being beaten by troubled American prodigy Bobby Fischer. Losing to the young American made many Russians uneasy who genuinely thought their man was unbeatable.

Before play even begins in Canada a legal challenge is launched by a Quebec citizen. His rental car in Czechoslovakia was flattened by a Russian tank and he threatened to impound the Russian hockey equipment to compensate for his loss. A little more diplomacy helped settle that business.

Legendary Habs goalie passes out pointers

Jacques Plante the Habs' goalkeeping maestro brought an interpreter to a Russian practice in Montreal and gave young Tretiak some tips on defending against Canadian snipers. Canadians saw that as disloyalty but the Russians were impressed by the sportsmanship.

Russia outplayed Canada in the first match. Between periods Smith asked Eagleson what was going on with the Canadians. Eagleson does not take the question well. He calls Smith ""a fucking commie just like they are.""

Game 2 is in Toronto. Smith has an eye for the action:

""In one of the most terrific plays of the entire series and indeed in hockey history Peter Mahovlich took a pass from Phil Esposito and faked a slapshot as he crossed the Soviet blue line. The Soviet defenceman Yevgeni Paladiev moved his feet together to block the impending shot and in an instant Mahovlich flew by leaving him flailing with his stick. Tretiak had played brilliantly up to this point but Mahovlich deked left and then right leaving the Soviet goalie down and out as he slipped the puck into the net running over Tretiak in the process. The crowd erupted.

There was the absolute beauty of the goal—the artistry of Mahovlich's moves all achieved while short-handed in pressure-packed circumstances—but there was also the joyous realization that Canada was back on top by two goals. The roof of Maple Leaf Gardens seemed in danger of being blown off in that moment.""

The next game in Winnipeg ended in a tie.

The Canadian federal election campaign gathered steam. The Liberals glommed onto the now wildly popular and patriotically charged series. At the same time the visiting Russians went from total anonymity to superstardom in just a few days. Players came here expecting protests from Eastern European Canadians but adoring autograph seekers made far more noise.

Phil Esposito's speech for the ages

Game 4 in Vancouver turned ugly. Another losing effort for Canada. When Frank Mahovlich held Tretiak down on the ice for waaaay longer than necessary fans booed the Canadian team. It was a turning point: CTV's Johnny Esaw held a mic for a sweaty and exhausted Phil Esposito who unleashed an emotional speech:

""To the people across Canada we tried we gave it our best and to the people that booed us geez. I'm really – all of us guys are really disheartened and we're disillusioned and we're disappointed at some of the people. We cannot believe the bad press we've got the booing we've gotten in our own buildings. If the Russians boo their players … then I'll come back and I'll apologize to each one of the Canadians but I don't think they will.""

Another worry for Smith that night. Esposito said it was no longer a game but a war. ""As far as I was concerned as a diplomat Esposito's invoking of the word ""war"" as a rallying cry for his teammates and Canadians ran directly counter to the Canadian government's diplomatic goal of reducing the risk of ""war"" with the USSR. No one wanted to replace a stick and a puck with a steel helmet and a bayonet.""

Sept. 22 1972 8:00 p.m. Moscow time. 150 million viewers tuned in across the 11 time zones of the USSR. Everyone welcomed a change from the stupefying agriculture reports usually shown at that hour. The Canadian games saw no advertising on the boards but now in Moscow the Soviets have capitalized nicely on the situation and ringed the whole place with ads for western brands.

Brezhnev Kosygin and Podgorny take seats at centre ice happy to associate themselves with these skating exemplars of the ideal Soviet man.

Phil Esposito glides out for the player intros and tumbles over a dropped flower. He rises to one knee and does a theatrical bow to the potentates in their box seats. He later swore that Brezhnev ""the guy with the hairy eyebrows"" looked him right in the eye but for millions of Russians the irreverance made a big impression. Fun-loving Canadian fearlessness saved the moment. Canadian fans applauded their boys this time even as the USSR won again 5-4.

It was not the Soviet custom to cheer with gusto. But leadership was embarrassed by 3000 Canadians drowning out the much bigger Moscow crowd. Alexander Gresko from the Sports Committee was tasked with making local fans get rowdy. He rounded up young female employees to go out in the stands and chant ""Shaybu Shaybu"" (We want a goal). But they were overwhelmed by thoroughly refreshed Canadians who were now chanting ""Da Da Canada. Nyet Nyet Soviet.""

A less-than-proud moment in Game 6. Valeri Kharlamov gets whacked from behind by Bobby Clarke. The two-handed slash at Kharlamov's ankle didn't permanently hobble the Russian as it easily could have but the referee called two-minutes for slashing and a ten-minute misconduct.

Soviets agree that the attack on Kharlamov was the series turning point. Smith says that as late as the 1990s Canadian ambassadors still heard Russians compare it to the siege of Leningrad.

In the unwanted help department Alexei Kosygin at this point said ""We are convinced Prime Minister Trudeau will win the election and if he needs any support we will send some people to vote for him.""

Paul Henderson had a fantastic late goal. Canadians at the game were ecstatic.

After the game Canadian fans made merry with the cheap vodka. A young water-skiing champion named Pierre Plouffe landed in a Moscow jail for throwing a drunken tantrum. He had already been on the radar for playing his bugle and waving his Canadian flag on the end of a hockey stick. He came close to getting an extended stay in the slammer. More work for the diplomat.

Fireworks in the final game

Fittingly for a diplomacy story the on-ice diplomats – the referees – play starring roles. Sinden Ferguson and Eagleson all hated the two West German refs who they thought were inept and favouring the Russians. The refereeing stoked their simmering beef with Russia's point men: ex-KGB officer Kiril Romesky and Alexander Gresko.

Kompalla the German ref called J.P. Parisé for interference. He protested too much and got upgraded to a ten-minute misconduct. Parisé skated back to the middle of the ice did a loop and then charged at Kompalla with his stick up. It certainly looked like a threat. That earned Parisé a game misconduct.

Coach Sinden lost it. He threw a stool and a chair onto the ice from the Canadian bench. Then a bunch of towels. Kompalla was clearly rattled and didn't touch his whistle for the rest of the match.

Foster Hewitt doing play-by-play for the television broadcast would say ""The Parisé incident nearly set the place on fire."" As this played out Smith was sitting beside Bobby Orr (who was still recovering from knee surgery). The two men have a lively exchange. Smith tells Orr that the whole point of the series is to build bridges with the USSR not blow them up. ""You've been in Moscow too long"" Orr says.

Alan Eagleson then head of the National Hockey League players' association is shown in this August 1972 file photo. (The Canadian Press)

It went downhill from there. A delayed goal light crossed some bare wires inside Alan Eagleson. He jumped up and made for the timekeeper's box. A line of Russian militiamen decided to remove Eagleson from the arena:

""Mahovlich without hesitating scaled the boards with his stick raised. Everyone from the bench players in uniform and some not coaches and trainers alike arrived like the cavalry and soon Eagleson was on the ice and being escorted to the Canadian bench. Various hand gestures were made along the way to the crowd in general most noticeably by Eagleson his assistant Mike Cannon and Team Canada trainer Joe Skro.

The Soviet crowd was stunned and silent. They had never seen anything like it in their controlled environment. The Canadian fans started up with the ""Da Da Canada. Nyet Nyet Soviet"" chant. External Affairs Under Secretary Ed Ritchie buried his head in his hands.""

When play resumed Henderson replaced Peter Mahovlich. He Cournoyer and Esposito streak into the Soviet zone. Henderson gets in front of the net Esposito passes Henderson shoots. Tretiak rebounds. Henderson shoots again.

""Henderson has scored for Canada.""

Final score 6–5 for Canada.

WATCH | Paul Henderson scores in Canada-Soviet hockey series:

Paul Henderson scores in Canada-Soviet hockey series in 1972 Duration 8:49 On Sept. 28 1972 the country's largest TV audience ever watches Canada's Paul Henderson score an epoch-making hockey goal. Aired on CBC-TV program Weekend on Oct. 1 1971

Thursday Sept. 28 1972 was an indelible day for Canadians. It was a sports moment but it was also a moment where everything else stopped. Everyone found a TV somewhere. Everyone celebrated. No headline font size was big enough.

""Hockey itself was the victor"" Vladislav Tretiak said whenever he was asked.

Unlike the old communist bosses who were content to bask in the reflected glory of their team President Putin likes to pretend he is the next Gretzky. Russian professionals are careful in photo ops to let the shaky beginner wheel to the net. Shaybu!

At a 2017 party in memory of the Summit series Smith had a quiet chat with Canadian Ambassador John Kur who told him that hockey ""was one of the only threads holding the bilateral Canadian–Russian relationship together.""

But even with hockey's lift there's no joy in Canada-Russia relations now. The 2014 incursions in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine led to Ottawa shunning many senior Russian officials. Moscow retaliated in kind. The war began on February 24 2022 just as this book was going to print.

Among the many atrocities wrought by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine it feels almost trivial to mourn the cancellation of 50th anniversary celebrations in Canada and Moscow.

As Smith says ""It is a situation not completely unlike what Pierre Elliott Trudeau faced in the early 1970s when dealing with a nuclear-armed hostile power following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Russia cannot be wished away; nor the Russian people blamed in full measure for the actions of its leadership. President Putin has to be dealt with from a position of strength with no illusions but we continue to need to find common ground to prevent further violence and war and to encourage change.

""Engagement and dialogue remain the foundation of diplomacy. And though diplomacy may falter from time to time it remains an essential element of foreign policy. Hockey has been and can again be part of that process with Russia.""

Wilbur Nations’ family and friends will gather on Monday at the house he designed and built to celebrate a milestone — his 100th birthday.

“Lots of people and food” he said.

And in the years since his birth Nations worked in the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression worked several times as a surveyor for the Mississippi State Highway Department (now the Mississippi Department of Transportation) Waterways and other companies was a Navy Seabee and spent years covering the globe as an engineer for International Paper.

It all began on April 18 1922 in Lincoln County where Nations was born and continued in Lorman where his family moved in 1928.

“That’s where I was raised” he said.

He joined the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1939 at 17 “and we worked at the Military Park. We cut the grass. That’s about the only thing we did was get the grass cut and we cleaned the monuments. It (the park) was bigger than it is now; a lot bigger.”

After two years with the CCC Nations joined the state Highway Department as a surveyor in the Natchez area.

“We built Highway 84 and Highway 18; we covered three counties” he said.

He left the highway department in 1940 and joined an engineering company that built Camp Van Dorn an Army training base in Centreville before enlisting in the Navy Seabees in 1942.

“When I volunteered in 1942 I did boot training at Norfolk Va. and then we were sent overseas” he said. “I didn’t have any leave until I got back in the states — almost three years. They put us on a train and we went to Oxnard Calif. and they put us on a ship headed for New Caledonia.”

Nations said his unit was a specially selected battalion that handled cargo “take the material in and ship it out.”

It was a mission that took him not only to New Caledonia but also to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands then to the Marshall Islands Saipan in the Marianas Islands and Guam before he returned to the U.S.

“As they took the islands we were right behind them handling cargo; no fighting cargo handling” he said. “We had another Seabee crew that went in ahead of us and built the buildings and the piers and we followed behind. It was tough; we worked seven days a week handling cargo.”

After the war Nations went to work as a surveyor for an oil company then back to the state as a surveyor for the highway department before going to the Waterways Experiment Station where he worked as a surveyor for flood models and as a surveyor for the facility’s expansion.

“Waterways later laid me and some others off — five of us” he said.

He returned to the state surveying counties for new highway locations.

“We had five counties” he said.

Nations left the highway department to work as a surveyor for Ford Bacon and Davis a construction company laying a natural gas line from Oxford Miss. to Atlanta Ga.

From there he went to work for International Paper as a field engineer.

“I was in the construction end of IP; whether we had to add on to the paper mill or build a new mill” Nations said. “I stayed with them 37 years building new mills and repairing mills. I worked in five countries in Europe five in the west. I went to Japan and the Philippines in 1970.”

He was later transferred to Charleston S.C. as a construction manager and then to Mobile Ala. as a construction manager and then to Vicksburg where he retired in 1985.

He said he stayed in the River City because his daughter lives in Vicksburg.

“We bought this lot and built this house; building it yourself is a lot cheaper in the long run” Nations said.

Looking at turning 100 Nations said “It’s been tough I’ll tell you. The oldest person in our family lived to be 80. My father’s father lived to be 104; I guess I have some of his genes.”

Tom was born on January 5 1935 to Pearl and Philip Janes in the small fishing village of Broad Cove Newfoundland where Philip served as Principal of the local school for 40 years. Tom and his two sisters enjoyed a simple yet loving childhood despite their mother’s passing when Tom was two years old and their father’s passing when Tom was 16.

Tom studied at Memorial University of Newfoundland for his first two years of college and worked long hours during summer internships with land survey crews in Labrador. He went on to earn his Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from McGill University in Montreal Quebec.

He was proud to wear the simple ring he received at his Iron Ring Ceremony upon graduation as a symbol of professional duty and obligation worn by Canadian engineers.

He began his employment with Canadian International Paper (CIP) in Témiscaming Ontario and his career advanced quickly. Upon transferring to Dalhousie New Brunswick he met the love of his life Mary Irene “Rene” Gray. The couple married in 1960 and shortly thereafter Tom accepted a transfer to Three Rivers Quebec where he and Rene welcomed their two children Susan and Philip. Following two more relocations with CIP to Gatineau and Hawkesbury Ontario the family moved to the U.S. in 1972 where Tom worked as Superintendent of the Great Northern Paper mill in Millinocket ME until he retired in January 1993.

In 1995 Rene and Tom moved to Summerfield FL and began a new chapter in retirement. They split their time between Florida Maine and New Brunswick for as long as they could share the long drives and enjoy the simple pleasure and anticipation of seasonal reconnection with family and friends.

Tom was an avid lifelong golfer who enjoyed the sport’s challenge and camaraderie well into his 80s. His quick analytical mind made him a formidable opponent – and fun partner – for any card game from cribbage to bridge to poker. His blue eyes twinkled with childlike-curiosity throughout his life and his family and friends appreciated that he was quick to laugh slow to anger and a loyal spirit.

Tom is celebrated by his daughter Susan Janes (Griffith) and her husband Michael of Half Moon Bay CA; son Philip and his wife Kristie of Amesbury MA; three grandchildren James Robert and Rachel; sisters Phyllis and Florence and extended family throughout Canada. He is predeceased by his beloved wife of 62 years whom he joined in Eternal life just seven weeks after she passed on Feb 17.

A funeral mass for Tom and Rene will be held be held on June 24 at St. John Bosco Catholic Church in Dalhousie New Brunswick and interment will be in St. Jean Baptiste graveyard with family per the couple’s wishes. A celebration of life was held with caregivers in the U.S.

But aside from Harry Styles Billie Eilish and The Weeknd and Swedish House Mafia there are so many other incredible artists that are taking the music and arts festival's stages by storm. And music label 88rising certainly had a major bombshell of a surprise for audiences in their ""Head In The Clouds Forever"" event lineup: 2NE1.

The second-generation K-Pop group was one of the biggest sensations coming from the Korean music industry gaining a huge worldwide following since their debut in 2009. But in 2016 they officially disbanded. The last time they shared a stage together was at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2015. Since then they've reunited as friends for band anniversaries and birthdays. On Saturday night however 88rising made all Blackjacks' (their fandom) dreams come true as CL Dara Bom and Minzy performed on the main stage.

Leader CL first performed some of her latest tracks as a solo artist including her viral bop ""SPICY."" And in a move — à la Super Bowl HLVII Beyoncé Halftime Show— she brought out her best girls for old time's sake. The quartet sang their 2011 international hit ""I Am the Best"" which they had also performed at the 2018 Winter Olympics’ closing ceremony and was featured in a Microsoft ad.

The Kalamazoo City Commission is scheduled to discuss (CBA) during its meeting Monday night.

Previous coverage:

Under the proposed agreement Graphic Packaging would select and contract with a community relations liaison whose job would be to build relationships with residents of the Northside and Eastside neighborhoods as well as neighborhood associations faith-based organizations and other groups. The liaison would also be tasked with helping residents gain a better understanding of Graphic Packaging's local facilities and employment opportunities the proposal said.

The CBA would also require Graphic Packaging to hold two job fairs for Northside and Eastside residents to let them know of career opportunities with the company. The job fairs will take place within those neighborhoods.

Thirdly under the proposed agreement Graphic Packaging would help improve a multi-use site that would be used for neighborhood businesses food trucks and youth activities.

Lastly Graphic Packaging would provide $60000 to fund programs that would promote inclusivity and economic empowerment within the neighborhoods the proposal said.

The CBA Steering Team would decide how to distribute the grant money and oversee the other aspects of the proposal. The team would be comprised of two members named by Graphic Packaging two members named by the city two Community Development Act Advisory Committee (CDAAC) members representing the residents of Northside and Eastside and two CDAAC at-large members said the proposal. The team would meet quarterly at least.

“Graphic Packaging has been engaged in conversations with the CBA Steering Committee over the past three months in a very thoughtful and productive process"" said Graphic Packaging Vice President of Government Affairs Andy Johnson. ""During our meetings we reviewed a number of ideas that were brought forward by committee members and discussed those ideas in a transparent process. We have jointly developed a proposed agreement that we believe sets the stage for increased community involvement and supports local economic benefits.""

Graphic Packaging International  which recently underwent a $600 million expansion at its Kalamazoo plant on North Pitcher Street has become the largest producer of coated recycled paperboard in North America the agenda report said. The CBA would help address the impact of the expansion on the Northside and Eastside neighborhoods the agenda report stated.

But the facility has been under scrutiny for the odor it emits into the Northside and Eastside neighborhoods. The smell caused by the gas hydrogen sulfide is reminiscent of a rotten egg.

Previous coverage:

Residents fear of long-term health effects especially since the Northside neighborhood has a higher-than-normal asthma rate.



The Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) said it has received 100 odor complaints against Graphic Packaging since 2012 which resulted in eight violations.

Graphic Packaging said it has taken steps to mitigate the odors by improving its chemical treatment process and using monitoring equipment among other efforts.

A report released in October by the Environmental Protection Agency and EGLE stated that the smells are not considered harmful for short-term exposure. But the state has yet to release its report about possible long-term health effects.

By EMILY SPARACINO | Staff Writer

CHELSEA – Local students are gaining exposure to some of the most cutting-edge technology in modern healthcare.

On Thursday April 14 Shelby Baptist Medical Center physicians and staff showed students and other visitors at Chelsea High School how to operate the Intuitive Da Vinci robotic-assisted surgical system a device already familiar to students in the school’s Healthcare Academy.

“I’ve actually seen this robot in surgery” CHHS senior Jessie Holsombeck said. “My first-ever surgery I watched was a prostate cancer removal with the Da Vinci robot. Being able to use the instruments that (the surgeon) uses in surgery is fascinating.”

Dr. Charles Braswell a general surgeon with Brookwood Baptist Health at Shelby Baptist Medical Center works with the robotic equipment frequently and cites the technology’s benefits for surgery patients including less pain and faster recovery.

“It gets people back to their normal activities in less time” Braswell said. “It’s just great at Shelby Baptist Medical Center.”

Bailey Mitchell a clinical territory associate with Intuitive said the company provides support and training for surgeons who utilize the Da Vinci robotic system for minimally invasive procedures.

“We’re training surgeons with the robot and we work closely with OR staff” Mitchell said. “It has revolutionized the world of surgery.”

Healthcare Academy students like Holsombeck and fellow senior Rylee Speed said having opportunities to work with the Da Vinci robot and other real medical equipment—both in their school’s surgical learning lab and in their internship rotations at Shelby Baptist Medical Center and Heart South Cardiovascular Group—has given them a better idea of what different careers would be like in the medical field.

“Getting to take this class and getting to put into practice everything I’ve seen in the books and everything we’ve talked about it’s something that I could have never imagined” Speed said. “Getting that patient interaction is something that you really can’t take for granted and it’s been an amazing experience.”

Speed said she has wanted to be a doctor ever since she was a child playing with a doctor kit.

After graduation Speed will attend Xavier University of Louisiana. She is interested in pursuing a future career in pediatrics or obstetrics and gynecology.

“Getting to help people and also getting to see all of the cool stuff that medicine has to offer just drew me to it” Speed said. “It really helps to have that real-life experience so we can connect it and really visualize it.”

During the first semester of the school year Speed Holsombeck and their Healthcare Academy classmates earned their Patient Care Technician certification.

The students are currently working toward their Certified Medical Assistant certification.

Holsombeck said being able to watch multiple surgeries during the internship rotations this semester has made her realize she wants to become a surgeon.

“I would never ever have thought that I would want to be in the OR” Holsombeck said. “Through exploration and actually standing in the OR and seeing a surgeon and what they’re doing I have found out I love this and I want to do it. It’s been the biggest blessing ever.”

Holsombeck said the surgeons have been especially accommodating to the students letting them observe different procedures and talking to them about each one.

“They are always so kind and they love to teach” she said.

Fostering students’ interest in healthcare careers is gratifying for Braswell.

“It’s great to be able to do this for them” Braswell said “To jumpstart them into any healthcare career they want to go into and as far as they want to go.”

Holsombeck plans to attend Lee University in Tennessee after graduation.

CHHS’s Healthcare Academy program is a part of Shelby County’s Career Technical Education.

“Just having a program like this is amazing” Healthcare Academy instructor Andrea Maddox said. “Just being able to take students from the foundational level and teach them the basic skills they need for any healthcare profession that’s why industry partnerships like this are so important. It helps connect what we do in the classroom to the actual real-world experience and the potential careers they could have one day.”

On April 14 CHHS students watched demonstrations throughout the day and then a community-wide open house was held from 4-6 p.m.

Maddox said the CHHS Healthcare Academy has experienced rapid growth since its formation in the fall of 2019.

Classroom upgrades and internships at Shelby Baptist Medical Center and Heart South have helped to carry the program forward and show students the variety of healthcare careers available in Shelby County.

“The basic skills that they learn here are foundational for any healthcare career” Maddox said. “Being able to expose them both in the classroom and through internships helps them make those solid choices.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L3RvcC0xMC1wZW5ueS1yb2JvdGljcy1zdG9ja3MtdG8tc3Rha2UtdXAtZm9yLWdvb2QtcmV0dXJucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Penny Robotics Stocks to Stake Up for Good Returns,The extent to which robotics has changed our lives for the better can merely be put into words.

You can purchase your tickets at the Motherlode Gift Shop were you can also find souvenirs and items like beanies gloves stuff animals etc.

It’s also next to the Miner’s Sweet Tooth fudge shop where you can purchase fudge and Grub Stake where you can grab hot food items like pizza.

If you’re more interested in sitting down at a restaurant there is the Iron Door pretty close by which is an American restaurant located near the entrance of Ski Valley.

Mt Lemmon Ski Valley Sky Ride experience

As you head up Mount Lemmon you need to take the turn towards Ski Valley on E Ski Run Road. Just look for the sign for Ski Valley and make sure that you don’t head towards Summerhaven.

Once you get up there you should be able to find parking in a pretty good sized parking lot. (If you need to go to the bathroom they have portable toilets up there.)

To purchase your tickets head inside the Motherlode Gift Shop.

Tickets will be good for a round-trip ride which will take about 30 minutes total.

You’ll lineup at the base station and handover your ticket stubs and then two people can be seated in each ski lift chair.

They space out the rides to optimize the balance and so there may be 3 to 4 ski lift chairs between each person or couple riding. This is an added plus in my opinion because it contributes to a quieter experience.

When it is your time to board you’ll be called to stand on a line and the chair will come up behind you without stopping (unless you’re having issues).

You’ll then sit down on it and the tip bar will be pushed down which acts as sort of your seatbelt. You can rest your feet on the bar below you or you can simply let them dangle — it’s up to you.

Tip: Keep your legs pointed towards the edge of the seat so that you don’t get your knee knocked by the bar that comes down in the middle.

It’s a pretty smooth ride up to the top but it may occasionally pause due to people getting on or off. You also might experience a slight bounce but nothing too scary.

Also you’ll find signs reminding you to not bounce the chair yourself and this is for your own good.

It’s a very peaceful and quiet ride as well which is perfect for taking in the beautiful forest scenery with towering pines and fir trees.

As you admire the vegetation it feels like you’ve been instantly transported to Colorado which is one of the coolest things about living in the Tucson area.

Be sure to say hello to the bear if you spot him!

Even if it is warm at the base of the mountain when you begin your drive up temperatures can be quite cool and breezy at the ski lift. So I would recommend wearing some type of jacket especially if you are prone to get cold.

Once you arrive at the top you’ll need to push up the tip bar as you approach the station.

If there are two people in the chair each person will step off towards the direction that they are seated on. So for example the person sitting on the left steps off to the left and the person sitting on the right steps off to the right.

A staff member will be up there to assist you if needed but you can just walk off the boarding platform once you’ve exited the chair.

(If you don’t want to hop off you can just stay in your chair and head back down but I would recommend hopping off just to explore a little bit.)

At the top you’ll be able to walk along the ridgeline which has great views of Tucson.

You can see all of the surrounding mountain ranges like the Rincon Mountain and Santa Rita Mountains including the tallest peak in the area Mount Wrightson.

There will be a dirt path you can walk along that will lead to a nice overlook and also lead you to different trailheads. This area was recently affected by a bad fire in 2020 so you’ll also see some of the burned areas.

The wind can start to pick up once you are up on the ridge so again a jacket really does come in handy.

If you want to do a hike you can choose from several different trails.

A few things to keep in mind about these trails.

First as just mentioned a major wildfire made its way through here so some of the trails are still recovering. You might have to deal with ash and loose dirt which can be a little bit of a problem on steep terrain. For that reason some of the trails might be closed whenever you arrive.

Second because you are pretty much starting at the top of the mountain these trails are going to lead you down and up. It will be similar to a canyon hike and so keep in mind that for every step you take down hill you will also need to head back up.

The Meadow and Mount Lemmon Trail #5 Loop is a pretty easy and short trail you can do which will not require you to make a lot of preparation.

One of my favorite trails is the Marshall Gulch Trail/Aspen Trail. You can access the trail from the top of the ski lift but it’s much better to start this at a different trailhead located at the end of North Sabino Canyon Creek Road (near the Marshall Gulch Picnic Area).

If you want to do a strenuous trail consider the Lemmon Lookout Wilderness of Rocks and Mount Lemmon Trail Loop. It’s about 9 miles round-trip with approximately 2300 feet elevation gain.

Those are only a couple of trails you can begin from this area though as there are dozens of trails that go out in all different directions.

If you want to go to the very top of Mount Lemmon you need to book some type of tour that will take you up there.

They have some really cool astronomy stations and telescopes and they offer experiences to the public which you can book in advance.

Also you can take a mountain bike back down although that is considered a very advanced route so only very experienced mountain bikers should attempt that.

Final word

The Mt Lemmon Ski Valley Sky Ride is a nice little attraction perfect for escaping the desert heat. You’ll get to experience nature in a unique way and take in some great views from over 9000 feet in elevation!",,,,,,,,,

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

June 20 2004 ~ April 17 2022

Jacob “Sam” Dallan Jessen was released from their mortal struggle with mental health returning home to their Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday April 17 2022.

Jacob was born to Karen and Don Jessen on June 20 2004. It was no accident that he would be born on the bright and summery Father’s Day that held the most light in the year; from his earliest moments he was a person that exuded kindness and love to all who knew him.

As the fourth of seven children Jacob was the heart of the family and always wore a smile. Growing up he was an easy child to raise and seemed happy to be a part of whatever was going on. Full of love he was always willing to jump up and pitch in without complaint. After meals Jacob was the one to quietly clean up the table and put away the food without being asked. On camping trips (or anything) he was the one to help haul the heavy coolers clear the ground sites and set up the tents.

Growing up Jacob had deep connections with all of his siblings. He and Nathan shared a room as kids and spent many nights staying up late talking with Jacob chattering all night long. When he grew older he continued to talk in his sleep. In one instant he would be playing dolls and Littlest Pet Shops with Melanie and Lydia building elaborate cities and storylines. In the next moment he’d be out with Blake and Nathan riding bikes or peppering the sheet rock in their bedroom making holes from blow dart guns. Every Sunday all the kids would come up with a new adventure to do together making up imaginary games playing ninja school and building blanket forts that filled entire rooms.

The Jessen boys started a lawn-mowing business purchasing equipment and building clientele. At one point they were caring for nine different lawns in Pleasant View and North Ogden UT. Jacob’s ability to work hard at a young age enabled him to keep up the business even when his brothers moved on. For Jacob it was more than just a business; he genuinely cared and considered it an important service – especially for Ida Barker and the other elderly friends and neighbors he served.

Jacob loved games and was the kid who read the entire rule book. No one was as masterful at Mario Kart as creative in LEGO building as dedicated at chess or had as much fun playing cards and doing puzzles. As a gracious winner he would occasionally almost throw the game so that he would still win - but only barely so you wouldn’t feel bad. When playing Settlers of Catan Jacob and Autumn would battle to see who could have the most wins and then set up the third player to win so that they could maintain their ongoing tie.

Our family went on lots of adventures in the outdoors and Jacob always seemed to be good at everything he tried. He could waterski snow ski canyoneer and loved to kayak with his Dad. Jacob was strong and had no fear. When we went paddle-boarding Jacob would always be jumping off the highest cliffs doing backflips and making everyone laugh (and giving his mom heart attacks). Camping trips river rafting backpacking King’s Peak yearly trips to Flaming Gorge boating at Lake Powell – Jacob loved them all.

When it came to swimming Jacob was a natural. Without any training or practice Jacob hopped into the water at Scout camp and on a whim swam the mile perfectly in glacier water earning a merit badge. Later Nathan was a little jealous that Jacob participated in the Utah State swim meet even as a sophomore – that huge smile he had on his face when he looked up at the clock and beat Nate’s time in the backstroke will be forever stamped in our memory bank. Jacob participated on the Weber High Swim Team for four years but was more than just a good swimmer – he was a good teammate and friend always kind and encouraging everyone to do their best. Thank you Coach Cruff and the entire swim team for your patience and understanding in Jacob’s journey. His time on the swim team was truly a highlight in his life.

Jacob was exceptionally smart – but didn’t like completing homework. He had a sharp mind and a knack for learning but felt like homework was a waste of time. He attended Weber High through his junior year when severe depression began to impact his ability to attend and complete school. It was at this point that Jacob let us know his preferred name which was Sam. Sam graduated from Two Rivers High School in 2022 and was working towards a CNA certificate which embodied their caring nature. We are especially grateful for Mr. Burke an English Teacher and Joel Robins a counselor who formed special connections with Sam enabling them to complete the required courses for graduation.

Sam also loved to eat sushi. For months Watami Sushi in North Ogden had advertised an open position. On occasion our family would eat there and Sam would say “Maybe I should work here.” One day Sam brought home an application filled it out and turned it in. They were hired that day and started work that night. This job was a great blessing to them and as a perk they enjoyed specially made sushi every night.

Sam was genuine chill and relaxed. At any moment Sam could be found sitting in their favorite chair or lying in front of the fireplace listening to music and laughing at memes. They loved sushi and spicy foods. They poured ranch and barbecue sauce on their rice drenched their burritos with mustard and put jalapeno peppers on everything – the hotter the better.

Sam struggled gracefully for many years with depression. Always the loving soul Sam never wanted to be a burden to anyone. While in treatment Sam was blessed to have exceptional and caring staff at Primary Children’s Hospital Huntsman Mental Health Institute Lifeline Residential and McKay-Dee Behavioral Health Center. Sam connected deeply with everyone around them. Their own words and love served to lift all who were present particularly the kids their own age who were dealing with their own unique struggles. The team of psychiatrists doctors counselors and staff in every location poured love into their efforts to work with Sam and their genuine care for them made a huge difference. A heartfelt thank you to all.

Sam worked hard to process many of their challenges coming to terms with many struggles and built the skills they needed to be able to open up and be authentic letting their voice be heard. Ultimately however the disease of depression was too heavy to bear.

They were accepting of everyone no matter what. When anyone struggled Sam was ready with a big hug and a heart full of understanding. Sam was sensitive to people’s feelings and genuinely wanted to help. We pray that their legacy will live on in the way that we care for and love each other because “kindness truly began with Sam.”

Sam was preceded in death by one brother Luke whose spirit surely accompanied them on the journey through the veil. Sam is survived by loving parents Don and Karen as well as five wonderful siblings: Blake Autumn Nathan Lydia and Melanie. Sam’s kind nature and bright smile will be missed by friends neighbors family members and all who were blessed to know them.

Memorial Services to celebrate Sam’s life will be held on Saturday April 30 2022 at 11 a.m. at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 2975 North 1000 West Pleasant View Utah 84414. Friends may visit with family on Friday April 29 2022 from 6 to 8 p.m. at Lindquist’s North Ogden Mortuary 2140 N.

For more information about CBC's Opinion section please see the FAQ.

I'd never really considered what a world without libraries would be like.

As an academic librarian and a life-long library card holder I paid little heed to those who predicted library buildings would close and everything would go online. ""It won't happen"" I said never imagining that a global pandemic would close library buildings for months on end. For the first time ever I saw glimpses of what a world without libraries might be like.

In the early days of the pandemic library users with internet access had a seemingly infinite number of downloadable resources a click away making those visions of an exclusively online library seem possible. It didn't take long however to see how deep the digital divide really was. So librarians set out to find innovative ways to get print and physical materials to the people who needed and wanted them.

My neighbourhood library Windsor Public Library's W.F. Chisholm branch developed a system where you rang a doorbell and placed your library card in a taped-off red square on the glass door. A staff member would write your card number down and retrieve your held requests while you waited in another taped-off square on the sidewalk for your material to be placed on a table outside the door.

Waiting silently

Sometimes other patrons and I would try to make socially-distanced small chat through our masks. Mostly we just waited silently alone.

When my material was put on the table the library staff and I would wave to each other and we'd go our separate ways. I was never sure if the wave meant ""hello"" ""goodbye"" ""can you believe what is happening?"" or ""please take care of yourself."" Likely it was a combination of all of these.

Walking home from the library one fall day I realized trips to the library never used to be about simply picking up reading material. It was about talking with the staff knowing their names and having them know mine. It was about running into neighbours and overhearing children's story time. But as the pandemic dragged on the library became less of an experience and more of a transaction; a conduit not a source of connection.

""I was lost in thought when I spotted the most remarkable thing: the librarians had taken apart a brightly-coloured picture book and taped the pages to the window side by side in a line at child height"" writes Heidi LM Jacobs. (Allison Cake/CBC)

One particularly cold and grey afternoon in the throes of the worst wave we'd seen to date I was waiting for my books in the taped-off square. I'd been feeling particularly lonely that day grieving the loss of things I'd taken for granted before. I was lost in thought when I spotted the most remarkable thing: the librarians had taken apart a brightly-coloured picture book and taped the pages to the window side by side in a line at child height.

They had created a pandemic version of story time. I exited my taped-off square on the sidewalk and read the story. I collected my books waved and continued on my walk.

As I entered the nearby park I suddenly felt more hopeful tracing the feeling back to the picture book on the window. It wasn't the story itself that gave me hope it was what the gesture revealed about libraries and librarians.

Libraries are about connections

A pandemic might close a library but it can't stop librarians. Their simple yet poignant act of taping a picture book to a window ensured anyone walking by who needed a story would get a story. Even when libraries were seeming more transactional librarians were still finding new ways to remind us that libraries are about connections and experiences.

The pandemic changed how libraries delivered their services but it didn't change the reasons why public libraries exist and must continue to exist.

When the pandemic closed libraries to the public we saw how many people depend on them not only for books and movies but also for computers internet access and a safe warm accepting space. In many ways we couldn't see all the things libraries and librarians do until their absence made them visible.

Librarians will always tell you that libraries are not about buildings or collections — libraries are about people. I have said that many times before without fully understanding what it means. It took the pandemic for me to realize that libraries and librarians are always there for us. In turn we must be there for them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvamFjb2ItbXVzZS1tdXJkZXItY2hhcmdlcy1nZW9yZ2lhLWd1bi1yYW5nZS1raWxsaW5ncy_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9qYWNvYi1tdXNlLW11cmRlci1jaGFyZ2VzLWdlb3JnaWEtZ3VuLXJhbmdlLWtpbGxpbmdzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,21-year-old Jacob Muse faces murder charges in Georgia gun range killings,"A 21-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a fatal armed robbery at a Georgia gun range that left three members of a family dead last week.

Jacob Christian Muse of College Park is charged with three counts of malice murder the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a news release Friday.

The coroner in Coweta County found the victims who were his parents and son. Richard Hawk came by the Lock Stock & Barrel Shooting Range and was the person who found the victims: Thomas Hawk 75 the owner of the range; his wife Evelyn 75; and their grandson Luke 17.

Investigators said that as many as 40 guns and the range's surveillance camera were also stolen in the April 8 incident.

The shooting range is in rural Coweta County about 50 miles southwest of Atlanta.

Police Chief Steve Whitlock said the Hawk family was well-known and well-respected in their small tight-knit community. The Hawks had operated Lock Stock & Barrel for nearly 30 years. Their grandson was on spring break helping his grandparents at the shop.

Coweta County Sheriff Lenn Wood had called the killings ""senseless and tragic"" in a statement on Facebook following the shooting and said he was ""fervently praying that God will use our law enforcement community and the Coweta Community to bring justice swiftly.""

""Family was taken from the Hawk family and us way too soon and we are left with hurt pain and very little answers"" he said in last week's statement.

Muse was booked into the Coweta County Jail officials said. Authorities did not release additional information about his arrest and it was not immediately clear whether Muse had an attorney who could comment."
JNJ,Johnson & Johnson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtc3BlYWtlci1qb2huc29uLXRydW1wLTdiYmU3MWI3ZmMyYWVmMjZkZTMwMzZhMzU0YWYwZDEz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene Speaker Johnson meet for second day,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Embattled House Speaker Mike Johnson and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L21pa2Utam9obnNvbi1tYXJqb3JpZS10YXlsb3ItZ3JlZW5lLWRlbW9jcmF0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Democrats warn Mike Johnson about private meetings with Marjorie Taylor Greene,"House Democrats are aghast as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) conducts a series of lengthy meetings with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) aimed at defusing her efforts to oust him. Why it matters: Democrats have already vowed to protect Johnson from Greene's motion – leading many of them to ask why he's still trying to appease her.

""He has to be careful here"" said one senior House Democrat telling Axios that ""if he looks like he's just simply going to try to capitulate to her that could affect [the way] some Democrats see him.""

House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said Tuesday: ""When Speaker Johnson meets with her for hours the American people should be asking 'what is Marjorie Taylor Greene extracting from the speaker?'""

Driving the news: Greene met with Johnson for several hours this week laying out demands that include no more aid to Ukraine and defunding special counsel probes.

Johnson told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday: ""It's not a negotiation okay this is how I've operated as speaker.""

After their meeting on Tuesday Greene said ""the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" and that she doesn't have a ""specific timeline."" She previously promised to force a vote this week.

What they're saying: ""I don't know what in the world they could be talking about for hours on end and I don't know why he would waste his time there. We have given enough indication we can help him get back to business"" Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.) told Axios.

Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) told Axios: ""You cannot placate her. The minute you try to appease her she's going to have new demands.""

""I worry that the Republicans are focused more on their internal battles and their culture wars than trying to do what's right for the American people as a whole"" said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.).

Zoom in: House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) compared Johnson's talks with Greene to the deal former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) struck with hardliners last January.

Included in the deal was a rule allowing any member to force a vote on removing the speaker which led to McCarthy's ouster and now has empowered Greene to bring Johnson to the table.

Between the lines: Democrats are still broadly committed to saving Johnson said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) but ""three months from now that doesn't necessarily [have to] be the case"" for some of his less committed colleagues.

Another House Democrat told Axios: ""It's fine – sit listen it doesn't cost you anything. But at some point you say: discussion's over shit or get off the pot. This has already consumed way too much attention.""

The other side: Some Democrats see Johnson as just doing what he needs to do.

""What I saw that I liked is he put bills in front of the House to vote on ... if he keeps doing that my only complaints will be policy"" said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.).

""The concessions that I've heard about they're meaningless ... I don't think she's a threat to anyone"" said Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.).

What to watch: One House Republican predicted Johnson won't give Greene any concessions telling Axios he's ""just trying to give her an exit ramp.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9wb2xpdGljcy9qb2huc29uLWdyZWVuZS1vdXN0ZXItdm90ZS1zcGVha2VyL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L3BvbGl0aWNzL2pvaG5zb24tZ3JlZW5lLW91c3Rlci12b3RlLXNwZWFrZXI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson and Greene meet again as speaker faces threat of ouster vote,"Washington CNN —

House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene met again Tuesday as the Georgia congresswoman continues to dangle the threat of an ouster vote against the speaker – but it remains unclear if they will reach a resolution that will hold off the vote.

Following their second meeting Greene would not specify when she may force the vote and wouldn’t commit to moving to oust the speaker this week but she said that Johnson has a “pretty short” window to act on a list of demands. A vote to remove the speaker is certain to fail however since House Democrats have announced they would vote to kill her motion.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” Greene told CNN’s Manu Raju. “We’re interested to see his actions not his words.”

The demands she referenced include Johnson committing to the so-called Hastert Rule which states that a majority of the majority have to support every bill that comes to the floor; defunding special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into former President Donald Trump; no more aid for Ukraine; and a 1% slash to the federal budget if they can’t process 12 separate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.

Greene said that they are waiting for the speaker to reach back out to them with a response. She added that they didn’t give him a deadline to get back to them.

“We didn’t give a specific timeline but it’s pretty short” she said.

Asked if she still plans to force an ouster vote this week – as she previously had said that she would – Greene said “Well we’ll see. It’s up to Mike Johnson.”

Later on Tuesday Johnson would not say if he would meet the asks.

“We are having discussions. That’s all” Johnson told CNN.

Johnson also called the talks “productive” and said he is “optimistic” they can get to a resolution.

“We’re working through a lot of ideas and suggestions as I said as I do with all members of the conference. That’s part of the process here” he told reporters. “And so I’m optimistic that we can get to some resolutions.”

Johnson and Greene met for around two hours on Monday and after that meeting Greene declined to provide details about what was discussed or say if she would still force a vote seeking his ouster this week.

Johnson has defended his leadership against the threat saying that he will not resign and warning that a vote to oust him could cause chaos in the House.

On Tuesday ahead of the meeting Johnson emphasized close his ties to Trump and projected confidence saying he intends “to lead this conference in the future” and that he is “glad to have the support of President Trump.”

Johnson insisted his meetings are not a negotiation and that he seeks input from all his members.

“It’s not a negotiation” he said. “Everybody knows I have lengthy discussions detailed discussions on a daily basis with members across the conference there are 217 of us it takes a lot of time” he told reporters.

Trump and Greene have spoken on the phone about her motion multiple sources with knowledge of the call told CNN.

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky one of the three Republicans publicly pushing for Johnson’s ouster said he and Greene are giving Johnson “one last chance” to agree to several “suggestions” ahead of Tuesday’s meeting.

“I think Marjorie has been very measured and reasonable about this and logical and she and I decided to give Speaker Johnson one last chance to say he’s going to be with the Republicans and not with the Democrats” Massie told CNN. “And there are sort of some litmus tests on that but these are things that matter to the conference.”

Republicans voice concerns over empowering Greene

Many Republicans oppose the push to oust Johnson not wanting to see the conference devolve into bitter infighting like it did after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic and unprecedented vote last year.

Johnson briefly addressed his ongoing conversation with Greene during a news conference but declined to give any specific details.

Some Republican House members voiced concerns Tuesday about empowering Greene any further by giving into any demands.

“I think if you negotiate with two members who want something you are going to lose 30 members of the conference who want something else and I think he knows that” Rep. Kelly Armstrong a North Dakota Republican said. “I would always hesitate to agree to anything when you know the goal posts are going to move within five minutes.”

Rep. Carlos Gimenez a Florida Republican said “I don’t deal with terrorists.”

“I don’t deal with people who are threatening me. Never have Never will” Gimenez said. “If I don’t I don’t think he should either.”

But a narrow majority has given Johnson few options in this moment as the speaker wants to avoid the spectacle on the floor months ahead of the election.

“The speaker is dealing in practical arts here not philosophical ones so I am going to stand by him in his decisions” said Rep. John Duarte a California Republican. “I think it is utterly regrettable that these very small minority of members are putting the speaker in this very difficult spot at a time when we should be focusing on the things that matter to the American people.”

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that the speaker simply has “an open door policy” and meets with anybody who has an issue they want to bring to him.

Scalise didn’t want to get into specifics of what Greene and Massie were asking for. But when asked about potentially vowing not to bring up additional Ukraine aid Scalise said that more aid for Ukraine probably wasn’t coming up soon anyway.

“If you look at the last Ukraine bill it took months for that coalition to come together” he said.

Asked if he had any concerns that agreeing to anything with Greene could empower her Scalise said “All our members are empowered right now. It is a time where everybody knows we either all move in the same direction or we are not going to be able to advance our agenda for that particular week. We’ve got to stay united.”

Meanwhile Johnson has been taking steps to reach out to his right flank. Johnson met with the conservative House Freedom Caucus Monday night according to a source familiar. Greene was booted from the caucus in July 2023.

Go Math! has been used at the school since 2015.

At the recommendation of Williams Bay Elementary School Principal Dr. Ali Bond the Williams Bay Board of Education on March 28 approved a five-year Grades K-5 pilot of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt’s new print and digital Into Math curriculum at a cost of $36337.

Bond said four elementary teachers had piloted the “very research based” Into Math curriculum since September to good review.

“Our teachers have determined that it provides a deeper understanding of math concepts to the students” Bond told the board. “With all the research that we’ve done and the discussions that we’ve had we have decided to move forward with Into Math. We feel a five-year plan would be the best way to go and then we can reevaluate once we’re three years into that to determine whether or not students are responding to it effectively and of course look at the data from their achievement to make sure we’re still continuing to grow and making the progress that we need to grow with math … We felt a five-year plan was the best for our budget as well as for the students.”

Bond said there would be an August teacher training on the new Into Math curriculum and a follow-up training in the fall.

Main entry remodelingThe Board of Education approved a $41490 proposal from Fort Atkinson-based Baker Glass LLC for replacing the main entry doors at Williams Bay Middle School/High School 250 Theatre Rd.

The existing front main entrance doors are original to the 1996 construction of the school.

District Administrator Dr. William White said the project was part of “progressive maintenance on the building.”

“We do a different project every year” White noted.

District building and grounds director Ryan Quinn reported to the board that the entryway doors at 26 years old were “getting near to the end of their life cycle.”

“We’ve got some wear and tear on the bases because of salt” he noted. “There’s been a lot more damage to the doors with scratching and nicking that sort of stuff. They’re not closing correctly they’re also not opening correctly just due to wear and tear.”

In response to board questioning Quinn noted that the new entryway doors will be similar in appearance and style to the existing doors.

In other building-related news the board approved a three-year preventive maintenance contract with Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls Inc. for repair and service of the district’s HVAC systems at Williams Bay Elementary School and Williams Bay Middle School/High School at a cost of $42639 in 2022-2023 $43919 in 2023-2024 and $45235 in 2024-2025.

The board also approved a three-year building mechanicals and controls services contract with Johnson Controls for planned Metasys preventive maintenance and an ADS site directory software subscription at a cost of $12667 in 2022-2023 $13047 in 2023-2024 and $13439 in 2024-2025.

Johnson Controls’ Metasys building automation and energy efficiency management system connects a client’s commercial HVAC lighting security and protection systems and allows them to communicate on a single platform.

The district has contracted with Johnson Controls for building automation system services for more than 20 years.

“They make sure we’re as energy efficient as possible” Quinn said. “We’ve seen significant savings.”

Personnel changesThe board accepted the resignations of six-year Williams Bay Middle School-High School math teacher Kelsey Hartland and Williams Bay Elementary School first grade teacher Briana Pharris.

Approved by the board were the appointments of Luke Breen for maintenance Andrew Nickelsen as head varsity baseball coach Caleb Eddington as assistant varsity baseball coach and Steve Kulper as a volunteer assistant baseball coach.

COVID-19 reportWhite presented his monthly update report on impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the district.

“Things are going about as well as can be expected” he said. “We’re not really seeing many cases of COVID-19 in the district we haven’t had any student cases in a couple of weeks so things are going about as smoothly as they can. Certainly we know that things will rear its head at some point but we’re moving back as close to normal as we can getting field trips getting activities and things going for the kids. We recognize that the last two years have been really stressful on staff and students and families. We’re happy to see things trending in the right direction. We want our staff and students to have a ‘normal’ experience. We want to see that (COVID) in the rear-view mirror and get back to really focusing on the things that make this district special which isn’t COVID.”

Other newsIn other developments at the March 28 meeting the Williams Bay Board of Education approved:

* A one-year 2022-2023 intergovernmental agreement with Geneva Joint 4 School District (Woods School) for sharing a 0.8 full-time equivalent speech and language therapist between the two school districts approximately 20 hours per week with Williams Bay and approximately 12 hours per week with Geneva Joint 4.

* A one-year 2022-2023 technology services contract with Milwaukee-based SMG Computing Inc. at a cost of $70500 for 750 service hours over the contract term.

Today American multinational investment bank JPMorgan Chase reveals plans for the company’s new all-electric headquarters located in New York City. Designed by Foster + Partners the new skyscraper is slated for construction at 270 Park Avenue in busy Midtown Manhattan.

Designer: Foster + Partners

Rising to 423 meters in height the new headquarters will mark the city’s “largest all-electric tower with net-zero operational emissions” describes the architects with Foster + Partners. Obtaining renewable energy from a New York state hydroelectric plant to power the entire building the architects say that the tower will host “exceptional indoor air quality that exceeds the highest standards in sustainability health and wellness.”

Midtown Manhattan is known for some pretty iconic buildings–from the Chrysler Building to the Flatiron Building. Introducing a new skyscraper to weave into the city fabric is always a feat in itself. “270 Park Avenue is set to be a new landmark that responds to its historic location as well as the legacy of JPMorgan Chase in New York” Founder and Executive Chairman of Foster + Partners Norman Foster says

“The unique design rises to the challenge of respecting the rhythm and distinctive streetscape of Park Avenue while accommodating the vital transport infrastructure of the city below. The result is an elegant solution where the architecture is the structure and the structure is the architecture embracing a new vision that will serve JPMorgan Chase now and well into the future.”

Replacing an antiquated building from the 1950s the new skyscraper will house up to 14000 employees marking a three-quarters increase in building occupancy. Supported by an innovative fan-column structure and triangular bracing allowing the building to remain elevated above the ground by 80 feet.

On the ground floor the new headquarters will offer 2.5 times more outdoor space “featuring wider sidewalks and a large public plaza on Madison Avenue with natural green space and other amenities geared toward the residents workers and visitors who frequent the neighborhood on a daily basis.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlL25ld3MvcHJvdGVzdC1uYXNhLXNjaWVudGlzdC1yZWJlbGxpb24tYjIwNTk3ODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nasa climate scientist who was arrested speaks about his tearful protest,"Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planet Get our free Climate email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

A Nasa scientist who went viral over his tearful protest on the climate crisis has told The Independent that his activism comes from a sense of desperation to “find something that actually has an impact and moves the needle”.

Peter Kalmus was among a group of scientists arrested last week after they chained themselves to a JPMorgan Chase building in Los Angeles in protest of the bank’s financing of fossil fuels.

A video showed the scientist breaking down in tears and pleading with people to listen to urgent climate warnings. “We’re going to lose everything” he said. “And we’re not joking we’re not lying we’re not exaggerating.”

Dr Kalmus who spoke to The Independent on his own behalf and not as an employee of Nasa is also an author and has more than 220000 followers on Twitter. But despite his significant platform to speak on the climate crisis he described it as an “echo chamber”.

“I think it’s critical for the message of climate urgency to make its way out into the mainstream” he said in a phone interview.

Civil disobedience feels like a way to emphasise the seriousness of his convictions he said using the analogy of a home catching fire while a family is eating breakfast.

If you casually mention that the house is on fire before returning to your coffee he noted “they’ll think you’re joking they won’t take you seriously”.

Dr Kalmus says that he wants the public to understand the climate crisis is an emergency caused primarily by burning fossil fuels – and that he wants leaders to stop claiming to listen to scientists and actually do so.

“Every day that we continue to expand the fossil fuel industry and add more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is going to lock in additional levels of heating in the future” he says.

“And that means additional levels of death and suffering. So that’s what the stakes are.”

The LA protest was part of a wave of action organised by Scientist Rebellion a global movement of scientists who engage in civil disobedience to highlight the climate crisis.

The demonstrations took place in the wake of the latest report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which warned we are “firmly on track toward an unlivable world” if global greenhouse gas emissions don’t peak by 2025 at the latest.

In Madrid protesters threw red paint over the Spanish National Congress. Scientists also protested at the Ministry of Environment in Quito Ecuador and at the Climate Ministry in Copenhagen. In total more than 1000 Scientist Rebellion activists in 25 countries including Rwanda Sierra Leone Colombia Malawi Germany Italy and the UK took part in non-violent actions with many risking arrest.

Dr Kalmus says that while he doesn’t have any specific plans for future protests taking part in climate civil disobedience makes him feel hopeful.

“I feel like I’m actually finally starting to be heard – probably really for the first time” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2J1c2luZXNzL3JlY2Vzc2lvbi1yaXNrcy1kdWVsLXJlc2lsaWVuY2UtaG9wZXMtaW4tZ2xvYmFsLWVjb25vbXktb3V0bG9vay9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MDg5NjM0Ni5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9idXNpbmVzcy9yZWNlc3Npb24tcmlza3MtZHVlbC1yZXNpbGllbmNlLWhvcGVzLWluLWdsb2JhbC1lY29ub215LW91dGxvb2svYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwODk2MzQ2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recession risks duel resilience hopes in global economy outlook,"Bloomberg

The fastest inflation in decades and the resulting rush by central banks to raise interest rates are stoking recession fears in financial markets -- worries that are being compounded by the impact of aggressive coronavirus lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine.In the last week alone the the U.S. and U.K. logged inflation accelerating the most since the early 1980s and the central banks of Canada and New Zealand provided a model for the U.S. Federal Reserve and others by hiking rates 50 basis points for the first time in 22 years.Bank of America Corp. reported fund managers were the most bearish they’d ever been about the outlook for growth and JPMorgan Chase & Co. boosted its reserves to insulate itself against an economic deterioration.Meantime Sri Lanka and Pakistan fell deeper into crises as the United Nations warned of a “perfect storm” for developing countries as commodity prices surge the World Trade Organization cut its outlook for commerce and searches for “recession” on Google and the Bloomberg Terminal spiked.Against such a backdrop policy makers head to Washington this week for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The Fund is already saying the war means it will downgrade its forecasts for 143 economies this year -- accounting for 86% of global gross domestic product.“We are facing a crisis on top of a crisis” said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.“For the global economy  the combined impact of war and coronavirus will be a year of lower growth higher inflation and elevated uncertainty. To get to recession we’d need to see further shocks. Russia cutting off Europe’s gas supply or China’s lockdown expanding from Shanghai to other major cities are possible catalysts.”— Tom Orlik chief economistBut there are also reasons to think resilience albeit with a touch of stagflation rather than global recession may be the order of the day at least for rich nations.Thanks to pandemic-era stimulus households in developed markets still have 11% to 14% of income in savings according to a JPMorgan Chase analysis sent to clients last week.Leverage is at multi-decade lows and income is advancing at an annual rate of about 7% amid tightening labor markets catalysts for a potential rebound in the second half of the year. In the U.S. reports last week on retail sales and consumer sentiment offered hope all consumers aren’t pulling back despite price shocks.“I see more reasons for the global economy to slow than for it to re-accelerate” said Stephen Jen who runs Eurizon SLJ Capital a hedge fund and advisory firm in London. “However whether it will fall into a recession is a whole different story simply because the abatement of covid around the world should unleash huge pent-up demand helping to offset a good part of the headwinds.”Still that robustness is going to be tested.The fastest inflation in decades around the world is already starting to turn off many consumers especially those witnessing higher food and fuel bills. About 84% of Americans plan to cut back on spending because of higher prices according to a Harris Poll for Bloomberg News.Central bankers are also pushing up interest rates with the Fed now more likely than not to boost its benchmark by a half-point next month for the first time since May 2000 and start reducing its portfolio of bonds. Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to address the outlook in an appearance on Thursday.One danger is that policy makers flip from reacting too late to rising inflation to tightening too much as their economies weaken or if inflation turns out to be driven by supply chain woes that monetary policy can’t address. The fund managers surveyed by BofA saw an 83% risk of a policy error.“The reason we’re looking at much slower growth is that central banks need to respond by tightening policy from its currently very easy state such that financial conditions will tighten and that will restrain demand” said Karen Dynan Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.In a precursor of the IMF’s new economic outlook to be released on Tuesday Dynan estimated global growth will slow to 3.3% this year and next compared with 5.8% in 2021.The big advanced economies will expand only moderately this year and weaken further in 2023 she said. Large emerging markets face a “divergent” outlook with India improving and China grappling with lockdowns and a property downturn.The pace of developments this year has caught policymakers off guard.The White House’s top economic adviser Brian Deese said last week that the U.S. faces a lot of uncertainty. China’s Premier Li Keqiang said there’s an urgent need for government stimulus.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has overshadowed a deepening slowdown in China as the government continues with its “dynamic zero” approach to controlling Covid-19 a policy that has stalled production in manufacturing and financial hubs Shenzhen and Shanghai and kept millions of people at home.That approach however is likely to push growth down to 5% this year below the official target of around 5.5%.Global supply lines that were still recovering from the pandemic may also suffer a further setback if China doesn’t control the virus soon.Giant Manufacturing Co. is among the producers feeling disruption. It’s waiting as long as two years for bicycle parts Chairperson Bonnie Tu told Bloomberg Television.“It is a hell of job” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd29ybGQuaW4vYXJ0aWNsZS9Ud2l0dGVyLUJyaW5ncy1KUC1Nb3JnYW4tQXMtQWR2aXNvci0vMTYtMDQtMjAyMi00MjU2MzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twitter Brings JP Morgan As Advisor,ERROR: You must `download()` an article first!,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbnoubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vbmFzYS1zY2llbnRpc3Qtd2VudC12aXJhbC10ZWFyZnVsLTE1MTE1NjU1OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Nasa scientist went viral for his tearful climate protest.

SINGAPORE — Plant-based milks jostle for shelf space with cow’s milk with new varieties of nut grain legume and vegetable milk popping up every year.

Joining the fray is Oatside a homegrown label that offers plant-based milk from — you guessed it — oats that made its debut in Singapore's supermarkets and cafes in February.

Oatside is founded by Benedict Lim who spent six months deriving the taste he desired and another one year to build the production line. Taste was what pushed the former Kraft Heinz executive to start the venture during the pandemic.

“(I realised) that unlike soy or almond oat milk had a huge variance in taste and texture between different brands because of the complexity of the oat extraction process” said the 31-year-old Singaporean who has consciously dropped dairy milk from his diet. He added his palate picked up an off-putting “barny” taste when he resumed drinking dairy milk consumption after a period of consuming oat milk.

ADVERTISEMENT

Oatside prides itself to be one of the first “full-stack” oat milk brands to originate from this part of the world with in-house manufacturing capabilities and full control over its sourcing and production process. Oatside is made from 100 per cent Australian oats natural spring water is halal-certified and doesn't contain artificial flavours gums emulsifiers preservatives or colouring.

Family and friends gamely tasted the more than 50 versions of oat milk “including many terrible-tasting” ones before the winner emerged Lim said. The victor is a creamy smooth and malty milk a taste that he believes is ""comfortably familiar"" with Asians.

His personal favourite among the three flavours? After a quick protest — “That’s like asking you to pick your favourite child it’s an impossible question!” — he picked the Barista Blend which beat the Chocolate and Chocolate Hazelnut variants.

According to Lim the production of oat milk requires 90 per cent less land and water and produces 70 per cent less emissions as compared to cow’s milk. In line with its ""mission to be sustainable without tasting sustainable"" Oatside sources Rainforest-Alliance certified ingredients and uses recyclable paperboard packaging (from Forest Stewardship Council certified sources).

Story continues

Oatside is also sold in Indonesia Malaysia Taiwan and South Korea. The company has raised S$22 million to-date closing its pre-series A funding round in December 2020 led by Proterra Investment Partners Asia.

The self-proclaimed foodie recently spoke with Yahoo Finance Singapore about entrepreneurship and his inclination towards alternative proteins.

What is the ""full-stack process"" and why is it important?

We retain full control over the entire process from ingredient sourcing to the extraction of oats into milk. Since we wanted to achieve a very distinct taste and texture we had to customise something quite specific; as opposed to using an original equipment manufacturer. Such a solution would have been much easier but would have constrained us on the product. We worked closely with many talented engineers to make this happen.

What was the biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?

The biggest challenge was the initial fundraising process. Given we wanted to build our own dedicated production line we had to raise an unusually large amount for a pre-series A round. There were many venture capital firms and angel investors who were uncomfortable with the large capital outlay without having a commercial product ready to go so it was a very uncertain period since it wasn’t clear if we could even start.

Eventually Proterra Investment Partners a food-focused private equity fund where I had interned during my college days connected with the vision and decided to support us. The pre-seed funding of S$22 million subsequently fell into place – something I am incredibly grateful for.

What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learnt from your experience?

I used to think factories ran with just an on/off button. After spending months in the factory for commissioning I've realised it’s a lot more complicated than that! I now have a huge amount of respect for engineers!

What advice do you have for aspiring entrepreneurs?

Bring on the best people who can build not just what you need in the short term but who can build the vision of the company five years out. We are a very young company with limited resources and we were fortunate enough to be able to hire fewer but more senior people who are seasoned in their respective fields of running a consumer business. It’s made the process of scaling a lot smoother than it otherwise would be.

How much alt protein do you consume?

I find it easy to incorporate them into my diet given how significantly the taste of products is improving. A recent favourite is TiNDLE’s alt chicken. I had it as a butter chicken curry dish at the Mandala Club and it was mind-blowingly good!

Rising inflation inverting yield curves and increased energy prices are all sparking fears that consumer spending might be about to contract. Here’s why the Unilever (LSE:ULVR) share price might be attractive with recession fears rising.

Things people use

Unilever is one of the 10 companies that control everything that we buy. These companies make things like food cleaning products and toiletries.

An increased cost of living might force consumers to spend less on things that they can do without. But while this might be bad news for companies that sell holidays and cars it’s less likely that we’ll make significant cutbacks in things like food and toothpaste.

In order to see why I think the Unilever share price might be attractive with a recession on the horizon let’s compare it to two of the other companies that control everything that we buy: Kellogg (NYSE:K) and The Kraft-Heinz Company (NYSE:KHC).

Brand power

Each of these companies draws strength from its portfolio of well-known brands. Strong brands allow businesses to charge a premium for their products. That should result in higher operating margins. So in order to evaluate brand strength let’s see how Unilever’s operating margin have compared with operating margins at Kellogg and Kraft-Heinz over the last four years.

Operating Margin 2021 2020 2019 2018 Unilever 18.4% 18.5% 16.8% 24.6% Kellogg 12.4% 12.8% 10.3% 12.6% Kraft-Heinz 19.6% 21.1% 19.9% 21.8%

As we can see Unilever’s operating margin is consistently the highest of the group. That indicates to me that it’s able to charge a premium price for its products.

Debt

Unilever Kellogg and Kraft-Heinz all carry significant amounts of debt. Paying interest on debt can obstruct a company’s ability to make money for its shareholders. We can assess Unilever relative to its rivals here by comparing each companies interest expense — the amount of interest the company pays on its debt — with the company’s operating income. The results are as follows:

Operating Income Interest Expense Interest as % of Operating Income Unilever (€) 8702000 491000 5.64% Kellogg ($) 1752000 223000 12.73% Kraft-Heinz ($) 5094000 2047000 40.18%

Of the three Unilever pays the smallest amount of its operating income out as interest on its debt. This is a good thing. It should give the company greater financial flexibility and give it better opportunities to adapt its business in the future.

Conclusion

Unilever seems to be able to use its strong brand portfolio more effectively than its rivals and it also has the interest payments on its debt well under control. Investing in Unilever comes with risk as the company attempts to restructure its product lineup in pursuit of growth. And I wouldn’t expect Unilever shares to be entirely immune from a general movement downwards in the stock market. But if I were looking to buy shares in a consumer products company to protect myself from an upcoming recession I’d be looking at the Unilever share price as a buying opportunity today.",,,,,,,,,

Tribune Columnist

Today we have a great employee/teacher and a great art/community connection. Read to the end please.

Fifty years in one job. Nearly impossible right? No way. Wait. Let’s ask Linda Pearl of Plymouth for her opinion.

Her answer is yes it is possible. Do you know why? Because she did it and she lived it. Linda recently retired after 50 years as a cashier at the Kroger supermarket in Plymouth.

It was more than a job. It was a way for her to connect to friends and to the community. She comes away from the job with many fans smiles and praise. Her friends and coworkers said she is thoughtful dependable and a joy to know.

Linda is more than a cashier. She is an asset to Plymouth.

'We have innovated and evolved':REAL Services Director Becky Zaseck retires after 36 years with the nonprofit

She started in 1972 right after graduating from John Glenn High School. It was meant to be a summer job before college. She went to Ancilla College and later earned a degree in education at Indiana University South Bend.

Through all this “Kroger was steady work” she said. She stayed. Later Linda substituted at St. Michael Catholic School in Plymouth. “I taught at 7:30 a.m. and then went to the store at 4 p.m. I never needed a lot of sleep when I was younger.”

In addition to St. Michael’s she subbed at Knox Schools.

Yet she stayed with Kroger. She said it was good pay and later she was vested in the retirement plan. “I enjoyed working with people. Teaching and being a cashier were similar to me. Both are helping people. I liked pointing out to people that there were electronic coupons for Huggies or baby food. Something to help.”

Later Kroger used her talents to travel to other stores and teach cashiers about new software. “I was in 16 Kroger stores for two or three weeks.”

Another Kroger job was going into different stores with plans to change the merchandise on the aisles. “It is a reset of the merchandise. We were given plans and we flipped the store. It is a challenge and a chance to meet new people” she said.

Yvonne Carothers supervisor at Plymouth Kroger said she has worked with Linda for 26 of the 50 years. “I was her supervisor for 20 years. Linda is reliable and an excellent worker. She went above and beyond the call to help customers. She would make sure a customer was able to pick up their medication from the pharmacy. If it was too late she would deliver it.”

Coworker Linda Williams had many kind words for her friend. “She is always helpful and the sweetest person. I heard recently that an older customer couldn’t make a doctor’s appointment. Linda drove her to the office.”

Plymouth Mayor Mark Senter came to her going away event at Kroger. “Fifty years. That means a lot to her and the community. You have to celebrate a day like that.”

Linda is not sure what retirement will be like because she has another part time job now assisting at a group home. “I’m blessed to leave on my own terms. Many people do not have a choice. And I have my health.” She is looking forward to traveling with relatives visiting some zoos and running into people from Plymouth.

If you have time a new bench/artwork will be unveiled at 11 a.m. Friday in front of the Near Northwest Neighborhood offices 1007 Portage Ave South Bend.

The bench is a creation of an Art and Sustainability class at IUSB. Previously the class unveiled a bench in early winter at the Kingdom Life Christian Cathedral 707 Sherman Ave. That church bench is a semi-circle and there is gear for community conversation.

The second one will be in front of the Local Cup coffee shop. Kathy Schuth executive director of NNN said the bench provides a place for coffee drinkers bus riders and visitors. “It will have a bike rack that is so practical looking. It is street art.”

The bike rack part is modeled after the logo for the neighborhood association’s NNN. Very stylish.

The bench uses sustainable materials and scrap metal.

IUSB art professor Brian Hutsebout said the bench was developed after conversations with NNN about need. “We partner with organizations. We talk in the class about art in public places. How long it will last? Should a piece exist? It is a critical look at what is needed.”

Grab a cup of coffee sit down and enjoy the art.

That might have been the contents of a grocery list compiled by a Macomb County woman who recently won $4 million in a Michigan Lottery instant game.

The 75-year-old player who chose to remain anonymous bought her winning ticket at the Kroger Store located at 26233 Hoover Road south of Interstate 696 in Warren.

She chose a $4000000 CA$H ticket.

“I decided to purchase a lottery ticket while I was out getting groceries” she said in a statement.

“I didn’t see any winnings on the ticket when I scratched it but I scanned it at the store to be sure. When I got a message to file a claim I looked the ticket over a second time and that’s when I realized I’d won $4 million. I couldn’t believe it!”

The woman visited Lottery headquarters recently to claim her prize. She chose to receive her prize as a one-time lump sum payment of about $2.5 million rather than 30 annuity payments for the full amount. She plans to save her winnings."

What’s more it won’t cost you anything – in fact they are so keen for you to come that you’ll be paid £4200.

If that sounds appealing then you might want to think about booking a stay at FluCamp. However as the name suggests there’s a catch to this “holiday”: FluCamp runs residential clinical trials in the UK to test potential treatments for colds and flu.

It is one of a number of companies and organisations offering sizeable payments – up to £7000 in some cases – plus “restaurant-standard” meals and other perks to tempt people to take part in clinical drugs trials.

As well as the money you will also have the satisfaction of knowing you are helping to advance medical science just like the thousands who have taken part in Covid-19 vaccine trials.

Adverts appealing for volunteers for paid clinical trials have been appearing in newspapers such as Metro and the websites of a number of healthcare organisations are currently recruiting people. Some are even offering “refer a friend” payments.

The trials are to test medicines and treatments for a wide range of diseases and conditions – from eczema and obsessive compulsive disorder to malaria Parkinson’s disease and gout.

The organisations running the trials talk about how this can be a great opportunity for students and others to earn cash while catching up on their studies or sleep or sitting around playing games consoles and watching Netflix.

But while the money will be tempting to some many people will be wary – mainly because they would be worried about the risk of suffering an adverse reaction.

The notorious “Elephant Man” drug trial at Northwick Park hospital in north-west London in 2006 which left six healthy men (who were each paid £2000) fighting for their lives continues to cast a long shadow over the sector.

Who runs these paid trials?

There are a number of companies and organisations that either conduct medical research themselves or recruit volunteers. They include MAC Clinical Research HMR (Hammersmith Medicines Research) Quotient Sciences Trials4us which is part of Richmond Pharmacology Labcorp and Parexel – the firm that ran that disastrous 2006 trial. These six all advertise current and upcoming trials on their websites.

Also look out for the ads promoting FluCamp and others that often appear in newspapers.

How much can I earn?

It varies hugely. King’s College London recently advertised in Metro for volunteers for a study relating to exercise that was offering £100 (plus travel costs and a free health check) which arguably doesn’t sound like a lot.

However many of the trials being advertised on the websites mentioned above are offering four-figure sums. Payments of £4000 to £6000-plus are not uncommon.

FluCamp’s ads say it will pay people £4200 and that an average trial lasts 11-14 days.

In some cases you will get travel expenses on top; in others this is included in the payment.

Who can take part?

Some trials involve healthy volunteers; others are looking for people with a specific illness or condition. Usually there is a minimum and maximum age. Some trials only want men or women and some don’t want people who currently smoke.

Traditionally this is something that has been popular with students. A survey carried out last year by the website Save the Student indicated that 2% of students make money from drug trials. However Quotient Sciences says its recent volunteers come “from all sorts of backgrounds – from firefighters and accountants to students social workers nurses and cabin crew”.

Sometimes there are quite specific requirements. If you have previously dabbled with LSD or ecstasy for example HMR is currently seeking healthy men aged 18-55 who must have taken at least one hallucinogenic drug in the past. It is for a trial to test a potential new medicine for treating the symptoms of drug withdrawal and the payment is £3000.

Meanwhile MAC Clinical Research has a couple of trials looking for men experiencing erectile dysfunction (the payment is a little under £700) and one for people with OCD (£490).

So what is involved? Will I have to stay in overnight?

Again this will vary hugely. Needless to say the better-paying trials involve a lot more than having some blood tests and a physical examination.

The trials involve a vast array of medicines and treatments. Some involve psychedelic drugs such as ibogaine psilocybin and ayahuasca.

To get the big bucks you can expect a number of overnight stays

In some cases in addition to taking the study drug (or a placebo dummy medication) you might have to undergo a medical procedure. There may also be rules covering what you can eat contraception and so on.

And yes to get the big bucks you can expect a number of overnight stays.

For example HMR is advertising a trial for healthy men paying £5000 to test a potential medicine for Parkinson’s disease that involves seven nights’ residence on its wards six outpatient visits two MRI scans and two lumbar punctures (where a thin needle is inserted between the bones in your lower spine).

MAC Clinical Research is running a trial for healthy men and women to assess a potential new treatment for pain that pays up to £6060 although receiving that sum involves an 18-night stay.

The highest-paying trial we could find was one that Parexel is running soon for healthy men aged 28-55 to test a new medicine for osteoporosis a condition that weakens bones. The payment is £7475 and participants will receive the drug as an injection given under the skin in the stomach. This trial involves one screening visit two nights in the unit and 25 follow-up visits.

The NHS says it is important for people considering doing a trial to find out about the inconvenience and risks involved before they sign up and “carefully weigh up whether it’s worth it”.

Where are the tests done?

All over the country. MAC Clinical Research has clinics in Manchester Lancashire Merseyside south Staffordshire South Yorkshire Teesside and West Yorkshire. HMR has a big base in Park Royal west London while Trials4us is located in London Bridge and Parexel is at Northwick Park hospital. The Quotient Sciences trials base is just outside Nottingham while Labcorp has a clinic in Leeds. FluCamp has facilities in London and Manchester.

Do payments count as income and are they taxed?

This will vary depending on your circumstances. The payment could well count as “miscellaneous income” and you might be liable for income tax on it if the sum received is greater than your “reasonable costs” associated with taking part in the trial (which it often will be). But remember that everyone including students has a tax-free personal allowance – the amount of income you don’t have to pay income tax on. For 2022-23 this is £12570. Also you get a £1000-a-year tax-free allowance for “trading income” which includes money earned from side hustles or odd jobs such as clinical trials. If your annual income from these is more than £1000 or if in any doubt talk to HM Revenue and Customs. The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group website has a useful section on this area.

If you are on benefits speak to your benefit office or HMRC to find out what effect any payments might have.

Are the trials that pay more money more risky?

According to industry guidelines payment amounts should not be related to the perceived risk. HMR says payment amounts are based on the length of the trials adding: “It doesn’t change according to the type of study medicine. Payment is for your time and inconvenience and is never a reward for risk.”

So are clinical trials safe?

It is possible you will experience unexpected side-effects according to the NHS. Of course it is possible for any medication to cause side-effects.

Trials4us says this may be the first time the trial medication has been given to humans “so there may not be any direct knowledge of its side-effect profile”. But it adds that the risks involved will have been carefully assessed in animal studies using doses that greatly exceed those given to volunteers.

In 2015 the Mirror published data released after a freedom of information request showing that 7187 Britons who took part in clinical trials between 2010 and 2014 suffered serious and unexpected adverse reactions of which 493 were immediately life-threatening. More recent data does not appear to be available.

What about meals and other perks?

Meals and access to leisure facilities are typically included.

HMR’s website talks about its “outstanding” facilities for volunteers including restaurant-standard meals free wifi widescreen TVs with Sky and games consoles books newspapers and board games.

Similarly Quotient Sciences says you can watch TV or DVDs play on its Xboxes read or surf the net and take part in pool tournaments.

Some companies including FluCamp offer private en suite rooms but with many trials you will be on an open ward.

Will doing a trial affect my life insurance travel insurance etc?

Insurers are unlikely to ask about any participation in clinical trials says the Association of British Insurers. “If they do then as with all questions you should answer honestly and fully.” If in any doubt check with your insurer.

How are clinical trials regulated in the UK?

Before a trial of a new medicine can begin a government agency called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has to review and authorise it. And all medical research involving people has to be approved by an independent research ethics committee.

Will I get compensation if things go wrong?

Yes almost certainly. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has guidelines on this area. The compensation policy should be clearly spelled out at the outset.

How do I find out more?

Check out the websites mentioned previously plus press ads and noticeboards at GP practices universities etc. The Be Part of Research website has information about clinical trials while many charity websites highlight trials.

The NHS says you can ask your doctor or a patient organisation if they know of any that you may be eligible to join.

‘The staff were discreet professional and very knowledgable’

A man in his 30s from Manchester told us he was paid £730 plus expenses to take part in a trial for a potential treatment for erectile dysfunction. He signed up after seeing an advert on Facebook from MAC Clinical Research.

Asked what was involved he said: “Health checks involving blood pressure ECG blood samples and repeat visits to the clinic. Some participants self-applied a RigiScan device in private which was used to measure their erections.”

I felt at ease throughout the study A man in his 30s who took part in a clinical trial

He added: “While I would describe the trial as unusual the MAC staff brought normality and care; they were all discreet professional and very knowledgable. The RigiScan device was simple and easy to use. I felt at ease throughout the study. It is great to know that work like this goes on to improve the lives of people suffering.”

The man said the staff “looked after me really well”. He has since returned to take part in another study and said he may do more in the future.

At the time of writing MAC Clinical Research was advertising a couple of erectile dysfunction trials on its website. One pays up to £680 and the other up to £690 plus travel expenses. The first one is a study that will run over two months with participants required to visit the clinic seven times. The second one requires six outpatient visits to the clinics for check-ups.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Newsday reported that the Silver Sands Motel and Cottages in Greenport whose inviting neon sign and kitschy drive-up rooms have miraculously retained their nuclear-age charm was sold on Wednesday for an unspecified price that according to a local real estate agent was the “No. 1 commercial transaction on the North Fork.”

“It is like no other piece of real estate on the North Fork” Judi Desiderio CEO of Town & Country Real Estate in East Hampton told the newspaper. “It is a piece of history … it’s an amazing property.”

Located along a private beach at the end of a long wooded road on Peconic Bay the 30-acre motel property was cobbled together over the years through the acquisition of land and cottages from neighbors according to Jean Burden whose parents opened the motel.

Burden and her son Terry Keefe have shared ownership of the property with Silver Sands Holdings which purchased an interest in the hotel last year from Darline Duffy the widow of Burden’s brother who died in 2019 according to the report.

Duffy told the New York Post in May of 2021 that she was happy with the deal but Keefe claimed the new investors were pressuring him to transform the property into a high-priced luxury resort something he didn’t intend to do.

“We never charged more than $200 for a night” Keefe told the Post while pointing out that other Greenport hotels charge double that rate. “This is old North Fork. People come to the waterfront property to relax and go to the beach.”

Shortly after the exchange the Silver Sands Holdings filed a lawsuit against Burden and Keefe alleging they had mismanaged the motel’s finances according to the report. Keefe responded in court papers that the allegations were “completely fabricated.”

The motel property which also includes 15 acres of wetlands has been used for numerous fashion and movie shoots and as a nostalgic retreat for some locals.

But with new ownership that could change — Silver Sands Holdings has said it will spend millions upgrading the property — and the motel could become the latest old-school inn on Long Island to be given a Ralph Lauren-style makeover.

In recent years the Sound View Hotel also in Greenport has gotten extensive investments and renovations dating back about five years; the Pridwin Hotel and Cottages on Shelter Island got an influx of cash last year to convert the East End hotel into a full-service luxury resort with enlarged guest rooms a modernized lobby a spa and fitness center and a 100-seat restaurant and lounge; and a private equity group bought Greenport Village’s Menhaden Hotel for $8.3 million from a mom-and-pop team last August.

The Hollywood star owns a bunch of private jets and often flies them himself.

He is such a fan of airplanes that the apartment in which his home is located in the United States has an airstrip. And this could be the destination of the Boeing 737 the new Travolta plane.

On March 20 he posted a video on his Instagram where he celebrated getting his 737 flying license as he had already done with the 707 and 747.

In the background of the video is a registered aircraft N788LS which is listed as property of Constellation Productions a company owned by Travolta himself. See the post below:

Actor’s advice was requested by UOL To confirm whether he will be the main pilot of the aircraft or whether the aircraft will be at the company’s disposal but there was no response until this report was published.

Since the other planes in the actor’s home are also registered to his company this should be the likely destination for the newly acquired 737.

The Plane

The model purchased by Travolta is a Boeing 737-300 manufactured in 1988. It was flown to British Airways Maersk Air Germania Delta Airlines and finally belongs to Las Vegas Sands.

It was purchased in early April by Produções Constellation according to information from the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration a regulatory body similar to the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency Anac).

The 737-300 has a length of 33.4 meters a height of 11.1 meters and a wingspan of 26.9 meters. The interior of the plane has been customized and there is still no information on what it should look like to meet the requirements of the actor and his family.

John Travolta is 68 and has had a driver’s license since he was 22. His passion for aviation was so strong that his home is located in the Gamboller Complex in Florida (USA).

The residence has a private airstrip of approximately 2286 meters in length that allows the aircraft to be flown in the direction of the artist’s residence. There he managed to park his plane next to the house.

other planes

The actor owns a Boeing 707 with registration number N707JT registered in the United States. JT stands for his initials. The plane was converted to carry VIPs in the 1970s and was also owned by singer Frank Sinatra.

The actor named the plane Jett Clipper Ella after his first two children and donated the plane in 2017 to the Aircraft Restoration Historical Society. It was painted in the colors of the Australian company Qantas a company that Travolta has served as an ambassador for since 2022.

Other Travolta aircraft include the Dassault Falcon 900 and Falcon 2000 which he also flies.",,,,,,,,,

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

For the first time anywhere in the nation a developer builders huge corporations and a power company are coming together to study the homes of the future. This month Innovation Way was unveiled at Babcock Ranch. It features a row of models that highlight some never before used technology along with new technology that is just gaining popularity. Florida Power and Light will study energy use in the homes for two years to see what works best. The builders will look at what buyers want and what is cost effective.

“Innovation Way is a way to change the industry” said Tom Hoban Kitson and Partners’ President and chief investment officer.

Syd Kitson Chairman/CEO of Kitson & Partners is excited about this new venture.

“We talked to all the builders and nobody has done this anywhere else” Kitson began. “That is what is exciting about it. You will see that this innovation works and then you will see it all over the country.”

Kitson stressed that because FPL is collecting data and not the builders it will be non-biased and aimed at looking at what is best for the consumer.

Lennar Pulte and D.R. Horton built the models. Each builder created two homes with the latest innovations. Lennar also built two identical models without the new technology to use as a control. A final model by Lennar is a high tech partly deconstructed home to show how some of the items work from within the walls.

“This is not just for Babcock Ranch” Kitson stressed. “This will improve homes all over the country. When you have these builders that are national brands they will deploy this faster than any other builders because they are literally in all parts of the country.”

While the builders all created smart homes with things lighting and temperature set and monitored from smart phones and devices each builder also installed some items unique to them.

Pulte is proud of its air conditioning system that features circular vents instead of the traditional rectangle or square shape. It also has a different system of duct work. Instead of a large duct that branches off to smaller ducts around the house the Pulte homes have three inch micro ducts that all come out individually from the air handler.

“They all run directly from the air conditioning unit to where they supply air no mixing boxes no air exchanges so it’s a more even temperature” said Nick Crawford Pulte’s director of strategic sourcing.

The exterior walls are made from insulated concrete forms. The Sherman Williams paint has air purifying technology for the interior walls. Alexa can control the kitchen faucets. The Silestone quartz countertops contain innovate bacteria resistant technology and is stain shock and scratch resistant. Artificial turf in the backyard was installed for low maintenance and is environmentally friendly. Permeable pavers for the driveway and walkway allow water to percolate back into the lot instead of into the storm water system. Four batteries in the garage are for power backup instead of a generator.

Pulte also partnered with Ford for one of their models. In the garage is a Ford charging port and a wall of information about the F-150 Lightning Fords new electric truck.

“We had a connection with our corporate marketing team and the Ford corporate marketing team and Ford was looking for a place to showcase it. And being this is a community of the future they though it would be a great partnership” Crawford explained.

Pulte’s two models are the Oakview and the Cobblestone. The Oakview is a two-story five bedroom four bathroom home that spans 3654 square feet under air. The Cobblestone is a one story house with three bedrooms and two bathroom that spans 2408 under air.

“We were super pumped to get started” Crawford said. “We were really excited to reach into our partnerships and our teams to develop the innovation products. Some of these products in both houses are not even available in retail yet so that is so cool.

We learned so much on what we should and shouldn’t offer. Hopefully some of the stuff will be included in our future homes.”

Lennar’s two models with the innovations are the Chestnut and the Redbud. The Chestnut is a three bedroom plus den two bathroom home that spans 2086 square feet under air. The Redbud is a five bedroom four bathroom house modeled as four bedrooms and a den. It spans 3261 square feet under air. Karen Gough vice president of sales is excited to showcase a new type of electrical panel.

“Span reinvented the electrical panel” Gough began. “It’s become a digital control and monitors everything in your home.”

A computer panel shows all the energy use for every source and every room.

The Greyter system is being studied in the Redbud model. That system takes water that has been used in the shower and bath filters it and returns it to be used in the toilet.

“It is more water efficient and environmentally friendly” said Dave Meyers director of operations for Lennar.

John Bell cofounder of Greyter says the system is not only good for the environment it saves money.

“It just makes sense” Bell stated. “The typical family of four saves 9000 gallons per year.”

Lennar is also showcasing a RHEIA small duct system where the HVAC is all run in air conditioned spaces. The system also has a built in ventilating dehumidifier system.

Meyers said Lennar wanted to put a wide variety to innovations into these models to not only test the efficiency but the cost effectiveness of each item.

“With Lennar we don’t just dip our toe in it we go all the way” Meyers stressed.

D.R. Horton built their two models in just 64 days. They put their innovations into the Cordale and the Clearden. The Cordale is a three bedroom two full and one half bathroom house that spans 2000 square feet. The Clearden has four bedrooms and two full and one half bathroom and is 2700 square feet.

Kyle Knight director of operations for D.R. Horton pointed out special innovative features that include smart switches that can make windows and glass doors go from clear to frosted. He called up an app on his phone to demonstrate the smart lighting and temperature settings. Push the away button and the lights go off and the windows darken with the frosted setting. Push home and the windows become clear and the lights go on. In the kitchen two bottom sections of the refrigerator can be set to be refrigerated or freezers. The home has memory foam insulation. A Square D program gives smart information on individual appliances so people can see what is on or off from anywhere at anytime. An energy monitoring system allows a person to see what energy is being used and where.

“It is similar to Span but this is a monitoring system Span is the actual panel” Knight explained. “This is by appliance. You can see what you are doing. Span is monitored by circuits.”

All water that comes through the home is monitored. The system learns the homeowner’s habits in the first 60 days and if something is different it notifies the homeowner of a water usage difference.

Getting so many different companies on board usually isn’t easy.

“How often do you get Lennar Pulte and D.R. Horton to work together?” questioned Kitson. “They are fierce competitors.”

Yet they are competitors that all jumped at the prospect of working together on this project.

“We are the three largest builders in the country building homes side by side” Crawford exclaimed. “Knowing that all three had the same goals in mind we started the process for all three to develop a strategy independently from the other two so we would not all be doing the same thing. It was unique. We probably won’t get the opportunity to do this again.”

“It's fun. I like competition” Knight added. “I have a lot of friends at Pulte and Lennar so it is a friendly competition. We don’t typically do joint ventures so this is something special.”

Manufacturers were also part of the partnership. A lot of the systems in the homes were donated by the manufacturers that wanted to display and show what their product can do.

The houses also feature motion activated faucets. There are voice activated showers where a person can simple say “turn on the water to 85 degrees.” There is a microwave that can power the entire kitchen. A television becomes a picture frame with photos when not in use.

“If you have a teenage kid and they are in the shower too long you can turn the water off on them in the shower or turn the water down to 60 degrees” Hoban explained.

The models are not for sale. They will be monitored by FPL for two years and the data will be used to see what works and what doesn’t and what homeowners want. Even though no one is living in the home FPL can still collect data as if a family was in residence.

“The beauty of Innovation Way is that not only will visitors be accessing the homes and interacting with the various technologies including turning on lights running faucets and the air conditioning etc. but also many of the technologies in these homes are application-enabled which allows us to run simulations without physically accessing the homes” stated Alyssa Ten Eyck Marketing and Communications for FPL.

Kitson is proud to be the first in the nation to create this collaborative innovation testing.

“The innovation and some of things put in these homes are truly remarkable” he exclaimed. “The whole point is to make these homes more efficient and less expensive to operate and we need to prove that and that is what FPL is doing. That is what Babcock Ranch is all about. It is all about innovation and creating things that will better people’s lives. We are the only ones in the country with this test lab. The hope is that it would be throughout Babcock and throughout the country.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3RoZW1pYW1paHVycmljYW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzE3L3VuZGVycGFpZC1hbmQtb3ZlcndvcmtlZC11bXMtamFuaXRvcmlhbC1zdGFmZi1hcmUtY29udGludWluZy10aGVpci1zdGFuZC1hZ2FpbnN0LXVuZmFpci1sYWJvci1jb25kaXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Underpaid and overworked UM’s janitorial staff continues stand against unfair labor conditions,"In the latest demonstration in a series of protests against ABM Industries representatives of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU 32 BJ) upset janitorial staff and UMESA members took to South Dixie Highway on April 12 to demand job vacancies be filled.

“We are here to fight for our work to be fair and to stop overworking us” protestor Olga Mendoza said. “It’s an allegation with all the respect to the company but we deserve to be treated as human beings.”

Their anger can be attributed to the estimated 30 to 40 janitorial vacancies currently on campus that ABM refuses to fill that force the short-staffed janitors to compensate by upping their workload for no additional pay.

“When workers leave they don’t fill the vacancies” said Mars Fernandez a graduate student studying counseling psychology. “So what ends up happening is that the same amount of work needs to be done and managers pressure workers to do an extra amount of work.”

The University of Miami outsources the hiring of janitorial and groundskeeping staff to ABM Industries a facility management company paying them for the salary of the requested staff. Protesters said they believe that ABM is pocketing the wage money of the staff they are not hiring for their own benefit.

“I am sure that ABM has the money given by the university to hire workers but doesn’t use it for that” Marlene Trejos ABM janitor said.

The issue of understaffing was noticed amid the pandemic when the janitorial staff was classified as “essential workers” because ABM and UM were desperate to have them clean their campus. Only limited staff were allowed to work because of distancing and isolation policies but their expectations remained the same During the pandemic they blamed the extraneous amount of labor on COVID-19 but no adjustments have been made even as UM drops their COVID-19 regulations.

“I understand that during the pandemic there were no students no open offices but today’s reality it’s essentially back to normal” Trejos said. “The students are back the offices are open so it is not fair that they are saving their money while sacrificing us the workers.”

Trejos has seen these issues unfold in front of her for the 33 years she has worked at UM. In all her time here Trejos said she has not seen an improvement in working conditions or pay even as ABM claims to have made improvements.

“They’re doing a work surcharge stating that our work hours are not eight hours when in reality we’ve been working eight hours for years under that same contract” Trejos said. “It has always been eight hours.”

The organizers of the protest said that the problem runs deep but the union lacks the bigger movement needed to pressure ABM to enact change out of a fear of losing job security.

“The people are bothered and upset but at the same time we are scared. We’re scared because if we don’t accept the treatment that they are giving us then they could potentially fire us” Trejos said.

The unioners have attempted to redirect their efforts through UM hoping that having the university behind their cause will compel ABM to oblige. However the union has been unable to gain much traction here either as UM directs complaints back to ABM effectively gridlocking the movement.

“The university always tells us that we are subcontracted and that we need to resolve these problems with ABM” said Antonio Benton a union delegate and ABM employee. “It’s frustrating and when it happens we have to try to put pressure and that’s exactly why we are here united and are protesting.”

The shared sentiment of the protestors was that though ABM was to blame the university should be taking bigger strides to pressure ABM and honor the work of the janitorial staff.

“​​The university talks a lot about a culture of belonging of Canes Care for Canes but through the practice of subcontracting out an essential piece of work on the university they are effectively disenfranchising a whole group of people who are the most exploited workers at the university” Fernandez said. “We would like to see President Frenk not pretend like janitors and groundskeepers and cafeteria workers are not part of our university community.”

Many of the protestors said they are pushing for more student and faculty involvement in these protests to encourage the university to take a strong stance against ABM’s treatment of their workers.

“I think it’s important that we support our community especially the people who take such great care of our school” said Emily Bosworth a first year Ph.D. student at UM studying counseling psychology. “It’s important for the students who benefit from these workers to be here supporting them.”

Bosworth one of the only students present at the protest is a member of UMESA an organization that builds a bridge between the workers of the school and the students they are working for.

“I want to see more students and I want to see more faculty here” Bosworth said.

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

Babcock Ranch has sold more than 2000 homes and is on pace for another record-setting year. Recognized as the country’s 14th fastest-selling master-planned community in 2021 by RCLCO Real Estate Advisors the town reported 714 homes sold in 2021.

“This is a significant milestone from a development perspective and for the 2000 families who were looking for a better way of life and found it at Babcock Ranch” said Syd Kitson chairman and CEO of Kitson & Partners which is developing America’s first solar-powered town. “They understand the vision and recognized Babcock Ranch as an authentic hometown that emphasizes people community and a healthy lifestyle.”

Created with respect for the natural environment and the philosophy that smart growth and sustainability work hand in hand half of Babcock Ranch’s footprint is set aside as greenways parks and expansive lakes providing recreation and scenic backdrops for homes and the Founder’s Square downtown district.

Residents Lindsay and Justin Graham saw the vision during their first visit.

“As soon as we drove over the bridge we knew we were home” said Lindsay. “It just spoke to us. We saw what it was going to be and wanted to be part of it.”

Encompassing 18000-acres Babcock Ranch is planned for 19500 residences and 6000000 square feet of commercial space. Construction activity continues to accelerate to meet demands with new homes neighborhoods amenities and facilities introducing the next phase of the town’s development.

The completion of the 82640-square-foot Crescent B Commons shopping center last fall brought the convenience of a Publix grocery story restaurants and professional services to residents with more businesses opening in the coming months.

Also under construction are the state-of-the-art Babcock High School planned to open for the 2022-23 school year and a one-story field house which will serve as an emergency shelter and a recreation center for school and community activities.

“Providing shopping education and recreation close to home is important to the Babcock vision as a vibrant sustainable community filled with possibilities” said Kitson.

Named Master Planned Community of the Year by the Lee Building Industry Association for a second consecutive year in 2021 Babcock Ranch offers homes from AR Homes by Arthur Rutenberg Divco Custom Homes Florida Lifestyle Homes Lennar Meritage Homes Pulte Homes and WCI. Additional neighborhoods by D.R. Horton and Toll Brothers are coming soon.

While Elvis was notorious for pursuing women throughout his career it was unthinkable anything personal could ever happen with Dolly. She has been steadfastly married to her husband Carl since 1966. What The King wanted from the Queen of Country Music was far more than a mere fling. He was desperate to record what would become her most famous song a beautiful ballad so special to him that the star even sang it to his wife as they left the courtroom after ending their marriage. Dolly said: ""Priscilla Elvis’s wife told me that when she and Elvis divorced Elvis sang my song to her. That touched me so deeply.""

I Will Always Love You had already been a country music smash after it was released in 1974. It would of course become a global sensation when Whitney Houston remade it for The Bodyguard. But the classic heartbreaker was almost recorded by Elvis. It is a tantalising thought but one man stood in the way – and left Dolly devastated. She said: ""I’d been invited down to the studio to meet Elvis and be there when he sang my song. That’s the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me. Who doesn’t love Elvis?""

READ MORE Elvis was so turned on in classic scene you can see 'Little Elvis' Unfortunately Elvis's manager Colonel Parker made a demand Dolly simply could not accept: ""Colonel called me the afternoon before the session and said ‘You do know we have at least half the publishing on any song that Elvis records?’ And I said ‘No I did not know that.’ “He said ‘Well it’s just a rule’. So I said ‘Well it’s not my rule’”. ""And I cried all night long ‘cause I was so disappointed. It wasn’t Elvis I loved Elvis and I’m sure he was as disappointed as I was because he had it worked up and ready to go - I know he loved that song."" Even decades later Dolly confessed the pain has never gone away.

Elvis and his manager Colonel Parker

Last year Dolly even admitted she wished she could speak to Elvis and say: ""Hey I bet you were as disappointed as I was about all that and I still dream about you singing that song."" However the star also explained that she never regretted the reason for her decision. It's another example of why she is the ultimate businesswoman as well as superstar. Dolly said: ""I wanted to hear Elvis sing it and it broke my heart - I cried all night. But I had to keep that copyright in my pocket. You have to take care of your business! Everybody’s going to use you if they can.""

“I wanted to see the film with an audience” Suzi 71 explains. “So I slipped in at the back and watched it with people for the first time. Debbie Harry Joan Jett and KT Tunstall all came on screen saying ‘We wouldn’t have done what we do if not for Suzi.’ I was in tears!

“The next day I called my friend Cherie Currie from the Runaways and told her I’d realised that I'd given permission for women to be different. The phone went quiet and then Cherie said ‘Ya just got that?’.” Suzi laughs. The Detroit-born bass-playing icon who blitzed the UK with hits in the Seventies starting with 1973’s Can The Can was the first female rocker to front a band. “I didn’t have a role model” she says. “All I was doing from day one was being me. Whatever I was trying to do had not been done before. And thank God I did it.” Her uniqueness hadn’t gone unnoticed. She recalls her father Art telling her “Boy oh boy Suzi when they made you they threw away the mould.”

She adds “And before I could say thank you he said ‘Thank goodness!’.” Her Hungarian-born mother Helen called her “the wild one” and told her ‘You have the devil in you’ – the first giving Suzi the title for a 1974 hit and the second for last year’s critically-acclaimed album The Devil In Me. She had that indefinable X factor. Mickie Most the 70s equivalent of Simon Cowell caught her performing within a band called Cradle at a Detroit club in 1971. Afterwards he called his wife Christina back in London. “I’ve found it!” he told her excitedly. “What?” she replied. “I don’t know” he said. “But I’ve found it!”

Most was the second record company mogul to offer Quatro a deal that week. She says “Elektra wanted to make me ‘the new Janis Joplin’"" she recalls. ""Mickie Most said ‘I’m going to make you the first Suzi Quatro’.” She went with Most’s RAK Records. He set her up in a London hotel but it took months for something to spark. “Mickie didn’t ‘get me’ on record” she says. “I’d had a year of not gigging. I told him ‘I need a band; I’m going to go crazy’. Then I formed one and it all gelled.” The band including lead guitarist Len Tuckey – her future husband – opened for Slade with Thin Lizzy as the support act; and Most recruited glam rock wizards Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn (aka Chinnichap) to “craft the magic three-minute single.”

Suzi and Tuckey were living on the top floor of a house in Crouch End when the sorcery kicked in. “The phone rang at 8.30am and the lady who owned the house called me down” Suzi recalls. It was most telling her RAK would hire a plane to fly the band to Bristol for their gig that evening. “I hated flying and he knew it so I asked why. He said “Because you’ve got to do Top Of The Pops. You’re number one!” That was Can The Can. “The phone rang off the hook all day champagne arrived from the label flowers. It was like bedlam. It was fantastic! I went through a 24hour ego-trip walking around like I was Marilyn Monroe. “The next day I looked in the mirror and said ‘You idiot!’ I sat down with my ex for coffee and he said ‘Welcome back Suzi’. It went to my head just for one day. I am so down to earth…”

And she is still 56 million record sales later. Suzi’s live fee shot through the roof and the Chinnichap hits kept coming – 48 Crash Devil Gate Drive Daytona Demon Too Big etc. “They worked in tandem with me” she says. “Every song was tailored to my personality” – which is full on. Even now Suzi admits “I’m not into relaxing. If I’m watching a movie I’ll play Scrabble at the same time. I can’t ever be still. At Catholic School I was thrown out of first grade because Sister Inez said I drove her mad. “Impatience is my worst quality. I’m Dr Quatro now honorary doctorate from Cambridge so I can say ‘I am Dr Quatro and I don’t have any patience’.” Suzi was five and a half when her life changed forever. The family were watching the Ed Sullivan Show and Elvis came on performing Don’t Be Cruel. Her sister Patti nine years older started screaming. “A little light bulb went off inside my head; I decided there and then I’m going to do that!”

Quatro is her real name. She’s Italian on her father’s side – her grandfather Michael Quattrocchi [CORR] emigrated from Palermo Scilly aged nine but had his surname shortened by US immigration officials. Her father worked for General Motors by day and played keyboards in the evening with his Art Quatro Trio – Suzi played bongos on stage with them aged six. “He had his own agency too; he gave me my work ethic.” 5ft tall tomboy Quatro was athletic and a self-confessed “smart-ass” who liked the company of tough boys. From 14 she played in a show band called the Pleasure Seekers with two of her three sisters. “Until 1970 I’d sung 99% of the songs I was the show! But then we became Cradle and brought in my little sister to do most of the singing. “When Mickie Most came to see us with Jeff Beck and Cozy Powell I only did two songs. I took the mic and said ‘Here’s one I wrote Brain Confusion’ [the B-side of her first single] – and followed that with Jailhouse Rock.”

Yardbirds star Jeff nudged Most and said “the bass player”; he replied “I’ve got it already.” Equally impressed the UK rock press later described Quatro variously as ‘a tattooed tomboy’ ‘a hell-cat’ and presciently in 1973 ‘the world’s only female punk rocker’. A hostile NME reviewer received a box of pig brains through the post – Suzi blames Mike Chapman. Adored in Australia and Germany she had no US hits until 1978’s Stumblin’ In with Chris Norman from Smokie by when she was well-known for playing Leather Tuscadero on TV’s Happy Days. The character was “the female Fonz” – typecasting! Unwilling to exploit her sparky sexuality Suzy only did a Penthouse shoot because they allowed her to pose clad top-to-toe in white leather. She married Len Tuckey two years her junior and five times her size in 1976. They had daughter Laura a radio broadcaster and musician son Richard but divorced in 1992. She wed German concert promoter Rainer Hass in 93. Suzi’s career has been eclectic. She writes poetry and wrote a musical about Tallulah Bankhead but never stopped touring.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought immense suffering to the people of that land while sparking calls for increased military spending in both the United States and Europe. Though that war may prove to be a tragedy for the world one group is already benefiting from it: U.S. arms contractors.

Even before hostilities broke out the CEOs of major weapons firms were talking about how tensions in Europe could pad their profits. In a January 2022 call with his company’s investors Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes typically bragged that the prospect of conflict in Eastern Europe and other global hot spots would be good for business adding that “we are seeing I would say opportunities for international sales… [T]he tensions in Eastern Europe the tensions in the South China Sea all of those things are putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there. So I fully expect we’re going to see some benefit from it.”

In late March in an interview with the Harvard Business Review after the war in Ukraine had begun Hayes defended the way his company would profit from that conflict:

“So I make no apology for that. I think again recognizing we are there to defend democracy and the fact is eventually we will see some benefit in the business over time. Everything that’s being shipped into Ukraine today of course is coming out of stockpiles either at DoD [the Department of Defense] or from our NATO allies and that’s all great news. Eventually we’ll have to replenish it and we will see a benefit to the business over the next coming years.”

Arms to Ukraine profits to contractors

The war in Ukraine will indeed be a bonanza for the likes of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. First of all there will be the contracts to resupply weapons like Raytheon’s Stinger anti-aircraft missile and the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin-produced Javelin anti-tank missile that Washington has already provided to Ukraine by the thousands. The bigger stream of profits however will come from assured post-conflict increases in national-security spending here and in Europe justified at least in part by the Russian invasion and the disaster that’s followed.

Indeed direct arms transfers to Ukraine already reflect only part of the extra money going to U.S. military contractors. This fiscal year alone they are guaranteed to also reap significant benefits from the Pentagon’s Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program both of which finance the acquisition of American weaponry and other equipment as well as military training. These have in fact been the two primary channels for military aid to Ukraine from the moment the Russians invaded and seized Crimea in 2014. Since then the United States has committed around $5 billion in security assistance to that country.

According to the State Department the United States has provided such military aid to help Ukraine “preserve its territorial integrity secure its borders and improve interoperability with NATO.” So when Russian troops began to mass on the Ukrainian border last year Washington quickly upped the ante. On March 31 2021 the U.S. European Command declared a “potential imminent crisis” given the estimated 100000 Russian troops already along that border and within Crimea. As last year ended the Biden administration had committed $650 million in weaponry to Ukraine including anti-aircraft and anti-armor equipment like the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin Javelin anti-tank missile.

Despite such elevated levels of American military assistance Russian troops did indeed invade Ukraine in February. Since then according to Pentagon reports the U.S. has committed to giving approximately $2.6 billion in military aid to that country bringing the Biden administration total to more than $3.2 billion and still rising.

Some of this assistance was included in a March emergency-spending package for Ukraine which required the direct procurement of weapons from the defense industry including drones laser-guided rocket systems machine guns ammunition and other supplies. The major military-industrial corporations will now seek Pentagon contracts to deliver that extra weaponry even as they are gearing up to replenish Pentagon stocks already delivered to the Ukrainians.

On that front in fact military contractors have much to look forward to. More than half of the Pentagon’s $6.5 billion portion of the emergency-spending package for Ukraine is designated simply to replenish DoD inventories. In all lawmakers allocated $3.5 billion to that effort $1.75 billion more than the president even requested. They also boosted funding by $150 million for the State Department’s FMF program for Ukraine. And keep in mind that those figures don’t even include emergency financing for the Pentagon’s acquisition and maintenance costs which are guaranteed to provide more revenue streams for the major weapons makers.

Better yet from the viewpoint of such companies there are many bites left to take from the apple of Ukrainian military aid. President Biden has already made it all too clear that “we’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead.” One can only assume that more commitments are on the way.

Another positive side effect of the war for Lockheed Raytheon and other arms merchants like them is the push by House Armed Services Committee chair Adam Smith (D-WA) and ranking committee Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama to speed up production of a next-generation anti-aircraft missile to replace the Stinger. In his congressional confirmation hearing William LaPlante the latest nominee to head acquisition at the Pentagon argued that America also needs more “hot production lines” for bombs missiles and drones. Consider that yet another benefit-in-waiting for the major weapons contractors.

The Pentagon gold mine

For U.S. arms makers however the greatest benefits of the war in Ukraine won’t be immediate weapons sales large as they are but the changing nature of the ongoing debate over Pentagon spending itself. Of course the representatives of such companies were already plugging the long-term challenge posed by China a greatly exaggerated threat but the Russian invasion is nothing short of manna from heaven for them the ultimate rallying cry for advocates of greater military outlays. Even before the war the Pentagon was slated to receive at least $7.3 trillion over the next decade more than four times the cost of President Biden’s $1.7 trillion domestic Build Back Better plan already stymied by members of Congress who labeled it “too expensive” by far. And keep in mind that given the current surge in Pentagon spending that $7.3 trillion could prove a minimal figure.

Indeed Pentagon officials like Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks promptly cited Ukraine as one of the rationales for the Biden administration’s proposed record national-security budget proposal of $813 billion calling Russia’s invasion “an acute threat to the world order.” In another era that budget request for Fiscal Year 2023 would have been mind-boggling since it’s higher than spending at the peaks of the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam and over $100 billion more than the Pentagon received annually at the height of the Cold War.

Despite its size however congressional Republicans — joined by a significant number of their Democratic colleagues — are already pushing for more. Forty Republican members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have in fact signed a letter to President Biden calling for 5% growth in military spending beyond inflation which would potentially add up to $100 billion to that budget request. Typically enough Representative Elaine Luria (D-VA) who represents the area near the Huntington Ingalls company’s Newport News military shipyard in Virginia accused the administration of “gutting the Navy” because it contemplates decommissioning some older ships to make way for new ones. That complaint was lodged despite that service’s plan to spend a whopping $28 billion on new ships in FY 2023.

Who benefits?

That planned increase in shipbuilding funds is part of a proposed pool of $276 billion for weapons procurement as well as further research and development contained in the new budget which is where the top five weapons-producing contractors — Lockheed Martin Boeing Raytheon General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman — make most of their money. Those firms already split more than $150 billion in Pentagon contracts annually a figure that will skyrocket if the administration and Congress have their way. To put all of this in context just one of those top five firms Lockheed Martin was awarded $75 billion in Pentagon contracts in fiscal year 2020 alone. That’s considerably more than the entire budget for the State Department dramatic evidence of how skewed Washington’s priorities are despite the Biden administration’s pledge to “put diplomacy first.”

The Pentagon’s weapons wish list for FY 2023 is a catalog of just how the big contractors will cash in. For example the new Columbia Class ballistic missile submarine built by General Dynamics Electric Boat plant in southeastern Connecticut will see its proposed budget for FY 2023 grow from $5.0 billion to $6.2 billion. Spending on Northrop Grumman’s new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent will increase by about one-third annually to $3.6 billion. The category of “missile defense and defeat” a specialty of Boeing Raytheon and Lockheed Martin is slated to receive more than $24 billion. And space-based missile warning systems a staple of the Trump administration-created Space Force will jump from $2.5 billion in FY 2022 to $4.7 billion in this year’s proposed budget.

Among all the increases there was a single surprise: a proposed reduction in purchases of the troubled Lockheed Martin F-35 combat aircraft from 85 to 61 planes in FY 2023. The reason is clear enough. That plane has more than 800 identified design flaws and its production and performance problems have been little short of legendary. Luckily for Lockheed Martin that drop in numbers has not been accompanied by a proportional reduction in funding. While newly produced planes may be reduced by one-third the actual budget allocation for the F-35 will drop by less than 10% from $12 billion to $11 billion an amount that’s more than the complete discretionary budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since Lockheed Martin won the F-35 contract development costs have more than doubled while production delays have set the aircraft back by nearly a decade. Nonetheless the military services have purchased so many of those planes that manufacturers can’t keep up with the demand for spare parts. And yet the F-35 can’t even be properly tested for combat effectiveness because the simulation software required is not only unfinished but without even an estimated completion date. So the F-35 is many years away from the full production of planes that actually work as advertised if that’s ever in the cards.

A number of the weapons systems which in the Ukraine moment are guaranteed to be showered with cash are so dangerous or dysfunctional that like the F-35 they should actually be phased out. Take the new ICBM. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry has called ICBMs “some of the most dangerous weapons in the world” because a president would only have minutes to decide whether to launch them in a crisis greatly increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war based on a false alarm. Nor does it make sense to buy aircraft carriers at $13 billion a pop especially since the latest version is having trouble even launching and landing aircraft — its primary function — and is increasingly vulnerable to attack by next-generation high-speed missiles.

The few positives in the new budget like the Navy’s decision to retire the unnecessary and unworkable Littoral Combat Ship — a sort of “F-35 of the sea” designed for multiple tasks none of which it does well — could easily be reversed by advocates from states and districts where those systems are built and maintained. The House of Representatives for instance has a powerful Joint Strike Fighter Caucus which in 2021 mustered more than one-third of all House members to press for more F-35s than the Pentagon and Air Force requested as they will no doubt do again this year. A Shipbuilding Caucus co-chaired by representatives Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Rob Wittman (R-VA) will fight against the Navy’s plan to retire old ships to buy new ones. (They would prefer that the Navy keep the old ones and buy new ones with more of your tax money up for grabs.) Similarly the “ICBM Coalition” made up of senators from states with either ICBM bases or production centers has a near perfect record of staving off reductions in the deployment or funding of those weapons and will in 2022 be hard at work defending its budgetary allocation.

Towards a new policy

Coming up with a sensible realistic and affordable defense policy always a challenge will be even more so in the midst of the Ukrainian nightmare. Still given where our taxpayer dollars go it remains all too worthwhile. Such a new approach should include things like reducing the numbers of the Pentagon’s private contractors hundreds of thousands of people many of whom are engaged in thoroughly redundant jobs that could be done more cheaply by civilian government employees or simply eliminated. It’s estimated that cutting spending on contractors by 15% would save around $262 billion over 10 years.

The Pentagon’s three-decades-long near $2 trillion “modernization” plan to build a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers missiles and submarines along with new warheads should for instance simply be scrapped in keeping with the kind of “deterrence-only” nuclear strategy developed by the nuclear-policy organization Global Zero. And the staggering American global military footprint — an invitation to further conflict that includes more than 750 military bases scattered on every continent except Antarctica and counterterror operations in 85 countries — should at the very least be sharply scaled back.

According to the Center for International Policy’s Sustainable Defense Task Force and a study of alternative approaches to defense carried out by the Congressional Budget Office even a relatively minimalist strategic rethinking could save at least $1 trillion over the next decade enough to make a healthy down payment on investments in public health preventing or mitigating the worst potential impacts of climate change or beginning the task of narrowing record levels of income inequality.

Of course none of these changes can occur without challenging the power and influence of the military-industrial-congressional complex a task as urgent as it is difficult in this moment of carnage in Europe. No matter how hard it may be it’s a fight worth having both for the security of the world and the future of the planet.

One thing is guaranteed: a new gold rush of “defense” spending is a disaster in the making for all of us not in that complex.

You’ve probably heard a lot about corporations not paying taxes. Last year individuals like you contributed six times more in income tax than corporations did.

But have you heard about how many of your tax dollars then end up in corporate pockets? It’s a lot — especially for corporations that contract with the Pentagon. They collect nearly half of all military spending.

The average taxpayer contributed about $2000 to the military last year according to a breakdown my colleagues and I prepared for the Institute for Policy Studies. More than $900 of that went to corporate military contractors.

In 2020 the largest Pentagon contractor Lockheed Martin took in $75 billion from taxpayers — and paid its CEO more than $23 million.

Unfortunately this spending isn’t buying us a more secure world.

Last year Congress added $25 billion the Pentagon didn’t ask for to its already gargantuan budget. Lawmakers even refused to let military leaders retire weapons systems they couldn’t use anymore. The extra money favored top military contractors that gave campaign money to a group of lawmakers who refused to comment on it.

Then there’s simple price-gouging.

There’s the infamous case of TransDigm a Pentagon contractor that charged the government $4361 for a metal pin that should’ve cost $46 — and then refused to share cost data. Congress recently asked TransDigm to repay some of its misbegotten profits but the Pentagon hasn’t cut off its business.

Somewhere between price-gouging and incompetence lies the F-35 jet fighter an embarrassment the late Senator John McCain a Pentagon booster called “a scandal and a tragedy.”

Among the most expensive weapons systems ever the F-35 has numerous failings. It’s spontaneously caught fire at least three times — hardly the outcome you’d expect for the top Pentagon contractor’s flagship program. The Pentagon has reduced its request for new F-35s this year by about a third but Congress may reject that too.

Most serious of all there’s the problem of U.S. weapons feeding conflicts in ways the Pentagon didn’t foresee but probably should have.

When U.S. ground troops left Afghanistan they left behind a huge array of military equipment from armored vehicles to aircraft that could now be in Taliban hands. The U.S. also left weapons in Iraq that fell into the hands of ISIS including guns and an anti-tank missile.

Even weapons we sold to so-called allies like Saudi Arabia have ended up going to people affiliated with groups like al Qaeda.

Military weapons also end up on city streets at home. Over the years civilian law agencies have received guns armored vehicles and even grenade launchers from the military turning local police into near-military organizations.

Records also show that the Pentagon has lost hundreds of weapons which may have been stolen including grenade launchers and rocket launchers. Some of these weapons have been used in crimes.

Taxpayers shouldn’t be spending $900 apiece for these outcomes. My team at the Institute for Policy Studies and others have demonstrated ways to cut up to $350 billion per year from the Pentagon budget including what we spend on weapons contractors without compromising our safety.

Even better we could then put some of that money elsewhere.

Compared to the $900 for Pentagon contractors the average taxpayer contributed only about $27 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention $171 to K-12 education and barely $5 to renewable energy.

How much more could we get if we invested even a fraction of what we spend on military contractors for these dire needs?

Most Americans support shifting Pentagon funds to pay for domestic needs. Instead of making Americans fork over another $900 to corporate military contractors this year Congress should put our dollars to better use.

The F-35 has proliferated around the world impressively with numerous international partners purchasing it and rightly so considering its game-changing military capabilities known in many aviation circles as the quarterback in the sky. This year Canada Finland Thailand and the United Arab Emirates are in various stages of acquiring the F-35.

Here is a quick rundown of where the F-35 program stands right now and some of the impressive facts some of the critics seem to always forget:

The F-35: A Global Jobs Creator

Lockheed says the F-35 program includes eight international partners and six countries that have purchased the fighter. This has been a boost to economic development in the United States. The warplane according to the defense behemoth is “delivering more than just air dominance it’s simultaneously delivering tens of thousands of high paying high-quality jobs to American workers across the country and around the world.”

U.S. May Get Fewer F-35s (Or Not?)

The United States is requesting 61 F-35s for FY23. That is 33 fewer than what the Pentagon has previously planned to order.

Keep in mind this is just a starting point with Congress and could be amended much higher. Numerous lawmakers who have positive ties to the F-35 with production from suppliers that support jobs in their districts will look to increase that number. Lockheed can look to foreign military sales to pick up the slack until the National Defense Authorization Act from Congress passes later this year for the FY23 defense budget.

Also with Russia and China now the clear dominant threat to U.S. national security the F-35 is a vital component of America’s national defense strategy. There is a very strong possibility the buy this year of F-35s could go up especially as the war in Ukraine continues to press ahead.

Canada May Become a Customer

Meanwhile Canada is in the market for a new fighter to replace its aging CF-18 Hornets. Canada’s Royal Air Force announced on March 28 that Lockheed won the competition to supply its main warplane. The deal is not fully baked yet. Canada could order 88 new warplanes perhaps F-35s in a buy that is worth $15 billion for a 2025 delivery but the Canadian government would have to approve it first.

The F-35 could enable Canada to not only defend the homeland and help NATO secure Europe but it could also be a factor in protecting the Arctic region from Russian incursion. Canada is claiming sovereignty of 1.2 million square kilometers of land in the Arctic. Russia has territorial claims there as well.

Thailand Is Beginning the Process Toward F-35 Purchase

Thailand is another potential customer for the F-35 although there are numerous hurdles the country will have to jump through in order for a successful airplane transfer from Lockheed. The Royal Thai Air Force wants U.S. Air Force Pacific Command to help the Thais make a formal request for the F-35. This would be a modest buy of four fighter jets but would still make a difference with the U.S. ally in its rivalry with China. Thailand could use stealth fighters to protect its borders with the air superiority fighter.

Finland Is So Far Giving a Green Light

Finland announced on February 11 that it had formalized a significant buy of F-35s. 64 jets and maintenance assistance with a manufacturing and engineering partnership included in the deal. This will create assembly jobs in Finland. Beginning in 2025 the F-35 will begin replacing its F/A-18C/D Hornet fighters. Finland is closer in the process to join NATO and the F-35 will be an important part of its defense strategy if it becomes an active partner in the alliance.

2022: The Year of the F-35?

All in all the F-35 is popular with foreign air forces. The stealth fighter is making more inroads with those customers and the United States looks like a reliable ally when these “fighter diplomacy” deals are consummated. The agreements with Thailand and also the UAE have some work to do before they commence but the Canada and Finland will most likely have F-35s patrolling in their skies later this decade.

At the US Army’s High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at the White Sands Missile Range New Mexico the Lockheed Martin Layered Laser Defense (LLD) weapon disabled the engine on a drone which then parachuted to earth.

Sponsored by the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and conducted in partnership with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and Lockheed Martin the February 2022 test was intended not only to demonstrate the ability of laser weapons to track and take out large targets like the drone in question but also a variety of threats such as robotic fixed-wing aerial vehicles quadcopters and subsonic cruise missiles.

According to the Navy laser weapons have a number of advantages. Using a high-resolution telescope the system can track and help identify incoming targets and determine how much damage the laser inflicts on a target. In addition laser weapons can be scaled back to disable sensors or dazzle hostile forces without permanently blinding them.

Unlike earlier laser weapons which were powered by chemicals the LLD is solid-state composed of coils of glass optical fibers doped with various elements. These coils can be bundled and the lasers they generate can be combined into a single powerful beam and projected through optics that aim it focus it and compensate for atmospheric distortion.

In addition laser weapons require no explosives or propellants which makes them inherently safer to keep aboard ships and it has a theoretically unlimited supply of ammunition so long as power is available allowing for costs of about a dollar per shot.

The Navy has previously deployed laser weapons in 2014 aboard the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf and the USS Portland in 2021 that disabled drones without shooting them down. Both were demonstrators and the Navy has no plans to field the LLD as a standard weapons system. But the latest test shows the increasing capabilities of the technology including the use of artificial intelligence to track and target threats.

""The Navy performed similar tests during the 1980s but with chemical-based laser technologies that presented significant logistics barriers for fielding in an operational environment"" said Dr. Frank Peterkin ONR’s directed energy portfolio manager. ""And ultimately those types of lasers did not transition to the fleet or any other service.""

His mission: Do what no one has been able to do build on Union Pier.

More words have been spilled in vain on Union Pier than any other development in the history of Charleston. It’s the grand prize the most valuable of valuable jewels and through the decades the State Ports Authority has a perfect record of getting absolutely … nothing … done.

Dare I write the words “this time could be different”? Well if Jacob Lindsey is willing to move his family to that Rocky Mountain paradise called Boulder Colo. and then pack them up 14 months later and bring them back to Charleston in an effort to do the impossible why not? Let’s be wild and crazy Steve and allow that the impossible just might be possible.

Here’s the dream: The city’s darn-smart former planning director a guy who knows everyone who knows how everything here works is lured back to Charleston by a giant national real estate developer (that would be Lowe Enterprises) to draft a plan for Union Pier and get it through the incredible maze to approval. It cannot hurt that Charleston’s favorite billionaire Ben Navarro is a new partner with Lowe in its grand waterfront hotel The Cooper being built on the site of the Ports Authority’s former headquarters.

Cruise ships you ask? Be patient we’ll get to that.

The biggest hurdle is not the neighborhoods not even those tacky cruise ships but the client the State Ports Authority. Look at it this way: A guy can hire the best lawyer in town but if he isn’t going to listen that lawyer isn’t going to do him much good. The Ports Authority has never been much of a listener at least when it comes to listening to us common folk in Charleston.

The bearded rail-thin Lindsey has to know what he’s getting himself into.

POSITIVES

— Excellent arm length with a stiff firm punch that can stymie defenders on contact.

— Can establish first meaningful contact on defenders in the run game latch and steer them away from the ball.

— Flashes the ability to generate torque to displace and create alleys on wide-zone base blocks.

— Has the frame and vast reach to engulf tie up and blot out slow-trigger 'backers on his climbs.

— Plays with an edge and will strain to sustain blocks once latched.





NEGATIVES

— Marginal athletic ability balance and body control.

— Uneven weight distribution in his pass sets; will overset open the door and get dusted across his face by moderately skilled rushers.

— Will often drop his hands prior to his punch which causes him to be late with wide hand placement and gives easy access to his frame.

— Slow to re-leverage his hips and hands underneath the bull rush causing him to get knocked back on his heels and shed with ease against secondary moves.

— Steps under himself and loses critical ground out of his stance on the backside of zone runs allowing consistent penetration.

OVERALL

Vederian Lowe was a four-and-a-half-year starter at Illinois with 52 career starts at left tackle. He started 12 games during the 2021 season in the Illini's multiple run scheme.

Lowe has excellent arm length that he uses to establish first meaningful contact on defenders as a run- and pass-blocker. He excels in pass protection using a stiff firm punch to deliver jolt on contact and his strong latch in the run game enables him to control steer and open up alleys on frontside kick-out/angle-drive blocks.

Lowe can be effective at the second level on climbs in a straight line and he has the wingspan and grip strength to tie up 'backers. He also brings a physical edge as a finisher through the whistle.

Lowe has marginal play speed due to middling movement skills recovery balance and body control. He is slow to adjust his angles and fit on shifty targets on the move reset and refit in his anchor and redirect laterally to protect against inside counters. This causes him to whiff and fall off too many blocks and he struggles to stay upright with trash around his feet.

Overall Lowe has a tremendous amount of experience at left tackle along with admirable maturity and leadership qualities. His ideal length good grip strength and competitive toughness should give him a shot at carving out a backup role. However his subpar movement skills contact balance and body control cap his ceiling as a depth piece.

Lowe had to adjust for the ball hit by leadoff batter Tim Anderson carrying further than he expected given the stiff breeze blowing in. He had to time his leap to get extended above the top of the 8-foot wall. And then he had to survive the massive celebratory hug from centerfielder Kevin Kiermaier.

Josh Lowe brought it back 😱 pic.twitter.com/K17uWtspwk — MLB (@MLB) April 17 2022

“It feels really good’’ the 6-foot-4 Lowe said. “I was happy that I put myself in a position to go and help the team succeed make a play on that ball.’’

Lowe who shifted from third base to the outfield in 2017 at Class A said he only robbed one homer previously last season at Triple-A Durham. This one was better.

“That was pretty cool today’’ he said.

Kiermaier couldn’t say enough good things about the play noting Lowe’s “perfect” form and instincts to keep tracking it through the wind and insisting it should be the top play on ESPN’s SportsCenter.

“I’ve been excited in years past when my teammates make great plays and that one has to be up there’’ Kiermaier said. “Just triumphant. … I didn’t think there was a chance but I saw him keep going back and I saw him jump up and I saw it go in his glove and I screamed.

“That’s a play that he’ll never forget — his first robbed homer in the big leagues. He’s going to be doing that for years to come. He’s a great player all around he works hard and he’s just a great athlete. So for him to make that play I was just living vicariously. That was awesome. Reminds me of a young Kevin Kiermaier.’’

Tommy Romero sent down

Tommy Romero’s second major-league outing went better than his Tuesday debut as he worked the final two innings allowing just a solo homer. But he was optioned back to Triple A after the game as the Rays opted to keep reliever Phoenix Sanders in clearing a space for Javy Guerra the right-handed reliever acquired Saturday from San Diego. Manager Kevin Cash said they are still learning about how best to use Guerra who was converted from shortstop to reliever in 2019: “He’s a high electric-stuff guy that we’ve got to find a way to get it the zone consistently.’’ ... Reliever Dusten Knight designated for assignment after pitching Wednesday cleared waivers and accepted an outright assignment to Durham.

Rotation set Ryan Yarbrough delayed

The Rays opted to keep their rotation in order and push back plans to give their starters extra rest with Shane McClanahan set to work Monday’s series opener against the Cubs Josh Fleming (either starting or behind an opener) on Tuesday and Drew Rasmussen on Wednesday. The starters will get extra rest before their next turn as the team has Thursday and April 25 off. The Rays initially hoped Ryan Yarbrough sidelined at the start of the season with left groin tightness could face the Cubs. But though Cash said Yarbrough was “doing good” and hadn’t had a setback the lefty has yet to even throw off a mound. Cash said they hope Yarbrough does so by Tuesday and it was “possible’' he could start during the nine-game homestand that begins Friday.

Miscellany

Reliever J.P. Feyereisen made his first start since 2014 in college working as the opener Sunday. But rather than wait in the dugout for the bottom of the first inning he stayed in the bullpen and ran in from there to the mound. “I’m not big on sitting down after getting loose’’ he said. ... For 14 of the current Rays the series against the Cubs that starts Monday will be their first games playing at historic Wrigley Field. … Cash said catcher Mike Zunino’s previously sore shoulder has improved to the point where he can start playing back-to-back games potentially this week though maybe one game as a DH.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Perkins-Sinapati filed one of three civil lawsuits blaming HPD for the wreck.

In February the city council approved the settlement.

At last check Perkins-Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses. Meanwhile his attorney cast suspicion on his arrest.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June. All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUva2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BlbmluZy1wcm9qZWN0aW9uLTEyMzU5MDc3NzUv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtYm94LW9mZmljZS1vcGVuaW5nLXByb2plY3Rpb24tMTIzNTkwNzc3NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Looks To Evolve Summer With $130M+ Global Opening – Box Office Preview,"The first Planet of the Apes movie under the Disney regime after absorbing Fox hits theaters this weekend with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes poised to do $50M+ domestic and $130M WW.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels.

Thompson Center is in full swing after the building’s developers on Monday officially kicked off the redevelopment project saying it will have an “unbelievable impact” on the Loop and strengthen Chicago’s reputation as a technology hub.

Once complete the building at 100 W. Randolph St. will become Google’s Chicago headquarters and house 2000 employees. The project is expected to be move-in ready by 2026.

The renovation of the center comes at a time of wider transformation for the Loop. Mayor Brandon Johnson announced in April that he was seeking $150 million in tax increment financing for four La Salle Street adaptive reuse projects. The conversions would create more than 1000 new apartments in the city’s Central Business District bringing new use to largely vacant office buildings.

Prime/Capri Interests a joint venture between developers Michael Reschke and Quintin Primo III is completing the $280 million build-to-suit redevelopment under an agreement with Google which intends to purchase the building once renovations are complete. PCI said the makeover is akin to a rebuild.

“When this project is complete this one single building will help lift up the surrounding area” Reschke said. “Not only will it lift up the buildings but it also will lift up ... all the people who work live and visit this area every single day.”

Reschke and Primo were joined by Gov. J.B. Pritzker Johnson and Google’s head of its Chicago operations Karen Sauder along with other Google executives and city and state officials.

Pritzker told Google’s leaders that it’s “an incredible investment both in your future and in ours.”

PCI will restore and modernize the Thompson Center with a new triple-pane glass wrap on the exterior a heightened colonnade three levels of covered terraces and access to green spaces.

The center’s CTA stop at Clark and Lake streets where six lines converge will remain open throughout construction. Google previously said passengers on those lines could expect a “new and improved CTA experience” though it hasn’t been made clear what that will look like.

In 2022 Pritzker announced that the center traded hands inking a deal with Google in “a sale that has eluded State government for decades” according to a news release at the time. The state working out terms with developer Reschke sold it to Google for $105 million and then paid $75 million for 115 S. La Salle St. formerly the BMO Harris Bank building where the state moved its offices from the Thompson Center.

Construction at the 1.2 million-square-foot center started a month ago when Clark Construction placed equipment on the site and protective fencing was installed around the building’s perimeter and outdoor plaza. On Thursday construction crews could be seen tearing off the lower exterior of the building and a portion of the atrium.

The 38-year-old state government building has long garnered mixed reactions. Over the course of its existence three governors wanted the center demolished because of its age and high maintenance costs. State officials have said it costs $17 million a year to operate the building.

But pricey maintenance costs are expected to change through PCI’s redevelopment efforts. The developer is pursuing LEED Platinum status — the highest level of LEED certification — and transitioning the building to all electric. The Thompson Center’s internal systems will be replaced along with its heating and cooling systems to better handle Chicago’s climate. The glass facade which will bring a modern touch and higher visibility will also double as a way to improve the building’s thermal performance.

Efforts to make the center a green building are in line with Google’s goal to use 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“With the Thompson Center we saw a chance to revitalize the Loop but also take this iconic building that some thought of tearing down and instead make the renovations necessary to respectfully steward it into the 21st century” Sauder said.

Designed by Chicago architect Helmut Jahn the building opened in 1985 as the State of Illinois Center. It’s become recognizable for its 17-story atrium and the 29-foot tall “Monument with Standing Beast” sculpture. The sculpture nicknamed “Snoopy in a Blender” was removed last week and will be kept at a state facility until it’s moved to the Art Institute of Chicago.

Jahn’s namesake architecture firm is leading the redesign.

Johnson said Google’s investment proves Chicago is globally connected and a world-class hub for innovation. From 2022 to 2023 Chicago saw 32 new office openings.

“Chicago is the place to be” Johnson said.

We spent the night at the new(ish) Marriott Frankfurt Airport which really impressed me… for the most part.

Background on the Marriott Frankfurt Airport

For years I used to stay at the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport which I for some reason had a real soft spot for. The hotel featured 1000+ rooms so it was an absolutely massive airport hotel. In early 2020 it was announced that the hotel would be split into two.

Rather than having a single Sheraton with 1000+ rooms there would instead be a Marriott with 233 rooms and a Sheraton with 779 rooms. As part of this redevelopment the hotel has also undergone a major renovation which seems to largely be wrapping up.

Booking the Marriott Frankfurt Airport

I booked the Marriott Frankfurt Airport a couple of weeks in advance with a flexible rate which was only around 140 Euro per night. I thought that was pretty low since typically I find the Marriott is priced quite a bit higher than the Sheraton.

Interestingly by the day of arrival the hotel was charging 260 Euro for a base room which is a good reminder to always book early especially with a flexible rate that you can cancel.

Marriott Frankfurt Airport location

The single biggest selling point of the Marriott Frankfurt Airport is the location as it’s connected directly to Terminal 1. To access the hotel just go to the check-in hall on the departures level (one level above arrivals). There’s the A & Z check-in hall and then there’s the B & C check-in hall and between the two you’ll see an escalator.

Escalators to Marriott Frankfurt Airport

Take the escalator up a level and then take the enclosed bridge that goes toward hotels the Squaire etc.

Path to Marriott Frankfurt Airport

You’ll then just want to follow the signage toward the Marriott and Sheraton as the two hotels share an entrance.

Marriott & Sheraton Frankfurt Airport entrance

There’s then a central area where the Marriott is in one direction while the Sheraton is in another direction.

Marriott Frankfurt Airport lobby & check-in

I’ll just say it upfront — I couldn’t believe how nice the Marriott was from the lobby to the guest rooms to the food & beverage outlets. The lobby was pretty with tons of seating that wasn’t only nice to look at but was actually practical. For example I wish more hotels had cafe-style seating in the lobby so that you can easily come down there and work on a laptop without ordering anything to eat or drink.

Our check-in experience was also great. We were helped by a really friendly guy. Not only did he thank me for being a Bonvoy Titanium member but he proactively explained that we were entitled to a suite upgrade subject to availability and he offered to take a look at any available upgrades. A moment later he said he had upgraded us to a suite.

Seriously I should buy a lottery ticket because I don’t remember the last time I stayed at a Marriott and the check-in agent proactively offered a suite upgrade that wasn’t pre-blocked.

He also explained that the hotel’s club lounge was closed for the time being and that breakfast and an evening happy hour were instead served in other venues:

The club lounge breakfast was served from 6:30AM until 10:30AM at Flavors Restaurant

Soft drinks were available from 10:30AM until 5PM at Eatery Kitchen & Bar

The club lounge evening happy hour was served from 5PM until 10PM at Flavors Restaurant with a snack “bento box” plus alcoholic drinks

Now I have to apologize about something in advance — I didn’t take pictures of anything related to the club lounge. After way overindulging in Courchevel I needed a solid 12 hour food and drink detox prior to getting on a Singapore Suites flight.

Marriott Frankfurt Airport suite

We were assigned room 6222 a suite on the sixth floor. The elevators were right across from reception and I remembered them from the Sheraton days (though the walls have been treated).

Marriott Frankfurt Airport elevators

Our room was near the elevator — we just had to turn right and then it was the first room on the right.

Marriott Frankfurt Airport suite exterior

The suite was massive and really well done. Inside the entrance was the living room which had a large “L” shaped couch a desk with a chair a dining table with four chairs and then a more comfortable seat in the corner by the TV.

The room had a mini-fridge with two bottles of water and a kettle. I didn’t see any in-room coffee — I know (rather controversially) the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport used to charge for in-room coffee pods so I’m not sure what’s going on here.

Also off the living room and right by the entrance was a half bath with a sink and toilet.

There were double doors separating the bedroom from the living room. The bedroom had a king size bed and a chair.

At the back of the bedroom was a closet and then past that was the main bathroom.

The bathroom had a sink a bathtub a walk-in shower and a toilet.

Toiletries were from Acca Kappa as is pretty standard for Marriott.

Sadly the Marriott doesn’t have much in the way of apron or runway views but rather mostly faces the terminal and the Squaire.

Marriott Frankfurt Airport suite view

Obviously it was awesome to get a proactive upgrade to such a large suite. Even more impressive to me though was the general way these rooms were renovated. Is this a St. Regis? No of course not. But I thought the effort that was put into the finishes and in particular the wall treatments made a big difference. For example this felt at least as luxurious as the rooms at the Ritz-Carlton Turks & Caicos.

Marriott Frankfurt Airport air conditioning problems

Now let me share my one real criticism of the property. When we walked into our suite we noticed how warm it was. I know everyone likes to sleep at different temperatures and in Germany people generally like to keep it pretty warm.

For example I know when my relatives from Germany visit the United States they always ask us to make it warmer at night because anything below 74 degrees is just too cold for them.

That brings us to the Marriott Frankfurt Airport:

For our stay in early April the hotel hadn’t yet turned on air conditioning for the season so the only thing you could do was control the amount of heat that the room got

There was no way to open the windows

They didn’t have any fans (or anything) that guests could borrow to cool off their rooms

I don’t want to exaggerate and suggest that the room was like a sauna but both Ford and I slept on top of the sheets because it was just too warm otherwise. I don’t remember temperature being an issue at the Sheraton in the past so I think we just got unlucky in terms of the time of year where we stayed.

In winter this wouldn’t be an issue and in summer the air conditioning is turned on.

Marriott & Sheraton Frankfurt Airport public areas

Anyone who stayed at the Sheraton before it was renovated (and split into two hotels) probably wouldn’t recognize the hotel at this point. Most of the public facilities of the two hotels are shared as the lobbies are right next to one another.

Sheraton Frankfurt Airport lobby

The Sheraton lobby is much nicer than before.

Like really nice…

Eatery Kitchen & Bar is the primary restaurant of the Marriott and Sheraton and it’s such a significant improvement over the old setup.

One area of the hotel that hasn’t been renovated is the gym. This is shared between the two hotels and it’s on the small side when you consider that there are 1000+ rooms. Then again perhaps airport hotels don’t get as much gym use as some other hotels.

I also spent a night at the Marriott Frankfurt Airport last year. However I didn’t review the hotel at the time since it was still fully under renovation. However at the time I did snag some pictures of the club lounge even though it wasn’t open.

This is the same lounge space that the Sheraton used to have but it looks much nicer than before. Hopefully this lounge opens again at some point in the not-too-distant future.

Bottom line

The Marriott Frankfurt Airport is an impressive airport hotel. The main reason to stay here is the location — you can’t beat being connected directly to the terminal without even having to go outside.

The way that the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport has developed while being split into two hotels is impressive. The rooms are nicely done I was offered a proactive elite upgrade and the food & beverage outlets are nice-looking as well (though I didn’t actually eat or drink anything at the hotel).

My only real criticism is the lack of air conditioning during our stay as our room was quite warm. Hopefully that’s an isolated incident though as air conditioning should soon be turned on for the season.

Collaboration to create the largest hotel-based emergency food-relief effort on the island

Community

By Advertorial

Sunday 17 April 2022 11:00 AM

The Marriott Bonvoy portfolio of hotels and resorts in Phuket Phang Nga and Koh Samui have entered a new collaboration with Living Waters Phuket (LWP) a registered charity Foundation. This will ultimately support LWP’s efforts with its ongoing emergency food relief initiatives throughout Thailand.

The collaboration commenced at the start of April and continues its efforts for over two weeks with a donation of 1600 Life Bags for communities in Thailand’s southern provinces.

“When we learned about the amazing project that Living Waters Phuket has been running and how much our local communities need immediate attention we wanted to offer our support right away” said Mr Brad Edman Multi-Property Vice President Phuket and General Manager at Renaissance Phuket Resort & Spa.

“Marriott hotels and resorts in Phuket have always supported the communities in which we operate especially during the pandemic. Our collaboration with LWP will help to further support communities in need.”

Demand for emergency food aid is at an all-time high due to the pandemic and ongoing effects on tourism and the fact that thousands of people are still required to live in community isolation for extended periods of time.

The Living Waters Phuket Foundation was set up in November 2021 to build brighter futures for communities in need in Phuket and across Thailand. It essentially helps to raise awareness of critical projects and provides funding around essential relief areas including emergency food supplies education requirements renewable energy and sustainable environmental solutions.

“We are thrilled to see the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio work together with us at this level; this is the largest single hotel based collaboration on Life Bags and is a pleasure to be part of the difference this will make to the communities across southern Thailand” said Shaun Stenning Founder of Living Waters Phuket.

“This is part of the roll out joint initiative with Foundation and the Phuket Hotels Association (PHA) Life Bag Project which we have been working on in recent months.”

In April 2022 all 16 Marriott Bonvoy hotels and resorts in Phuket Phang Nga and Koh Samui will work with Living Waters Phuket to organise two major Life Bag Project events; the first in Koh Samui from April 2nd- 5th and the next across the three districts in Phuket from April 19th – 20th.

1600 Life Bags will be distributed with the goal of helping over 6400 people in desperate need. Each Life Bag can feed a family of four people for up to four days and contain staple family food products.

“Serving our world is one of Marriott’s core values and giving back to the communities where we operate is one of our main commitments. Business Council GMs and NextGen team of associates work together closely to support local communities through various activities and initiatives.

“Phuket has been a major focus for us during the pandemic. We are very happy that we’re now able to extend our support to Phang Nga and Koh Samui through our collaboration with Living Waters Phuket” said Mr Daryn Hudson Head of Marriott Southern Thailand Business Council and General Manager at Four Points by Sheraton Phuket Patong Beach Resort.

There are 16 Marriott Bonvoy portfolio hotels and resorts across Phuket Phang Nga and Koh Samui taking part in this initiative.

Recently Marriott Bonvoy on Wheels Marriott International’s delivery programme collaborated with Master Chef Diana Chan. As a part of this association Chef Diana curated five dishes which will be available at the JW Marriott hotels in Mumbai Pune Delhi Chandigarh Kolkata and Bengaluru till July 2022. In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol Chef Diana talks about the association her love for typical desi Indian food winning MasterChef Australia and more. Excerpts:

Tell us about the new menu…

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

The menu showcases five dishes which I have carefully selected and personally trained the in-house chefs to prepare. The dishes available are inspired from my Malaysian background infused with some Australian ingredients. It will be available for three months from the start of April 2022.

You won 'MasterChef Australia' in 2017 - what was the most unforgettable aspect of the MasterChef journey for you?

I will never forget the moment that I lifted up the trophy. It was electric. I also loved my semi-final challenge. I had a gut feeling inside of me beaming with confidence and all I wanted to do was deliver. I felt like a crazy woman on a mission (laughs)!

What do you keep in mind when creating any dish? Which aspect do you give most priority to - flavour texture taste?

For me it’s all about balance of flavours. Sure texture and visuals play a big role too. After all we do eat with our eyes. I love food that is visually appealing but more so it has to taste good. I’m also huge on the quality of ingredients. I want to know that my protein and vegetables are good quality and have been sustainably sourced.

What do you love the most about Indian food?

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

I love Indian food because it evokes a memory for me. It’s nostalgic for me. Growing up in Malaysia Indian food is incredibly popular. I love the spices and the aroma from curries and the simplicity and delicate flavours in rotis. It’s a very broad and interesting cuisine with so much left to explore.

You have said before that you like savoury dishes more than deserts… What is the most important aspect one should keep in mind when cooking savoury dishes?

Balance of flavours. It takes years to master cooking. Understanding the fundamentals and the basics before being too adventurous is the most important rule in cooking. I love being able to improvise on dishes and changing ingredients which react in a similar way and using what’s in season.

For vegetarians what is the quickest main course recipe you'd recommend?

Tadka dal and rice. I love it. I tend to add in extra veggies when cooking tadka dal to bulk it up a little. All done in 30 minutes.

For non-vegetarians which is the quickest main course recipe you'd recommend?

A perfectly seasoned and well-cooked steak with Greek Salad and Truffle Dijon. It’s our go-to in my household.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3dGVsZWdyYXBobmcuY29tL2xhZ29zLW1hcnJpb3R0LWhvdGVsLWlrZWphLXBhdHJvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lagos Marriott Hotel Ikeja,"The Ikeja – based Lagos is this Easter period reinforcing its position as choice venue for international and local travellers looking to savour uniquely curated dining experiences as its acclaimed world class chef Bishnu Khatri delights diners with authentic Indian cuisine at Wakame Restaurant. The General Manager of the Hotel Rudi Janse Van Rensburg said: ’’Since opening our Asian specialty restaurant–Wakame; our venue with its unique offerings and semi-open kitchen has established its position as a specialty cooking restaurant.

‘‘Our Chefs De Cuisine are passionately busy each day with varieties of traditional Asian blended cuisine which include Japanese Chinese Thai and Northern Indian recipes. “A visit to Wakame Restaurant will open up your palate and unlock a new and inspirational perspective on Asian food. Your journey would begin with an eye opening appreciation of the restaurant’s décor with its style inspiration from the rich and beautiful mosaic designs reminiscent of traditional Asian settings.

You then become awakened to the aroma of jasmine and spice surrounding the pleasant clatter of pots and pans; excitingly signaling your meal. “In all with Indian cuisine it’s more about the experience around the preparation and the collective style of sharing the dish; which makes it one of the best for bonding with family and friends. ‘‘Taking this all into consideration; Chef Bishnu Khatri is definitely a valued addition and fulfills this aspect of our Wakame Restaurant gastronomy.

The culinary talent who enjoys cooking tandoori kebabs world famous chicken biryani and a variety of authentic Indian regional curries is equally proven to deliver the best naan tandoori biryani and curries you will ever taste. “Wakame Restaurant is inspired by the concept of Asian cuisine and our customers have been privy to our use of only the freshest ingredients around world class culinary equipment. I am therefore excited about the elevated offerings and experience that chef Bishnu will deliver to our customers. ‘‘In line with Wakame Restaurant’s service culture; our Chef de Cuisine- Bishnu and his team will deliver inspiring menus from the Robata Grill Crispy Duck Oven Wok and Tandoor Oven."

Since 2018 Agrolog has invested in developing the ginger value chain by using its internal resources to support an out-grower scheme reaching an aggregate of 10000 farmers.

This collaborative effort is focused on providing immediate material capacity and structural support to 60000 smallholder farmers out of the over 1.2 million vulnerable indigenous Ginger farming communities of Kaduna State spanning 12 local government areas.

As a result of the first year’s harvest Agrolog embarked on vigorous training of women within the project community to help them process some of their harvests into ginger juice powder oil spices and syrup to create new markets within and outside these communities.

The training featured over 100 women trained in batches who will become merchants for processed Ginger in Southern Kaduna. The women were mainly excited as they have been economically empowered to cater to their families and are grateful for a project that mostly pays attention to women to drive equality in community development.

According to Dr Manzo Maigari the Managing Director Agrolog Limited the Nigerian variety of Ginger is very much in demand and can serve as a significant source of income for the country. It is also acclaimed to be of superior quality with an outstanding flavour and is in heavy demand in the international market.

“It is therefore on this basis that these women are undergoing training to give them a chance of more than just subsistence farming. In time they can export their produce to international markets and get real value for their labour and grow to empower their families and other women who will in turn empower others.

“In this way we enable a cycle of development and progressive practices which will drive gender parity and promote inclusion for women and women farmers in Nigeria” she said.

After being eliminated on April 15 against Brazil the tennis players selected by captain Fabiola Zuluaga in the Colsanitas team which represents the Colombia national team were challenged not to bring their record down to group II in 2023 through three death matches against the Paraguayan national team.

To ensure the result in favor the team captained by Fabiola Zuluaga needed only the triumph in the singles points. The first to take the court was Cucuteña Yuliana Lizarazo who in two and a half hours overtook the juvenile Leyla Britez with partials of [5-7] [6-4] and [6-2].

Yuliana Lizarazo derrotó a Leyla Britez en el primer juego de la jornada entre Colombia y Paraguay / (Twitter: @Fedecoltenis)

The second was much more unbalanced as María Fernanda Herazo scored a double 6-0 against Heydi Doldán in less than 50 minutes and gave the national team the long-awaited peace of mind:

Thus Team Colombia Colsanitas said goodbye to Salinas Ecuador without qualifying the long-awaited play-offs to play the international title but rescuing their category for the following year when they can count on the experience and talent of María Camila Osorio number 33 in the WTA ranking.

It was not necessary to play the doubles game between Maria Paulina Perez and Antonia Samudio vs. Leyla Britez and Paulina Franco because at 1:41pm Colombia already had 2-0 in favor in the overall series of the relegation and permanence match.

In post-match statements between Colombia and Paraguay captain Fabiola Zuluaga was very optimistic about the work of her leaders during the final phase of qualifying in the Billie Jean King Cup 2022. These were his words about it:

It should be noted that next year Colombia will compete again in this instance against South American rivals such as Brazil Argentina Mexico or Chile. Subsequently the women's tennis coffee team will have the opportunity to return to the play-offs a place that has not been accessed since 2008 when it won that year's Group I Americas and had to play against Belgium as a visitor.

For Colombia this will be the seventeenth consecutive season in Group I the most important that the American continent has in the Billie Jean King Cup. The last time the national team was part of Group II was in the 2005 edition of the championship formerly known as the Fed Cup.

It should be recalled that within Group II of the Americas in the 2022 edition of the Billie Jean King Cup are the following countries which are now looking for a place in Group I for the following year:

Bahamas Barbados Bermuda Bolivia Costa Rica Cuba Dominican Republic El Salvador Honduras Jamaica Panama Peru Puerto Rico Trinidad and Tobago Uruguay and Venezuela.

A year ago Colombia participated in this competition formerly called the Fed Cup with Emiliana Arango and María Camila Osorio Serrano in its ranks. The coffee delegation was eliminated by Argentina and was unable to reach the play-off area where Argentina and Mexico did settle countries that won with the participation of Nadia Podoroska Paula Ormaechea; Fernanda Contreras and Giuliana Olmos.

T20 bowling doesn't have one-size-fits-all template

Coping with injuries bubble life and managing workload

NEW DELHI: Skipper Hardik Pandya 's philosophy of playing ""not just to win"" but ""to entertain"" has infused energy and life into Gujarat Titans ' stellar campaign so far in IPL-15 feels pace spearhead Lockie Ferguson The New Zealand speed merchant has been one of the pillars for Titans in their debut season with eight wickets from five games including two match-turning performances.When asked how the new skipper has measured up with his leadership skills Ferguson was generous in his praise.""Hardik has a pretty relaxed approach towards game of cricket and he plays the game to entertain people as much as to win the game. I think that kind of attitude breathes energy and life into the group and of course he is leading with his performances which counts for a lot"" Ferguson told PTI in an exclusive interview.The New Zealand speedster is comfortable around the leadership group which has helped the team win four out of its first five games.""The whole leadership group including vice-captain Rashid (Khan) has also got a relaxed attitude and coaching group of Gary (mentor Kirsten) Vik (Director of cricket Vikram Solanki) and (head coach) Ash (Ashish Nehra) are the same. That explains quite well and its enjoyable"" he added.""Hardik has taken to leadership with an open arm but he has shown that one can't forget how good a batter he is when he gets going"" he said.Ferguson's respect for Hardik is understandable. When asked who is the most dangerous T20 batter that he has ever bowled to he promptly said ""Hardik Pandya"".""It's nice to have him in my side as I remember when I was with KKR in one match he was hitting sixes for fun.""Ferguson has also enjoyed playing under his national team skipper Kane Williamson and his former KKR captain Eoin Morgan.""During pressure situations what you need is relaxed attitude from the skipper. That helps a fast bowler. Time spent with a captain is the key so in that regard it is pretty tough to get past Kane (Wiliamson).""If Hardik laid the foundation with his special knock it was Ferguson who brought Titans back in the game against Rajasthan Royals with a beautifully planned delivery that got rid of Jos Buttler who was on a rampage.Ferguson explained what went into planning that delivery.""Look I wasn't trying to think too much about the score at that time. We had a wicket earlier in that over (R Ashwin) and Rashid had already bowled a gun over the one before me so that built some pressure"" he said.""The first ball that Jos played against me and I thought he might try to lap it and he was too good as he hit it for a six.""So my only real option was to change the pace and try to get some sort of movement in the air and it came out perfectly landing at the bottom of the stumps. So I was very pleased to tell from reaction that I got him out"" he said.Ferguson agreed that batters are planning well to combat the yorker and block hole deliveries at the death overs and hence the wide yorkers have come into the picture. They have been used to good effect to stop the run-flow.""The batters are setting up for yorkers now and when they are practising in nets and on bowling machines I find them to be so good at hitting low full-tosses and that's pretty awesome part of the game that if a bowler misses a fine margin he is hit for six.""""Fast bowlers have had to adapt and in IPL in last two seasons fast bowlers have done a great job on slightly bigger UAE grounds (Dubai and Abu Dhabi). Grounds this year are decent sizes and yeah I think there isn't a one-size-fits-all kind of a delivery.""Yes wide yorker is an effective delivery but you are also toying with the wide line. Depends how it's coming out on the day and depends how the batters are going about it.""Last year just before the Black Caps' World T20 campaign was about to commence Ferguson had a muscle tear and had to give the global meet a miss.""Yeah it was a small tear that put me out for three weeks and I missed the WT20 which was perhaps the most frustrating time one had to endure that too before the first game"" he rued.He feels that managing workload in a bubble life and playing three matches in a week for two months does have its flip side also which one needs to be very careful about.""Last couple of years have been challenging because of the amount of cricket we have played and the bubble life and when you are playing three games a week...""""It's very difficult for a fast bowler to recover. It's okay if you are doing it for a couple of weeks but after some time you are perhaps burning the candle at both ends"" he concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC8xODI4OTA5Mi9tYW4tdXRkLWNyaXN0aWFuby1yb25hbGRvLXByZS1tYXRjaC1yaXR1YWwv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2Zvb3RiYWxsLzE4Mjg5MDkyL21hbi11dGQtY3Jpc3RpYW5vLXJvbmFsZG8tcHJlLW1hdGNoLXJpdHVhbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch bizarre Cristiano Ronaldo pre-match ritual as he touches every team-mate in the tunnel before...,"MANCHESTER UNITED fans are calling for Cristiano Ronaldo to be appointed captain after seeing footage of his bizarre pre-match ritual.

The 37-year-old stole the show at Old Trafford on Saturday as he banged in a hat-trick in the 3-2 win against Norwich.

And it's quite possible his pre-match antics had a helping hand.

Ronaldo was spotted making contact with every one of his team-mates in the tunnel.

Starting with skipper Harry Maguire at the front of the line Ronaldo then made his way down the starting XI.

He could be seen touching his team-mates on their shoulders or chest while also offering words of encouragement prior to kick-off.

Supporters were loving it as one user tweeted: ""It’s actually criminal that he isn’t captain looool.""

Another commented: ""Ronaldo being captain without actually being captain Maguire is a fraud.""

A third added: ""Just give this man the armband ffs the only positives from this season have come from Ronnie.""

This fan then remarked: ""Give him the armband. Not even talking to the club I’m talking to Maguire…. Just give it him.""

Meanwhile one stated: ""Little things like that is why he should be captain.""

One then posted: ""Leadership doesn’t always need a captain band.""

Another simply said: ""Oh Captain My Captain....""

BONUS BONANZA

Ronaldo's hat-trick against Norwich was his second treble from his last three Premier League games as he brought up 21 goals for the season.

His dazzling display against the Canaries saw him bank a cool £850000.

When Ronaldo returned to United in the summer a set of incentives were included in the deal.

Ronaldo's heroics saw him bank two of those — the first a £750k bonus for reaching 20 goals and then another £100k for his hat-trick strike.

Having reached his initial goals target the five-time Ballon d'Or winner will continue to bank an extra £100k like yesterday for every additional time he finds the back of the net.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWNidXp6LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0LW5ld3MvMTIxOTU1L2xpdmUtY3JpY2tldC1zY29yZS1ndC12LWNzay1tYXRjaC0yOS1pcGwtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Live Cricket Score - GT v CSK Match 29 IPL 2022,"IPL 2022

Hello and welcome to the Live Blog for Match 29 of IPL 2022 - between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings at the MCA stadium in Pune. Hit refresh for latest updates.

Ecstasy for one team; agony for another

Ecstasy for one team and a shattering experience for Jordan and co. Bravo took the key wicket of Rashid Khan and then followed it up by removing Joseph. However Jordan once again couldn't nail the yorker and Miller ended up thwacking him for a six and a four to take the side to a famous win. He has certainly rolled back the years.

He was dismissed by Jordan via a full toss but it turned out to be above waist high resulting in a free-hit in the final over. A game full of twists and turns plots and sub-plots.

'Killer Miller' is back

David Miller is playing a blinder and Rashid Khan has gone on a hitting spree. GT are right back in it! Miller played a crackerjack lofted cover drive off Bravo. He seems to be turning back the years. And then crunched Theekshana for a six.

Rashid Khan then joined forces by thwacking three sixes and a four off Jordan. He used his strong wrists to put on a fine exhibition of power-hitting. GT suddenly need 23 off 12. What a turnaround!

Bravo's masterclass

David Miller gave GT hope by tonking Jadeja for two sixes and a boundary. D Bravo then gave nothing in Tewatia's zones for him to tonk - midwicket straighter boundaries and behind square on the on-side. Tewatia eventually spooned a catch to mid-off.

Near-perfect execution against Tewatia.

Another one bites the dust

Jadeja is also among the wickets now. Saha tried to press the accelerator pedal but he could only pull it to the fielder at deep square leg. 48 for 4 and with little hope of finding a way of out of what seems like a temporary tunnel of darkness for GT.

Theekshana's mystery

Now Manohar falls to Theekshana. The off-spinner floated it up and Abhinav Manohar could only chip it to Moeen at short cover. That little bit of mystery in Theekshana's bowling causing issues.

2 for 2!!

Not the best of starts for GT. Gill would feel disappointed as he cut a short and wide ball from Mukesh to point. Shankar also went for the cut against Theekshana's carrom ball but could only edge it to behind.

Jadeja cameo helps CSK to 169

Barring a four Joseph keeps it tight in the 18th over giving away only 10. Jadeja overturns a leg-before decision off Rashid in the 19th over but only six runs off the over. Dube is dropped by Abhinav in the final over and the ball travels for a four. Jadeja goes over midwicket for successive sixes off the fourth and the fifth deliveries. Dube is run out attempting a second runs off the final delivery. 18 off the over helps CSK finish with a competitive total.

Gaikwad falls after a fine knock of 73

Looking to target the shorter boundary Gaikwad ends up picking the fielder at depe backward square leg to give Dayal a wicket in the 17th over.

Dube survives

Dube is rapped on the pads by Shami and is given out leg-before. After a discussion with Gaikwad he decides to review it. And luckily for him replays reveal an inside edge and he survives. CSK are 129/3 after 16 overs.

Rayudu falls after a good stand

Coming down the track to Ferguson Rayudu ended up yorking himself and a chunk of the bottom of his bat flew off. Gaikwad ends the over with a six and a four - over deep midwicket and over extra cover respectively. Rayudu also puts away a half-tracker from Rashid over the deep midwicket fence for his second six. However he has to depart in the next over misting one to hand Vijay Shankar a catch at sweeper cover to give Joseph a wicket. End of a partnership worth 92 off 56 balls. CSK are 124/3 in the 15th over.

Gaikwad fifty powers CSK

Joseph's pace is to the liking of Gaikwad and Rayudu who score a six each in the 11th over. Gaikwad brings up a 37-ball fifty in the next over with a single. It is an expensive over from Dayal as Rayudu cracks a drive past extra cover for a four while Gaikwad capitalises on a free-hit striking the ball over the square leg fence for his fourth six. Rayudu guides one over short third man for a four and takes a single off the final delivery of the over as CSK reach 100 with 19 coming of the over.

CSK kept in check

Ferguson has been clocking good speed but he has also conceded a boundary apiece to Gaikwad and Rayudu in his first two overs. Meanwhile Rashid Khan has started economically giving away only five in his first over and although Rayudu scores a four off him in the second over the stand-in GT captain has given only seven. CSK are 66/2 after 10 overs.

Gaikwad gets going but Moeen falls

Gaikwad targets the inexperienced Dayal in the fourth over flicking one away for a six while he also gets a top edge over short fine leg for a four. The opener also flicks a full delivery from Shami in the fifth over for a four. However Joseph strikes in his first over as Moeen gets an inside edge onto the stumps while going for a drive. Gaikwad ends the powerplay with a six as CSK move to 39/2. This is also the first time in this IPL that Gaikwad has survived the powerplay.

Uthappa falls early

Shami strikes in the third over to dismiss Uthappa who tried to play across the line but was struck on the back leg. The onfield umpire ruled in favour of the batter but a successful review from GT ends Uthappa's stay for 3 off 10.

Quiet start for CSK

Mohammed Shami concedes only three in the opening over while Yash Dayal bowls a four-run over to keep the CSK openers in check.

Toss and teams:

GT have won the crucial toss and opted to bowl. Rashid Khan is going to lead the side today.

Chennai Super Kings (Playing XI): Robin Uthappa Ruturaj Gaikwad Moeen Ali Ambati Rayudu Shivam Dube Ravindra Jadeja(c) MS Dhoni(w) Dwayne Bravo Chris Jordan Maheesh Theekshana Mukesh Choudhary

Gujarat Titans (Playing XI): Wriddhiman Saha(w) Shubman Gill Vijay Shankar David Miller Abhinav Manohar Rahul Tewatia Rashid Khan(c) Alzarri Joseph Lockie Ferguson Yash Dayal Mohammed Shami

Jadeja: We would have bowled first as well. Now we will look to put a good score on the board and put pressure on them. After the last game we had a day off and back to basics with the training and stuff. Same team for us.

Rashid: We would like to bowl first. Bit of stiffness in the groin area for Hardik so as a team we didn't want to take a chance. He will rest and hopefully be back for the next game. Super excited it's kind of a dream. So I just want to learn as much as I can and give 100 percent. Matthew Wade is out and Saha is in. It's just to balance it out as Hardik is absent.

Prelude:

Gujarat Titans have won 4 out of 5 games while Chennai Super Kings have just one win in the bag. However CSK beat Royal Challengers Bangalore in their last match with Robin Uthappa and Dube smashing the opposition's attack to all corners of the ground. Ravindra Jadeja then ended up with a three-for and Theekshana took four.

On the other hand Hardik Pandya has been leading from the front inspiring his team to one victory one after another. Even in their last match it was Hardik who came to GT's rescue with a brilliant 52-ball 87. The bowling line-up looks quite formidable too. If there is a weak-link it could be the form of Shankar and Wade.

So who will come out on top today? Can CSK build on their only win of the season so far?

Eric Holcomb has locked in its two candidates according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

Sen. Mike Braun who chose not to run for reelection to the Senate and instead opted to run for governor is projected by the NBC News Decision Desk to beat a crowded field of Republican contenders including Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch.

Braun’s focus during the campaign was on improving economic opportunity within the state citing his experience as a small business owner. He also campaigned on protecting the rights of parents in making decisions related to education and on making healthcare more affordable through increased transparency according to his campaign website.

Democratic candidate Dr. Jennifer McCormick the state’s former superintendent of public instruction ran uncontested in the primary and was projected as the winner shortly after polls closed in northwest Indiana according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

McCormick received her doctorate in education from Indiana State University. She is running on a platform that includes increased investment in public education protection of reproductive rights and finding unique solutions to eliminate wasteful spending while not eliminating key programs according to her campaign website.

McCormick was endorsed prior to the election by the American Federation for Teachers’ Indiana chapter the Indiana State Teachers Association and several other groups.

Braun and McCormick will face off in the general election this fall. Holcomb was unable to seek reelection due to term limits imposed in the state but won his 2020 reelection campaign decisively.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

SHEFFIELD VILLAGE Ohio — *EDITOR'S NOTE: The above video is from a previous story.

Police have arrested the man they say shot and killed a woman more than three months ago outside a Lorain County McDonald's.

The U.S. Marshals Service tells 3News 34-year-old James Kimbrough was captured at an unspecified location. He is currently being held without bail at the Lorain County Jail on a charge of aggravated murder.

Authorities claim Kimbrough shot the 24-year-old victim to death back on Jan. 6 as she sat in her car in the parking lot of the McDonald's on Detroit Road. Her name has not yet been released but owner John House confirmed she was an employee at the restaurant.

""We are devastated by the tragic loss of our team member and friend. Our hearts are with our employee's family and loved ones"" House said at the time. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our people and customers and we're working closely with law enforcement in their investigation.""

Court records show Kimbrough had been facing charges of aggravated burglary and domestic violence in a separate case but had been out on bond at the time of the murder. Following the killing Marshals offered a $5000 reward for information leading to his arrest.

If convicted Kimbrough could potentially face the death penalty should prosecutors choose to pursue it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21jZG9uYWxkcy1nb2VzLWdyZWVuLW1jcGxhbnQtc2hhbXJvY2stc2hha2UtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1ldtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Goes Green (It's Not McPlant or Shamrock Shake),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/mcdonalds-goes-green-mcplant-shamrock-shake-electric-vehicle-ev on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21jZG9uYWxkcy1nb2VzLWdyZWVuLW1jcGxhbnQtc2hhbXJvY2stc2hha2UtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1ldtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy1vcGVuLWVhc3Rlci1zdW5kYXktMjAyMi1tY2RvbmFsZHMtd2VuZHlzLTE2OTQwMznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Restaurants Are Open Easter Sunday 2022?

Every once in a while photos of these glasses will pop up on social media with people wondering why they you don't see them anymore -- is it because today's children are too sensitive to handle such awesomeness? Are Garfield's thought balloons too edgy for those little Gen Z snowflakes? Nah it's because these things had shocking levels of cadmium and lead paint.

Seriously these glasses were all over the place for decades. From the Shrek ones in the 2000s ...

To the Disney ones that blew this child away in the '90s ...

To the Garfield ones that still populate the cupboards of millions of mothers and grandmothers across the world ...

So it's too bad that in 2010 what was destined to be the last batch of Shrek glasses was found to contain dangerous levels of cadmium which can damage the liver kidneys lungs bones nervous system and permanently lower your IQ (perhaps enough that you'll think Shrek 3 and 4 are better than the first one). The discovery was made by Jennifer Taggart of the Smart Mama Blog who along with another anonymous tipster supplied her findings to the Consumer Products Safety Commission. McDonald's insisted that the glasses were safe and that they only recalled 12 million of them ""out of an abundance of caution"" but an investigation by the feds found that just touching the glasses eight times a day could be ""hazardous"" for a 6-year-old. It didn't help that the mugs had Shrek's irresistible mug painted on them so the kids were probably kissing them all day long.

After the recall a follow-up investigation into painted character glasses new and old found that they had ""up to 1000 times the federal limit for lead in children's products."" These included ones with Disney characters DC Comics superheroes Coca-Cola logos and more. According to an investigation by consumer goods safety advocate Tamara Rubin of the Lead Safe Mama blog (whose work is responsible for the recent flurry of interest in this subject and thus this article) the old Garfield mugs in particular contain more than 1000 times the currently legal amount of lead in America and about 150 times the amount of cadmium allowed in the state of Washington (there's no federal law about this yet). That peculiar aftertaste is not lasagna; it's cancer-causing chemicals. Rubin has made even more concerning findings in harmless-looking mugs adorned with the likes of Snoopy the Smurfs the Carebears Popeye and more -- basically pretty much every mug an '80s kid was likely to beg their parents for.

And it's not like the toxic crap stays in the glass -- an UK study found that the metals can leach out and be swallowed. The dumbest part here is that even before Taggart and Rubin's recent findings some had been warning about this for over 30 years. In 1977 the Environmental Protection Agency warned that McDonald's painted glasses contained levels of lead well past the legal limit for that era and McDonald's' response was basically ""no they don't."" The Garfield mugs were just too important for the company's financial survival apparently. (The following tweet is screenshotted from Rubin's blog.)

The good news is that there are independent stores out there that sell non-toxic mug replacements for the Garfield glasses at cost just for the love of Jim Davis like this one. We recommend hurrying up and stealthily replacing the ones your mom refuses to throw out before Mr. Davis sues all those stores into oblivion.

Little has been written about their fascinating history but a more complete story of “The Mothers” and their work is coming forward through community members who want to reflect upon and share their experiences from that time. Some knew The Mothers as their own parents. All knew them as role models guides and mentors.

The Mothers were Mrs. Willette Chambers (1931-2007) Mrs. Ruth Forney (1926-94) Mrs. Annie J. Hicks (1923-79) Mrs. Rosalie Johnson (1929-2002) Mrs. Mildred Largent (1930-97) Mrs. Lucille Rutherford (1930-2017) and Mrs. Laura Thomas (1929-2018). A March 6 2005 News Herald article indicated that several of them lived in Morganton’s historic Jonesboro district near West Concord Street giving them the name “West Concord Mothers.”

I learned about The Mothers in 2015 during a Black History Month presentation at New Day Christian Church. The program was spearheaded by Morganton native Gary Harbison who was inspired by his memories of the Civil Rights era as a youth. Harbison wanted to recognize The Mothers for the strategic role they played in advancing the rights of Morganton’s Black citizens.

Mostly domestic workers The Mothers led the local school desegregation effort believing that if men led the work they would be more subject to threats and job loss. According to Artie McKesson Logan a student who was mentored by The Mothers the men worked invisibly to guarantee the physical safety of the youngsters.

The Mothers’ goal was to provide an equal education for their children. In 1964 having grown frustrated with the local board of education’s lack of progress toward desegregation they started meeting secretly at the home of local educator and pastor of Green Street Presbyterian Church the Rev. W.F. McIntosh.

Andrea Chambers Lytle daughter of Mother Willette Chambers remembers that the group met after dark to minimize the risk of being observed by people who opposed their work.

The children in question attended two of the county’s Black schools Mountain View Elementary and Olive Hill High School. The textbooks band uniforms and other supplies they used were handed down from white schools and certain courses they wanted to take at the high school level were not offered at Olive Hill. McIntosh advised The Mothers coached them on process and approach and helped them strategize.

Another key advisor was NAACP president and pastor of Slade’s Chapel AME Church the Rev. J. L. Hunt. Some of The Mothers were members of his congregation and the NAACP and he availed the church to them for meetings.

A Feb. 5 2012 News Herald article indicated that The Mothers approached the board of education in 1964 with an attorney-drafted petition asking to transfer their children to white schools nearer their homes. Their request was granted.

The Mothers walked their children to Forest Hill and Central schools daily as the men surveilled from nearby but out of sight. After being harassed and unhappy at their new schools the students returned to Mountain View before the academic year ended. Lytle spoke of particularly traumatic racial experiences while attending Central.

Media coverage was sparse. In his bachelors’ thesis titled “A Powder Keg That Could Easily Explode: Race Paternalism and Protest in Morganton North Carolina” Michael Ervin partly attributed this seeming silence to municipal and media leaders’ efforts to maintain a moderate-to-progressive community image by minimizing reports of racial tensions.

Ervin believes however that leaders’ desire to keep local conflict out of the news gave activists like The Mothers leverage to press for their goals. The Mothers also knew that publicizing their work would jeopardize their livelihood and personal safety so media silence was advantageous.

Logan said The Mothers prepared students for a new and potentially hostile environment by training them in non-violent approaches. They instructed boys to wear a tie to school every day told all students to keep their grades up to always be on their guard and also on their best behavior and taught them how to respond to heckling and threats.

Lytle experienced the tensions between the unflinching expectation of exemplary behavior in the face of racism and the fact that she was the daughter of one of The Mothers. She had frequent fights with white classmates because she was bullied and felt unprotected by faculty and staff.

The Mothers had previously coached youth to peacefully protest their exclusion from the Collett Street Recreation Center in 1963. Over a period of several weeks facility administrators repeatedly denied Black children access to the gym saying that the dirt on their shoes would damage the new floors while allowing white children in the gym in their street shoes.

Advised by The Mothers Logan said “[Students] purchased brand new tennis shoes” bringing them to the gym tied across their shoulders “so that they wouldn’t say that we were bringing dirt and sand and things in there.” Collett Street Rec opened the gym to Black children in 1964.

The Mothers’ work impacted desegregation through the 1970s when Mother Lucille Rutherford said they helped Black adults get factory jobs previously reserved for whites. Decades later she attended the recognition ceremony at New Day Christian Church where she was presented with a plaque recognizing The Mothers.

The plaque was placed on display at the History Museum of Burke County where it is part of the permanent oral history exhibit called “Children of the Struggle – the Desegregation of Burke County NC Public Schools.”

The young people who pioneered desegregation under the tutelage of The West Concord Mothers have varied and complex stories to tell. Some speak of easier transitions into integration while others tell of the trauma they still carry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXByLzE3L29waW9pZC1zZXR0bGVtZW50LXNlZW4tYXMtYXZlbnVlLWZvci1zZWJhc3RpYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opioid settlement seen as avenue for Sebastian County sobering center funds | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"FORT SMITH -- The millions Arkansas received as part of a settlement with opioid manufacturers and distributors could be key to establishing a place in Sebastian County to divert intoxicated people from the county jail.

Rusti Holwick chief executive officer for the Fort Smith-based Guidance Center updated the Sebastian County Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee on efforts to secure money for a sobering center Tuesday.

Holwick said the committee wrote a letter to Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and Gov. Asa Hutchinson late last year requesting an opportunity to apply for money to establish a sobering center and cover associated operating costs. This included both federal funds and money from the state's $216 million settlement with opioid manufacturers and distributors.

The latter was announced in July and was part of a multistate $26 billion settlement with Cardinal McKesson AmerisourceBergen and Johnson & Johnson.

Holwick said she followed up with an attorney with the Association of Arkansas Counties about the possibility of applying for a portion of that settlement money for a sobering center.

""He had reported that there's still really a timeline we're still pretty far out from being able to apply for any of the opioid settlement funds"" Holwick said. ""But at least we're on the front end of it so there's still some potential for that whatever level that may be.""

Holwick noted the attorney was concerned about the possible need for specific language in the state legislation for sobering centers Arkansas Act 587 of 2021 concerning other substances such as opioids in order to tap into the settlement funds for such a center. However Holwick said Kathryn Griffin justice reinvestment coordinator for Hutchinson didn't believe this would be necessary.

Act 587 which allows a law enforcement officer to take someone intoxicated to a sobering center rather than a jail at their discretion defines a sobering center as ""a facility or setting for providing recovery detoxification and recuperation from the effects of alcohol the focus of which is treating alcoholics and persons who are intoxicated.""

How it might help

Police Chief Danny Baker said he believed his department would be the most helpful in trying to connect this proposed sobering center to the opioid settlement money. He said while the number of public intoxication and driving while intoxicated arrests is a starting point in discussing the potential helpfulness of a sobering center it doesn't reflect the issue of the overdoses stemming from fentanyl a synthetic opioid to which the department responds on ""almost a daily basis.""

""If it were not for the presence of Narcan with our officers and our EMTs and firefighters the death toll would be ... we wouldn't even want to talk about that"" Baker said. ""And so to be able to connect the need for that to the opioid crisis is going to be very simple. There's going to be enough data to support that.""

Narcan is the name brand of the drug naloxone and reverses the effects of an opioid overdose.

Baker said a sobering center would help to not only reduce the number of people held at the Sebastian County jail but also improve the community. While the Police Department needs to address the fentanyl issue from all angles a facility of this nature would help connect people who have overdosed on fentanyl to the services they need to escape the cycle of addiction. However it would require a long-term investment.

Cheri Taylor a police officer in the department's Crisis Intervention Unit said drug overdoses in the community have increased exponentially in the past few months.

""This fentanyl is a scourge like we've never seen"" Circuit Judge Stephen Tabor said. ""I've been here practicing criminal law in this jurisdiction for over 40 years. There's nothing like it.""

Plans and other funding sources

The Quorum Court established the Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee in August 2017 to find ways to reduce the jail population and improve the justice system.

Possible solutions include drug veterans and mental health courts; a crisis stabilization unit; alternative sentencing and diversion programs; special accelerated court dockets; electronic monitoring and signature bonds for nonviolent felonies; and a text message notification system for defendants in criminal court cases.

The Guidance Center a nonprofit behavioral health care provider has been the site of the Sebastian County Five West Crisis Stabilization Unit since 2018. This is used to divert those with mental illnesses from jail to treatment in Sebastian Crawford Franklin Logan Scott and Polk counties.

Holwick told the committee Oct. 7 the center had space for a potential sobering center. It anticipated a sobering center would be a ""very sparse space"" with 10 mats for intoxicated people. Most of the cost would come from staffing it around the clock. The cost was determined to be about $521000 annually or about $43000 monthly.

Holwick said Tuesday while the Guidance Center has a space in one of the day treatment programs on its campus that could be easily renovated and used for a sobering center doing so would take away space from its program which generates revenue. She said it would be ideal if money was available to add a room to the center.

The Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee's subcommittee for the sobering center is looking into other federal money sources for the facility as is County Judge David Hudson according to Holwick.

Hudson said he believed the opioid settlement money would be shared evenly between the state city and county governments in accordance with the Arkansas Opioids Memorandum of Understanding that Hutchinson Rutledge Chris Villines of the Association of Arkansas Counties and Mark Hayes of the Arkansas Municipal League signed last year. This money would be released over an 18-year period.

A portion of the county's American Rescue Plan money could be used to implement the sobering center as well according to Hudson. The county has been allocated $24.8 million in covid-19 relief money which must be spent by Dec. 31 2026.

Intoxicated arrests

The Sebastian County jail recorded 2023 bookings for public intoxication and first-offense driving while intoxicated offenses from Jan. 1 2018 through March 31 2022. This includes an average recidivism rate of about 60% between the individual years meaning someone who was arrested and booked for either of the two offenses had the same happen again. This figure doesn’t include bookings with additional offenses.

Fort Smith’s Police Department also began diverting public intoxication and first-offense driving while intoxicated arrests to the Crawford County jail in Van Buren in April 2020. It diverted 551 such arrests from that point through February 2022.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzE2L3doeS1pdHMtdGltZS10by1idXktdGhlLWRpcC1tZXRhLXBsYXRmb3Jtcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Charts That Show Why It's Time to Buy the Dip in Meta Platforms' Stock,"Trading at merely 16 times free cash flow this tech giant is a bargain buy.

Meta Platforms (META 0.55%) formerly known as Facebook has been treated harshly by the stock market lately. Three negative narratives drive this sentiment: Heavy investment in the metaverse reduced ad spending and tough competition from TikTok. Because of this Meta Platforms stock is trading at an all-time low when valued from a price-to-free cash flow standpoint.

While these concerns are real a ratio of 16 times free cash flow is far too low for a high-quality business like this. Investors must understand Meta Platforms' risks and know how these will affect the financials.

It's getting harder to grow revenue

CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the metaverse won't be cheap. However he is committed to bringing about this change through the company's Reality Labs division which provides ""augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware software and content."" Meta broke out this division for the first time in the fourth quarter and the results weren't pretty. In 2021 the division lost $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion. It's also not slowing down on expenses. In 2021 Meta spent $71 billion on operating expenses but management is guiding for $90 billion to $95 billion in 2022.

Revenue is expected to be negatively affected by recent iOS privacy changes from Apple. This has caused Meta customers to see a lower return on investment (ROI) for their ad campaigns. Meta claimed in the Q4 conference call that the changes disproportionately affect smaller businesses. With less successful advertisements companies reduce their budgets and focus on other areas.

Meta is also worried about ByteDance's TikTok social media app. While Facebook announced Reels to offer a similar product and effectively compete TikTok is still capturing a large chunk of the social media market share. For the first time ever as a public company Facebook's daily active users fell from the previous quarter.

With rising costs revenue growth pressures and a strong competitor the future looks grim for Meta Platforms.

Valuations suggest this stock is a bargain

Are these concerns truly valid? After all Meta Platforms is still the most dominant social media company and is highly profitable. Management also expects revenue growth of 3% to 11% for Q1 and investors will find out on April 27 if Meta hit that guidance.

If Meta can reach the top end of the revenue guidance and continue with 30% expense growth the company will still be cheaply valued. In 2021 Meta Platforms produced $38.4 billion in free cash flow (FCF) on revenue of $118 billion an impressive 33% margin. If sales grow 10% for the year and its FCF margin is affected by the $21.5 billion in increased operating costs the company could generate $35.2 billion in free cash flow.

With no stock price appreciation this would value the stock at 17.2 times 2022 free cash flow. This valuation is still lower than it's been at any time Meta's been a public company and is cheap compared to other companies in the market.

To add another factor to Meta's value proposition it has been aggressively repurchasing shares. Doing this it is making each share more valuable by retiring old shares. This catalyst will further decrease its valuation by reducing the number of shares outstanding. With Meta repurchasing more than $44 billion in stock last year the company could repeat that program in 2022 and lower shares outstanding by about 7%.

When is the best time to buy?

Meta Platforms may be facing some headwinds but the company is one of the most financially powerful in the world with solid cash flow generation and more than $44 billion in cash with no debt on the balance sheet. The market doesn't leave bargains around like this very often and investors should act accordingly. Alternatively you could also wait until Q1 earnings are reported on April 27 but any positive news will likely send this stock soaring as it has only experienced negative headlines recently.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzbW9ybmluZ29uY2hhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25mdC9pZi15b3UtdGhvdWdodC1hcHBsZXMtYXBwLXN0b3JlLWZlZXMtd2VyZS1oaWdoLW1ldGFzLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS13aWxsLW1ha2UteW91LWJsdXNoL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzbW9ybmluZ29uY2hhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25mdC9pZi15b3UtdGhvdWdodC1hcHBsZXMtYXBwLXN0b3JlLWZlZXMtd2VyZS1oaWdoLW1ldGFzLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS13aWxsLW1ha2UteW91LWJsdXNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta's fees for Metaverse sales blow away Apple's app store,"Platform fees have been a hot topic in the tech world over the past year primarily because of Epic Games’ lawsuit against Apple. Apple’s app store charges a 30% fee to sellers which many thought was exorbitantly high – including Mark Zuckerberg. In November 2021 post Zuck said:

As we build for the metaverse we're focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work. The 30% fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that so we're updating our Subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.

It turns out Zuck decided that fee was just right because 30% is exactly how much the platform fee is for sales on Meta Quest the VR system previously called the Oculus Quest. On top of the platform fee Meta charges an additional 25% sales fee (on the remaining 70%) for every sale made in the virtual world Horizon Worlds which Meta operates. That means for each sale made on a Meta Quest machine running in Horizon Worlds the creator will be paying Meta 47.5% of the sale price.

Meta is quick to point out that they expect others to integrate their own VR machines with Horizon Worlds in which case the platform fee would not be charged by Meta. Any platform fee would be determined by the other party making the VR headset.

The State of Meta’s VR

Meta has bet the company on the metaverse (see: name). The metaverse as Meta imagines it is “the next evolution of social connection.” A 3D virtual reality (VR) space that “will let you socialize learn collaborate and play in ways that go beyond what we can imagine.”

The company spent $10.3B on the metaverse in 2021 and Zuck has said this investment is not slowing down in 2022. The $10B expense slashed Meta’s quarterly profits by 8% and resulted in the stock dropping some 26%. The investment hasn’t all gone to waste though; Meta has the most successful VR headset in the Meta Quest. Its virtual reality division Reality Labs brought in $2.2B in 2021 roughly doubling revenue from each of the previous two years.

Meta recently released a video of a virtual reality panel between Zuck and some of the creators on the Horizon Worlds platform. They highlighted playing games having round table meetings attending guided meditation classes and (confusingly) going to a Wendy’s. Their choice to highlight eating one of the few things that cannot translate to the Metaverse is anyone’s guess.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2JkYWEwYTM3LTlmNGYtNGJjYy04ZjNhLWNhOTI2MTE4NmU4Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk fails to convince the doubters that he will 'save' Twitter,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

No matter the generation they continue to win the love of players and casual followers. In that sense anyone can enjoy the filter available on Meta platforms that turns pets into a pokemon.

Nowadays short videos are very successful so there are continually new filters with users can use to explore their creativity. On Instagram and Facebook a Pokémon filter that simulates the capture of a creature with a pokéball is succeeding.

This allows you to place a dog cat hamster and even a person in the center. However the most popular videos have been those of people “trapping” their pet inside a pokéball. After the simulation where the puppy or kitten is captured the filter creates a Pokémon card that shows a description of the “creature” including the type its strength and other data.

The conjunction between the Japanese franchise and mascots has been widely used for reels and stories of Meta's platforms. To use it is only necessary to search for the filter in the social network.

You must first access the option to create a reel then in the section of selecting filters search for “Catch them Now! (Pokémon)” there will be the option which has a very similar style to the Augmented Reality (AR) video game Pokémon Go in which you can catch creatures on the street or inside buildings.

After selecting the filter you must point the camera at the pet which will immediately be in the center of the screen. Later the filter will do the animation work where the pokéball will simulate catching the furry and show the description letter.

It should be remembered that reels can be recorded in a series of clips (one at a time) all together or with videos from the gallery. The capture button must be held down to record the first clip. A progress indicator will be displayed at the top of the screen as it is recorded. You have to stop recording to finish each clip.

At the end of the AR filter animation all that remains is to save and publish the reel. Of course for it to be successful some hashtags must be added such as #Pokémon #AtrápalosYa #Mascotas among others.

If you have a public account you can share the reel in a special space in the “Explore” section to be discovered by the huge Instagram community. It can also be published to the feed to share it with followers. When sharing reels that include certain songs hashtags or effects the reel can also appear on specific pages whenever someone clicks on that song hashtag or effect.

If you have a private account reels will respect the privacy settings on Instagram. If the reel is shared in the feed only followers will be able to see it. People will not be able to use the original audio from the reels (if added) nor will they be able to share your reels with others who don't follow you.

To see other reels you just have to go to the “Explore” section where you can see what is trending on Instagram.

He also spoke about the future of internet advertising in the metaverse and the company’s plans in the upcoming auction of broadcasting rights for the Indian Premier League. Edited excerpts:

Given that political ads comprise a small proportion of your revenue and the heat that they bring through allegations of the platform being biased how does the cost-benefit work out?

I don’t have a point of view on this really. This is globally one of the calls that we took a while back. In the context of the role that we can play — just as businesses connect to consumers we have discovered that our platforms are used to drive causes. We saw that one of the roles we played in the pandemic was to bring attention to the public health agenda. The code of the platform is that you can build communities and get a message across and therefore I can imagine the utility from a campaign point of view as well. When you look at political ads as a percentage of total (revenues) both in India and globally it becomes pretty apparent that the driver for us is not revenue.

Companies across the world have stepped up their investments in metaverse. How does the future of advertising on internet change on Web 3.0 and the metaverse?

In a very short period of time from when we articulated the idea of metaverse and the change of identity to Meta there has been massive excitement from across industry and business leaders across the spectrum and I’ve seen this excitement in India as well. Leaders instinctively get the power of a more immersive internet and what it means to move from 2D to 3D (two-dimension to three dimension) not just from a consumer point of view — with use cases such fitness and gaming — but also from enterprise perspective if they can engage with these users in a more immersive manner. We have been pretty open in saying that we do not know all the answers at the moment. Going back to the acquisition of Oculus in 2014 the company has been making hefty investments in AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) for a while now. We have no illusion that we are building the metaverse. We know that we are going to contribute to what will become metaverse and that different companies will create different spaces. It should be interoperable a lot more than what mobile internet was. At the same time we do not have any illusion that we have cracked all of it either in terms of technology or how interoperability will work or even what the different revenue streams will be. What we do know is that there is going to be a lot of work on access side on devices that enable more immersive version of the internet.

Governments and regulators across the world are debating on formulating policies for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens and the metaverse? How important is it for these policies to be laid down as early as possible?

On the last version of the internet a lot of these laws and policies had to be developed post-facto. We saw this explosive growth and innovation which had a huge impact on global economy as well as the impact on the ability of people to connect in a seamless manner. But we also discovered that there were a lot of bad actors who could do great harm. Even in some of our own works — we have had a lot of fundamental product work and policy changes over the last few years on the back of recognising that. We have the opportunity to learn from that as we think about how to design the different building blocks that will form the metaverse over the next 5-10 years. For example we have been baking in privacy as a core design principle in to every product feature and it will translate quite well. We have to proactively work with stakeholders including regulators around the world to make sure that we build these frameworks in a way that allows innovation but absorbs the learnings of the last 20 years.

Is Facebook involved in those conversations as far as the policy making in India on these aspects in concerned?

Given the nature of the company we are. When you look into how much we are leaning into build Web 3.0 and metaverse a technology which is fundamentally different we obviously engage with anyone who wants to hear our point of view. We have found stakeholders including governments being open to discussions in private where they are open to objective discussion on different point of view. That will continue to be the case in Web 3.0 as well.

As a big media company so to say would Meta be interested in buying rights to broadcast IPL?

One I don’t think we’re a media company. I think we partner with other media company and hopefully they’ve seen value in leveraging our platforms. We ourselves don’t see us as a media company. I don’t think we will build particular use cases. We are thinking more along the lines that we can build frameworks and help with foundational tools on both the software and hardware side that will enable other developers to build compelling use cases for the metaverse. The role that Meta has is fundamentally around the building the toolkits enabling other partners and developers and therefore in this context we don’t have the intention to bid for IPL rights that are opening up in the next few weeks. It is the context of the role we see ourselves in of building the metaverse and not because we think IPL is not a fantastic property. I have seen the power of IPL in building Hotstar.

In terms of the Apple privacy changes globally there’s a $10 billion impact that Meta has said it will see as a result of the new policy. For India could you provide any qualitative or quantitative insights into what impact is being witnessed by Meta?

There are no numbers to share. What we’ve publicly announced over the last few weeks and what’s to come we’ve clearly worked to make sure that some of the underreporting on web conversions that have come on the back of the Apple changes are addressed. That will continue. The only other thing to call out is that Apple or iOS is a very small share of the total devices in India.

As far as the Metaverse is concerned are there products that you see changing the shape of Web 3.0? Have you invested in any of these?

It really is an open canvas. I believe that the timing of this is quite important. When the last version of the internet came up we were at a very different stage as a country. Not many people had come online and the developer ecosystem was very early. This confidence that has now come in on the back of the massive entrepreneurial energy that has been unleashed in the last few years aided by international capital.

As a country we now have the opportunity to shape the global metaverse. I do not think it is now about picking only a couple of categories. As a country the opportunity is so big we could not be in a better position to create a value for ourselves and the world.

Some of the companies have started building use cases. Are they pioneers in this unknown field of metaverse or are they leaping before looking?

I do not have a view on a particular company or a particular use case. We are trying to articulate our vision of what we are trying to build the enabling agenda on the hardware or the software side and pointing to the opportunity to build it in a patient intentional manner over the long term."

Ras Al Khaimah one of the smaller and lesser-known of the seven emirates said earlier this year that it planned to make laws about gaming in some resorts. On the same day Las Vegas casino giant Wynn Resorts said it would build a resort approved for gaming or gambling on a man-made island.

The announcements could mark an important moment for the Gulf a part of the Middle East that has traditionally had stricter Islamic rules. Gambling has long been off-limits.

Currently those seeking to gamble go to the likes of Lebanon's Casino du Liban or some Egyptian hotels.

Yet times may be changing.

Two people with knowledge of the issue told Reuters that gambling in some form would be permitted in the UAE. But they added it would be up to each emirate to decide whether and how to make rules about it - similar to how Sharjah does not permit alcohol sales unlike other emirates. They also said the policy change would happen soon without providing an exact date.

Casino and hotel companies that have moved into the UAE could benefit should Ras Al Khaimah make the way for other emirates to follow.

Caesars Palace which opened in Dubai in 2018 and is the only one of American giant Caesars Entertainment resorts without a casino told Reuters that it would examine any possibility of offering gambling in Dubai.

About 10 km along Dubai's coast from the Caesars resort digging has begun on another area to support a new resort by Las Vegas gambling company MGM Resorts International.

When asked whether it would consider introducing gaming at the resort MGM said ""gaming has not been part of the planning and there are no updates to our plans.""

The UAE government media office as well as the media offices of the emirates of Dubai Abu Dhabi and Sharjah did not answer requests for comment on Ras Al Khaimah’s plan to permit gambling and whether they planned to make similar changes.

Competition

The possibility of gambling plays out against a situation of strong competition in the Gulf with the UAE competing with Saudi Arabia to become a popular destination in a part of the world moving away from oil.

The UAE where foreigners make up 90 percent of the population has already moved in other areas to keep first mover advantage over Saudi Arabia.

The Emirates changed to a Saturday-Sunday weekend this year to move closer to international markets. A Friday-Saturday weekend is common in many Muslim nations.

In the past 18 months the UAE has made legal changes including decriminalizing alcohol use and situations in which unmarried people live together.

The country has also found ways to offer some games of chance.

In 2020 it started a national ""Loto."" Players bought a ""collectable"" picture of a UAE scene such as the Burj al Arab hotel for $9.50. The buyers were entered into a draw. Now players seeking to enter the draw buy a bottle of water to be given to a charity to win a top prize of 10 million dirhams.

The game is considered acceptable under Islamic law because there was an ""exchange of value"" in the purchase of the collectable or bottle.

Unclear path

Ras Al Khaimah stressed that its laws being developed by the recently created Department of Entertainment and Gaming Regulation would push for responsible gaming.

The Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority did not answer Reuters questions about how its plans would work alongside the federal laws against gambling.

Vitaly Umansky a gambling industry expert at the Sanford C Bernstein investment company in Hong Kong suggested that gaming in Ras Al Khaimah would likely be limited to foreigners.

What can you tell us about that place?

A:

Thomas Hull from southern California owned a chain of El Rancho motor inns. On a visit to Las Vegas in 1940 Hull met with a number of civic leaders who convinced him to open a franchise. There's some discrepancy over how much Hull paid for the 57 acres he purchased; we've seen $5700 and $57000. Considering that 5000 acres to the south and west of the El Rancho Vegas site sold a year later for $1 per acre it seems more likely that Hull paid $100 per and not $1000.

The grand opening of the El Rancho Vegas took place on April 3 1941. The 65-room bungalow-style motor inn on the southwest corner of Highway 91 (now the Strip) and San Francisco Avenue (now Sahara) came complete with a casino steakhouse showroom barbershop health club western clothing store palm tress lawns and a large swimming pool right next to the highway to entice road-weary families. It was also air-conditioned. And Hull gave the local radio-station operator free rent in exchange for moving his studio and tower to the resort plus promos every half-hour: “Broadcasting from the grounds of the fabulous El Rancho Vegas.”

Just beyond the city line the El Rancho Vegas attracted the traffic coming in from southern California as well as locals escaping the claustrophobia of Fremont Street. Business boomed from the beginning and Hull quickly doubled the number of rooms.

In one bold move Hull actually revolutionized Las Vegas development. By building in an unincorporated area of Clark County he avoided the higher city taxes on property and gambling revenues as well as the control of the powerful downtown casino operators (all of whom according to contemporary accounts believed that it wouldn't last a year). Less stringent building codes reduced the cost of construction and the wide-open desert permitted ease of accessibility and plentiful parking for motorists unavailable in the congested city core.

In fact this ""motor-hotel"" triggered the transition from a town organized around and dependent on the railroad to one better served by cars and trucks. It also coincided with an overall suburbanization of America in the 1940s specifically Los Angeles's spreading low-rise sprawl. When the El Rancho Vegas opened in 1941 thanks to Highway 91 Las Vegas was a mere seven hours by car from L.A.

Management difficulties prompted the joint to be sold several times. It burned to the ground in a spectacular fire in 1960 that consumed nearly the entire casino and adjoining buildings within the first 20 minutes with flames shooting 100 feet in the air. The cause of the fire was never determined though plenty of rumors circulated at the time and since.

Those included widely held suspicions that the arsonist was Marshall Caifano the Chicago Outfit's Las Vegas enforcer in those days. Apparently just a day earlier Caifano was in the casino trying to strong-arm the bosses for a large dinner comp and a room he could use when he bullied a showgirl or two into a one-night stand. For the first time the casino manager told Caifano to take his business elsewhere. Caifano was decidedly vocal about his displeasure threatening everyone and everything in sight.

All that said fire department officials claimed that they didn't find any accelerants in the ashes even though the casino went up so quickly. Even so Caifano was placed in the brand new Black Book the first name to earn the dubious distinction. With Caifano now a persona non grata in the casinos Chicago installed their new enforcer Tony ""the Ant"" Spilotro.

The El Rancho site across the Strip from the Sahara has still yet to be developed more than 60 years later. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds now occupies 26 acres on that corner; it's owned by Phil Ruffin who picked up the property from MGM Resorts when he bought Circus Circus in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9hdGxhbnRpYy1jaXR5LW5qLWNhc2lub3MtdXNpbmctbmV3LXRhY3RpY3MtaW5jcmVhc2luZy1wYXktdG8taGlyZS13b3JrZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlantic City NJ casinos using new tactics to hire workers,"ATLANTIC CITY — As a casino dealer Shamikah Townsend knows when the odds are in her favor.

“She said ‘I’ll pay you to move to Florida in two weeks'"" Townsend said. “I didn't know craps so I had to be honest and tell her but I went out and I learned it.”

On Monday Townsend made her move getting hired on the spot at a job fair held by the Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City.

Townsend is part of a great hiring wave taking place at casinos across the nation as the gambling halls compete to add staff while recovering from the coronavirus pandemic that drove customers away and led to staff reductions.

But casinos are just one of many industries struggling to add new workers and they find themselves competing with each other not only for casino workers but for people with experience in the hotel restaurant and tourism industries to name just a few.

“Gaming is facing the same labor issues that we see across the broader economy” said Casey Clark senior vice president of the American Gaming Association the casino industry's national trade group. ""In our recent CEO survey the labor shortage is a top concern across the country.

“Competition for talent is a huge impediment for growth and we're also experiencing an expansion of gaming with customer demand increasing” he said. “Those things are problematic when they happen together.”

That has led to some innovative tactics including the use of virtual reality goggles at some MGM Resorts International job fairs to let applicants experience what the job will be like before signing on the dotted line.

Atlantic City's casinos are also talking with state government agencies about funding new transit options to get people to jobs at casinos from farther-out places. One possibility: something like the contract the Borgata had with a state transit agency in 2008 for a daily shuttle bus between its Atlantic City casino and Camden — an hour-long trip reaching clear across the state.

In Clark County Nevada home to Las Vegas an economic development official said last month more than 40000 jobs have gone unfilled since the state’s casinos reopened after a temporary closure in 2020. During one job fair in February Caesars Entertainment was looking to hire 500 people.

On Friday in Las Vegas about 6000 people are expected to attend a jobs fair in which 105 casino and other employers will offer 13000 jobs.

“Work is available whether you are a first-time job seeker changing fields newly relocated to the area or retired and wish to return to work"" said Wanda Gispert a vice president with MGM Resorts.

Nationwide there were about 1.65 million workers employed in the gambling amusement and recreation sectors of the U.S. economy in March representing about 91% of the pre-pandemic workforce Clark said. The AGA said it does not have a figure for casino employment alone.

Joe Lupo president of Atlantic City's Hard Rock casino is also president of the Casino Association of New Jersey. He estimates there are 2000 full and part-time casino jobs open in Atlantic City right now where the overall workforce of 22000 is down from 49000 in 2003.

“Coming out of COVID especially last year after the restrictions were lifted the workforce supply just has not been available” he said. “It's been difficult for all of us to find enough people. I certainly know after meeting with everyone last week that every property is hiring.”

That has very practical effects in casino resorts which might not be able to open all their hotel rooms or open all the craps or roulette tables they have. Restaurants that used to serve 700 tables a night may only be able to do 300 executives said.

As they are in other industries workers are reaping the benefits of switching jobs or taking a new one after being unemployed for a time. Casinos are increasing wages and benefits and are offering to train workers without the type of experience that was once required just to get a foot in the door for an interview.

“Everybody's looking to hire the same person” said Bill Callahan general manager of the Ocean casino in Atlantic City. “We always need people.”

In some departments “people that made $14 an hour a year ago might now be making $16 or $17” Callahan said.

Ocean is starting an in-house training program to teach people how to become dealers something most applicants had to learn on their own before Callahan added.

The Morongo casino in Cabazon California has been regularly holding job fairs since December and has at least four more scheduled for this month.

In North Carolina the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians said last month it needed nearly 900 additional workers for its two casinos in the state. Tribal leaders are considering recruiting workers from other countries and housing them in dormitories.

And in West Virginia racetrack casinos told state regulators last month that a shortage of workers is preventing them from operating at full strength for a third year in a row.

Townsend the newly hired dealer in Atlantic City says circumstances are coming together nicely for her.

“I wanted to move up and improve my situation"" she said. ""These places have to compete with everybody else for workers now and there's money to be had.”

These are the best hiking spots in New Jersey A trip to New Jersey doesn't have to be all about the beach. Our state has some incredible trails waterfalls and lakes to enjoy.

From the Pine Barrens to the Appalachian Trail to the hidden gems of New Jersey you have plenty of options for a great hike. Hiking is such a great way to spend time outdoors and enjoy nature plus it's a great workout.

Before you go out on the trails and explore some of our listeners' suggestions I have some tips on hiking etiquette from the American Hiking Society.

If you are going downhill and run into an uphill hiker step to the side and give the uphill hiker space. A hiker going uphill has the right of way unless they stop to catch their breath.

Always stay on the trail you may see side paths unless they are marked as an official trail steer clear of them. By going off-trail you may cause damage to the ecosystems around the trail the plants and wildlife that live there.

You also do not want to disturb the wildlife you encounter just keep your distance from the wildlife and continue hiking.

Bicyclists should yield to hikers and horses. Hikers should also yield to horses but I’m not sure how many horses you will encounter on the trails in New Jersey. If you are thinking of bringing your dog on your hike they should be leashed and make sure to clean up all pet waste.

Lastly be mindful of the weather if the trail is too muddy it's probably best to save your hike for another day.

I asked our listeners for their suggestions of the best hiking spots in New Jersey check out their suggestions:

Although it may sound like an idea straight out of a Black Mirror episode a company has now developed a microchip that you can choose to implant in your hand to well make payment truly wirelessly. Let’s take a look at the details below.

Skin-Implantable Chip for Wireless Payments? Yes Please!

The idea of a skin-implantable computer chip is not a new idea per se. Last year we saw a Swedish company develop a similar microchip that can store and show a user’s COVID-19 vaccination certificate. Now a British-Polish digital payments company named Walletmor is selling a unique skin-implantable microchip that can enable users to make NFC-based wireless payments.

“The implant can be used to pay for a drink on the beach in Rio a coffee in New York a haircut in Paris – or at your local grocery store” the founder and the CEO of Walletmor Wojtek Paprota said in a statement. “It can be used wherever contactless payments are accepted” he further added.

The skin-implantable payment chip from Walletmor consists of a tiny microchip and an antenna packed inside a biopolymer which is a naturally-sourced substitute of plastic. The chip leverages near-field communication (NFC) technology used in smartphones for wireless payments. Hence users can wirelessly pay at any store or retail shop that accepts NFC-based wireless payment.

Furthermore Paprota notes that the payment chip is completely safe and has been approved by regulatory authorities. It does not require any battery to operate weighs less than a gram and is slightly bigger than a single grain of rice.

Walletmor says that after becoming the first company to offer a skin-implantable payment chip commercially last year it has sold over 500 of them over time. One customer named Patrick Paumen who got an implant in his hand says he is able to wireless pay at stores with his hand without needing a smartphone or a payment card.

“The reactions I get from cashiers are priceless!” said Paumen “The procedure hurts as much as when someone pinches your skin” he further added.

Now coming to the price of the implant you can get a Walletmor microchip for yourself for €199 (~Rs 16400). However it is worth mentioning that the chip will work in selected regions around the world – only where you can open an iCard account. You can go to Walletmor’s official website to know more about its microchip offering.

MU,Micron Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9kaXNsb2NhdGlvbi1hdmFsYW5jaGVzLXNtYWxsZXN0LWVhcnRocXVha2VzLWV2ZXItZGV0ZWN0ZWQtaW4tbWljcm9uLXNjYWxlLW1ldGFscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dislocation Avalanches: Smallest Earthquakes Ever Detected in Micron-Scale Metals,"On the micrometer scale deformation properties of metals change profoundly: the smooth and continuous behavior of bulk materials often becomes jerky due to random strain bursts of various sizes. The reason for this phenomenon is the complex intermittent redistribution of lattice dislocations (which are line-like crystal defects responsible for the irreversible deformation of crystalline materials) due to external loading which is also the cause of the formation of the uneven step-like surface upon deformation.

To study this phenomenon in more detail research groups of the Eötvös Loránd University of Budapest Charles University of Prague and École des Mines de Saint-Étienne have developed a highly sensitive micromechanical platform where weak elastic waves emitted by the specimen can be detected during the deformation of micron-scale pillars. Compression experiments performed on such zinc single crystalline micropillars in a scanning electron microscope confirmed that these so-called acoustic signals indeed occur during strain bursts so this experiment allowed us for the first time to practically hear the “sound of dislocations.”

The acoustic signals are sampled with a rate of 2.5 MHz therefore they provide extremely detailed information on the dynamics of dislocations. The in-depth statistical analyses performed by the researchers revealed that strain bursts exhibit a two-level structure: what has so far been seen as a single plastic slip is in fact a result of several correlated events on a μs-ms timescale.

The most surprising outcome of the experiments is that this process despite the fundamental differences between deformation mechanisms of metals and that of tectonic plates was found to be completely analogous to earthquakes. Acoustic signals emitted from the testpieces followed fundamental empirical laws established for main shocks and aftershocks in seismology such as the Gutenberg-Richter and Omori laws.



Compression of a zinc micropillar. The otherwise ultrasonic acoustic signals were transformed into the audible domain to better illustrate the correlation between acoustic events and strain bursts.

“These results are expected to bear high technological impact since for the first time we were able to observe direct connection between acoustic signals and the plastic events that emitted them” said Péter Dusán Ispánovity assistant professor at Eövös Loránt University and head of the Micromechanics and Multiscale Modelling Research Group. “Since the measurement of acoustic emission is a frequent method for monitoring and locating material failure in technological applications by providing fundamentally new information about the underlying physics our results are expected to contribute to the further development of this technique.”

Dávid Ugi PhD student in the group of Ispánovity and corresponding author of the publication added: “These experiments are rather complex since one has to couple the nanometer precision manipulation tool with the extremely sensitive acoustic sensor all in the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Such measurements to our knowledge at the moment can only be performed at our laboratory” added the young researcher.

The methodology can also be used to investigate other types of deformation mechanisms such as twinning or fracture so the results which were published in Nature Communications are expected to open up new vistas in the research of micromechanical properties of materials.

""After five years of Mainstream Support and five years of Extended Support Office 2013 will reach the End of Extended Support on April 11 2023. Per the Fixed Lifecycle Policy after this date security updates for Office 2013 will no longer be available"" Microsoft told customers.

""After Office 2013 reaches the end of support Microsoft won't provide any new security updates and the continued use of Office 2013 after April 2023 may increase your organization's exposure to security risks or impact your ability to meet compliance obligations.""

Once the end of support is reached Microsoft will stop providing several services to Office 2013 license owners including technical support bug fixes and security patches for new issues.

Also connecting Office 2013 clients to Microsoft 365 might lead to performance or reliability issues because Office 2013 is no longer a supported client since October 2020.

Upgrade options for Office 2013 users

Available upgrade options for Office 2013 are Microsoft 365 Apps the subscription version of Office that comes with many Microsoft 365 and Office LTSC 2021.

Microsoft 365 Apps comes with many Microsoft 365 and Office 365 enterprise and business plans and it allows endpoint users to install full versions of Office apps on multiple devices.

Office LTSC 2021 is sold as a one-time purchase via a volume license agreement and can only be installed on one computer per license.

The main difference between these two Office versions is that Microsoft 365 Apps is updated regularly with new features while Office LTSC 2021 has the same features it came with on its launch date in September 2021.

""Please start upgrading to Microsoft 365 Apps which is designed to receive regular updates and will help you stay current by getting security updates and our latest features"" Microsoft said.

""Alternatively if your organization requires a static unchanging product consider moving to Office LTSC 2021.""

Office 2013 upgrade plan

After exploring your options and deciding to switch to a newer version on compatible devices (system requirements for 365 Apps and LTSC 2021) you should prepare an upgrade plan (you can find more info on moving to Microsoft 365 here).

""Because Microsoft 365 Apps comes with many enterprise Microsoft 365 (and Office 365) plans you should review the capabilities of your current plan as part of planning an upgrade to Microsoft 365 Apps"" the company explains

""Prior to deploying Microsoft 365 Apps for example you should ensure that all your users have accounts and licenses.""

Sources familiar with the situation told Insider that the ads wouldn’t disrupt gameplay and may appear on a billboard in a racing game for example.

It’s not immediately clear how else Microsoft plans on implementing ads such as having them show up as avatar skins or as videos inside game lobbies. But as Insider notes Microsoft is reportedly concerned that the ads could “irritate” players and is planning on building a “private marketplace” to let only select brands into the program.

Microsoft reportedly doesn’t intend to take a cut of the ad revenue

Sources also told Insider that Microsoft doesn’t intend to take a cut of ad revenue and will instead allow the game developer and advertising company to share the funds. It’s possible that Microsoft may just want to use this as a way to attract more developers of free-to-play games to the platform as this would open up another stream of revenue outside of microtransactions.

According to Insider Microsoft won’t use the data it collects from Bing and other services for targeted ads on Xbox. The outlet also doesn’t know whether Microsoft has floated the idea to advertisers yet but its sources claim ads will start appearing on Xbox as soon as the third quarter of this year.

“We are always looking for ways to improve the experience for players and developers but we don’t have anything further to share” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to Insider. The Verge reached out to Microsoft with a request for comment but the company said it didn’t have any additional information to share beyond its statement to Insider.

In-game advertisements on console games aren’t a new concept; game companies experimented with them in paid games quite a bit in the mid-to-late 2000s. Around this time EA Games partnered with the (now-defunct) Microsoft-owned advertising company Massive letting companies place ads in Madden NFL Skate NHL and NASCAR franchises as well as in Burnout Paradise. If you played any of these games at the time you might remember seeing digital Obama ads plastered in digital sporting arenas or on billboards. Saints Row 2 even had real-life ads on billboards like this one for Netflix.

In-game ads for real-life products might have been a novelty back in the day but with some next-gen games costing close to $70 players expect an ad-free experience. This is likely the reason why Microsoft is reportedly rolling out the initiative for free-to-play games only. More recently EA attempted to slip an unskippable full-screen commercial into UFC 4 in 2020. Fans who paid for the $60 game obviously weren’t happy resulting in EA pulling the ad.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXRlbnRseWFwcGxlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0L2EtbWljcm9zb2Z0LXZyLWdsb3ZlLXBhdGVudC1wdWJsaXNoZWQtaW4tZXVyb3BlLWRlc2NyaWJlcy10aGVpci1hY2Nlc3NvcnktYXBwbHlpbmctZXF1YWxseS10by1mdXR1cmUteGJveC1nYW1lcy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Microsoft VR Glove patent published in Europe describes their accessory applying equally to future Xbox games ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.patentlyapple.com/2022/04/a-microsoft-vr-glove-patent-published-in-europe-describes-their-accessory-applying-equally-to-future-xbox-games-commercial.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXRlbnRseWFwcGxlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0L2EtbWljcm9zb2Z0LXZyLWdsb3ZlLXBhdGVudC1wdWJsaXNoZWQtaW4tZXVyb3BlLWRlc2NyaWJlcy10aGVpci1hY2Nlc3NvcnktYXBwbHlpbmctZXF1YWxseS10by1mdXR1cmUteGJveC1nYW1lcy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL21pY3Jvc29mdC14Ym94LWFtaWliby1za3lsYW5kZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Has The Perfect Opportunity To Rival Amiibo With Skylanders,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL21pY3Jvc29mdC14Ym94LWFtaWliby1za3lsYW5kZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjc0NDE4LzIwMjIwNDE3L21pY3Jvc29mdC1vZmZpY2UtMjAxMy1zdXBwb3J0LW1pY3Jvc29mdC1vZmZpY2UtMjAxMy1zdXBwb3J0LWVuZGluZy0yMDIzLmh0bdIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNzQ0MTgvMjAyMjA0MTcvbWljcm9zb2Z0LW9mZmljZS0yMDEzLXN1cHBvcnQtbWljcm9zb2Z0LW9mZmljZS0yMDEzLXN1cHBvcnQtZW5kaW5nLTIwMjMuaHRt?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Office 2013 Support is Ending in 2023 | What Happens After?,"Microsoft Office 2013 support is already ending in 2023 or 12 months from now.

As such it won't be long until Microsoft Office 2013 users will need to switch to a higher and more recent version of the productivity software.

Microsoft Office 2013 Support

It is worth noting that by the end of its support in 2023 a decade had already passed since the debut of Office 2013 in the first month of January of the said year.

Not to mention that Office 2013 has long been succeeded by Office 2016 which launched in 2015.

Despite that Microsoft still supports Office 2013 providing its users with continued security updates. It comes as it still has yet to complete its five years of Extended Support which ends in April 2023 as per a news story by Bleeping Computer.

On the other hand the Mainstream Support of the Office 2013 which also lasted for half a decade had concluded a few years back already.

Office 2013 Support End: What's Next

The Redmond- based tech firm told Office 2013 users that it ""will reach the End of Extended Support on April 11 2023.""

In turn the software maker warned Office 2013 users that once the support comes to its final curtain call ""security updates for Office 2013 will no longer be available.""

Thus Microsoft would no longer provide any security updates for Office 2013. That said the tech giant warned its users that continued use of its after the support end is a risky move.

Microsoft warned that ""continued use of Office 2013 after April 2023 may increase your organization's exposure to security risks or impact your ability to meet compliance obligations.

Apart from the lack of security updates in general Microsoft would specifically cease providing its users any bug fixes as well as technical support.

Considering the risks of using Office 2013 after April 2023 Microsoft asks its customers to upgrade to Microsoft 365 Apps which still receive constant security updates.

In fact according to a recent report by How to Geek Office 365 is created to be updated to its latest version like how most apps work these days.

On the other hand older versions of the productivity app of Microsoft are not meant to last perpetually thus its support is ending sometime soon.

For instance Office 2016 and Office 2019 for Windows support cease receiving updates on Oct. 14 2025 whereas Office 2019 for Mac ends on Oct. 10 2023.

Mondelez International which owns the chocolate giants said it would investigate the incident.

Sara Handley from Newport told Isle of Wight Radio the egg was bought by a family member from Waitrose East Cowes on March 28.

It was given as a gift to Sara’s son who has special needs.

As he went to crack it open Sara says he discovered what appeared to be a dead slug.

Pictures taken by Sara seem to show slime and a slug partially melted into the chocolate.

Sara said she has contacted Cadbury only to be told to “call back on Tuesday”. She said she posted the images on Facebook to make people aware.

The egg which is a Dairy Milk Buttons egg has a best before date of July 31 2022.





A Mondelez spokesperson said:

…Encourages Youth to breathe deeply and keep going no matter the challenge

Tom Tom the leading candy brand from Cadbury Nigeria Plc (a part of Mondelēz International) officially kicked off the “Breathe For It” Summit on Thursday 24th March 2022 in a virtual gathering as part of its efforts to champion and encourage youth creativity and drive.

Delivered as a panel session moderated by Motolani Alake Editor Strategic Partnerships and Lead Pulse Podcast Network at Pulse Nigeria key industry players shared insights for success within the entertainment sector at the event. The panellists included famous Songwriter and Rapper Reminisce Alaga Director Integrated Marketing Communications TeamApt; Osagie Alonge Entertainment Lawyer; Foza Fawehinmi A&R Consultant; Excel Joab; as well as Focus Ramon a Music Producer and Sound Engineer. The event was aired for music and entertainment lovers and stakeholders to watch from the comfort of their homes.

Cadbury’s Category Lead (Gum and Candy) in West Africa Morolake Emokpaire gave more insight into the Company’s decision to champion this engagement. She said “The reception we got from the audience on the summit further emphasizes the reason we launched the “Breathe for it” campaign which is to inspire focus and build clarity in the pursuit of what Nigerian youth love. Our panelists were spot on in their delivery. You will agree with me that conversations about the music industry have to be made because it has become one of our largest exports as Nigerians and Africans.

“As we aim to engage more Nigerian youth to breathe deeply no matter the challenges they face we have lined up activities like MTV Base Cypher that is ongoing “Breathe for it” Verses Challenge 2.0 which is about to start and so much more for them to show their talents in what interests them the most.”

During the summit the panellists urged Nigerians to always remember the history of Afrobeat as it evolves into a global sensation. According to Osagie Alonge the evolution of Afrobeat is a combination of the creatives creative managers brands and technology. He said “It’s a combination of a few things. However we also have to look at the people who have driven the culture and not just the music like the managers brands and others in the creative space that have collaborated with these artists.”

Excel Joab further explained the role of technology in the Nigerian music industry and its evolution in the last seven years noting that people have started to see the value of music which is why they subscribe to streaming platforms. While Reminisce Alaga viewed artists and producers as the drivers of the industry Focus Ramon encouraged the wider Nigerian community to stop devaluing the hard work producers and sound engineers put into creating songs. Foza Fawehinmi highlighted the need for players in the industry to be intentional and hardworking to attract more investors who can contribute to building an efficient structure that enhances the efforts of current active stakeholders.

The event which saw Reminisce perform his trending song “Hustle” also ushered in a new era for Mani Lapussh as the summit marked the premiere for his and Rema’s new song collaboration. This is one of the many benefits of his signing a contract as Tom Tom Boy.

Members of the audience who tuned in to the event were treated to an exclusive listening session ahead of the proposed official release of the song across all music streaming platforms.

The “Breathe for It” campaign was introduced in 2021 to help the younger generation build capacity in a key passion area – music. The campaign through which Cadbury has signed two artistes – Rema and Mani Lapussh – as Brand Ambassador and Tom Tom Boy respectively promises to deliver more exciting activities for Nigeria’s youth.

Cadbury’s powerhouse of candies comprises the nation’s beloved No.1 candy brand Tom Tom its sub variant Tom Tom Freshlime and the fun-filled and exciting Buttermint as well as Cadbury coffee and caramel-flavored candies two recently launched variants of candy which were introduced after listening to the yearnings of its consumers. Since its introduction in 1970 Cadbury’s Tom Tom has remained the leading candy brand in Nigeria. The brand which is beloved by millions of loyal consumers in Nigeria and beyond has grown to become the biggest and strongest candy brand in the Nigeria market.",,,,,,

As the pandemic subsides the office market is bouncing back.

A new Q1 2022 Tampa Office Insight Report from JLL reveals that people are quickly inking leases for St. Pete’s existing offices and new Class A offices in Tampa.

In the first quarter St. Petersburg had an office vacancy rate of 3.5% – a historic low rate for the city. Meanwhile Tampa had a 14.6% vacancy rate. Combined the two rates in the metros average 11.7%.

“Employers are trying to coax their employees back into the office even if not five days a week and part of the hook is highly amenitized [sic] modern spaces in thriving downtowns” said Mack Feldman Vice President with Feldman Equities a commercial real estate development firm with office properties in Tampa and downtown St. Pete including the First Central Tower the Castille at Carillon and the Morgan Stanley Tower.

“While St. Pete’s CBD (Central Business District) vacancy is significantly lower than Tampa’s a lot of Tampa’s vacancy is in newly-built buildings that are quickly filling. Those new buildings are achieving rents in the $50s per square foot range which is a high watermark that’s helping to push average rents up on the Tampa side across all types of office buildings” Feldman said. “By contrast we’ve had very limited new office development in downtown St. Pete. Still the fact tenants are choosing downtown St. Pete over downtown Tampa tells you a lot about how employers perceive the downtown and its ability to help them attract and retain highly paid employees.”

Another commercial real estate expert who asked not to be named also said the downtown St. Pete market is very strong as rates have increased in Class A products by $3 to $5 per square foot in the last year.

Today the average direct asking price per square foot in St. Pete is $31.78 while Tampa’s is $38.07. The study points out that Class A buildings specifically in Westshore have increased asking rates to $45 per square foot.

Although the office inventory in St. Pete is limited several new projects are underway that will bring more office space into the mix including Orange Station at the Edge which is under construction at the old St. Petersburg Police HQ. The project entails constructing residential units including workforce housing units commercial space and 50000 square feet of office space. There is also an adjacent pad of land to the site that could be developed into an office building. Another project is Red Apple’s 46-story tower that’s taking shape at 400 Central Ave. The tower will primarily be used for condos; however it will include office space.

In Tampa new Class A office properties such as 1001 Water Street the SkyCenter One building at Tampa International Airport and Midtown totaled around 208000 square feet of absorption as a result of move-ins this quarter. Another 350000 square feet of space at new office projects will be occupied by the end of this year according to the report.

With the robust leasing activity on the remaining new construction space it’s projected that many buildings will be 90% leased by the end of the year.

However certain submarkets are continuing to suffer. The report indicates that in Tampa submarkets tenants are vacating space in Class B buildings and buildings in less desirable submarkets. The vacancy is expected to decline over the next three to nine months especially in new office buildings being delivered which house most of the vacant space.

The insight report shows the Gateway/Bayside and Interstate I-75/I-4 Corridor submarkets experienced significant tenant move-outs accounting for 90% of the market’s absorption. These submarkets have struggled over the past 24 months as tenants have more quality office space options to relocate to in the Westshore and Tampa.

“Going into Covid most owners expected the suburbs to do well and downtowns to suffer. We’ve seen the opposite” Feldman said. “Commodity product in the suburbs with no walkability or amenities is suffering. The suburbs will come back especially if we stay in a low supply situation but the short term may be a rough ride.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbi1uYXkuY29tL29iaXR1YXJ5L29saXZpYS1hdHdlbGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Olivia Juanita Longest Atwell of Hanover Indiana,"

The experience

The home for this five-night event will be the 26 Bridge Street event space in DUMBO which is a former metal factory steps from the East River and near Manhattan Bridge. According to this week's announcement the space will be altered to resemble noma's home location in Copenhagen including plenty of greenery and typically minimalist Scandinavian wooden tables and chairs in the dining room to create a sort of mod-hygge look.

It's a rare opportunity to experience a special menu from a restaurant that is a bucket list-type establishment for foodies and one that some gourmands plan their entire travel calendars around. The World's 50 Best Restaurants list for instance declared noma ""one of the most coveted restaurants on the planet"" as part of its most recent top ranking in 2021.

While $700 for the Brooklyn experience is not cheap neither is a regular dinner seating at the restaurant in Denmark. The current food menu is priced at approximately $421 per person with another $262 for wine pairings or $145 for juice pairings (and we're not talking Capri Sun pouches here but rather bold flavor combinations like quince-saffron or green gooseberry).

The Discovery of the Kodak Mosaic

Rochester New York’s local CITY News reports that the tech company Delta-X Global had been rehabilitating the old Kodak laboratory in Eastman Business Park (formerly known as Kodak Park) to create its new research and development hub.

In February in the midst of demolition work and knocking down a wall in a conference room on the first floor the rehab team made an unexpected discovery: there was a beautiful and enigmatic mosaic hidden behind the drywall perfectly preserved out of view for decades.

“The drywall had been covering a gray cinderblock wall about 12 feet high and 18 feet long adorned by an elaborate mosaic composed of tens of thousands of hand-cut tiles most measuring about one square inch” David Andreatta of CITY News writes. “Others were as small as the pips on a pair of dice.

“Gradations of blue danced with specks of black and diminutively detailed dots of yellow and red against a backdrop of white. Together they formed… something. A submarine? A rocket? A fish? A submarine rocket fish?”

Rochester-based photographer James Montanus the son of the legendary Kodak photographer Neil Montanus was one of the first people to lay eyes on the rediscovered mosaic before word of the find got out.

“I have a friend who works in that building” Montanus tells PetaPixel. “It’s a former Kodak research building that housed Kodak’s research scientists. He is one of only two former Kodak employees who are still employed there.

“Because the building was just sold to a high tech firm in Toronto Canada they were helping to take down some walls in advance of a $25 million major renovation.”

Montanus was one of the people Delta-X Global CEO Derek Dlugosh-Ostap reached out to after the discovery and the photographer was able to visit the site and shoot some photos of the art.

Uncovering the Meaning of the Mural

Montanus then took to his Twitter account to see if anyone could decipher the meaning of the mosaic.

“[…] no one knows what it means or why it’s there” Montanus wrote. “Ancient aliens perhaps? Portal to another dimension? My friend has worked there for 44 years and no one has a clue. Do you?”

People soon pointed out that the mosaic seems to show scientific principles that allow for camera film and analog photography. The symbols for silver (Ag) nitrogen (N) carbon (C) and oxygen (O) are among the elements seen in the artwork and there appears to be abstract depictions of things like sunlight flash a film strip and an aperture.

“[I]t represents the science advances that make photography possible” Tweets Maine-based writer Carla Jean. “Bottom right is optics (lenses redirecting light) the top right letters are the elements used to make film (e.g. silver halide coatings) and more chemistry stuff.”

“The mosaic shows the areas of science chemistry electricity physics and optics” Dlugosh-Ostap tells CITY. “All of those elements combined together were meant to express the work that was being done in this building in the ’60s when it first opened.”

A software engineer and Rochester Institute of Technology alumnus named Mike found confirmation of this explanation in a Physics Today article from 1961 the same year the laboratory was opened.

“One wall of the building’s lobby contains a ceramic tile mural depicting fundamental aspects of physics” the article reads.

Mike also found the mural in an article about the lab’s opening published in the Democrat and Chronicle that year.

“Depicted in the mural are the symbols of sound mechanics atomic structure optics electronics electrical energy and photography” the article says. “They comprise subjects which will be intensively studied in some 200 ‘labs’ in the building […]”

The Artwork Will Be Preserved

The good news is that Delta-X Global plans to keep the mosaic and feature it prominently in its new research hub.

“We are proud to be the new owners of the mural” Dlugosh-Ostap writes in a Tweet. “We are definitely keeping it and will be incorporating it into our new lobby design!”

While CF states that it “understands that it is one of only 30 companies to face these restrictions” the rail line’s public notice was more ambiguous “We have already identified and notified those customers who can help us manage the current congestion by reducing their rail car inventories.”

“If we do not see reductions to the operating inventory through their voluntary efforts then we will begin metering traffic after April 18th” Union Pacific added.

The story has received little media attention largely limited to a 270-word Associated Press rewrite of CF’s press release.

Industry publication Freight Waves also stated that the disruption wasn’t limited to one railway company. It reported that BNSF Railway Company informed regulatory body Surface Transportation Board (STB) in a March 30 reply to an inquiry by the agency that it had slashed service levels by 2 percent.

The STB’s inquiry was spurned by a March 24 call for help to the federal agency from the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) after farmers became unable to either purchase or supply grain because rail shipping was simply unavailable specifically affecting the ability of the livestock industry to keep animals fed and alive.

“One NGFA member has spent an additional $3 million on secondary freight in the last month to try and keep animals fed” the NGFA stated. “This is additional freight they should not have to purchase and this reduces available freight to others and makes the secondary freight market even more expensive.”

The Association added “Another example is an NGFA member that had to stop selling feed while it waited on a train that sat loaded at origin for 7 days due to a lack of available rail crews.”

The STB has summoned rail executives for an April 26 and 27 hearing to address the issues.

And it’s not just grain and fertilizer being affected. A trade association of ethanol producers recently complained that manifest and unit transportation delays of between 2 and 12 days have been suffered while West Virginia coal producers have complained there aren’t enough rail cars to ship thermal or metallurgical coal at all.

Union wars

BNSF like Union Pacific emphasized a major attributing cause to its service disruptions as being staffing shortages.

The firm’s reply to the STB stated that at the beginning of 2021 BNSF had almost 3000 train yard and engine staff on furlough but has since reduced that number to 450.

November of 2021 reporting by Freight Waves revealed that both BNSF and Union Pacific were in a fight with major labor unions over the implementation of a September Joe Biden Executive Order mandating COVID-19 vaccination for all employees.

By December both companies had suspended the edicts after the Biden administration ran into resistance at the federal court level.

The Federal Railroad Administration lists Union Pacific and BNSF as two of the top seven Class 1 freight railroads in the nation.

However the greater cause elucidated by the vaccine mandate wars may simply be ongoing and overarching disputes between the unions and their employers.

In January a District Court judge prevented Union Pacific employees from striking picketing or conducting a “sickout” over complaints arising from the company’s COVID measures.

In late March BNSF’s unions sought to pursue arbitration after opposing a recently implemented “Hi Viz” (high visibility) attendance policy that deploys a progressive discipline schema in response to various tiers of absences such as weekends holidays or missed calls.

The massive California maritime supply chain crisis in 2021 was likewise attributable to a dispute between the Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshoreman and Warehouse Union coiled around a contract negotiation set to come to a head in mid-2022.

In Canada a March freight disruption that hit Canadian Pacific Railway was also rooted in a dispute with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference whose members walked off the job amid an impasse over contract negotiations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9jb21wYW5pZXMtbmV3cy9kb2hhLWZlc3RpdmFsLWNpdHktY29uY2x1ZGVzLWZpZnRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWNlbGVicmF0aW9ucy13aXRoLWdyYW5kLW1vc2FpYy13YWxsLXVudmVpbC1jaGY3cGNpcNIBngFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9jb21wYW5pZXMtbmV3cy9kb2hhLWZlc3RpdmFsLWNpdHktY29uY2x1ZGVzLWZpZnRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWNlbGVicmF0aW9ucy13aXRoLWdyYW5kLW1vc2FpYy13YWxsLXVudmVpbC1jaGY3cGNpcD9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doha Festival City concludes fifth anniversary celebrations with grand mosaic wall unveil,"Doha Qatar: Doha Festival City Qatar's one and only choice for shopping dining and entertainment concluded its 5th anniversary festivities in a big reveal showcasing its commemorative digital mosaic a one-of-a-kind colourful celebration with visitors and community.

While families around the world celebrate Easter Ramadan and Passover for many Palestinians there will be empty seats at the dinner table. For Um Nasser Abu Hmeid from Amari Camp in Ramallah four of her sons are missing as they languish in Israeli jails.

This Palestinian Prisoner’s Day the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC) the largest coalition in Palestinian society proudly reaffirms our unwavering solidarity with all Palestinian political prisoners in apartheid Israel’s prisons and detention centers.

We call on our supporters to take meaningful action today by escalating all BDS campaigns to isolate apartheid Israel’s regime of oppression and to pressure corporations that are deeply involved in Israel’s violations of prisoners’ human rights.

We especially call for escalating the #BoycottHP and #StopG4S campaigns. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) continues to provide services to Israeli prisons despite full knowledge of Israel’s grave human rights abuses. G4S owned by Allied Universal continues to be complicit in violations of international law through its 25 percent stake in Policity Corporation Israel’s national police training centre which trains officers in violent militarized tactics aimed at repressing Palestinians including tactics that lead to abuse and torture.

We also call for an end to the Deadly Exchange programmes between Israeli and US law enforcement entities in which “worst practices” are shared to promote and extend violent discriminatory and repressive policing in both countries. These include racial profiling massive spying and surveillance deportation and detention and attacks on human rights defenders.

Palestinian political prisoners in numbers:

According to the latest figures from Addameer the Palestinian Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association there are currently 4450 Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli prisons and detention centers.

This number includes approximately 530 “administrative detainees” denied due process and arrested on “secret evidence” that neither they nor their lawyers are permitted to see or refute in court. We salute the boycott of Israeli military courts by Palestinian administrative detainees.

Also held in Israeli dungeons are 160 Palestinian child prisoners from the ages of 12 - 17 and 32 Palestinian female prisoners - many of whom are mothers.

Mass arrests:

Since the beginning of the year apartheid Israel’s occupation forces have inflicted a campaign of collective punishment via violent mass arrest on the city of Jenin in the north of the illegally occupied West Bank. More than 200 of the city's residents have been arrested with 100 arrests taking place in March alone. According to the Palestinian Prisoners Club there are approximately 500 Palestinian political prisoners from Jenin in Israeli jails including three women and around 10 children.

Mass arrest of Palestinians is nothing new. According to a 2017 report by Addameer over the past 50 years more than 800000 Palestinians have been imprisoned or detained by Israel this figure is now believed to be closer to 1 million. This means that about 40% of Palestinian men and boys living under military occupation have been deprived of their freedom. Almost every Palestinian family has suffered the imprisonment of a loved one.

Take action:

Against this backdrop we have hope! With your help BDS campaigns are thwarting Israel’s brutal objectives and contributing to the creation of a more beautiful and just world.

To show meaningful solidarity with Palestinian Prisoners take the following 5 actions:

Lobby your government or parliament to impose a security and #MilitaryEmbargo on Israel. This includes cutting military funding in the case of the US and a ban on arms and spyware technology from Israeli companies such as NSO Group. Take the first steps towards declaring your community trade union association church workplace student government/union city council business or other organization an Apartheid Free Zone (AFZ) by excluding companies that are complicit in apartheid. These include companies listed in the UN database for involvement in illegal settlements and others like HP Caterpillar IBM AXA Hyundai Heavy Industries and G4S/Allied Universal. Boycott Israeli and international brands complicit in Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity. This includes all Israeli banks (Leumi Hapoalim etc.) and major multinationals such as: Elbit Systems HP G4S/Allied Universal AXA CAF PUMA Caterpillar General Mills/Pillsbury Hyundai Heavy Industries JCB Volvo Barclays Bank Alstom Motorola Solutions IBM and CEMEX. Boycott all academic cultural sports and tourism engagements in apartheid Israel or supported/sponsored by Israel (or its lobby groups and complicit institutions). Join a BDS campaign or a strategic Palestine solidarity group near you to act collectively and effectively.

Channel your anger strategically and mobilize to #DismantleApartheid and all forms of racism and oppression.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The world of finance is facing a reckoning over what defines sustainable investing.

Investors around the world are ploughing tens of billions of dollars a year into companies and funds that tout superior environmental social and governance (ESG) attributes. Many assume they’re doing good for the environment or gender equality as they save for retirement.

But there’s growing concern – even among those who make their living in sustainable finance – that ESG’s emergence as an asset class alongside traditional stocks and bonds risks shifting the focus away from the non-financial values it’s meant to promote.

At the heart of the confusion is the broad scope of what constitutes ESG investing. The concept loosely covers everything from climate-related business risk to boardroom diversity to workplace safety – three disparate concepts that Tariq Fancy former chief investment officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock Inc. the world’s largest asset manager says have been lumped together almost arbitrarily.

Mr. Fancy has made waves in the finance industry by arguing ESG investing is “a giant societal placebo” geared more to helping professional investors improve risk-adjusted returns than to promoting the global action required to solve complex long-term threats such as climate change and inequality.

There’s a massive amount of money at play. At the end of 2021 assets in ESG-themed mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rang in at US$2.74-trillion globally up 34 per cent from the year before according to Morningstar. In Canada assets in such funds doubled through 2021 to $34.5-billion. Many of these investors believe their money is going toward improving environmental and social conditions. In reality however they’re more likely acquiring a slate of traditional companies that have merely met or exceeded a certain ESG threshold as measured by a third-party ratings agency.

Ratings from organizations such as Sustainalytics MSCI and S&P are used by investment pros to gauge whether a stock is a suitable addition to an ESG fund or ETF. But a Globe and Mail investigation shows the methods these ratings providers use vary to the point where the same company can be judged as both an ESG leader and a laggard depending on who’s doing the measuring. It’s sowing skepticism not just among investors but among some of the companies being scored too.

The repercussions can be far-reaching. Investors in passive funds might believe they’re buying into a group of companies with rock-solid ESG performance across the board when not all of them are universally graded as such. Meanwhile outfits that receive the ESG stamp of approval might avoid making improvements in an area prioritized by one ratings agency but not the others. And that can lead to significant business risk – say if a company’s assets need to be slashed in value over the long term for failing to deal with a growing environmental risk that might not have been highlighted in its score.

As far as Mr. Fancy is concerned regulation of the ESG space is key. “We all want to believe that good companies do better. Unfortunately that doesn’t happen unless you have regulation. And I’d say on the values piece okay fine that’s what it means for investing but what does it mean for the world?” Mr. Fancy said in an interview from his home in Toronto. “I saw next to no impact. Even where you could find that ESG had greater value to investing it was marginal at best.”

The Globe reviewed the ranges of companies’ ratings and assigned them roughly into higher middle and lower tiers. It then identified companies that had divergent ratings across providers. The review showed wide variances in scores for some companies.

Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. for example received a high score for its ESG practices from MSCI but low ratings from ISS S&P and in Bloomberg’s ESG Disclosure system. Real estate company FirstService Corp. and heavy-equipment seller Toromont Industries Ltd. similarly received a high MSCI score but low scores from the other providers.

Energy company AltaGas Ltd. ALA-T received a high score from MSCI CDP (formerly known as the Climate Disclosure Project) and from Bloomberg’s climate disclosure metric but low scores from ISS and S&P. Telecom giant BCE Inc. meanwhile has middling scores from MSCI and S&P but higher scores from the other providers. And money manager IGM Financial Inc. has an average score from MSCI but high scores from Bloomberg S&P Sustainalytics and CDP. Its governance rating from ISS is low but ISS’s ESG rating for the company is above average.

New rules could push Canada to get tougher on corporate disclosure

What gets scored and how often accounts for the difference. It can be unclear in some instances whether ratings are meant to show a company is living up to its environmental and social claims or if investors are adequately protected from financial risk if it doesn’t. “In most cases it’s a check-the-box exercise. There’s no audit and certainly there’s no recourse” says Bonnie-Lyn de Bartok founder of the S Factor Co. a Toronto-based provider of social impact data. “A lot of these indexes are funded by the same folks who are listed within them. There’s a lot of conflict of interest.”

She adds that investors who aren’t experts in ESG can get overwhelmed by the disparities and controversies around the legitimacy of such ratings. In that case she says “they’re just going to do their own thing because they don’t believe or trust what’s out there.”

Regulators are starting to respond. Last year saw the formation of the International Sustainability Standards Board an offshoot of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation and it’s seen as a milestone in the move to standardize ESG reporting. The ISSB issued its first draft rules for sustainability and climate-related disclosure in late March.

Meanwhile the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has created a climate and ESG task force that will target “ESG-related misconduct.” The idea is to get tough by closing disclosure gaps and police the market to root out bad actors operating under the guise of ESG righteousness.

The umbrella group of Canada’s securities commissions also recently published guidance aimed at improving disclosure of ESG-themed funds. The new guidelines are meant to prevent greenwashing and the agency has said it would monitor such funds for disclosure so investors aren’t misled.

The ratings providers contend they’re not misleading anyone. Instead they say they play a valuable role for a range of different audiences – from financial institutions to retail investors – highlighting material non-financial measures that could affect a company’s long-term health as well as uncovering risks that could lead to legal and regulatory trouble. “The reality is there are different approaches to measuring ESG. There are different motivations” says Simon MacMahon global head of ESG research at Sustainalytics a unit of Morningstar that provides analysis of corporate risk for institutional investors. “In some cases there’s an investor education component here. It will take some time to get people to better understand what ESG is under different scenarios.”

Mr. MacMahon points out that his company’s clients tend to be large institutions such as pension and sovereign wealth funds which often have their own research capabilities and use ratings and the underlying data as part of a wider analysis of ESG.

Indeed investors need to investigate the methods used to to arrive at a particular rating and make decisions based on their own tolerance for risk says Simon Fischweicher CDP’s head of corporations and supply chains North America. “Looking at an ESG score without understanding how they’re factoring different risks into it just sort of taking it at face value doesn’t allow you to do that sort of assessment” Mr. Fischweicher says. “I think what’s really critical is for those ESG scores to be a tool but not the only tool by which environmental social and governance factors are integrated into investment decisions. Maybe the first step and then you dig deeper.”

Richard Manley head of sustainable investing at CPP Investments says if money managers understand the limitations of ESG scores and have their own expertise for spotting nuance contradictory ratings might not be a problem. Instead they become “breadcrumbs” that shape discussions with the company. When he sees a deficiency in reporting he says it prompts questions: “Why are you not reporting this data that is material or that your largest peers are reporting? Is it because there’s no internal capacity to do it? Because you’re performing badly and don’t want to tell the world about it? Because you haven’t prioritized it yet? There is a conversation to be had there about culture.”

Still the difference in methods along with the metrics tracked and the variable weight given to different factors have created uncertainty for individual investors. This contrasts with agencies that rate corporate credit; companies either risk defaulting on their debt or they don’t.

ESG risks can be large. If investors find out too late that corporate performance or strategies have been overstated with resulting environmental or physical damage it could lead to legal action and a loss in asset value. There are parallels to the financial crisis when credit rating agencies gave top grades to mortgage-backed securities despite complexities that hid their incredibly risky nature and eventually caused financial contagion.

The problem is being studied in depth by researchers at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who first published the Aggregate Confusion Project in 2019. Their data measure the divergence in ESG ratings among six providers examining 709 indicators in 64 categories. They concluded that the correlation among ratings for individual companies ranged from 38 per cent to 71 per cent for an average of 61 per cent compared with an average of 92 per cent among credit rating agencies.

The researchers blamed the divergence on a host of factors. Agencies rate aspects of ESG differently and not all look at every aspect. They also give different weightings to certain metrics in their final scores. As an example one rater could include a company’s government lobbying activities while another might not take that into account.

Greenwashing is real as companies and funds ride the ESG express. The goal is to make it rare

Sustainalytics for example rates companies based on unmanaged ESG risks to come up with a score. CDP rates companies’ performance based on climate forest and water metrics. (Companies that garner its top “A” score form the basis of the STOXX Global Climate Change Leaders Fund.) MSCI says its ratings are designed to help institutional investors integrate ESG into their mainstream portfolios by identifying issues that can cause risks or create opportunities. They are geared to the “specific purpose of enhancing long-term risk-adjusted returns” according to the company.

A common worry is that investors buy ESG funds thinking they’re acquiring companies focused on environmental or social solutions while earning returns when in fact many of the underlying investments are the largest companies on the broader stock indexes.

“The real problem at the moment is not necessarily ESG ratings. I think the much bigger problem is the promise that if you buy a fund based on ESG ratings you have an impact – you change the world” says Florian Berg one of the authors of the Aggregate Confusion Project. “There’s no proof.”

Take the BMO MSCI Canada ESG Leaders Index ETF. It’s billed as being “for investors looking to align socially responsible values with their investments using a best-in-class approach.” The ETF’s holdings replicate the MSCI Canada ESG Leaders Index but a scan of that grouping shows a close correlation with the broad S&P/TSX Composite Index. In fact its top five holdings – Enbridge Inc. Canadian National Railway Bank of Nova Scotia Brookfield Asset Management and Bank of Montreal – are among the top eight companies in the composite. Three of the companies The Globe found to have among the widest divergences in Canadian ESG ratings – Toromont Industries Ritchie Brothers and FirstService Corp. – are in the ESG Leaders ETF.

Similarly the top five holdings in the TD Morningstar ESG Canada Equity Index ETF are Royal Bank of Canada Enbridge Scotiabank BMO and CN – again all among the top eight in the composite. TD says the fund is designed to track an index of large and mid-size companies that have higher ESG ratings than their peers. BCE FirstService and IGM Financial – which The Globe found to have a wide variance in scores – are among the holdings.

This doesn’t mean fund managers are breaking rules but it puts the onus on investors to familiarize themselves with the criteria of the funds they buy and what the objectives are.

Besides there are other ways for investors to influence corporate behaviour says Mr. Berg – for instance through shareholder activism. An example is the push by the investment fund Engine No. 1 to replace three directors at Exxon last year in opposition to the company’s insufficient response to climate risk. The campaign was successful. “Overweighting ESG stocks doesn’t necessarily mean this has an impact on the real world” he says. “But it is marketed in a way that it has.”

The Sloan researchers wrote that the divergence in ratings has some important consequences apart from just making it difficult to analyze the ESG performance of companies funds and portfolios. It could produce disincentives for companies to make improvements in certain areas as different ratings prioritize different sustainability factors. It could also lead to markets mispricing assets based on their ESG risks or benefits and make it difficult to link CEO pay to ESG performance – an increasingly common practice.

None of this is to say companies shouldn’t be getting serious about ESG-related obligations and strategies. There’s more than enough evidence showing those with the most complete programs are best able to withstand economic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. There are also other options for investors such as impact funds whose holdings are chosen specifically because their businesses generate measurable environmental or social improvements.

Still concerns about how investments are judged as sustainable or not are shared across the spectrum from environmental and social activists to the top voices in the financial world. Mark Carney the former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England and co-manager of Brookfield Asset Management’s Impact Fund has been a driving force in directing many of the world’s financial institutions to put climate considerations among their top investment objectives in his role as UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance.

Mr. Carney has acknowledged the problems with third-party ESG ratings. In his 2021 book Value(s) he pointed out that different data vendors can have dramatically different ratings for the same company. That means returns can also be vastly different depending on which vendors investors rely on. “Unfortunately ESG data can fall short due to incomplete coverage and a dependence on self-reporting by companies” he wrote.

The ISSB’s global standards could eventually render some ratings agencies’ practices obsolete and force them to reinvent their offerings to the market says Emmanuel Faber the board’s chair. With generally accepted accounting principles for example there’s less need to score companies’ financial disclosure practices and this will be the case with ESG says Mr. Faber the former CEO of Paris-based food company Danone SA. There will still be demand for analysis of ESG performance that’s conducted by the agencies and that will improve with standardized reporting.

“They would look at climate and social and nature-based topics or specific industry sustainability issues in much more detail in their links with the enterprise value assessment than what they are able to do with ESG alphabet soup today” he says. “You would hopefully have a consolidated landscape with ESG metrics. They would be comparable. They would be of high quality.”

For its part IGM whose ESG ratings vary widely isn’t overly bothered by the scores themselves. But it’s keen to make sure the providers gather and report the correct underlying data – and that it has the opportunity to vet the information. That hasn’t always been the case says Andrea Carlson senior vice-president enterprise sustainability and financial risk for IGM which is majority owned by Power Corp.

IGM rates well in measures around the “E” and “S” of ESG but falls short on ISS’s pure governance score – a fact Ms. Carlson says can be attributed to attitudes toward public companies controlled by one majority shareholder. “For many of these organizations they historically haven’t engaged companies in the rating process. They’re starting to get better at that – soliciting issuer feedback on the ratings” she says. “But they don’t give you the recipe on how the score is created. That part is still a bit of a black box and regulators are starting to get involved in the conversation.”

Some companies grumble about their ESG report cards. Moncton-based energy company Major Drilling operates in 20 countries and is working to improve ESG performance in all its branches says Andrew McLaughlin its general counsel. “Every now and then we’ll get this report out of the blue. And then it just sort of deflates the process” he says. “We’ve got to go chasing down [information] in areas where we just haven’t been tracking. Certain issues that are important to ratings agencies aren’t what we consider to be our priority or investors’ priorities for us but nevertheless they can impact your score.”

Richard Mattison the president of S&P Global Sustainable1 says his agency has tried to craft its rating based on the real-world impact critics say is lacking. “If you’re dealing with an ESG skeptic your first bridge for them in capital markets at least is to bring them to a point where they understand there’s a financial risk associated with certain ESG topics” he says. “However we also think it’s important not just to understand the financial risk associated with ESG topics. It’s also to understand what kind of real-world impact has been driven by ESG. That is embedded in our score as well.”

Such real-world impact will eventually become financial impact but over a longer period than financial markets assess company valuations he says. For example if a company is producing cheap clothing while polluting the environment or employing children its reputation could take a major hit along with its bottom line.

Still as with every other rating investors can pick at a well-scoring company and ask whether it deserves its high marks based on their beliefs of what’s important.

An example: S&P Global’s data form the basis of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes which include companies evaluated for superior ESG performance. Canadian Pacific Railway is part of Dow Jones’s North American sustainability index despite a continuing RCMP investigation and legal action surrounding its safety protocols after a 2019 train crash in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia that killed three workers. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada ruled in late March the company’s safety deficiencies contributed to the accident. CP Rail disputes that conclusion.

S&P Global spokesperson Sarah Whybrow says S&P Global Sustainable1 considered the event “and reflected the incident in the company’s S&P Global ESG scoring while awaiting material information regarding the event from both the Transportation Safety Board and pending legal cases.” She says S&P is currently reviewing the Transportation Safety Board report and monitoring the legal cases.

Mr. Fancy who now heads the Rumie Initiative an educational technology non-profit he created after leaving BlackRock in late 2019 says the key to better corporate and finance-industry performance lies not in ESG scores but in strong and deliberate government and regulatory action to enforce standards. Many people entered the sustainability professions to make positive impacts inside and outside their companies and have a sense of fair play. They need to lead the charge he says.

“I think it’s ridiculous for anyone to work in the ESG community and not be arguing in favour of government regulation” Mr. Fancy says. “It would be like a coach who teaches how to play clean hockey and then they’re okay with there being no referees. You don’t get any benefit from playing clean unless someone’s enforcing it.”

Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX 1.51%) has grown for years to become a titan in the entertainment industry with more than 221 million subscribers worldwide. The stock has been similarly successful returning more than 2200% in just the past decade.

However Netflix has steadily transformed its business over the years transitioning from licensed third-party content to in-house productions it owns. That strategy has largely paid off with a large and growing library of originals but the financial side of the business seems to be hitting some bumps.

Let's break down Netflix's cash-flow dilemma and discuss what challenges it could create for the company in this environment of rising interest rates.

More content more spending

Netflix has been ratcheting up its in-house content development for years and it's done a great job if its 27 Oscar nominations at the 94th Academy Awards mean anything.

Below you can see how the company's cost of goods sold which captures its content spending has grown along with revenue. The business is very profitable -- net income in 2021 totaled $5.1 billion. However that's because of how the company amortizes its content spending. If you look at the company's free cash flow it paints a much different picture.

The business is actually burning cash most years despite the strong profits on its income statement. Netflix borrows money to help fund content and it currently has a net debt (total debt minus cash) balance of $9.4 billion.

Could rising rates hurt Netflix?

This could potentially put Netflix in a bind -- rising interest rates due to high inflation will likely make borrowing more expensive. The ideal solution is Netflix growing revenue faster than its expenses which also comes with a Catch-22.

In recent years streaming has become increasingly competitive. Virtually every major content developer launched services just in the past few years. Some of these companies like Walt Disney have decades of legacy content built up which has enabled them to fill their content catalog without breaking the bank.

Netflix's premium plan costs $19.99 per month in the U.S. and it's worth wondering how much more it can increase pricing without spiking its churn rates. Netflix has been a staple in many streaming households for so long that it may have the pricing power it needs but I wouldn't assume that as a sure thing.

What's the ""end game""?

Perhaps more importantly what's the long-term investment thesis for Netflix? In recent years subscriber growth has slowed notably with management guiding for the company's fourth consecutive quarter of single-digit year-over-year subscriber growth in the first quarter of 2022.

If subscriber growth doesn't pick back up it could pressure Netflix to further raise its prices. It's unlikely the company's content spending will shrink anytime soon. Great content has replay value but there will be a constant need to invest in new hit shows and movies to keep the competition at bay.

I'm not trying to say that Netflix is in financial trouble but free cash flow is important as businesses mature. It funds dividends and share repurchases which investors look for as revenue growth slows. If Netflix can't deliver on that metric I worry the stock may hit a long-term ""glass ceiling."" It's something investors will need to watch for over the coming quarters and years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS9lbnQvamVubmlmZXItZ2FybmVyLXdvcnN0LW1vdmllLW5ldGZsaXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Garner's Worst Movie Is Crushing On Netflix,"This low point in Jennifer Garner's career somehow still has a lot of talent behind it and it's currently doing great on Netflix.

By Nathan Kamal |

This article is more than 2 years old

After Jennifer Garner broke out to audiences playing Sydney Bristow the tough capable iron-willed CIA agent in ABC’s hit thriller series Alias Hollywood took note. Of course Hollywood saw her masterful starring portrayal of an international badass master of disguise and immediately started casting her as the love interest to random flavor of the month leading men. Though she had made a few film appearances like being a love interest in the cult stoner comedy Dude Where’s My Car? and a love interest in the Leslie Nielsen 1997 comedy Mr. Magoo her film career began concurrently with Alias. Admittedly some of these early movies weren’t bad 13 Going on 30 has become a beloved staple of sleepovers and the one-two shudder of Daredevil and Elektra had the good sense to make her an ass-kicking ninja-trained fighter. Catch and Release is not one of these. The 2006 romantic comedy-drama film starring Jennifer Garner and Timothy Olyphant is an odd low point for everyone concerned but it also is currently in the top five most-streamed films on Netflix. So let’s get into it.

Jennifer Garner stars in Catch and Release as Gray Wheeler. From the very beginning of the film she is distraught and weeping but there is a pretty good reason: she is attending the funeral of her fiance Grady which was scheduled for the day they were supposed to be married. This is a good moment to pause and decide if you are really invested in Catch and Release and can suspend your disbelief enough to think there was no possible other option than to schedule a funeral for the maximum possible tragic poetic irony in a woman’s life. We are quickly introduced to Jennifer Garner’s friends Dennis (Sam Jaeger) and Sam (Kevin Smith somehow managing to wedge in a tasteless lesbian joke) both of whom will be comedic relief for the remainder of the movie. We are also introduced to Timothy Olyphant as Fritz the best friend of the late Grady. We know that he is a bad guy (who will likely turn out to have a heart of gold) because he works filming commercials in Los Angeles has carefully shaggy early-2000s hair and smokes inside. Also he has loud sex with a random woman in the bathroom at his best friend’s funeral while Jennifer Garner hides in the bathtub behind a closed shower curtain.

Aside from the offscreen death of Jennifer Garner’s fiance the real premise of Catch and Release is discovering the things you don’t know about the people you love. In this case it turns out the departed Grady not only had a million-dollar investment account that he never told Garner about he has been paying $3000 a month to some unknown party. But because this isn’t Alias it is not an exciting dangerous discovery. It turns out that Grady cheated on Garner at a party and now has a young son with a scatter-brained woman named Maureen (a wildly miscast Juliette Lewis). Basically Catch and Release is a movie about how Jennifer Garner’s dead fiance was actually kind of a sucky person and his best friend half-heartedly covers up for him for a while. As you might expect Garner and Olyphant manage to fall in love and then have some difficulties and then fall in love again. At the end of the movie there are some complications involving Grady’s inheritance and a DNA test and ultimately everyone moves into Jennifer Garner’s house together as one big found-family. In theory this is a good lesson.

Catch and Release was the directorial debut (and to date only directed film) by screenwriter and producer Susannah Grant. Grant has an excellent track record including an Academy Award nomination for writing Erin Brockovich and recently co-created the acclaimed Netflix series Unbelievable with Ayelet Waldman and Pulitzer Prize-winner Michael Chabon. Considering that Jennifer Garner Timothy Olyphant and Susannah Grant have all produced excellent work in the years since Catch and Release it must just be taken as a kind of weird anti-miracle that dragged everyone down with it. No specific one part of the film is incredibly terrible but all the combinations come together in a lackluster mixture of contrivances and stock characters. But despite that people are loving it on Netflix. Go figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmVzdC1uZXRmbGl4LXN0YW5kLXVwLWNvbWVkeS1zcGVjaWFsc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,27 funniest stand-up specials on Netflix for a good laugh,"It's important to remember during These Trying Times that we all still need to make room in our lives for laughter and joy.

27. Tiffany Haddish: Black Mitzvah

At least on Netflix Tiffany Haddish's performance energy is unparalleled. For her special titled Black Mitzvah Haddish imbues coming-of-age anecdotes with effervescence and physical comedy that just can't be beat. She explores stardom growth and peeing in an Uber. Adult stuff! If you're looking for a pick-me-up and the greatest ponytail to grace the small screen you're in the right place. — A.F.

26. Pete Davidson: Alive From New York

It was only a matter of time before Saturday Night Live fave and hot celeb gossip singularity Pete Davidson swaggered his B.D.E. onto the stage for a proper comedy special. Pete Davidson: Alive from New York is that special and it's a Netflix original. Just like Pete himself the comedy sometimes feels rough and unformed. But the SNL star finds his groove in the end as he often does by mining humor our of deeply personal touchstones from his life. — Adam Rosenberg Senior Reporter

25. Eric André: Legalize Everything

The unhinged comedy of Eric André is front-and-center in Legalize Everything right at the start. The comic known best for his eponymous The Eric André Show as well as a top-tier internet meme kicks off his Netflix special with a sketch moment. Dressed up in a cop's uniform André parades through the streets of New Orleans brandishing a bong and all manner of drugs. It's an appropriate introduction to a too-short stage show where altered states and absurdity are the order of the day. — A.R.

24. Michelle Wolf: Joke Show

Michelle Wolf’s second streaming special (and first on Netflix) is everything the comedian does best: humblebragging disguised as self deprecation and incisive commentary about sexism that doesn’t feel pedantic all delivered with a cheeky smile. Wolf’s greatest comedy weapon has always been that she doesn’t seem like someone with the power to destabilize the unsuspecting audience with words alone but she absolutely nails it every time. — Proma Khosla Entertainment Reporter

23. Sarah Silverman: A Speck of Dust

Sarah Silverman is one of those comics who needs no introduction. You've probably heard OF her simply because you've probably heard her. The outspoken SNL veteran has built her brand of humor around finding the jokes inside of challenging topics and speaking about them candidly and with a heavy dose of irony. A Speck of Dust finds Silverman in a more introspective mood as she balances her ribald flavor of jokes alongside thoughtful and thought-provoking acts of self-reflection. — A.R.

22. Jim Gaffigan: Cinco

Comedy's favorite father of five has plenty of Grammy-nominated works on Netflix but Cinco is one we just keep coming back to. In his fifth one-hour special Jim Gaffigan meditates on the birth of his fifth child as well as the morphing political climate in 2017. We get tons of great Gaffigan moments including his uproarious look at binge-watching. — A.F.

20. Todd Glass: Act Happy

Act Happy is a uniquely hilarious stand-up special because it features a live band on stage with Todd Glass and the way he plays off that band and uses it to accent his jokes and stories makes for Glass’s best special yet. His fast dynamic stream-of-conscious comedy is on fire here as he digs into the minutiae of life and the backing band is icing on the cake. — Kellen Beck Entertainment Reporter

19. Seth Meyers: Lobby Baby

In his Netflix debut Late Night host Meyers brings the broad likability that drives his talk show that has kept him prominent in comedy since his days at Saturday Night Live’s Weekend Update desk. His takes on fatherhood and married life aren’t revolutionary but they’re comfortably personal and absurd enough (like the titular bit) to make an impression. He also takes advantage of Netflix unlike anyone else with the “SKIP POLITICS” option for anyone who wants to get through a comedy hour without hearing a word that rhymes with “grump.” — P.K.

1. Bo Burnham: Inside

Among the more impressive pandemic projects to hit the market Bo Burnham: Inside is an unconventional comedy special that takes a painfully precise look at the traumatic experience of social distancing during COVID-19. In it Burnham takes musical aim at everything from aging (""30"") to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (""Bezos I"" and ""Bezos II"") with his characteristic wit and self-depreciation — having made the project while of course stuck at home like the rest of us.

It's not an easy watch. Mashable's Alexis Nedd actually described it as a ""musical recap of shared psychic trauma."" If that's the kind of viewing experience you can manage then you definitely should cue it up. But if you need to sit this one out we get that too. The ""I am not well"" scene is genuinely hard to watch. — A.F. *

The CNN Original Series airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.

CNN —

Over the past 70 years media mogul Rupert Murdoch built a small Australian family newspaper company into arguably the most powerful conservative media empire in history. With a market cap of $13.50 billion News Corp is one of the most influential companies on the planet.

The story behind the ruthless business tactics political maneuvering and dynastic family battles that have gone into the making of this media powerhouse would be perfect fodder for one of the News Corp news outlets or TV channels if it were not about Rupert himself. Now as the seemingly invincible figure advances into his nineties speculation through the worlds of business politics and entertainment about who will succeed him as the leader of News Corp has reached a fever pitch.

Here’s a look at who’s who in the potential line of succession and the wider Murdoch clan.

Rupert Murdoch

Australian-born Rupert Murdoch 91 is the media magnate who grew the small newspaper company he inherited from his father in 1952 into News Corporation Ltd. the multi-billion dollar global media empire with a presence in cable film television internet satellite sports publishing and other fields. At different points the conglomerate has included the newspapers News of the World the Sun the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal; Twentieth Century Fox film studio; the Fox Broadcasting network; Fox News Channel; HarperCollins publishing and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Murdoch has been married four times and fathered six children over the course of his seven-decades long career. Several of Murdoch’s children have followed him into the family business. Murdoch’s penchant for pitting the siblings against each other in a years’ long competition to see who will succeed him as head of News Corp is widely believed to be the inspiration for the popular HBO series “Succession.”

Murdoch’s ruthlessness extends far beyond his family circle. Early in his career he developed the tactic of confronting competition by buying them or running them out of business. Dealings at his British tabloid papers came under scrutiny in 2011 when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals celebrities and crime victims to get their stories. The Murdoch family brand made headlines again when Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations in 2016.

Murdoch still holds the top post at News Corp the second incarnation of the now defunct News Corporation which broke up into two companies in 2013. It is unclear who will lead the company when he passes.

Potential Heirs

Lachlan Murdoch

Lachlan Murdoch 50 is Rupert Murdoch’s oldest son with his second wife Anna. He began learning the family business at a young age through internships at his father’s media outlets. He rose quickly through the executive ranks and by 1997 had become chairman and chief executive of News Ltd. At the time his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent “the first among equals.” His ascension continued smoothly until 2005. That year Lachlan abruptly quit his executive positions at News Corporation after a battle with Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan then launched his own investment company Illyria Pty in Australia. After an extended absence Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 and resumed his position as a potential heir to the empire becoming CEO of Fox Broadcasting and executive chairman at 21st Century Fox. Shortly after Lachlan’s younger brother James was tapped to be CEO of 21st Century Fox in a power-sharing experiment orchestrated by Rupert between the brothers. The experiment proved unsuccessful and Rupert sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019. Lachlan now holds the roles of executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation and co-chairman of News Corp as well as executive chairman of NOVA Entertainment an Australian media company.

James Murdoch

James Murdoch 49 is Rupert Murdoch’s fourth child and second son with his second wife Anna. James’ early career choices was at odds with his father’s conservative newspaper empire. He dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label Rawkus Records. After several years he transitioned into executive roles within News Corporation and assumed the role of corporate company man. After Lachlan quit Fox in 2005 James was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent to his father.

In 2007 James became chairman of BSkyB. In 2011 he was named deputy COO of News Corporation and chairman and CEO of News International. But as James was climbing to new heights within the empire the company became engulfed in scandal when investigators and journalists discovered staff at some Murdoch tabloids in Britain had been hacking the phones of public figures and crime victims to get their stories. James was forced to step down as chairman of BSkyB as a result.

After several years hiatus he rejoined the family business eventually becoming chairman of Sky and CEO of 21st Century Fox co-leading the company with older brother Lachlan who served as executive chairman. The joint leadership arrangement didn’t work out and James left 21st Century Fox in 2019 when the company was sold to Disney and then left Sky when majority control was acquired by Comcast. Long known as the lone liberal of the Murdoch clan James’ political differences with his family came to a head and he resigned from the board of News Corp in 2020 writing at the time “My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”

Elisabeth Murdoch

Elisabeth Murdoch 53 is Rupert Murdoch’s second child the first he had with second wife Anna Murdoch. Elisabeth began her training in the family business early with internships and entry level jobs at Murdoch properties. In 1996 she became managing director of Sky Networks at BSkyB. But several years later she was passed over for the role of chief executive at Sky.

Rupert considers Elisabeth to be most like him but he has been more dismissive of her attempts to take the throne saying at one point she’d have to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company. In 2000 she left the family business and went on to found Shine one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies with shows like “The Biggest Loser” “Master Chef” and “History Cold Case.”

When News Corporation acquired Shine in 2011 Elisabeth attempted to take a seat on the News Corporation board but scrutiny over the phone hacking scandal prevented that from happening. She left Shine after a merger with two other production companies. In 2019 she established a new production company Sister and in 2021 Sister funded the opening of a London branch of Ghetto Film School a non-profit program geared toward introducing young people of color to the entertainment industry.

Wives

Anna Murdoch

Rupert met Anna Torv at his newspaper The Daily Mirror in Sydney where she was working as a reporter. A few months after his divorce from Patricia Rupert and Anna married. They had three children together Elisabeth Lachlan and James now the main contenders to be heir of the Murdoch empire. Over the years Anna published several novels one of which featured a family that bore a striking resemblance to her own. She spent three decades raising their family and acting as Rupert’s loyal partner on the world stage. In the mid-1990’s as Rupert approached conventional retirement age Anna hoped his relentless drive to build the empire would subside and he’d spend more time with her enjoying their golden years. Rupert was completely opposed to that idea. The disagreement led to an irreconcilable rift and the two divorced in 1999 after 31 years of marriage.

Wendi Deng

Deng 53 Rupert Murdoch’s third wife is mother of his two youngest children Grace Murdoch 20 and Chloe Murdoch 18. Wendi met Rupert when she was working at his Star TV network in Hong Kong. The up-and-comer immediately charmed the media mogul; one former colleague said “She was always someone who was going to do well. We just didn’t realize how well.” They married in June 1999 two years after meeting and only 17 days after Rupert’s divorce with his second wife Anna was finalized. Wendi grew to be one of Rupert’s closest advisers and confidantes but his older children opposed the marriage and viewed Wendi as a potential competitor for control of the Murdoch empire. But after 14 years the marriage fell apart amid allegations of Wendi’s infidelity on which she has declined to comment.

Jerry Hall

Former supermodel and ex-girlfriend of rock star Mick Jagger Jerry Hall married Rupert Murdoch in 2016 when she was 59 and he was 85. The grown Murdoch children genuinely like Jerry and approved of the union very different circumstances from his marriage to Wendi Deng. The London wedding was a joyful family affair and presented a rare moment of solidarity among the Murdoch clan. In August – 6 years after tying the knot – it was reported that Hall and Murdoch finalized their divorce.

Prudence Macleod

Prudence Macleod is Rupert’s oldest child from his first marriage to Patricia Booker. Prudence never showed much of an interest in running the family business so she has largely stayed out of the succession battle that has ensnared her siblings Elisabeth Lachlan and James. She has held different positions at News Corporation throughout her career and currently sits on the board of Times Newspapers Ltd. She also has a voting share in the Murdoch family trust.

Their most recent project smashed the sale price record for a home in the north Brisbane suburb of Wavell Heights when it sold for just over $3m last month.

But even they admit the days of turning trash to cash may be over.

“To come into this market as a flipper now you’ve missed the opportunity” Nathan said.

“You’ve got to find a builder and materials. It’s a timely process now. Definitely not as quick as it used to be.”

The professional builders have decided to change their strategy as uncertainty starts to plague the market amid the threat of interest rate rises the increasing cost of living and a looming federal election.

“We’ve changed our tactic from big and loud luxury homes to condensing it down to something all buyers can afford” Nathan said.

“Right now in this market you can see people can’t afford to pay over the $2 million mark… so we’re coming down into a safer market.”

Operating under the banner of Odessa Property Group the siblings have flipped six houses in under three years.

Before 46 Power St Wavell Heights they built and sold 87 Benecia Street in the same suburb for $2.227m.

“We buy the land design and build ourselves pick the finishes ourselves” Nathan said.

“We’re lucky to have suppliers to help us with construction at the moment.”

But their next projects are more low-key — a duplex in Wavell Heights and a multi-residential block of land in Nundah on which they are tossing up whether to build units townhouses or two houses.

Nathan would not reveal how much he and his brother had made from their flipping pursuits except to say “several hundred thousand”.

But you can get an idea once you consider their Power Street build was around $1 million plus the cost of the land.

“We’re just passionate about building a good product” Nathan said.

“It’s been in our blood from day one. Dad was a builder so it’s just what we were taught when we were kids.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbWljaGFlbHdlc3QuY29tLmF1L2xhYm9yLXRyb2xscy10aHVncy1hbmQtbG9ib3RvbWlzZWQtc2h0aGVhZHMtYmVsaWUtYS1iaWdnZXItY2hhbGxlbmdlLWZvci1tZWRpYS1lbGl0ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Labor trolls 'thugs"" and ""lobotomised sh*theads"" belie a bigger challenge for media elites - Michael West","The social media outcry over ABC Breakfast News presenter Fauziah Ibrahim’s silly Twitter lists belies the greater issue of media bias the parroting of News Corp and Nine agendas therefore government spin. Who has really been lobotomised here? Michael West reports.

It was a heck of a Twitter storm. ABC Breakfast News presenter Fauziah Ibrahim was found to be hosting two “lists” on her Twitter feed: “Labor Trolls/Thugs” and “Lobotomised Sh*theads”.

Unfortunately for Ibrahim the lists were public. They contained not just pro-Labor tweeters sick of nine years of Coalition rule but also others who are clearly not trolls thugs or lobotomised sh*theads.

Many of the people on Ibrahim’s lists are in fact decent contributors to the public debate whether tribal Labor supporters or not. This is the point of Twitter it gives people a voice it delivers everybody and anybody a role in the public marketplace for ideas. It is democracy. Yet this is something which is lost on mainstream media elites.

Sales sails

ABC’s top presenter Leigh Sales often complaining about Twitter trolls just left the online forum. Lisa Millar too. Others have taken a dismissive somewhat elitist view of social media Andrew Probyn writing it off as just Twitter; others complaining wrongly that it has been weaponised against women.

No Twitter is people not some group conspiracy of trolls. And so a siege mentality has developed in the traditional media an “us versus them”. It is elitist and it is wrong.

The ABC and others chose to ignore the voice of the people people who wanted #prayerroom investigated who would have liked to have seen even-handed coverage of gotcha moments who would rather see proper scrutiny brought to bear on the like of this week’s preposterous announcements about another Darwin port or Scott Morrison’s “forestry package” and the bizarre claims it would create 73000 jobs in Tasmania (when there are now about 3000 jobs).

The approach from ABC management seems to be if it’s not in News Corp or Nine newspapers or maybe the Guardian it’s not news. They have become news followers rather than news leaders. This is the fundamental problem after years of defunding bitter criticism by both sides of the political divide. Where once Q & A set the news agenda on a Monday night shunted back to Thursday and hamstrung by its faux balance now its audience has been shredded along with its influence.

This writer really appreciates and supports ABC like most of its critics. We want it properly funded defended. Yet Twitter Facebook Reddit TikTok and other social media forums are here to stay. They can often be brutal but that’s life.

Ibrahim will face censure. She should probably apologise as quickly as possible. It’s not a good look for the public broadcaster to be slagging off its audience but she appears to have simply made a stupid mistake. Making her Twitter lists publicly visible that is. To expect ABC journalists to not hold any personal bias is neither reasonable nor realistic. Everybody has a personal view.

Bigger fish to fry

Meanwhile the ABC faces far more profound challenges. Every day the broadcaster follows up the stories which have run in News Corp and Nine Entertainment media and therefore Coalition agendas with little scrutiny. They are a key part of the machine which fails to hold governments to account and which favours the Liberal Party.

This is because Nine and News are selective the latter venomously selective in their coverage of politics. The government and its phalanx of spinmeisters control this agenda by leaking to a small group in the Canberra press gallery in return for positive coverage. To generalise if they don’t play the government game they don’t get the drop.

The ABC and other media the likes of commercial breakfast TV regional media and talk-back radio get up every morning and follow these same agendas.

The result is that the news which the public receives news which is critical to the outcome of elections to legislation and public policy is distorted perverted.

Agenda bender

Why would ABC take seriously and report as gospel truth unchallenged and worthy of debate News Corp’s agenda-ridden news coverage? Surely it is not lost on them that News its broadcaster Sky News its state tabloids and national daily The Australian are propaganda.

News Corp is controlled by foreign media magnate Rupert Murdoch whose Fox News in the US championed Donald Trump and is now singing the praises of Vladimir Putin.

Even US President Joe Biden has dubbed Murdoch “the most dangerous man in the world”. In the UK found to have engaged systematically in hacking phones and bribing officials News was outed as a criminal enterprise yet it is daily lent the imprimatur of credibility by ABC and others.

Even worse Murdoch’s cheerleading for war gave licence to the invasion of Iraq and the rise of ISIS. A million dead. And yet the ABC blithely follows them day in day out. There has been a massive loss of perspective partly due to the ravages of ABC funding cuts partly due to weak management.

It needs managers who will fight stand on principle exhort their journalists not to be distracted by political theatre by the daily antics. Its “talent” its stars on screen have won their public position and pay rises during a decade of Coalition rule. They are unlikely to change course now. It is up to management to manage.

Stick to your knitting

ABC has sought to innovate frolicking with ABC Life and various ventures to lift their younger demographics. The best thing however indeed the only thing which they can do is to focus on hard news and analysis – not fritter away millions trying to compete in a crowded magazine market.

They need to stop hosting lobbyists and political PR people on their chat shows – or at least disclose the likes of ASPI IPA AI Group and BCA and their agendas.

Last week the first week of the election campaign was dominated by Albo’s gaffe. It was a bit of a shocker to be sure but hardly deserving of blanket coverage when the Morrison campaign was flat-out pork barrelling with the taxes of ordinary Australians simply buying votes with somebody else’s money.

And what of the straight out lies that the subsidies for logging companies would bring about 73000 jobs or that – having sold the Port of Darwin to the Chinese on a 100 year lease for just $510m – it was a good idea to build another port for $1.5bn with no consulting engineers or financial modellers involved to assure us it was even feasible.

ABC has little choice but to listen to what people are saying on social media not spurn it. Elitism will only ruin their credibility. That means recognising that its corporate media peers are institutionally biased and driven by commercial and political agendas. In other words they will have to do their own work ignore the clickbait. It won’t be easy.

The Knights have reportedly pulled their extension offer for Kalyn Ponga in a stunning twist to the superstar fullback’s future.

It now opens the door for Ponga to link up with the Dolphins after being sprung meeting with coach Wayne Bennett earlier this month.

News Corp reports Ponga and the Knights had agreed to a five-year deal however it was pulled by the club on Friday.

Ponga is signed with the Knights until the end of 2024 — however he has an option in his favour for the final two seasons which he has to make a call on by Round 10.

The Dolphins have been circling Ponga as their potential marquee signing and now it looks likely that the 24-year-old will end up in Redcliffe.

It opens the door now for the Knights to chase Storm superstar Cameron Munster — who has also been in talks with the Dolphins — with a long-term deal.

According to News Corp Ponga’s father Andre who is also his manager wanted authority over when the deal was announced — not the Knights — and that has created some unsettlement at the club.

The Knights wanted to unveil the new deal last week but Andre was not on board.

The extension was understood to be between $1.1 million to $1.2 million for another three years which would have kept Ponga in the Hunter until the end of 2027.

News Corp reports senior Knights management have become fed-up with Andre delaying the announcement as well as the money being paid for Ponga who is yet to hit his best form this season.

“It’s massive news coming out of Newcastle” Fox League analyst Corey Parker said.

“We’ve been following this story for a number of weeks and it looked like it was agreed on with Kalyn Ponga and his management were going to proceed for a long period of time at the Knights.

“Now that’s been sensationally pulled from Kalyn Ponga. There seems to be some communication breakdown between Andre who is Kalyn’s dad and the senior management at the Knights.

“It’s a huge story because there’s a flow-on effect off the back of that with the Dolphins coming into the competition next year. They need a marquee signing they’ve made it very clear that Kalyn Ponga is going to be that man.

“Kalyn still has two years to activate on his contract but that looks highly unlikely going forward which then opens a number of doors for a number of clubs because Cam Munster is also in that same conversation with the Dolphins.

“But if Kalyn Ponga goes there first you wouldn’t imagine they can afford both of them.”

“It’s disruptive for the Knights” Shane Flanagan added.

“I’m sure the team today wouldn’t have an understanding of what was going on behind the scenes and without knowing the details it is a tricky one with the two-year option in his favour and the extension.

“For Newcastle I hope he stays but it does sound (like) it’s dragging on and on. We thought last week there would be an announcement and then all of a sudden there’s a backflip there.

“From a club’s point of view they can go back there and they may have put a deadline on it and they wanted to get it resolved but not good for the club or the player.”

Ponga now has six weeks left before he must activate or knock back his option for 2023 and 2024.

But after this revelation it seems unlikely that he will choose to stay beyond this season.

When it launched last week an offer came in quickly — sight unseen.

But this buyer did not secure the property.

It turned out that the next owners of the house were another family; and they were the first people through the door at the property’s open home.

Peterswald for property agent Bec Owens said No.60 Ocean Esp had been sold for $1.3m.

She said while the family might update it a bit they don’t intend to undertake a huge renovation project.

“They had been house hunting in another area but they fell in love with the beachside location” she said.

For anyone looking for a waterfront opportunity you’d have to look far and wide to find a more attractive one than this.

No.60 Ocean is a rare example of 1940s architecture coupled with a sensational location a mere 10 steps from the sand.

Mrs Owens said while there are a handful of similar homes in this waterfront neighbourhood that have already been renovated and No.60 is the “most original left on the esplanade”.

“There isn’t even a carparking space in front so from the living area you actually feel like you are hovering over the beach” Mrs Owens said.

“You’d never need to go on holidays or to a shack; it’s got the convenience of suburban living with a seaside feel.

“It has been well loved and kept super neat.

“There is certainly a lot to love about the current home and the character that comes with it.”

Built in 1946 No.60’s floorplan offers a handcrafted Bernd Farasin kitchen with a meals area that connects through to the living room.

The living area is at the front of the home with picture windows taking in water views sunrises sea breezes and birdlife.

Down a hall there are two bedrooms the family bathroom laundry and a family room.

The property has a garage a workshop and a studio — above the garage — accessed from a courtyard.

The studio’s feature window at the front seemingly on top of the water makes it a perfect source of inspiration.

“The studio opens to the entertainment area it would be a great space for entertaining a guest bedroom or rumpus” Mrs Owens said.

“And with its views over the water it would make a beautiful art or yoga studio.”

No.60’s grounds feature crazy sandstone paving and steps to the flower garden that leads to the beach.

The quaint seaside cottage is positioned on a corner block with dual access and only a narrow esplanade between the front gate and the beach."

The CNN Original Series airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.

CNN —

Over the past 70 years media mogul Rupert Murdoch built a small Australian family newspaper company into arguably the most powerful conservative media empire in history. With a market cap of $13.50 billion News Corp is one of the most influential companies on the planet.

The story behind the ruthless business tactics political maneuvering and dynastic family battles that have gone into the making of this media powerhouse would be perfect fodder for one of the News Corp news outlets or TV channels if it were not about Rupert himself. Now as the seemingly invincible figure advances into his nineties speculation through the worlds of business politics and entertainment about who will succeed him as the leader of News Corp has reached a fever pitch.

Here’s a look at who’s who in the potential line of succession and the wider Murdoch clan.

Rupert Murdoch

Australian-born Rupert Murdoch 91 is the media magnate who grew the small newspaper company he inherited from his father in 1952 into News Corporation Ltd. the multi-billion dollar global media empire with a presence in cable film television internet satellite sports publishing and other fields. At different points the conglomerate has included the newspapers News of the World the Sun the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal; Twentieth Century Fox film studio; the Fox Broadcasting network; Fox News Channel; HarperCollins publishing and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Murdoch has been married four times and fathered six children over the course of his seven-decades long career. Several of Murdoch’s children have followed him into the family business. Murdoch’s penchant for pitting the siblings against each other in a years’ long competition to see who will succeed him as head of News Corp is widely believed to be the inspiration for the popular HBO series “Succession.”

Murdoch’s ruthlessness extends far beyond his family circle. Early in his career he developed the tactic of confronting competition by buying them or running them out of business. Dealings at his British tabloid papers came under scrutiny in 2011 when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals celebrities and crime victims to get their stories. The Murdoch family brand made headlines again when Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations in 2016.

Murdoch still holds the top post at News Corp the second incarnation of the now defunct News Corporation which broke up into two companies in 2013. It is unclear who will lead the company when he passes.

Potential Heirs

Lachlan Murdoch

Lachlan Murdoch 50 is Rupert Murdoch’s oldest son with his second wife Anna. He began learning the family business at a young age through internships at his father’s media outlets. He rose quickly through the executive ranks and by 1997 had become chairman and chief executive of News Ltd. At the time his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent “the first among equals.” His ascension continued smoothly until 2005. That year Lachlan abruptly quit his executive positions at News Corporation after a battle with Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan then launched his own investment company Illyria Pty in Australia. After an extended absence Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 and resumed his position as a potential heir to the empire becoming CEO of Fox Broadcasting and executive chairman at 21st Century Fox. Shortly after Lachlan’s younger brother James was tapped to be CEO of 21st Century Fox in a power-sharing experiment orchestrated by Rupert between the brothers. The experiment proved unsuccessful and Rupert sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019. Lachlan now holds the roles of executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation and co-chairman of News Corp as well as executive chairman of NOVA Entertainment an Australian media company.

James Murdoch

James Murdoch 49 is Rupert Murdoch’s fourth child and second son with his second wife Anna. James’ early career choices was at odds with his father’s conservative newspaper empire. He dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label Rawkus Records. After several years he transitioned into executive roles within News Corporation and assumed the role of corporate company man. After Lachlan quit Fox in 2005 James was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent to his father.

In 2007 James became chairman of BSkyB. In 2011 he was named deputy COO of News Corporation and chairman and CEO of News International. But as James was climbing to new heights within the empire the company became engulfed in scandal when investigators and journalists discovered staff at some Murdoch tabloids in Britain had been hacking the phones of public figures and crime victims to get their stories. James was forced to step down as chairman of BSkyB as a result.

After several years hiatus he rejoined the family business eventually becoming chairman of Sky and CEO of 21st Century Fox co-leading the company with older brother Lachlan who served as executive chairman. The joint leadership arrangement didn’t work out and James left 21st Century Fox in 2019 when the company was sold to Disney and then left Sky when majority control was acquired by Comcast. Long known as the lone liberal of the Murdoch clan James’ political differences with his family came to a head and he resigned from the board of News Corp in 2020 writing at the time “My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”

Elisabeth Murdoch

Elisabeth Murdoch 53 is Rupert Murdoch’s second child the first he had with second wife Anna Murdoch. Elisabeth began her training in the family business early with internships and entry level jobs at Murdoch properties. In 1996 she became managing director of Sky Networks at BSkyB. But several years later she was passed over for the role of chief executive at Sky.

Rupert considers Elisabeth to be most like him but he has been more dismissive of her attempts to take the throne saying at one point she’d have to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company. In 2000 she left the family business and went on to found Shine one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies with shows like “The Biggest Loser” “Master Chef” and “History Cold Case.”

When News Corporation acquired Shine in 2011 Elisabeth attempted to take a seat on the News Corporation board but scrutiny over the phone hacking scandal prevented that from happening. She left Shine after a merger with two other production companies. In 2019 she established a new production company Sister and in 2021 Sister funded the opening of a London branch of Ghetto Film School a non-profit program geared toward introducing young people of color to the entertainment industry.

Wives

Anna Murdoch

Rupert met Anna Torv at his newspaper The Daily Mirror in Sydney where she was working as a reporter. A few months after his divorce from Patricia Rupert and Anna married. They had three children together Elisabeth Lachlan and James now the main contenders to be heir of the Murdoch empire. Over the years Anna published several novels one of which featured a family that bore a striking resemblance to her own. She spent three decades raising their family and acting as Rupert’s loyal partner on the world stage. In the mid-1990’s as Rupert approached conventional retirement age Anna hoped his relentless drive to build the empire would subside and he’d spend more time with her enjoying their golden years. Rupert was completely opposed to that idea. The disagreement led to an irreconcilable rift and the two divorced in 1999 after 31 years of marriage.

Wendi Deng

Deng 53 Rupert Murdoch’s third wife is mother of his two youngest children Grace Murdoch 20 and Chloe Murdoch 18. Wendi met Rupert when she was working at his Star TV network in Hong Kong. The up-and-comer immediately charmed the media mogul; one former colleague said “She was always someone who was going to do well. We just didn’t realize how well.” They married in June 1999 two years after meeting and only 17 days after Rupert’s divorce with his second wife Anna was finalized. Wendi grew to be one of Rupert’s closest advisers and confidantes but his older children opposed the marriage and viewed Wendi as a potential competitor for control of the Murdoch empire. But after 14 years the marriage fell apart amid allegations of Wendi’s infidelity on which she has declined to comment.

Jerry Hall

Former supermodel and ex-girlfriend of rock star Mick Jagger Jerry Hall married Rupert Murdoch in 2016 when she was 59 and he was 85. The grown Murdoch children genuinely like Jerry and approved of the union very different circumstances from his marriage to Wendi Deng. The London wedding was a joyful family affair and presented a rare moment of solidarity among the Murdoch clan. In August – 6 years after tying the knot – it was reported that Hall and Murdoch finalized their divorce.

Prudence Macleod is Rupert’s oldest child from his first marriage to Patricia Booker. Prudence never showed much of an interest in running the family business so she has largely stayed out of the succession battle that has ensnared her siblings Elisabeth Lachlan and James. She has held different positions at News Corporation throughout her career and currently sits on the board of Times Newspapers Ltd. She also has a voting share in the Murdoch family trust.

Their most recent project smashed the sale price record for a home in the north Brisbane suburb of Wavell Heights when it sold for just over $3m last month.

But even they admit the days of turning trash to cash may be over.

“To come into this market as a flipper now you’ve missed the opportunity” Nathan said.

“You’ve got to find a builder and materials. It’s a timely process now. Definitely not as quick as it used to be.”

The professional builders have decided to change their strategy as uncertainty starts to plague the market amid the threat of interest rate rises the increasing cost of living and a looming federal election.

“We’ve changed our tactic from big and loud luxury homes to condensing it down to something all buyers can afford” Nathan said.

“Right now in this market you can see people can’t afford to pay over the $2 million mark… so we’re coming down into a safer market.”

“We buy the land design and build ourselves pick the finishes ourselves” Nathan said.

“We’re lucky to have suppliers to help us with construction at the moment.”

But their next projects are more low-key — a duplex in Wavell Heights and a multi-residential block of land in Nundah on which they are tossing up whether to build units townhouses or two houses.

Nathan would not reveal how much he and his brother had made from their flipping pursuits except to say “several hundred thousand”.

But you can get an idea once you consider their Power Street build was around $1 million plus the cost of the land.

“We’re just passionate about building a good product” Nathan said.

Who has really been lobotomised here? Michael West reports.

It was a heck of a Twitter storm. ABC Breakfast News presenter Fauziah Ibrahim was found to be hosting two “lists” on her Twitter feed: “Labor Trolls/Thugs” and “Lobotomised Sh*theads”.

Unfortunately for Ibrahim the lists were public. They contained not just pro-Labor tweeters sick of nine years of Coalition rule but also others who are clearly not trolls thugs or lobotomised sh*theads.

Many of the people on Ibrahim’s lists are in fact decent contributors to the public debate whether tribal Labor supporters or not. This is the point of Twitter it gives people a voice it delivers everybody and anybody a role in the public marketplace for ideas. It is democracy. Yet this is something which is lost on mainstream media elites.

Sales sails

ABC’s top presenter Leigh Sales often complaining about Twitter trolls just left the online forum. Lisa Millar too. Others have taken a dismissive somewhat elitist view of social media Andrew Probyn writing it off as just Twitter; others complaining wrongly that it has been weaponised against women.

No Twitter is people not some group conspiracy of trolls. And so a siege mentality has developed in the traditional media an “us versus them”. It is elitist and it is wrong.

The ABC and others chose to ignore the voice of the people people who wanted #prayerroom investigated who would have liked to have seen even-handed coverage of gotcha moments who would rather see proper scrutiny brought to bear on the like of this week’s preposterous announcements about another Darwin port or Scott Morrison’s “forestry package” and the bizarre claims it would create 73000 jobs in Tasmania (when there are now about 3000 jobs).

The approach from ABC management seems to be if it’s not in News Corp or Nine newspapers or maybe the Guardian it’s not news. They have become news followers rather than news leaders. This is the fundamental problem after years of defunding bitter criticism by both sides of the political divide. Where once Q & A set the news agenda on a Monday night shunted back to Thursday and hamstrung by its faux balance now its audience has been shredded along with its influence.

This writer really appreciates and supports ABC like most of its critics. We want it properly funded defended. Yet Twitter Facebook Reddit TikTok and other social media forums are here to stay. They can often be brutal but that’s life.

Ibrahim will face censure. She should probably apologise as quickly as possible. It’s not a good look for the public broadcaster to be slagging off its audience but she appears to have simply made a stupid mistake. Making her Twitter lists publicly visible that is. To expect ABC journalists to not hold any personal bias is neither reasonable nor realistic. Everybody has a personal view.

Bigger fish to fry

Meanwhile the ABC faces far more profound challenges. Every day the broadcaster follows up the stories which have run in News Corp and Nine Entertainment media and therefore Coalition agendas with little scrutiny. They are a key part of the machine which fails to hold governments to account and which favours the Liberal Party.

This is because Nine and News are selective the latter venomously selective in their coverage of politics. The government and its phalanx of spinmeisters control this agenda by leaking to a small group in the Canberra press gallery in return for positive coverage. To generalise if they don’t play the government game they don’t get the drop.

The ABC and other media the likes of commercial breakfast TV regional media and talk-back radio get up every morning and follow these same agendas.

The result is that the news which the public receives news which is critical to the outcome of elections to legislation and public policy is distorted perverted.

Agenda bender

Why would ABC take seriously and report as gospel truth unchallenged and worthy of debate News Corp’s agenda-ridden news coverage? Surely it is not lost on them that News its broadcaster Sky News its state tabloids and national daily The Australian are propaganda.

News Corp is controlled by foreign media magnate Rupert Murdoch whose Fox News in the US championed Donald Trump and is now singing the praises of Vladimir Putin.

Even US President Joe Biden has dubbed Murdoch “the most dangerous man in the world”. In the UK found to have engaged systematically in hacking phones and bribing officials News was outed as a criminal enterprise yet it is daily lent the imprimatur of credibility by ABC and others.

Even worse Murdoch’s cheerleading for war gave licence to the invasion of Iraq and the rise of ISIS. A million dead. And yet the ABC blithely follows them day in day out. There has been a massive loss of perspective partly due to the ravages of ABC funding cuts partly due to weak management.

It needs managers who will fight stand on principle exhort their journalists not to be distracted by political theatre by the daily antics.

And what of the straight out lies that the subsidies for logging companies would bring about 73000 jobs or that – having sold the Port of Darwin to the Chinese on a 100 year lease for just $510m – it was a good idea to build another port for $1.5bn with no consulting engineers or financial modellers involved to assure us it was even feasible.

ABC has little choice but to listen to what people are saying on social media not spurn it. Elitism will only ruin their credibility. That means recognising that its corporate media peers are institutionally biased and driven by commercial and political agendas. In other words they will have to do their own work ignore the clickbait. It won’t be easy.

The Knights have reportedly pulled their extension offer for Kalyn Ponga in a stunning twist to the superstar fullback’s future.

It now opens the door for Ponga to link up with the Dolphins after being sprung meeting with coach Wayne Bennett earlier this month.

News Corp reports Ponga and the Knights had agreed to a five-year deal however it was pulled by the club on Friday.

Ponga is signed with the Knights until the end of 2024 — however he has an option in his favour for the final two seasons which he has to make a call on by Round 10.

The Dolphins have been circling Ponga as their potential marquee signing and now it looks likely that the 24-year-old will end up in Redcliffe.

It opens the door now for the Knights to chase Storm superstar Cameron Munster — who has also been in talks with the Dolphins — with a long-term deal.

According to News Corp Ponga’s father Andre who is also his manager wanted authority over when the deal was announced — not the Knights — and that has created some unsettlement at the club.

The Knights wanted to unveil the new deal last week but Andre was not on board.

The extension was understood to be between $1.1 million to $1.2 million for another three years which would have kept Ponga in the Hunter until the end of 2027.

News Corp reports senior Knights management have become fed-up with Andre delaying the announcement as well as the money being paid for Ponga who is yet to hit his best form this season.

“It’s massive news coming out of Newcastle” Fox League analyst Corey Parker said.

“We’ve been following this story for a number of weeks and it looked like it was agreed on with Kalyn Ponga and his management were going to proceed for a long period of time at the Knights.

“Now that’s been sensationally pulled from Kalyn Ponga. There seems to be some communication breakdown between Andre who is Kalyn’s dad and the senior management at the Knights.

“It’s a huge story because there’s a flow-on effect off the back of that with the Dolphins coming into the competition next year. They need a marquee signing they’ve made it very clear that Kalyn Ponga is going to be that man.

“Kalyn still has two years to activate on his contract but that looks highly unlikely going forward which then opens a number of doors for a number of clubs because Cam Munster is also in that same conversation with the Dolphins.

“But if Kalyn Ponga goes there first you wouldn’t imagine they can afford both of them.”

“It’s disruptive for the Knights” Shane Flanagan added.

“I’m sure the team today wouldn’t have an understanding of what was going on behind the scenes and without knowing the details it is a tricky one with the two-year option in his favour and the extension.

“For Newcastle I hope he stays but it does sound (like) it’s dragging on and on. We thought last week there would be an announcement and then all of a sudden there’s a backflip there.

“From a club’s point of view they can go back there and they may have put a deadline on it and they wanted to get it resolved but not good for the club or the player.”

Ponga now has six weeks left before he must activate or knock back his option for 2023 and 2024.

But after this revelation it seems unlikely that he will choose to stay beyond this season.

When it launched last week an offer came in quickly — sight unseen.

But this buyer did not secure the property.

It turned out that the next owners of the house were another family; and they were the first people through the door at the property’s open home.

Peterswald for property agent Bec Owens said No.60 Ocean Esp had been sold for $1.3m.

She said while the family might update it a bit they don’t intend to undertake a huge renovation project.

“They had been house hunting in another area but they fell in love with the beachside location” she said.

For anyone looking for a waterfront opportunity you’d have to look far and wide to find a more attractive one than this.

No.60 Ocean is a rare example of 1940s architecture coupled with a sensational location a mere 10 steps from the sand.

Mrs Owens said while there are a handful of similar homes in this waterfront neighbourhood that have already been renovated and No.60 is the “most original left on the esplanade”.

“There isn’t even a carparking space in front so from the living area you actually feel like you are hovering over the beach” Mrs Owens said.

“You’d never need to go on holidays or to a shack; it’s got the convenience of suburban living with a seaside feel.

“It has been well loved and kept super neat.

“There is certainly a lot to love about the current home and the character that comes with it.”

Built in 1946 No.60’s floorplan offers a handcrafted Bernd Farasin kitchen with a meals area that connects through to the living room.

The living area is at the front of the home with picture windows taking in water views sunrises sea breezes and birdlife.

Down a hall there are two bedrooms the family bathroom laundry and a family room.

The property has a garage a workshop and a studio — above the garage — accessed from a courtyard.

The studio’s feature window at the front seemingly on top of the water makes it a perfect source of inspiration.

“The studio opens to the entertainment area it would be a great space for entertaining a guest bedroom or rumpus” Mrs Owens said.

“And with its views over the water it would make a beautiful art or yoga studio.”

No.60’s grounds feature crazy sandstone paving and steps to the flower garden that leads to the beach.

The quaint seaside cottage is positioned on a corner block with dual access and only a narrow esplanade between the front gate and the beach."

The restrictions by McLean and Mercer counties both in the heart of North Dakota coal country came as concerns mounted in 2020 that Coal Creek Station North Dakota’s largest coal-fired power plant would be shuttered and see much of its electrical generation replaced by wind turbines. McLean County first adopted zoning restrictions making it harder to connect to a valuable transmission line tied to the coal plant while neighboring Mercer County followed up with a two year moratorium on new wind projects.

While North Dakota leaders rallied to find a new owner for Coal Creek Station and rescue the plant from shutting down coal advocates and renewable energy companies have been hard at work negotiating new policies for wind development in coal country.

McLean County which is home to Coal Creek Station is slated to hold a hearing Monday April 18 on amendments to its zoning rules that could roll back restrictions added two years ago. A draft proposal has been workshopped by county officials and a Virginia-based clean energy company looking to build the state’s largest wind farm near Coal Creek Station.

Just over the Missouri River Mercer County has already adopted a new ordinance laying the groundwork for local wind policy ahead of an expiration date on the county’s wind moratorium early next month.

But the decision by Mercer County officials came as a surprise to a group of wind and coal industry stakeholders who had been collaborating to develop a new ordinance for the commission. A Facebook post by the grassroots group Faces of North Dakota Coal which is part of the working group collaborating with the wind industry in Mercer County called the decision ""the worst possible"" outcome and said it ""ensures that this 'political football' won't go away anytime soon.""

A tale of two counties

Both McLean and Mercer counties are located on top of vast stores of lignite coal have advantageous conditions for wind farms and are hubs for valuable transmission lines whose space for new energy generation is tight.

In McLean State's Attorney Ladd Erickson the architect of the county's wind restrictions has been fielding input from local groups and renewable energy companies to craft new rules for renewable energy development.

Earlier this year the terms of the Coal Creek transfer between its current owner the Minnesota-based Great River Energy and incoming owner the Bismarck-based Rainbow Energy Marketing were amended to include plans for a 400 megawatt wind farm near the power plant in McLean County. A project of the Virginia-based Apex Clean Energy the development would be the largest stand-alone wind farm in North Dakota.

McLean County commission chair Steve Lee said the Apex project is estimated to require tens of thousands of acres. While local officials aren’t looking to impede the large project Lee said they want to pass an ordinance that accounts for the sentiments of both landowners who want turbines on their property and those who do not.

“There’s a balancing act” he said. “We want to protect our property owners and their rights but we certainly don’t want to jeopardize Coal Creek Station.”

According to a working draft of the proposed new amendments supplied by Erickson McLean County and Apex are in agreement on much of the contents though several unresolved items remain. Those include one provision that would allow county officials to reject a permit application if the project could have a “material adverse impact” for property values agriculture or wildlife another provision requiring a wind developer to have buyers for their power prior to permitting and a third provision allowing the commission wide latitude to deny project locations by creating ""avoidance"" areas.

In comments submitted ahead of Monday’s hearing Apex said it has “significant concerns” about the provision allowing the county to designate these ""avoidance"" areas. Wind farms require years of planning analysis environmental studies and regulatory hoops and the company said “it is essential” for local requirements to be clear “up front and equally applied to all projects.”

One of the major restrictions applied by McLean County two years ago was a one mile buffer from the Missouri River and its reservoirs for turbines and power lines a provision that blocks wind farms needing a way to connect to the transmission line over the water. The proposed amendments retain that rule but provide an exception for transmission lines “that must cross” the water.

Erickson declined to comment for this story ahead of Monday's hearing. After the announcement of the Apex project the McLean County state's attorney said local reception for the wind farm remained to be seen.

“Some areas might be receptive and some areas not. I think it’s all gonna be about the location"" he said at the time.

The path forward for wind is less clear-cut in Mercer County where the moratorium is set to lapse next month but recent actions by the commission have left wind and coal industry stakeholders confused and unsure of next steps.

County commissioners there voted 3-2 last week to adopt a new ordinance laying the groundwork for a local wind policy if the moratorium is allowed to expire. Commissioner Gene Wolf who backed passing the ordinance said the county needed to stop ""kicking this can down the road"" and get rules into place before the moratorium's expiration date. Changes could be made later to finalize the ordinance he said.

The county’s decision came as a surprise to a group of coal and wind industry representatives who had been collaborating to develop an ordinance agreeable to both sides. The working group which Mercer County commissioners designated last July to tackle several areas of contention in the zoning rules included representatives from Faces of North Dakota Coal and NextEra Energy which is pursuing the proposed Garrison Butte wind farm in Mercer.

Faces of North Dakota Coal member Mark Pierce said the county’s decision to move forward without their task force's input felt like the “carpet was pulled out from underneath” them. He said that while the coal advocacy group and the wind industry don't see eye to eye on everything they were making headway and had ironed out most of their disagreements.

The ordinance that Mercer County passed has numerous gaps and errors Pierce said and is “effectively a ban” on new wind farms in the area. He added that if the county uses the newly passed ordinance to develop its long-term wind policy as several commissioners have said they intend to do it will result in a “procedural quagmire.”

The day before the Mercer County commission passed its new rules representatives from Faces of North Dakota Coal and NextEra sent a joint-letter to the commission asking them for a 60 day extension and urging them not to pass a different ordinance. The May expiration date on the moratorium wasn't a pressing deadline they added since they were not aware of any wind projects that would be imminently filing for permits in Mercer County including NextEra's.

Clay Cameron a project developer at NextEra Energy and Mark Pierce a member of the grassroots group Faces of North Dakota Coal told Mercer County commissioners on Wednesday July 7 2021 that they would collaborate to hash out differences over a local policy governing new wind development in the county which is currently under a wind moratorium. Adam Willis / The Forum

Mercer County Commission Chair Travis Frey said he supports the county reopening for wind development but stressed the importance of preserving landowner coal sector and tourism interests at the same time.

“Is it going to be the easiest county for you to have a wind farm? No” said Frey. “We’re just saying that if you’re going to be part of this community we’re not going to trade coal for you.”

Frey voted against passage of the new ordinance last week but he said he thinks it's a good document to work from as the county continues to craft a longer-term wind policy. He added that the commission tasked the NextEra and Faces of North Dakota Coal representatives with a narrow task of finding resolution on two sticking points but the two sides came back with separate edits on the entire ordinance.

Remaining points of disagreement in the new ordinance include two provisions that would require a wind developer to show that they have a buyer for their power within six months of approval and that they include an agreement with grid operators to connect to the grid in their permit application. In a red-line document supplied by Frey NextEra asked that both of those provisions be struck from the ordinance entirely.

Pierce said that while he supported the moratorium in Mercer County two years ago he viewed it as a short-term solution. The reality is that many people place a premium on the green energy produced by wind turbines and his county has the opportunity to create a “blueprint” for how coal and renewable energy can work together.

“A wind ordinance that nobody likes in its entirety"" but which provides a road map for the two industries going forward ""probably will end up being a good ordinance” he said.

The United States is by far the world’s largest producer of nuclear energy. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency active nuclear power plants in the US have the capacity to generate 95.5 gigawatts of electricity annually. In France the world’s second largest producer of nuclear energy production capacity totals just 61.4 gigawatts.

All told nuclear power plants account for about 19% of total electricity production nationwide. While nuclear power is a critical component of the American power grid some states rely more on nuclear energy than others. Over a quarter of the 93 active nuclear reactors in the United States are concentrated in just three states. Meanwhile nearly half of all states have no active nuclear power plants. (This is how much renewable energy your state produces.)

Using data from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission 24/7 Wall St identified the states that are home to the most nuclear reactors. States with the same number of nuclear reactors are listed alphabetically.

Among the 28 states on this list six have just one active nuclear reactor and seven have only two. Meanwhile three states have more than five. Generally states without any nuclear power plants produce electricity through native natural resources. Much of the power consumed in West Virginia for example is generated through coal-burning plants while some Great Plains states like Iowa rely heavily on wind farms. (These are the US wind farms generating the most electricity.)

Though nuclear energy is by far the most reliable and efficient power source available and produces no carbon pollution it is not without drawbacks. Nuclear power plants generate nuclear waste which cannot be destroyed and requires long-term storage. Additionally as accidents at the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine in 1986 and the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011 – not to mention our own Three Mile Island partial core meltdown in 1979 – have demonstrated malfunctions can be catastrophic. Nuclear power plants also have high-startup costs which can reduce their economic competitiveness.

Cathy Davenport Dean of Admissions believes there are many contributing factors to this large applicant pool. She credits Dickinson’s enrollment team who used strategies introduced during the pandemic and practices used before the COVID-19 pandemic to stay engaged with prospective students and show them everything that Dickinson College has to offer.

In 2020 the pandemic forced Dickinson’s enrollment team to develop a new form of virtual programming to connect with potential applicants such as Zoom information sessions covering a variety of topics and livestreamed tours led by student tour guides. The admissions team continued hosting these events even as prospective students were allowed to visit campus in-person again. On-campus visits also brought back in-person information sessions student-led tours and recruitment visits with coaches that prospective students and their families can experience. Davenport also stressed the importance of personalized messaging and the involvement of the enrollment team who are there to assist the families and prospective students at every step of the journey.

According to Davenport Dickinson’s admissions team also works closely with the Marketing and Communications department “so that Dickinson’s name is more broadly known – capturing and communicating the Dickinson brand the Dickinson experience and the strong outcomes of a Dickinson education in everything from print and electronic communications to photography and videos and on social media platforms.” Though this process is time-intensive she believes it may have contributed to the growth in applications and hopes that by continuing these practices in the future the applicant pools will continue to be robust moving forward.

Davenport explains that contrary to common perceptions the class of 2026 will not have many gap year students with only 15 students entering after a gap year in comparison to the 51 gap year students in the class of 2025. She expects that the college will meet the class of 2026’s enrollment goal of 600 students. Current students may have noticed an increase in campus tours the past few weeks which Davenport notes that “while many are newly accepted members of the class of 2026 the majority of visitors over the past two weeks have been high school juniors who are taking advantage of their spring breaks to begin the college search process.”

Luka Dubnick ‘23 a member of the Liberty Cap society of tour guides believes that the on-campus admissions events are a wonderful way to show prospective students the true Dickinson experience. He expressed his excitement for Accepted Students Day on April 8th and April 9th which occurs during Dickinson’s annual Red and White Day that celebrates Dickinson Athletics. Dubnick believes that the combination of these events will allow accepted and admitted students to have “a more authentic Dickinson experience” and the chance to be immersed in the Dickinson community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYWJkdWN0ZWQtZ2VvcmdpYS10b2RkbGVyLXNhZmUtZmF0aGVyLWNoYXJnZWQtd2l0aC1raWRuYXBwaW5nLWtpbGxpbmctY2hpbGQtcy1tb3RoZXIvYXJ0aWNsZV9mZWQ4ZDI5NC00NDk1LTUzZmMtYjAwMC1kY2NhYThkM2E4NDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abducted Georgia toddler safe; father charged with kidnapping killing child's mother,A man shot a would-be thief who was spotted trying to steal his car after he left it running in his driveway early Monday according to police and KIRO-TV.

Senior figures called for an urgent plan to plug staff shortages after data seen by the Observer revealed that sick leave related to mental health had increased each year since 2017 spiking through the pandemic.

MPs warned that staff were at “breaking point” and there was no clear plan to relieve the pressure on them. Some doctors warned of the lasting impact on their colleagues of having to deal with the pandemic.

Intense pressure on staff is set to continue after it emerged last week that the number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment had risen to the highest level since records began 15 years ago.

Data from 67 NHS hospital trusts released under the Freedom of Information Act found that there had been the equivalent of 22718 years of mental health sick days since 2017.

More than 2.2m days came last year as staff continued to battle through the pandemic on top of huge treatment backlogs and overrun A&E departments. It is estimated that there are 110000 vacancies across the NHS with trust leaders repeatedly warning that there are no robust plans to ensure shortages are filled.

Dr Thomas Dolphin a consultant anaesthetist who sits on the BMA’s consultants committee said mental strains were most acute at the start of the pandemic when staff struggled with limited PPE. However he said the crisis exposed serious underlying problems. “There was the relentlessness of the banal horror of it – having to watch people dying in such horrible circumstances unable to see their loved ones” he said. “To be fair to the hospitals there was a big focus on staff welfare. But it wasn’t enough because this exposed understaffing in the NHS that’s been going on for a long long time.

“We brutalised our staff for months on end. Then not surprisingly quite a lot of them have left or retired or moved to another country as soon as they could because it was soul-destroying. Now we’re in a position where we’re even more short staffed. The consequence is in those [mental health absence] numbers.”

He said that allowing more staff to work reduced hours could help.

Stephen Jones professional lead for mental health at the Royal College of Nursing said many nurses felt guilt at not being able to do more for patients. “Many are on the verge of leaving our profession for ever” he said. “We want employers to work with us to make sure staff are rested have breaks and look after themselves so they can look after patients better.”

Miriam Deakin director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts said there remained an “enormous strain on people right across the health and care system”. She added: “Just 27% of people working in the NHS feel that there are enough staff in their organisation to allow them to do their jobs properly. More than half of ambulance workers said they felt unwell due to work-related stress in the last year.

“Rising demand and persistent workforce shortages are leaving staff with unsustainably high workloads. As much as trust leaders work to ensure the wellbeing of their staff supporting personal resilience while operating with these constraints can go only so far.”

Daisy Cooper the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson who submitted the data requests said that a host of improvements were needed to help staff including dealing with the underlying problem of an overstretched workforce.

“These staggering figures show the NHS is facing a tidal wave of mental health-related absences” she said. “This must be a wake-up call to this Conservative government that they can’t turn a blind eye to this crisis any longer. Sajid Javid needs to come up with a clear plan to support NHS staff starting by fixing chronic staffing shortages and reducing unsustainable workloads.”

The data released by hospitals suggested the mental health problems were spread across the service with the biggest trusts reporting the highest numbers of days lost.

Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust one of England’s biggest with 10 hospitals recorded 591254 working days lost to mental illness over the last five years.

The Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust two other large trusts recorded 555798 and 401417 sick days respectively. All three trusts said they had comprehensive mental health support for staff in place.

A spokesperson for Manchester University NHS foundation trust said support included a comprehensive employee health and wellbeing service a dedicated 24/7 employee assistance programme online resources and mental health first aiders.

Nicky Clarke chief of people at the Northern Care Alliance NHS foundation trust said staff had shown “remarkable resilience” throughout the pandemic with a new wellbeing programme launched in 2020.

Jenny Lewis of Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust said not all mental health leave was work-related and reiterated that large trusts had higher absence figures adding: “We have done a lot of work with staff to remove the stigma associated with mental health so that we can better support our people.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We know the NHS has been under unprecedented pressure and supporting the mental health and wellbeing of NHS staff is a priority.

“We’ve invested £37m this year to fund 40 staff mental health hubs nationwide that sit alongside a dedicated helpline and 24/7 text support services. We have record numbers of staff including over 4200 more doctors and over 12100 more nurses compared with January 2021.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vbGFjay1vZi1zcG9uc29ycy1wb29yLWZhY2lsaXRpZXMtdW5kZXJtaW5lLXNwb3J0cy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1pbi1ub3J0aGVybi1uaWdlcmlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lack of sponsors poor facilities undermine sports development in northern Nigeria,"By David Ngobua Salim Umar Ibrahim (Kano) Dickson S. Adama (Jos) Abdulkadir Shehu (Kaduna) & Abdulkareem Mumuni (Ilorin)

At the moment there is no doubt that there is a huge gap in sports development between southern and northern Nigeria. This has become a worrisome trend especially in view of the fact that the North is also blessed with abundant talents who are only waiting to be discovered and nurtured to stardom.

Unfortunately while their southern counterparts appear to have embraced sports as lucrative business and given it the necessary public and private sector support to thrive it is clear that most states in the North are yet to give adequate attention to the sector.

It is said that this is partly the reason most of the national teams in Nigeria are dominated by players from the South.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to find extraordinary athletes like the Kaduna- born Miriam Usman who dominated women weightlifting in the 75kg. She was national African and Commonwealth champion as well as Olympics silver medalist.

Legendary footballers like Ismaila Mabo Sam Garba Okoye Baba Otu Garba Lawal Tijani Babangida Dahiru Sadi Heyman Abdullahi Patrick Pascal and a host of others are some of the stars that shone brightly from the North

The story of sports in the North is that of lack of sporting facilities and motivation. The account of a young sprinter from Kaduna State Suraj Habib who had to relocate from Zaria to Lagos to pursue his dreams of becoming a household name in athletics underscores the fact that talents abound in the North. Unfortunately they are being held down by unavailability of facilities and training opportunities.

Speaking to Making of Champions the first professional athletics club in Nigeria Habib said “It was a big step relocating from Zaria to Lagos because since I was born I had never been away from my family for more than a week.

“I found it very challenging because my family is a big one and everybody loves me. I am very close to my mum and support her a lot but I just said let me come here and see what I can make of myself because if I were to remain in Zaria I may not have as much support to travel for competitions and so on as I am experiencing here. So I had to leave home to chase my dreams.”

Habib may go on to realise his dream because of his bravery but many of his kinsmen some of who are even more talented may waste away because they don’t have the opportunity to move out; and the support and facilities they need to flourish are not easily available at home.

It is also an open secret that most of the sporting facilities in Nigeria are found in the southern part of the country. Although in order to encourage overall sports development in the country the federal government provided a stadium in each of the six-geo political zones states in the South usually go the extra mile to provide additional facilities for use by their teeming youths who are passionate about sports.

Most of the sports administrators in the North who spoke to Daily Trust on Sunday on the declining fortunes of sports in the region blamed the unfortunate situation on a number of factors including the non-availability of standard facilities lack of sponsorship as well as socio-cultural and religious inhibitions.

Speaking on why the North is no longer producing notable sportsmen and women the Commissioner for Youths and Sports Development in Kano State Kabiru Ado Lakwaya said the region was lagging behind due to lack of facilities qualified personnel and inadequate competitions.

He said “If you are talking about sports development you are talking about the three parameters: personnel facilities and competition.

“Facilities take 70 to 85 per cent of sports development. But if you look at the whole North we don’t have enough facilities to accommodate the different games. For instance we have only two standard swimming pools in Kaduna and Bauchi states. The remaining 17 states in the North have no swimming pool. How can we develop swimming in these states?

“In athletics only few states in the North have standard tracks. You can find tracks in states like Kano Bauchi Benue and Kaduna. If there is a competition in athletics how do you think the North would fare?”

Lakwaya also said another problem of sports development in the North was lack of trained coaches to harness abundant talents.

He said that most times states in the region depended on athletes from southern states to represent them especially in football.

“There is dearth of qualified coaches in the North so professional football clubs go to the South to hire coaches and players instead of developing our talents” added.

The commissioner concluded by saying that the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development’s zonal offices in Kaduna Bauchi and Jos had not done enough in organising competitions for the youth in the North. He said that without regular competitions sports would not grow.

To bridge the existing gap the Kano State Director of Sports Bashari Ahmad Maizare said states should pay more attention to facilities development training of coaches and regular competitions for athletes to develop their skills.

“Sports ministries should be assigned to technocrats with passion for the development of the sector. There is the urgent need to assign sports administration to capable hands who can bring the needed changes” he said.

In his contribution the Director of Sports Development in the Kaduna State Ministry of Sports Ibrahim Yakubu said his state was not lagging behind insisting that in recent times Kaduna has been a dominant force in sports like hockey volleyball and cricket.

He however agreed that the state is not doing particularly well in some games which he blamed on lack of sponsorship.

According to him states like Lagos Edo and Delta usually have sponsors a situation that makes it easy for them to continue to excel.

“States in the North are struggling to develop sports because we don’t enjoy corporate sponsorship. This is a major setback for us.

“Here in the North a lot of people are not enlightened in the area of sports sponsorship. There is the urgent need to sensitise them. There are so many philanthropists who can sponsor sports but they are not well informed” he said.

He therefore said that to close the gap between the South and North in terms of sports development well-meaning people in the North must be educated on the importance of sports and be encouraged to sponsor sporting activities.

“There are so many companies in the South that sponsor sports. But in the North we don’t have such types of companies or industries we can approach for sponsorship. Without sponsors it will be difficult to develop sports” he reiterated.

Mallam Bolakale Adisa Mogaji the executive chairman of the Kwara State Sports Commission blamed the unfortunate situation on socio-cultural and religious beliefs. He also said southern states were fond of poaching athletes from the North.

He said “There is more awareness in the South. It is only recently that our daughters are allowed to participate in sports in Kwara State; and they are not doing badly. But in some northern states you can hardly see female athletes. This has to do with religion culture and traditional beliefs. Down South they don’t take all these things seriously. And the most standard facilities are found in the South.

“Then there is the problem of sponsorship. Some states in the North don’t put so much money into sports; but again we are lucky in Kwara. Our government is doing well and there are results to point at. I pray that other states in the North would have our kind of awareness.”

He also lamented that most states in the North concentrate on football to the detriment of other sports. According to him less attention is being paid to sports like volleyball handball hockey cricket rugby and others.

On the issue of brain drain Magaji said “Edo Delta Rivers and others are used to poaching athletes from rival states. Other states suffer to produce their athletes but when they mature they are poached by richer states like Edo Delta and Rivers.”

The Commissioner for Youths and Sports in Plateau State Victor Lapan said the problem of sports development in the North could be attributed to the sharp decline in the education sector.

He said that in the past sporting activities were developed right from the schools where there were dedicated periods for games like handball football athletics shot-put badminton and a host of others.

Lapan lamented that these days such sports are hardly found in schools and this has affected sports development in the region.

He blamed the unfortunate situation on the government that took over most of the schools founded and managed by missionaries who paid attention to sports development in their schools.

Lapan also said that apart from insecurity which is ravaging the North disparity in federal government allocation to southern and northern states was another reason as states with higher allocations had more funds to develop sports.

In addition he alleged that some southern states even use their funds to poach or entice athletes from the North to represent them at national or international competitions.

He concluded that Plateau State was one of the casualties of poaching.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5vcnRoZXJuZWNoby5jby51ay9uZXdzLzIwMDcxODI4LnN0YWlubW9yZS1zaWduLXRvcC1yYWlsd2F5LXdvcmxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The sign on top of the railway world,"A great battle was fought on Stainmore in 954AD for control of Northumbria and Erik Bloodaxe the local king was killed and buried beneath a stone cross the remains of which can still be seen in a layby beside the A66.

And then the railway powered its way over the top opening on July 4 1861. It marked its achievement by placing a metal sign on the summit which included the vital piece of information that it was 1370ft above sea level – the highest point any railway in England reached.

The Stainmore summit. Picture: Mark Keefe

Initially there were timber signs which celebrated the conquering of the summit but in the late 1920s or early 1930s the London & North Eastern Railway replaced them with metal signs.

This seems to coincide with other metal signs being placed beside the East Coast Main Line by the LNER – one marks the Stockton & Darlington Railway and another beside the Tees Viaduct at Croft-on-Tees points out the distances to London and Edinburgh.

A sign from the same era beside the mainline in Darlington

But the railway over Stainmore which ran from Darlington to Tebay closed on January 20 1962. The tracks were lifted with indecent haste the extraordinary viaducts were blown up and pulled down and the summit signs were cut down. One went to the National Railway Museum in York and the other to the Head of Steam museum in Darlington.

So although the places where the Romans rested and where Erik Bloodaxe met his bloody end were commemorated the triumph of the railways in conquering the Pennines went unmarked.

“For the 150th anniversary of the opening of the railway in 2011 one of the ideas we came up with was to get a replica sign installed” says Mark Keefe a volunteer at the Stainmore Railway Company which this weekend is holding its Easter Rally. “We raised £5000 and got it laser-cut and when it was delivered to us I was given the project of getting it up.”

The Keefes set to work on the new sign. Picture: Brian Wastell

Mark and his wife Sue and his daughter Ellie painted the sign and with other volunteers including Willie Steele who farms in the area managed to get it in place. Brian Wastell of Darlington was on hand and he has kindly sent us in some pictures of it going up.

“It isn’t far away from the spot where the original one was” says Mark whose grandfather and uncle were among the protestors against the line’s closure when the last train went through in 1962 although he wasn’t born. “We parked up in the A66 layby climbed onto the moors where there are a couple of water gulleys and a round sheep pen from which we could just about work out the right point for it.”

And so once again from the Romans to the railways there was a full compliment of markers up on the summit.

In the early 1990s when the A66 was widened the Rey Cross was lifted and archaeologists were very disappointed when the could not locate the remains of Erik Bloodaxe who supposedly slept beneath the stone. The best guess now is that he lies somewhere out on the fell…

The signalbox on Stainmore was surrounded by sidings and some cottages were nearby for summitworkers

MEMORIES 566 mentioned Stainmore summit as we learned that Cllr Heather Scott the leader of Darlington council had grown up in one of the four “summitworkers” cottages that were near the signalbox at the very top of the railway world.

Now there is only the remote sign to remind us that the railways ever conquered the Pennines but once this was an important line taking Durham coal and coke to fire Cumbrian industry and then bringing back high quality iron ore for the blast furnaces of Teesside.

Up on the summit there were wide sidings controlled by the signalbox and engines could fill up with water which came from the Summit Reservoir which had been dug high on the moors of Moudy Mea to the south – even here the railway was beaten by the Romans as there are the remains of a signalling station on Moudy Mea.

Railway historian Ken Hoole tells how at the end of the 19th Century “the line over Stainmore was a busy one with mineral trains running night and day raising the echoes across the moors as they blasted their way up to the summit or rumbled slowly over the viaducts.

“The first mineral train of the day left West Auckland at 12.20am due at Summit Cabin at 2.24am and the last left at 10.30pm and reached Summit at 12.58am.

“There were six passenger trains in each direction ‘over the top’ all of which started or terminated at Darlington.”

In the 1930s there was an additional unpublicised passenger train every second Friday. It carried 150 miners who had been injured at work to convalesce in the Durham Miners’ Association’s Conishead Priory at Morecombe Bay.

Indeed the line over Stainmore had many happy holiday associations for the working people of the North East as it took them on the annual excursion to Blackpool.

There were though not enough year-round passengers to make the line pay and although there was a concerted campaign to keep it open the Minister of Transport announced on December 7 1961 that it could close. British Railways moved with amazing speed and announced that the last trains would be on January 20 1962.

The finale of the line was expected to be a scheduled diesel train but the Railway Correspondence & Travel Society ran a special steam-hauled train for the occasion from Darlington to Tebay with photographic stops at Kirkby Stephen East and Ravenstonedale.

“Those onboard were told that although they would be stopping at Stainmore Summit no one was to get off” says Mark Keefe “but as one chap told me: ‘Once the first 200 folk jumped off the rest just followed!’.”

THE Cumbria Easter Rally is on Easter Saturday and Easter Sunday April 16 and 17 and features vintage buses vans wagons cars tractors and commercial vehicles plus there are craft and food fayres and the Kirkby Stephen East station will be open although no trains will be running. It is a massive event that is centred on Kirkby Stephen but also includes neighbouring settlements like Brough and Winton. If you go over make sure you wave at the Stainmore summit sign as you go past. It is clearly visible on the south side of the A66 just before you begin the impressive descent into Cumbria.

The almajiri system of education is predominantly practised in northern Nigeria and has remained a source of concern for those who mean well for the region.

Most of the pupils called almajiri are young children between the ages of 5 and 17 sent out of their homes by their parents in search of Islamic knowledge.

However ample studies have shown that rather than acquire the knowledge of the Qur’an and jurisprudence most of the pupils who later transform into adults while rooming the streets rarely acquire the requisite knowledge worthy enough to make them useful to themselves and the society.

Experts believe that although the system worked several decades ago it is now a breeding ground for delinquent children and an escapist tool for lazy parents who don’t want to take responsibility of their children.

Governors of the northern states are also being accused of being indifferent about the plight of the young almajirai who to a greater extent are now recruitment harbour for men of the underworld.

For decades meetings policies and ‘punitive’ measures put in place at the local and state levels rarely made any difference in addressing the menace as parents keep sending their children through some clerics.

In most cases the children cater for their needs in such tsangaya schools or makarantun Allo.

For instance they beg for alms food and clothes and in most instances “feed” their teachers with the morsels they get.

Jonathan’s intervention

It was in the midst of what to do with the increasing number of almajirai that the federal government led by former President Goodluck Jonathan began constructing model tsangaya/almajiri schools across the country as part of the Almajiri Education Programme.

Those in charge of the initiative at the time said it was done to help the almajirci system become more mainstream in basic education.

However years after Jonathan has gone experts believe the initiative has flopped because the federal government left the concept to states that were right from the beginning not bothered about resolving the problem around almajirci.

Also most of the clerics championing the karatun allo were evidently reluctant to key into the initiative which would have paved the way for the children to learn both Qur’anic and western education under one roof.

Daily Trust Saturday reports that the Jonathan administration spent about N15billion to build no fewer than 157 tsangaya model schools across the northern states which are now sadly in a poor state due to poor maintenance funding and acceptability by those they are meant for.

According to a response to a Daily Trust Saturday enquiry from the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) on April 4 2022 the commission constructed equipped and handed over the 157 model almajiri schools to states.

It showed that Gombe State for instance has at least five of such schools Katsina 10 Kano 12 and Niger 10.

However an investigation by our reporter found that most of the schools are in bad shape even as many of them are struggling to remain afloat.

Learning infrastructures in the schools are fast deteriorating at a time when the menace of out-of-school children is on the rise.

The Minister of State for Education Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba said last year that Nigeria had the highest number of out-of-school children in sub-Saharan Africa putting the estimated figure at 10.1million children.

The figure grew by 400000 according to a report by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) on January 24 2022 released to mark the International Day of Education.

The report issued by the communication specialist at the UNICEF Nigeria Geoffrey Njoku stated “At least 10.5million children are out of school in Nigeria – the highest rate in the world. A full one-third of Nigerian children are not in school; and one in five out-of-school children in the world is Nigerian.”

These children who are of school age according to the Compulsory Free Universal Basic Education Act of 2004 have the right to be educated.

It stipulates that these children must attend a six-year primary school and another three years for junior secondary education. It was the Act that established the UBEC the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and the Local Government Education Authority (LGEA).

More so the revelation on the condition of the tsangaya schools which are meant to bridge the gap indicates a huge delay in the transition of the initiative.

Findings revealed that it was only in 2021 that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration moved to modify the strategy according to disclosures by the Presidential Steering Committee on Alternate School Programmes.

The UBEC has a specialised department called the Department of Tsangaya (Almajiri) Education Programme to address the problems of out-of-school children especially on basic education.

Although the UBEC stated on its website that the almajiri schools were handed over to respective Universal Basic Education Boards (SUBEBs) in states some chief functions of the UBEC according to its mandate inspired this report.

The UBEC has the mandate to coordinate the activities of SUBEBs that are related to the Tsangaya Education Programme; and it is vested with the mandate to collect collate and report the status of tsangaya model schools to the UBEC management.

Only one teacher in Daura tsangaya

Although the structures at the Daura Almajiri Model School in Katsina State are still being utilised for the tsangaya and a section for Islamiyya other facilities are no longer available.

According to observations the dormitory where the almajirai sleep has only bunk beds without mattresses or blankets for the pupils to use.

There are only scanty mats and mosquito nets in the dormitory of the school originally meant to be a boarding house.

Some of the pupils said the chairs were taken to the Islamiyya section which was not part of the school design leaving the almajirai in the tsangaya section to sit on the floor.

However some of the almajirai said they were happy being in the school as they felt they were better than their counterparts roaming the streets.

Malam Isah Musa an assistant teacher who has spent six years in the school said he was made an assistant teacher after he became the most senior almajiri (or pupil) in the school.

“In terms of feeding those of us who have means of income cater for themselves while the younger ones beg for food like any other almajiri” he said.

He appealed to the government to assist them with blankets and mats for the over 70 pupils in the school.

The pupils on their part asked for more teachers as findings revealed that there is only one teacher in the school called Malam Sulaiman Umar.

Speaking on how they are faring Malam Umar said they were trying to manage what they had and dismissed rumours of a school feeding programme in place.

“The only time we came close to that was when some huge cooking pots and other utensils were brought just like in conventional boarding schools. I was not there when they brought and offloaded them in my office and I was not there also when they took them away” he said.

Umar lamented that his N5 000 monthly allowance would not come regularly even as it had been slashed to N2500 by the authorities.

Teething problems in Gombe

In Gombe town where there is the Sheikh Muhammadu Almajiri Memorial School around the Malam Inna area the pupils are left to feed themselves; and they don’t have enough space to sleep despite the school being designated as boarding.

The school established in 2013 has two-block classrooms two hostel blocks two staff rooms a headmaster’s office a kitchen a dining hall and a borehole.

Daily Trust Saturday observed that there are two cleaners security personnel and three cooks.

There are about 20 N-Power volunteers two LEA permanent teachers and other volunteers in the school.

The school headmaster Malam Zakariya’u Muhammad Basakkwace said when the government handed over the school to their father the late Malam Muhammadu Basakkwace there was a pledge that it would be providing foodstuff and other essential materials for its effective running.

He added that cooking utensils were provided and three female cooks were employed but for the past seven years they have never cooked anything there as the cooking utensils rust in the store.

And since it is a boarding school the head teacher said parents had been left with the responsibility of providing food and the upkeep for their children.

On the facilities he said the hostel block and the classrooms were also becoming inadequate for the pupils whose age bracket is between six and 13 years.

“The initial two blocks of classrooms meant for 50 pupils now accommodate about 480 pupils with some of them taking lessons under a tree” he said.

Findings revealed that the N1000 termly levy for running the school is also discouraging some parents from enrolling their children.

“It is a challenge as most parents are reluctant to pay the fees” Basakkwace said adding that he is trying to expand the school to enroll children of neighbours.

Malam Idris Muhammad a teacher in the school said they were the best despite the poor welfare and inadequate attention from the government.

“We have students from all the six North East states and others from as far as Sokoto Katsina and Kano” he said.

A 17-year-old Rabilu Mukhtari said his father enrolled him in the school because of the combination of Islamic and western education.

Mukhtari praised the teachers for their dedication but decried lack of feeding.

For Salim Habibu a 15-year-old boy from Mubi in Adamawa State apart from the lack of feeding the congestion and poor hygiene in the toilets are a source of concern.

“While the hostel is not enough for our large number feeding is a major challenge. At times we eat food once a day and the school has banned us from going out to beg or search for food” he said.

Muhammad Bello 16 said he had already completed the Qur’an recitation within four years of his enrolment and had started memorization which he hopes to conclude within the next two years.

In Niger community converts tsangaya into western school

In Niger State there are about seven integrated basic Qur’anic education centres located in Suleja Mokwa Kontagora Bida Gurbin-Boka Zarumai and around 123 quarters in Minna the state capital.

Malam Hudu Danjuma who is the coordinator of education quality assurance in charge of the Suleja zone said most of the almajiri schools had become a shadow of themselves due to lack of acceptance by the original teachers who blocked pupils from enrolling in the schools when they took off.

“There were quarters built for the teachers but they refused to relocate” he said.

At the Suleja Almajiri Model Centre Daily Trust Saturday observed that the pupils have vacated the school as members of a nearby community adopted it as a primary school for their wards.

Malam Abubakar Yahaya the centre’s head teacher near Pangamu community in Suleja town said it was commissioned in May 2014 and was integrated as one of those almajiri schools of the federal government.

Yahaya said the centre initially had 80 pupils but the figure rose to 193.

A visit to the school showed that although there are six dormitories it does not operate as a boarding facility due to a lack of beds and mattresses since it took off.

In the classrooms there are not enough desks; hence mats have become the alternative.

A level three pupil Abdulkadir Abdullahi said his interest in the school stemmed from its dual learning system – Islamic and western education.

And for Sulaiman Ahmad another pupil the school feeding (morning and afternoon) is a good attraction that must be sustained by the community.

Daily Trust Saturday learnt of a World Bank-assisted education programme for the tsangaya schools in the state. The programme is called Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) and was launched in November 2019.

The head of Social Mobilisation in Local Education Authority Suleja Council Malam Ishaq Ibrahim said teachers employed by the state in conventional schools go to the 14 tsangaya schools within Suleja town to give two-hour lessons to the pupils on Thursdays and Fridays on N10 000 monthly allowance.

A day with tsangaya pupils in Kano

The Model Day Tsangaya Primary School in Bichi town in Kano State has over 200 pupils. The school’s signpost indicates that it is a boarding school but the reverse is the case.

The school is said to be under the care of the Kano State Qur’anic and Islamiyya Schools Management Board.

A teacher in the school who gave his name as Yusuf said the system allowed the pupils to study conventional western education from morning to noon then study Qur’an from noon to evening between Monday and Friday.

Another teacher called Musa said teachers’ welfare was fair just as their counterparts in other public schools in the state.

Murtala Amadu Kabagiwa a 12-year pupil said he dreaded Saturdays and Sundays because there won’t be classes; hence no feeding.

“We eat rice and beans to our satisfaction during school days. We play with our friends and study. I hate Saturdays and Sundays because it means no school for us and no rice and beans” he said.

Another pupil Musa Jafaru who said he was 14 years old said he was initially taken to Katsina for Qur’anic studies but was brought back to Bichi and enrolled in the school.

“I don’t go out to beg for food here. And I stay with my parents that is why I prefer here to the school in Katsina. No one calls me almajiri here.”

A resident Malam Adamu Abdullahi said if not for the school the children would have been elsewhere roaming the streets begging.

Good policy faulty implementation – Experts

Malam Muhammad Ishaq a tsangaya school teacher in Maiduguri Borno State said the modernised concept could not be accepted by many clerics because they were not carried along from the beginning.

“There was serious mutual suspicion at the beginning because some of the tsangaya teachers believed their pupils would be taken away from them.

“Another problem is that some of the teachers have a different perception about moving into formal-like schools. They prefer to set bonfires at night while the children sit around it.

“I know the concept would have sailed through had it been the government got the support to the clerics in their domains” he said.

An educationist Mr John Ejeh said the almajiri school system was a well thought out system but lamented that it was being driven by a faulty implementation strategy.

He said “It is not just about the UBEC building structures it should have been about sustaining the system; I don’t think that was done.

“You are trying to promote education and tackle the prevalence of street children and you just built schools to give to states who do not demonstrate any commitment to this. How do you think this will ever work?” Eje wondered.

Other experts argued that the federal government could have made the almajiri or tsangaya school system part of the unity schools nationwide to make them sustainable.

Another educationist in Abuja Mr Thomas Okon said “You can hardly hear of this perennial complaint of negligence across the over 100 unity schools because there is a full-scale budget by the Federal Ministry of Education.

“If they were sincere right from the start they should have included the running of the school in the national budget just like the unity schools” he said.

On what the UBEC should do the experts said the commission should fully take over the schools.

UBEC blames states starts new strategy

When contacted the programme coordinator Integrated Qur’anic Tsangaya Education (IQTE) at the UBEC Malam Ibrahim Yusuf insisted that the provision of basic education was the responsibility of states and local governments noting that the federal government through the UBEC was only assisting the states and local governments with such interventions.

Yusuf who spoke on behalf of the executive secretary of the UBEC Dr Hamid Bobboyi explained that the commission had a pact with the states saying the states were expected to deploy both teaching and non-teaching staff enrolment of learners maintain the schools among others.

“It was however discovered that the states did not only default on the provisions of the memorandum of understanding some of them converted the schools to other uses while others did not put them to use at all.

“The commission responded to these developments by changing its strategies for intervening in the education of almajiri children” he said.

Yusuf further disclosed that there was a new strategy for IQTE intervention with proprietors (alarammomi) engaged to plan and implement the programme.

“I am glad to inform you that this new approach is yielding the desired objectives” he noted.

Confirming the problems of poor facilities poor welfare and other issues observed during this paper’s investigation the UBEC official said the new strategy ensured that the proprietors of almajiri schools would build two classrooms and rehabilitate existing ones while the UBEC trains the proprietors and provides instructional materials and public enlightenment on the schools across communities.

“The teachers are to be provided by SUBEBS while UBEC assists the centres through the Federal Teachers’ Scheme (FTS) funded by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)” he said.

He also said the strategy “addresses the feeding problems of the almajirai which we hope the states would do a lot to help in this case” as well as skills development (vocational) training for older pupils. Some of the tsangaya centres will get agricultural projects assistance so that they can farm and provide food for the pupils.

The Coca-Cola Company Began As An Experiment

The Coca-Cola Company that is today a multinational company was a product of an experiment by American pharmacist Dr. John Stith Pemberton in 1886. Coca-Cola however was incorporated as The Coca-Cola Company in 1892 in Atlanta by Asa Griggs Candler and is currently a public company owned by different individuals and organizations around the world.

How It Was Founded

John Stith Pemberton (July 8 1831 – August 16 1888) was an American Confederate States Army veteran and pharmacist. He is famous for his creation of the original recipe used in the production of coca-cola in 1886. The recipe came from an experiment he began in search of a treatment for his morphine addiction. He had sustained a saber injury to his chest during the battle of Columbus and was using morphine to alleviate his pains but got addicted to it. His plans to create an alcoholic beverage that could serve as an alternative to morphine without containing morphine were thwarted by the Atlanta and Fulton County temperance legislation in 1886.

Prior to the legislation he had created the “Dr. Tuggle Compound Syrup of Globe Flower” using extracts from a toxic plant called buttonbush and also “Pemberton French Wine Coca” created from coca damiana and kola nut. With the temperance legislation in effect Dr. Pemberton decided to develop a non-alcoholic variation of his French Wine Coca which became the renowned Coca-Cola recipe. He enlisted the help of Willis E. Venable an Atlanta drugstore owner while developing and testing this recipe.

The accidental mixing of the concentrated syrup with carbonated water resulted in the creation of the iconic Coca-Cola carbonated drink. Although the experiment did not turn out to be the medicinal alternative to morphine as he had hoped Dr. Pemberton still saw business potential in his accidental creation. This non-alcoholic beverage was sold as nameless fountain drinks until Dr. Pemberton’s staff Frank Mason Robinson inspired by the key ingredients in the recipe which are coca and kola nut came up with the name “Coca-Cola”.

Dr. Pemberton fell ill soon after Coca-Cola made its market debut and was unable to manage and finance the business. In a desperate bid to ensure the continuity of his Coca-Cola legacy and also pressure from his son who was more interested in money than carrying on with his father’s dream of making Coca-Cola a global success the patent for Coca-Cola was sold in 1888 to another pharmacist named Asa Griggs Candler for an estimated $1750. Dr. Pemberton died in August 1888 before Coca-Cola was incorporated. His only child and heir passed away six years later bringing an end to the Pemberton family’s hold on the Coca-Cola brand.

Carrying on The Coca-Cola Legacy

While John Pemberton started the Coca-Cola brand Coca-Cola as a corporation was founded by Asa Griggs Candler. Candler incorporated the brand as The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892. The company was valued at about $100000 at this time. In 1893 he trademarked the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola was being sold in every state of the confederate union by 1895. Candler’s success was attributed to his use of merchandising in his advertising strategies. The company witnessed exponential growth under Candler’s leadership with sales rising from about 9000 gallons of syrup in 1890 to about 370800 gallons in 1900.

The company went from selling syrups in gallons to having its brand in ready-to-drink bottles in 1899 through an agreement with an independent bottling company. This agreement allowed the bottling company to produce bottle and sell beverages under the brand name Coca-Cola. Despite being a huge success The Coca-Cola Company sold to the Trust Company of Georgia owned by Ernest Woodruff in 1919 for an estimated $25 million.

Woodruff’s son Robert Winship Woodruff headed the company as president and chairman from 1923–1955. Meanwhile on 26 August 1919 Coca-Cola was listed for trading on The New York Stock Exchange as a public company with its stock selling for $40 per share. In 1920 the company made its first stock dividend payment to shareholders.

Since then the company has remained the market leader of the soft drink industry. It is the most widely recognized brand in the world as proven by a study carried out by Business Insider which revealed that 94% of people all over the world recognize Coca-Cola’s red and white logo. However the survival of the beverage company is threatened by the continuous increase in health-conscious consumers and less access to water resources.

Notable Mergers and Acquisitions

As a public company Coca-Cola had the financial base to expand its frontiers. This meant that it was able to partner with companies with shared interests and the acquisition of companies and brands struggling in the market. One of these acquisitions happened in 1960 when Coca-Cola took over Minute Maid for an amount that was not disclosed.

In 1982 it made its first non-food asset acquisition when it bought the film studio Columbia Pictures for the sum of $692 million. While it was the owner of the studio Columbia released several hit movies such as The Karate Kid Ghostbusters and Stripes among many others. However Sony later acquired it in 1989 for $3 billion.

In 1993 the number one beverage brand acquired Thums Up an Indian brand of cola and two years later it also acquired Barq’s. The company went on to buy half of the shares of Inca Kola in 1999 for $200 million and eventually took over the brand’s marketing and promotion overseas. In 2001 it parted with $181 million to purchase the brand of smoothies fruit juices and bars known as Odwalla but subsequently announced the brand’s discontinuation in 2020.

In 2007 Coca-Cola acquired Fuze Beverage from its founders for about $250 million. In 2008 it bought a 40% stake in Honest Tea for $43 million and in 2011 it purchased the remaining 60% stake. Two years after the company purchased a coconut water company named ZICO for an undisclosed amount and also spent $2.15 billion to acquire a 16.7% stake in Monster in August 2014 with an option of increasing it to 25%.

The company bought a minority stake in Suja Life LLC a juice manufacturing company in 2015 and on the 30th of January 2016 it acquired a 40% stake in Chi Ltd. Exactly three years later it purchased the 60% stake left in Chi Ltd. Meanwhile in December 2016 it also acquired several of former SABMiller’s Coca-Cola operations. It went on to buy Topo Chico a Mexican brand of sparkling water in 2017 and on the 31st of August 2018 it reached an agreement with Whitebread to acquire Costa Coffee. The deal was eventually concluded on January 3 2019 with Coca-Cola parting with £3.9bn.

Also in August 2018 an undisclosed amount of money was spent by The Coca-Cola Company for the acquisition of Moxie. Also in the same month it became a minority stakeholder in Body Armor and on the 19th of September 2018 it purchased a Willunga Australia-based company named Organic & Raw Trading Co. Pty Ltd known for manufacturing MOJO Kombucha. On the 5th of the next month it acquired a 22.5% stake in MADE Group. The Coca-Cola Company also owns more than half (68.3% precisely) of Coca-Cola Bottlers Africa’s stakes.

Key Takeaways Coca-Cola was founded by American pharmacist Dr. John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta Georgia sometime around 1886.

The name coca-cola was inspired by the key ingredients in the recipe – coca and kola nut.

The Coca-Cola Company is today owned by different investors and companies.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffet is a major shareholder through his investment company Berkshire Hathaway.

James Quincey currently heads the company. He became the President and Chief Executive Officer in May 2017.

Net Worth of Coca-Cola’s CEO and Key Shareholder

The Coca-Cola Company is currently headed by James Quincey who became the President and Chief Executive Officer in May 2017. According to a report on the company’s fiscal year 2020 executive compensation information on the 4th of March 2021 five executives of the beverage company were paid an average compensation package of $8.6 million a 1% reduction compared to the year before.

Among these executives was the British-born businessman James Quincey who reportedly received a total of $18 million a 2% reduction from his 2019 compensation. 62% ($11 million) of Mr. James’s compensation was in stock awards. He was also paid a salary of $1.6 million $3.1 million in option awards a bonus of $960000 a change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings worth $760000 and $473000 in other compensation.

As of September 2021 he was worth an estimated $50 million and all his earnings have come from his salary incentives and benefits he receives for being a member of the management team of the Coca-Cola Company.

On the other hand Warren Buffett who is the company’s major shareholder through his investment company Berkshire Hathaway had a fortune worth over $104 billion until June 2021 when he donated $4.1 billion of his fortune to a philanthropic cause. The donation was in fulfillment of his pledge to give all his Berkshire Hathaway shares which is more than 99% of his net worth to philanthropy.

Even with his most recent donation which has reduced his net worth to $100 billion the billionaire investor is still worth more than two times what he was worth 15 years ago when he started gifting his Berkshire Hathaway stock annually to different foundations. He has donated $41 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock but despite that the Oracle of Omaha is richer than he ever was. According to Forbes he had a net worth of $42 billion in early 2006 but the reason why he is worth much more than that now even after doing away with $41 billion worth of stock is as a result of the massive runup in the value of Berkshire Hathaway stock.

Warren Buffett occupies the sixth spot on the Forbes 2021 list of billionaires. The year before he was among the ten billionaires on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans with the highest philanthropy score of 5 which means that he has given away not less than a fifth of his fortune. However if that was not the case he would have been worth almost $198.3 billion today. This would also have made him the world’s second-richest person behind Jeff Bezos who is worth $201.5 billion."

Such devices could permit astronomers to examine older and more distant space objects.

Bigger telescopes often lead to big new discoveries. They can reach deeper into space finding and collecting light at far greater distances than smaller equipment.

In January NASA announced the deployment of its “largest and most powerful” telescope ever built the James Webb Space Telescope. It aims to build on the work of past telescopes while gathering in-depth information on the early development of the universe.

But NASA is seeking to greatly expand the size of its telescopes up to 100 times over ones currently in use. One way to do this is to build lenses using fluid materials.

NASA has been carrying out experiments to see if fluids can be used to create telescope lenses in microgravity conditions. The goal is to establish a method that could be used by astronauts in space to create lenses after transporting the necessary materials.

Much of the research centers on exploring how liquids behave in microgravity. NASA notes in a description of its experiments that all liquids contain a force that holds them together at their surface. This force is called surface tension.

On Earth surface tension can keep very small drops of water together in a perfect circle. But when the drops get bigger the surface tension is broken and the drop’s circular shape collapses. In space the microgravity environment causes drops of water and other fluids to form perfect circles and stay that way.

One experiment is called the Fluidic Telescope Experiment or FLUTE. It is a joint project involving NASA’s Ames Research Center in California the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and the Israel Institute of Technology known as Technion.

FLUTE’s main investigator is Edward Balaban. He said in a statement the way liquids behave in microgravity can be a good fit for producing large telescopes or other optical elements.

""In microgravity liquids take on shapes that are useful for making lenses and mirrors” Balaban said. “So if we make them in space they could be used to build telescopes that are dramatically bigger than was previously thought possible.""

FLUTE team members have carried out experiments on the ground and in the air to test different liquid materials. In one test scientists combined water with chemical mixes in search of a good material to make telescope lenses. The tests simulated a weightless environment.

Researchers involved in the experiments said they were able to easily create lenses in a container. They reported that the resulting lenses had surface qualities similar to or even better than lenses produced with costly equipment.

In December the FLUTE team carried out experiments on two zero gravity airplane flights. Such flights involve an airplane climbing and falling at different altitudes in an effort to produce brief microgravity conditions. The team had 50 chances to reach 15 to 20 second periods of microgravity for testing.

Moran Bercovici a professor of Mechanical Engineering at Technion helped lead the experiments. He said the team used pumps to push different oil materials into a circular frame. In a few seconds Bercovici said “we were able to create a free-standing liquid lens – until the plane lifted upwards again and gravity kicked in and the oils oozed out.”

The experiment produced hardened lenses. Bercovici and his team plan to complete more experiments in the coming months to test how different fluids keep their shape in microgravity.

One FLUTE project experiment will be carried out aboard the International Space Station (ISS). It is to be completed by private astronaut Eytan Stibbe the second Israeli to go to space. He launched to the ISS on April 8 along with three other private astronauts.

Stibbe will attempt to use polymer material like in the Technion laboratory experiment to create lenses in full microgravity. The lenses will then be transported back to Earth for close examination.

Balaban said: ""If our (ISS) experiment is successful it will be the first time an optical component is made in space. It feels a bit like making history.""

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought immense suffering to the people of that land while sparking calls for increased military spending in both the United States and Europe. Though that war may prove to be a tragedy for the world one group is already benefiting from it: U.S. arms contractors.

Even before hostilities broke out the CEOs of major weapons firms were talking about how tensions in Europe could pad their profits. In a January 2022 call with his company’s investors Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes typically bragged that the prospect of conflict in Eastern Europe and other global hot spots would be good for business adding that “we are seeing I would say opportunities for international sales… [T]he tensions in Eastern Europe the tensions in the South China Sea all of those things are putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there. So I fully expect we’re going to see some benefit from it.”

In late March in an interview with the Harvard Business Review after the war in Ukraine had begun Hayes defended the way his company would profit from that conflict:

“So I make no apology for that. I think again recognizing we are there to defend democracy and the fact is eventually we will see some benefit in the business over time. Everything that’s being shipped into Ukraine today of course is coming out of stockpiles either at DoD [the Department of Defense] or from our NATO allies and that’s all great news. Eventually we’ll have to replenish it and we will see a benefit to the business over the next coming years.”

Arms to Ukraine profits to contractors

The war in Ukraine will indeed be a bonanza for the likes of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. First of all there will be the contracts to resupply weapons like Raytheon’s Stinger anti-aircraft missile and the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin-produced Javelin anti-tank missile that Washington has already provided to Ukraine by the thousands. The bigger stream of profits however will come from assured post-conflict increases in national-security spending here and in Europe justified at least in part by the Russian invasion and the disaster that’s followed.

Indeed direct arms transfers to Ukraine already reflect only part of the extra money going to U.S. military contractors. This fiscal year alone they are guaranteed to also reap significant benefits from the Pentagon’s Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program both of which finance the acquisition of American weaponry and other equipment as well as military training. These have in fact been the two primary channels for military aid to Ukraine from the moment the Russians invaded and seized Crimea in 2014. Since then the United States has committed around $5 billion in security assistance to that country.

According to the State Department the United States has provided such military aid to help Ukraine “preserve its territorial integrity secure its borders and improve interoperability with NATO.” So when Russian troops began to mass on the Ukrainian border last year Washington quickly upped the ante. On March 31 2021 the U.S. European Command declared a “potential imminent crisis” given the estimated 100000 Russian troops already along that border and within Crimea. As last year ended the Biden administration had committed $650 million in weaponry to Ukraine including anti-aircraft and anti-armor equipment like the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin Javelin anti-tank missile.

Despite such elevated levels of American military assistance Russian troops did indeed invade Ukraine in February. Since then according to Pentagon reports the U.S. has committed to giving approximately $2.6 billion in military aid to that country bringing the Biden administration total to more than $3.2 billion and still rising.

Some of this assistance was included in a March emergency-spending package for Ukraine which required the direct procurement of weapons from the defense industry including drones laser-guided rocket systems machine guns ammunition and other supplies. The major military-industrial corporations will now seek Pentagon contracts to deliver that extra weaponry even as they are gearing up to replenish Pentagon stocks already delivered to the Ukrainians.

On that front in fact military contractors have much to look forward to. More than half of the Pentagon’s $6.5 billion portion of the emergency-spending package for Ukraine is designated simply to replenish DoD inventories. In all lawmakers allocated $3.5 billion to that effort $1.75 billion more than the president even requested. They also boosted funding by $150 million for the State Department’s FMF program for Ukraine. And keep in mind that those figures don’t even include emergency financing for the Pentagon’s acquisition and maintenance costs which are guaranteed to provide more revenue streams for the major weapons makers.

Better yet from the viewpoint of such companies there are many bites left to take from the apple of Ukrainian military aid. President Biden has already made it all too clear that “we’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead.” One can only assume that more commitments are on the way.

Another positive side effect of the war for Lockheed Raytheon and other arms merchants like them is the push by House Armed Services Committee chair Adam Smith (D-WA) and ranking committee Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama to speed up production of a next-generation anti-aircraft missile to replace the Stinger. In his congressional confirmation hearing William LaPlante the latest nominee to head acquisition at the Pentagon argued that America also needs more “hot production lines” for bombs missiles and drones. Consider that yet another benefit-in-waiting for the major weapons contractors.

The Pentagon gold mine

For U.S. arms makers however the greatest benefits of the war in Ukraine won’t be immediate weapons sales large as they are but the changing nature of the ongoing debate over Pentagon spending itself. Of course the representatives of such companies were already plugging the long-term challenge posed by China a greatly exaggerated threat but the Russian invasion is nothing short of manna from heaven for them the ultimate rallying cry for advocates of greater military outlays. Even before the war the Pentagon was slated to receive at least $7.3 trillion over the next decade more than four times the cost of President Biden’s $1.7 trillion domestic Build Back Better plan already stymied by members of Congress who labeled it “too expensive” by far. And keep in mind that given the current surge in Pentagon spending that $7.3 trillion could prove a minimal figure.

Indeed Pentagon officials like Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks promptly cited Ukraine as one of the rationales for the Biden administration’s proposed record national-security budget proposal of $813 billion calling Russia’s invasion “an acute threat to the world order.” In another era that budget request for Fiscal Year 2023 would have been mind-boggling since it’s higher than spending at the peaks of the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam and over $100 billion more than the Pentagon received annually at the height of the Cold War.

Despite its size however congressional Republicans — joined by a significant number of their Democratic colleagues — are already pushing for more. Forty Republican members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have in fact signed a letter to President Biden calling for 5% growth in military spending beyond inflation which would potentially add up to $100 billion to that budget request. Typically enough Representative Elaine Luria (D-VA) who represents the area near the Huntington Ingalls company’s Newport News military shipyard in Virginia accused the administration of “gutting the Navy” because it contemplates decommissioning some older ships to make way for new ones. That complaint was lodged despite that service’s plan to spend a whopping $28 billion on new ships in FY 2023.

Who benefits?

That planned increase in shipbuilding funds is part of a proposed pool of $276 billion for weapons procurement as well as further research and development contained in the new budget which is where the top five weapons-producing contractors — Lockheed Martin Boeing Raytheon General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman — make most of their money. Those firms already split more than $150 billion in Pentagon contracts annually a figure that will skyrocket if the administration and Congress have their way. To put all of this in context just one of those top five firms Lockheed Martin was awarded $75 billion in Pentagon contracts in fiscal year 2020 alone. That’s considerably more than the entire budget for the State Department dramatic evidence of how skewed Washington’s priorities are despite the Biden administration’s pledge to “put diplomacy first.”

The Pentagon’s weapons wish list for FY 2023 is a catalog of just how the big contractors will cash in. For example the new Columbia Class ballistic missile submarine built by General Dynamics Electric Boat plant in southeastern Connecticut will see its proposed budget for FY 2023 grow from $5.0 billion to $6.2 billion. Spending on Northrop Grumman’s new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent will increase by about one-third annually to $3.6 billion. The category of “missile defense and defeat” a specialty of Boeing Raytheon and Lockheed Martin is slated to receive more than $24 billion. And space-based missile warning systems a staple of the Trump administration-created Space Force will jump from $2.5 billion in FY 2022 to $4.7 billion in this year’s proposed budget.

Among all the increases there was a single surprise: a proposed reduction in purchases of the troubled Lockheed Martin F-35 combat aircraft from 85 to 61 planes in FY 2023. The reason is clear enough. That plane has more than 800 identified design flaws and its production and performance problems have been little short of legendary. Luckily for Lockheed Martin that drop in numbers has not been accompanied by a proportional reduction in funding. While newly produced planes may be reduced by one-third the actual budget allocation for the F-35 will drop by less than 10% from $12 billion to $11 billion an amount that’s more than the complete discretionary budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since Lockheed Martin won the F-35 contract development costs have more than doubled while production delays have set the aircraft back by nearly a decade. Nonetheless the military services have purchased so many of those planes that manufacturers can’t keep up with the demand for spare parts. And yet the F-35 can’t even be properly tested for combat effectiveness because the simulation software required is not only unfinished but without even an estimated completion date. So the F-35 is many years away from the full production of planes that actually work as advertised if that’s ever in the cards.

A number of the weapons systems which in the Ukraine moment are guaranteed to be showered with cash are so dangerous or dysfunctional that like the F-35 they should actually be phased out. Take the new ICBM. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry has called ICBMs “some of the most dangerous weapons in the world” because a president would only have minutes to decide whether to launch them in a crisis greatly increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war based on a false alarm. Nor does it make sense to buy aircraft carriers at $13 billion a pop especially since the latest version is having trouble even launching and landing aircraft — its primary function — and is increasingly vulnerable to attack by next-generation high-speed missiles.

The few positives in the new budget like the Navy’s decision to retire the unnecessary and unworkable Littoral Combat Ship — a sort of “F-35 of the sea” designed for multiple tasks none of which it does well — could easily be reversed by advocates from states and districts where those systems are built and maintained. The House of Representatives for instance has a powerful Joint Strike Fighter Caucus which in 2021 mustered more than one-third of all House members to press for more F-35s than the Pentagon and Air Force requested as they will no doubt do again this year. A Shipbuilding Caucus co-chaired by representatives Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Rob Wittman (R-VA) will fight against the Navy’s plan to retire old ships to buy new ones. (They would prefer that the Navy keep the old ones and buy new ones with more of your tax money up for grabs.) Similarly the “ICBM Coalition” made up of senators from states with either ICBM bases or production centers has a near perfect record of staving off reductions in the deployment or funding of those weapons and will in 2022 be hard at work defending its budgetary allocation.

Towards a new policy

Coming up with a sensible realistic and affordable defense policy always a challenge will be even more so in the midst of the Ukrainian nightmare. Still given where our taxpayer dollars go it remains all too worthwhile. Such a new approach should include things like reducing the numbers of the Pentagon’s private contractors hundreds of thousands of people many of whom are engaged in thoroughly redundant jobs that could be done more cheaply by civilian government employees or simply eliminated. It’s estimated that cutting spending on contractors by 15% would save around $262 billion over 10 years.

The Pentagon’s three-decades-long near $2 trillion “modernization” plan to build a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers missiles and submarines along with new warheads should for instance simply be scrapped in keeping with the kind of “deterrence-only” nuclear strategy developed by the nuclear-policy organization Global Zero. And the staggering American global military footprint — an invitation to further conflict that includes more than 750 military bases scattered on every continent except Antarctica and counterterror operations in 85 countries — should at the very least be sharply scaled back.

According to the Center for International Policy’s Sustainable Defense Task Force and a study of alternative approaches to defense carried out by the Congressional Budget Office even a relatively minimalist strategic rethinking could save at least $1 trillion over the next decade enough to make a healthy down payment on investments in public health preventing or mitigating the worst potential impacts of climate change or beginning the task of narrowing record levels of income inequality.

Of course none of these changes can occur without challenging the power and influence of the military-industrial-congressional complex a task as urgent as it is difficult in this moment of carnage in Europe. No matter how hard it may be it’s a fight worth having both for the security of the world and the future of the planet.

One thing is guaranteed: a new gold rush of “defense” spending is a disaster in the making for all of us not in that complex.

The clearing of the sale followed the lifting by US lawmakers of objections over human rights concerns.

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced last Thursday the sale of the helicopters and related defence systems to the Nigerian military.

The sale includes the Bell-made Cobras; 28 General Electric-made T700-401C engines; 2000 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon Systems used to convert unguided missiles into precision-guided missiles; and night vision targeting and navigation systems.

About Bell AH-1 Cobra

The Bell AH-1 Cobra is a single-engined attack helicopter developed and manufactured by the American rotorcraft manufacturer Bell Helicopter. A member of the prolific Huey family the AH-1 is also referred to as the HueyCobra or Snake.

The helicopter type which was used during the Vietnam War was produced in response to fulfill a need for a dedicated armed escort for transport helicopters to give the helicopters greater survivability in contested environments.

Design and features

The AH-1 is a dedicated attack helicopter featuring a tandem cockpit stub wings for weapons and a chin-mounted gun turret.

The fuselage and other sub-assembly elements are all made of corrosion-resistant material. No two dissimilar metals of the structure are in contact.

The helicopter features an epoxy primer layer on the exposed surfaces. The AH-1Z Viper is deployed to provide close air support armed escort/reconnaissance anti-air warfare and anti-armour operations.

Northrop Grumman developed the integrated avionics systems for the AH-1Z. The systems include two mission computers and an automatic flight control system with four-axis stability control augmentation system. Each crew station has two 8in×6in multifunction displays and one 4.2in×4.2in dual function display based on active-matrix liquid crystal colour technology.

The communications suite combines the US Navy RT-1824 integrated radio UHF/VHF COMSEC and modem in a single unit. The navigation suite includes an embedded GPS inertial a low-airspeed air data subsystem which allows weapons delivery when hovering and a digital map.

The Super Cobra can carry both TOW and Hellfire anti-armour missiles and is qualified to carry the Maverick missile.

The Super Cobra carries a three-barrel 20mm gatling gun for close range (up to 2km) engagement and 750 rounds of ammunition. With the gun in a fixed forward position the pilot can aim by manoeuvring the helicopter. Either crew member can slave the turret to the helmet-mounted sight and aim the gun by looking at the target.

Countries that have used the Cobra helicopters

Several countries including the US Israel Japan Jordan Turkey Pakistan and the Philippines have deployed the Bell AH-1 Cobra for attack missions.

The first examples of the type entered service with the US Army during 1967; other branches of the US military also opted to acquire the type particularly the US Marine Corps while export sales were made to numerous overseas countries including Israel Japan and Turkey.

For several decades the AH-1 formed the core of the US Army’s attack helicopter fleet seeing combat in Vietnam Grenada Panama and Iraq.

In the US Army the Cobra was progressively replaced by the newer and more capable Boeing AH-64 Apache during the 1990s with the final examples being withdrawn during 2001.

The Israeli Air Force operated the Cobra most prolifically along its land border with Lebanon using its fleet intensively during the 1982 Lebanon War.

Turkish AH-1s have seen regular combat with Kurdish insurgents near Turkey’s southern borders. Upgraded versions of the Cobra have been developed such as the twin engined AH-1 SeaCobra/SuperCobra and the experimental Bell 309 KingCobra.

Experts’ views on Cobra attack helicopters

Kabir Adamu founder and chief executive officer of Beacon Consulting a security risk management and intelligence consulting company said the attack helicopters would not be useful in the fight against banditry terrorism and all security threats that involve armed conflict.

According to him the helicopters expected in the country are very good for precision-styled warfare especially in urban settings where the enemy is sometimes mixed with the citizens.

“You need this precision-styled attack especially where you want to take the enemy by surprise and in close proximity from an aerial point of view” he said while stressing that the deployment of the aircraft using credible intelligence would prevent civilian harm.

According to Adamu the helicopters will help the military respond to distress much faster especially in forward operating bases which are most vulnerable to attacks.

“These helicopters will be very helpful to that response capability. In fact it’s one of the things that would be the game-changer because of the way the Nigerian security forces are spread thinly; there are so many threat elements and that means we have a lot of bases that are vulnerable to attacks. But where you have this response capability anytime they are in distress and you are aware you can deploy speedily” he said.

The expert therefore advised that the armory should be well secured so that enemy would not steal or destroy them as done in the past.

According to Shehu Sadeeq a private security and defence consultant the helicopters are more rugged and can access places where other aircraft including the Super Tucano cannot access.

He said the aircraft would make it easier for the military to access the forests where bandits/terrorists hibernate.

The security consultant however noted that Nigeria had not yet purchased the aircraft saying the contract had not been signed.

Sadeeq said “The US Congress has to make the final approval; after that is done Nigeria and America will agree on terms of use and constituents of the aircraft. When they agree they will sign the final agreement for the aircraft to be produced. So this is just the start of a long journey.

“We have learnt our lesson form the Tucano; Nigeria did not do due diligence. Americans did; they specified how the aircraft will be used and Nigeria signed not knowing that it will not be used against banditry. Before signing we must be sure of the terms of use.”

According to him the attack aircraft can only be effective if handled by well-trained personnel that can maximise its features. “A good aircraft needs a good pilot else you won’t be able to maximise its benefits. It’s our pilots and technicians that will make sure that the human element complements the quality of the aircraft” he said.

Chidi Omeje a security analyst applauded the move to purchase more aircraft saying “Nigeria is in need of more attack aircraft to deal with security threats.”

He said the aircraft would enable the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) to dominate the airspace. “The NAF will have more eyes in the sky and this will add great impetus to the war on terror” he said.",,,

That could save the GPU crypto mining community some coin on the electric bill.

In Chemnitz Germany a one-man hobbyist PC gaming researcher by the name of Igor Wallossek recently found a way to cut the power consumption of the Nvidia RTX 3090.

A report about the home lab electronics caper by Hassan Mujtaba for WCCF Tech explains why this is a breakthrough for anyone who uses the GPU:

“NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card is without a doubt the most power-hungry graphics card ever launched sipping over 500 Watts of power and requiring insanely massive GPU cooling solutions to keep the heat in check.”

Of course cryptocurrency industry watchers know it’s not just full-time gamers who stand to save some money if Igor’s efficiency mod to the chip is replicable by others.

Unless they’re using the ASIC chips specially designed to mine cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Dogecoin (DOGE) Litecoin (LTC) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Monero (XMR) Zcash (ZEC) and others— GPUs remain the most effective way to mine cryptocurrency.

Igor Labs Mods Nvidia RTX 3090 for Big Efficiency Boost

Out of the box the RTX 3090 has a manufacturer reference TGP (total graphics power) of 450W. That’s how much power the graphics subsystem requires to run the chip and keep it from overheating. WCCF Tech says most custom models run at closer to 500W. But Igor Labs found a way to limit power consumption to 300W— a 37% drop in its TGP rating — without losing nearly as much gaming performance. This was tested using 10 games at 4K resolution.

That yields an appreciable amount of electricity cost savings for the Nvidia GPU’s computations and the “insanely massive” cost of cooling the RTX 3090 (with electricity fed to the entire graphics rig through a 600 Watt rated PCIe Gen 5 16-pin connector which is designed to accommodate future graphics chips rated for 600 Watts).

That could save some money for the GPU mining industry

Graphics processing units are optimal for solving the SHA-256 hash algorithm problems that play a key role in the elaborate computational and economic architecture of proof of work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (and Ethereum for the past seven years until mainnet merges with the Beacon Chain to create network consensus using proof of stake).

While the RTX 3090 is a powerful miner with a hashrate clocked at 135 MH/s on the Dagger Hashimoto implementation for Ethereum mining WePC has recommended a more energy-efficient solution because the rig is such a power hog. Igor’s modification to limit the Nvidia card’s electricity usage could bump the RTX 3090 up the GPU mining leaderboards for key benchmarks like hashrate power consumption and daily profit/days to break even.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2RlbGwtcHJlY2lzaW9uLTcwMDAtd29ya3N0YXRpb24tbGFwdG9wcy1pbnRlbC1hbGRlci1sYWtlLWh4LW52aWRpYS1pbnRlbC1wcm8tZ3B1cy1jYW1tLW1vZHVsYXItZGVzaWduL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2RlbGwtcHJlY2lzaW9uLTcwMDAtd29ya3N0YXRpb24tbGFwdG9wcy1pbnRlbC1hbGRlci1sYWtlLWh4LW52aWRpYS1pbnRlbC1wcm8tZ3B1cy1jYW1tLW1vZHVsYXItZGVzaWduL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dell’s Upcoming Precision 7000 Laptops To Feature Intel Alder Lake-HX CPUs With Up To 16 Cores Intel Arc & NVIDIA RTX Pro GPUs New Modular Design,"Dell is preparing its brand new Precision 7000 series workstation laptops which will feature a range of new technologies ranging from Intel's Alder Lake-HX CPUs Pro GPUs in both Intel Arc & NVIDIA's RTX flavors and a brand new modular design.

Dell's Precision 7000 Series Being Upgraded With Intel 16 Core Alder Lake-HX CPUs Intel Arc / NVIDIA RTX Pro GPUs New Modular Designs

The latest leaks on Dell's Precision 7000 series laptop lineup come from leaker iGPU Extremist (@Emerald_x86). The leaker acquired photos of an internal Dell specs sheet which lists down upcoming Dell Precision 7770 and Precision 7760 high-end workstation laptops. Some of the changes that are expected within the new lineup are the upgrade from 8 Core Intel Comet Lake processors to the latest 16 Core Alder Lake-HX CPUs.

2 of 9

This is the first time that the Intel Alder Lake-HX CPUs are listed within an officially leaked specs sheet rather than appearing in online benchmark databases. The new parts will feature a similar die as the desktop parts rocking up to 8 P-Cores and 8 E-Cores for a total of 16 cores & 24 threads. The Precision laptops are said to feature 55W Core i9 and Core i7 variants but the second specs sheet mentions the 55W Core i5 SKUs too. As far as we know the lineup will include the following chips:

Moving over to the graphics side the Dell Precision 7000 series will be rocking both NVIDIA and Intel options. The graphics card options are wide including several RTX options up to the RTX A5000 16 GB and Intel's Arc mobility workstation graphics with a listed TDP of 125-90 Watts. This is the same TDP as the Arc A730M and A770M graphics so one might assume that we are looking at a variation of Intel's top ACM-G10 GPU here.

Other specifications include up to 128 GB of Non-ECC and 64 GB of ECC DDR5-4800 memory up to quad M.2 2280 slots support the latest PCIe Gen 4x4 interface that can hold up to 16 TB of storage capacity in RAID Thunderbolt 4 support up to a 16:10 4K (HDR500) OLED display with slim bezels and a brightness of 500 nits. The internal chassis will feature a vapor chamber cooling system with dual exhaust fans. But Dell has two other features incorporated into its Precision 7000 laptops and these are CAMM (Compression Attached Memory Module) and DGFF (Dell Graphics Form Factor).

Dell's latest Precision 7000 series will rock the new CAMM & DGFF Modular design approach. (Image Credits: @Emerald_x86)

CAMM is a proprietary memory module form factor for DDR5 4800 MHz kits made by Dell. The CAMM module could essentially take the place of two SODIMM modules. Not only can that allow for more room for other components but it could force users to buy their product and not a manufacturer's designs specifically. This wouldn't allow users to upgrade their memory DIMMs unless they are solely from Dell. The graphics chip will also come in the new DGFF (Dell Graphics Form Factor) but we don't have details for that yet.

Currently the release date of the two newest Dell workstation systems is unknown. Intel is hinting that the third quarter of 2022 could see the release of the ARC-based workstation GPUs so it would be advantageous for Dell to release their systems around the same timeframe. With that said Dell could unveil these systems at Computex 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaDRnYW1lcnMuY29tL2dob3N0LW9mLXRzdXNoaW1hLW9uLXBjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ghost of Tsushima On PC? GeForce Now Leak Looks More Plausible With Each New Launch,"Last year there was a massive data leak from NVIDIA GeForce Now servers and many unannounced games were revealed at the time. The company even confirmed the authenticity of the list according to a spokesperson from Nvidia:

‘Nvidia is aware of an unauthorized published game list with both released and/or speculative titles used only for internal tracking and testing. Inclusion on the list is neither confirmation nor an announcement of any game. Nvidia took immediate action to remove access to the list. No confidential game builds or personal information were exposed.’

We can confidently say that it is reliable more than six months after the previous leak. Several games have been confirmed in the leak in recent months including Street Fighter 6 Crysis 4 and Kingdom Hearts IV recently announced on April 10. Some have even made their debut including God of War on the PC Platform.

Gears 6 Dragon’s Dogma 2 Titanfall 3 Tekken 8 Monster Hunter 6 Final Fantasy 9 Remake and a remake of Half-Life 2 were among the leaked games; none of these have been officially revealed. However considering each brand’s financial success and legacy all appear feasible if not probable.

However one of the most notable names leaked in the GeForce Now library is Ghost of Tsushima. God of War and Horizon: Zero Dawn have already been launched on PC along with the official announcement of the Uncharted series on the PC Platform. And considering the authenticity of the list and how accurate it has been so far it seems like a matter of time before we see Ghost of Tsushima as well.

Ghost of Tsushima developed by Sucker Punch Studios has been one of the most popular and successful PlayStation exclusives since its launch. The visuals are simply breathtaking and the story is wonderful. If the game launches on GeForce now there is no doubt PC players will be in for a treat.

Here are some of the recently announced/released games from the NVIDIA GeForce Now leak:

Crysis 4 – announced

Street Fighter 6 – announced

God of War for PC – has been released

Death Stranding Director’s Cut for PC – has been released

Kingdom Hearts IV – announced

Sniper Elite 5 – announced

Half-Life 2 Remastered – announced

GTA The Trilogy The Definitive Edition – has been released

Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition – has been released

What else was on the list and what may still be released?

Gears 6

Tekken 8

Halo 5: Guardians on PC

Final Fantasy Tactics Remastered

Final Fantasy IX Remake

Resident Evil 4 Remake

Dragons Dogma 2

Monster Hunter 6

Lost Astral from Maxis studio

Helldivers 2

Demon’s Souls in the PC version

Ratchet & Clank in the PC version

Sackboy: A Big Adventure for PC

Ghost of Tsushima for PC

Horizon Forbidden West for PC

Returnal for PC

As you can see the list also mentions recently launched games such as Horizon: Forbidden West and others on the PC Platform. However while most of the names have been true and have already been launched or announced some could be just placeholders. Nvidia confirmed the list’s authenticity but they also mentioned that it was just for internal testing.

However we have to wait and see how much of that is true and if we get an official announcement for any of the suspected games. But the announcement of Kingdom Hearts 4 has made us more optimistic about the list. We will be looking for any leaks or rumors so stay tuned.

NVR,NVR Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzE2LzMtYmVzdC1zdG9jay1zcGxpdC1jYW5kaWRhdGVzLW9uLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtYWZ0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Best Stock-Split Candidates on the Planet After Alphabet and Amazon,"They're great candidates but don't hold your breath that stock splits will actually be on the way soon.

Many investors could be diagnosed with a fever. It's not the flu. Instead their condition can be blamed in large part on Alphabet and Amazon.

These two giant companies announced 20-for-1 stock splits earlier this year. And now a lot of investors appear to have a case of stock-split fever. They're anxiously looking for other stocks that could split.

You can cross Berkshire Hathaway off the list. Even though Berkshire's class A shares trade at more than $518000 CEO Warren Buffett is dead set against splitting the stock. Berkshire's class B shares offer investors a more affordable alternative anyway.

But there are other companies with super-high share prices that could consider splits. Here are the three best stock-split candidates on the planet after Alphabet and Amazon.

1. NVR

With the lone exception of Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares no other stock trading on the major U.S. exchanges has a higher share price than NVR (NVR 1.70%). The homebuilder/mortgage bank's share price currently tops $4400.

Unsurprisingly NVR usually ranks near the top of any list of potential candidates for stock splits. The stock's price has consistently been greater than both Alphabet's and Amazon's over the past couple of decades. However NVR has never conducted a stock split in its nearly 30 years of trading as a public company.

The company's incoming CEO Eugene Bredow could be more favorable toward a stock split though. Bredow will take the helm as president and CEO pending shareholders' election of current CEO Paul Saville as executive chairman of the board.

NVR faces interest rate increases that are likely to negatively impact both its homebuilding and mortgage lending businesses. With a more challenging macro environment on the way the company just might view a stock split as a way to boost investors' interest.

2. Seaboard

Seaboard (SEB 1.11%) doesn't trail behind NVR very much with a share price of close to $4150. The share price of the agribusiness and transportation company has topped $1000 throughout most of the 21st century.

But Seaboard and NVR have something else in common in addition to their high share prices. Like NVR Seaboard has never split its stock.

Is there any reason to expect Seaboard's management team to have a change of heart about a stock split? Not really. Robert Steer has served as CEO of the company since July 2020. There's nothing to suggest that Steer has a split on his mind.

Seaboard's executive team is more likely focused on some of the tailwinds impacting the business. Inflation especially higher fuel costs presents a key challenge for the company.

3. Booking Holdings

Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.20%) claims the third-highest share price after NVR and Seaboard (excluding Berkshire's class A shares). The online travel company's shares currently trade at close to $2250.

Unlike NVR and Seaboard Booking does have a stock split in its history. However it was a unique kind known as a reverse stock split. In June 2003 the company (then known as Priceline) conducted a 1-for-6 reverse stock split in a move that boosted its share price.

Booking's share price is much higher than that of Shopify another company that has recently announced a stock split. While Booking appears to be a great candidate for a stock split though don't count on one happening anytime soon.

However the situation for Booking could change down the road. As COVID-19 concerns fade global travel could enjoy an even greater resurgence. That could drive Booking's share price to a high enough level that the company's management puts a stock split on the table.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNC8xNi9ob21lLXNhbGVzLXN1bW1pdC1zdGFyay1wb3J0YWdlLXdheW5lLW1lZGluYS13ZWVrLWphbi0yNC83MTM4NDQyMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Home sales for Summit Stark Portage Wayne Medina week of Jan. 24,"SUMMIT COUNTY

An Aldi retail grocery store is the next business slated to move into the northeast corner of Lincoln Way E and 27th Street NE according to a lease memorandum filed with the Stark County recorder.

More:Ongoing foundation work is for new Chipotle restaurant on Lincoln Way E

An existing building — formerly Charlie's restaurant — is to be reconstructed for a new 19054 square-foot building which will house the new Aldi store on about 1.8 acres. The lease agreement is for 20 years.

Aldi and Chipotle are separate but related parts of an ongoing plan to revamp the approximately 108000-square-foot Kmart building and multi-acre property that the retailer last occupied in 2017. The large structure is being transformed into a large indoor/outdoor storage facility which will be called Space Shop Self Storage.

The conversion of the Kmart structure will accommodate around 700 individual storage units of varying sizes.

Massillon awaits more details on proposed Aldi

David Maley Massillon's economic development director said the city has yet to receive a formal site plan and lease details regarding the planned Aldi store from property owner Pittsburgh-based Kamin Realty. However he said progress at the 11.7-acre tract on Lincoln Way that includes Chipotle the planned Aldi and the storage center is a major plus.

""The way things are working out it will put the (entire) property to good use"" Maley said.

Another new unspecified business appears to be in the works for the property directly west of Chipotle and east of O'Reilly Auto Parts.

City Councilman Ted Herncane D-at large said the Aldi Chipotle and unknown business should act as an adequate visibility buffer between Lincoln Way and the storage center.

""I'm pleased to see the moving forward with the Charlie's site and the speed that the new Chipotle is going in"" said Herncane who chairs council's Economic Development Committee.

More Aldi stores in Stark County

In 2019 an Aldi store opened on the Menards' property at 3725 Erie St. S in Massillon.

Aldi is planning to utilize a 25000-square-foot section of the former Fishers Foods store at 8100 Cleveland Ave. NW in Plain Township. Locally-owned Fishers closed that store in January.

Construction for the Plain store is expected to begin in June and Aldi hopes to have the location open in the fall.

The Massillon store on Lincoln Way E aims to be the eighth Aldi locale in Stark County.

Overall Aldi has around 200 stores in 36 states and employs nearly 30000 people according to the chain's website.

In what has already become a familiar theme early this season Tyler Davis and Andy Bryant found their way to O’Reilly Auto Parts Victory Lane.

The opening lap of the Alternative Pest Management USRA Modified A-feature was the most exciting one for Davis.

Fellow front row starter Cody Schniepp got a good launch at the drop of the green crossing over just in front of Davis’ No. 65 machine.

As both drag raced to the top of the speedway into turn one Davis turned hard left and drove to the bottom of the speedway pulling the trigger on a slider off turn two to regain the lead.

From there Davis led all 20 laps at the line to record win number two at 81 Speedway (his fifth overall) so far in 2022.

For the second time in as many nights Tad Davis followed to the line duplicating his runner-up performance the night before at Humboldt Speedway.

Brothers Cody and Bryce Schniepp finished third and fourth with Josh Lanterman completing the top five.

Bryant picked up a B-feature win and was the night’s hard charger going 13th to 6th on the field while the Schniepps Tad Davis and former sprint car driver Jake Greider picked up the four heat race wins.

Bryant once again pulled double duty and went back-to-back in BSB Manufacturing USRA B-Mod competition here at 81 Speedway.

Bryant looked nearly unbeatable behind the wheel of car No. 28 opening up a big lead and never looking back the entire way.

Brian McGowen Friday night’s winner at Humboldt Speedway finished second. Reece Solander and Travis Johnson crossed third and fourth while 14th-starting hard charger Jon Sheets completed the top 5.

Randy Zimmerman picked up a B-feature win with Bryant Tyler Kidwell Gabriel Hodges and Solander recording heat race wins.

Coming up next another night of weekly racing series action takes place on Saturday April 23. Alternative Pest Management USRA Modifieds JLR Property Management Rookie Modifieds AutoTech Service Super Stocks Heyglassman.com Stock Cars all return for race night number five on the year.

WHEATLAND MO. (April 16 2022) – As its name would suggest Enduro races reward those who successfully endure the marathon nature of the unique-style event.

Clay Goodman of Carthage outlasted 36 others Saturday night in the inaugural Enduro Easter Bowl 150 at Lucas Oil Speedway coming home two laps in front of runner-up Troy Mitchell in the 150-lap feature.

“I’ll get to keep that one forever” Goodman said in victory lane after becoming the first winner of an Enduro race at Lucas Oil Speedway.

Goodman who started 18th earned $1500 for the victory in the first racing event of the 2022 Lucas Oil Speedway season.

Predictably wild the race for cars that are basically street-legal with some racing modifications for safety was a free-for-all with bumping banging and spins – but only one brief stoppage for a red flag. It took one hour five minutes to complete and proved that the fastest was not necessarily the first to finish.

Mitchell of Henley Missouri was a distant second and Jeremy Wilson of Humboldt Kansas wound up third after starting 33rd. Butch Knox of Sedalia was fourth and Scott Lampe of Fair Grove – who led a race-high 77 laps – wound up fifth.

Lampe had taken over the lead on lap 83 when Sims Nick spun after encountering a lapped car appeared to have things going his way. But Lampe who had Goodman a lap down began to slow on lap 127 with steering issues.

Twice Lampe’s car failed to corner properly in turn one and Goodman was able to take advantage and drive past on lap 133. He drove away from there to prevail.

“I really appreciate everybody that helped me out on this” Goodman said. “It feels pretty good. I didn’t expect this to happen. I’m pretty happy.”

In victory lane Goodman also mentioned that the car had all Lucas Oil products in it from transmission to engine. He said the car had been sitting for six years prior to him purchasing it for this event.

Lampe drove into the lead on lap 83 as Sims Nick headed to the pits to change a flat tire. Sims returned but three laps down and Lampe soon had the entire field a lap down.

The race’s lone red flag flew on lap 89 as Sean Steward rolled his car on the backstretch. He was able to drive it to the infield and the race resumed after a brief delay.

As the 37-car field took the green from a standing three-wide start it was Kevin Perkins leading the opening lap and Butch Knox lap two.

Derek Lampe took command on lap three and held it until pulling into the pits with smoke pouring from underneath on lap 23 with Scott Lampe assuming the top spot.

That’s what he and his brother Mike used to drive when they went hunting and did all the other crazy things that Omaha teens did back in the 1970s. But then Mike totaled it.

When he was 23 Steve found a similar car but with a black interior and his dad loaned him the purchase price. On the way to buying it he took a wrong turn in Wahoo and spotted a vehicle in a driveway that looked just like his high school car — red interior included.

“It was everything I wanted” he said.

Huettner talked the owners into finding another car for their 16-year-old daughter. He drove it 800-some miles to Cleveland where he was starting his career and then life got in the way. The car sat for years.

Steve D’Agata’s dream car was a 1959 two-door hardtop Chevrolet Impala like his dad used to own. It’s a link he said to when times were good growing up.

“I just wanted one so bad” he said.

He eventually found one after putting an ad in The World-Herald. A reader contacted him and told him about a car in Palmdale California. He bought it in 1986 but then being a parent got in the way for him too.

Then their families grew up and both men had more time and money to spend on their special automobiles.

With lots of professional help D’Agata spent 15 years restoring his car to its original condition. Jim Mazzei helped with the drivetrain suspension and interior Terry Foust with the body work paint and assembly and Tim McCartney assembled the interior.

Huettner got even luckier. Dale Boesch of Humphrey Nebraska the 2018 custom rod builder of the year had happened to marry a cousin of Huettner’s and agreed to work on his car. A two-year renovation began in 2019.

Both owners decided to honor the people who worked on their cars by entering them in the 67th annual O’Reilly Auto Parts World of Wheels car show at the CHI Health Center earlier this month.

Four hundred restored or tricked-out cars were entered in the season-ending show of the series. About 24000 people attended.

Prizes were awarded in several categories but those two walked off with two of the bigger ones.

Huettner who now lives in Ashland earned the outstanding custom award. D’Agata and his wife Carol won in the best-restored category.

It was exciting D’Agata said but he said that likely will be his only show.

“I kind of did the car for my dad. He died at 55” he said. “My kids love that car as much as I do. It’s a very emotional thing.”

Huettner said he’s not a car guy but he’s been asked to take the vehicle to other events.

He enjoyed the show too. He even met a son of the owner of the car dealership Swanson Ford in Ceresco where the car was purchased new.

Although he’s not sure about touring with the car he does have another goal in mind.

“I would love to find the 16-year-old girl I bought the car from and show it to her” he said. “She’d be 57 or 58. That’s one of the things I’m going to do is track her down and say ‘Here’s your old car.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bHAuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdHMtb3Blbi1jbG9zZWQtb24tZWFzdGVyLXN1bmRheS0yMDIyL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bHAuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdHMtb3Blbi1jbG9zZWQtb24tZWFzdGVyLXN1bmRheS0yMDIyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What’s open closed on Easter Sunday 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wwlp.com/news/whats-open-closed-on-easter-sunday-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bHAuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdHMtb3Blbi1jbG9zZWQtb24tZWFzdGVyLXN1bmRheS0yMDIyL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bHAuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdHMtb3Blbi1jbG9zZWQtb24tZWFzdGVyLXN1bmRheS0yMDIyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

To achieve this target carbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a vital role with the help of petroleum engineering and geoscience skills. Companies need to leverage existing assets and technology to establish a successful low-carbon venture technology. Strategic areas that companies could potentially invest to succeed in a low-carbon venture technology are

Direct air capture

CO 2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in conventional and unconventional reservoirs

enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in conventional and unconventional reservoirs CO 2 EOR in residual oil zones (ROZ)

EOR in residual oil zones (ROZ) CO 2 storage

Table 1 shows the sources of CO 2 emissions during energy production transportation and consumption. The captured carbon can be disposed of in different ways:

Direct Geological Storage

Injection into deep saline aquifers

Table 2—Some of the successful anthropogenic CO 2 projects (Global CCS Institute 2018).

Successful Field Projects

Gorgon CO 2 Injection Project. Chevron’s Gorgon CO 2 injection project in Northwest Australia is one of the largest CO 2 injection projects in the world. Gas that is being produced from the formation contains CO 2  which is separated compressed and geologically stored in the Dupuy formation. The integrated facility of the Gorgon project can be seen in Fig. 1. Dupuy formation is a Jurassic saline reservoir deep beneath Barrow Island (Flett et al. 2008). There are nine CO 2 injection wells and 4 water production wells to manage the reservoir pressure (pressure management wells).

When CO 2 gets injected and the pressure builds up water production wells are evacuating water so that the accumulation of high pressure gets released. The produced water is being injected into a different formation as shown in Fig 2. A 3D-seismic analysis was conducted as a function of time to observe how plumes are forming and growing. There are few observation wells equipped with downhole pressure gauges to monitor pressure readings continuously. As a result of this effort 3.4–4.0 million tons/year of CO 2 is being injected into the Dupuy formation and a significant cut in the overall CO 2 emissions was observed. Also an integrated reservoir surveillance plan was adopted to monitor the injected CO 2 and study the subsurface uncertainties (Denney 2013).

Agbami Oilfield Miscible Natural Gas Injection Project. Agbami field is a $5 billion deepwater natural gas injection project in Nigeria which holds about 1 billion bbl of recoverable oil. The field was discovered in 1998 and has been producing for the past 12 years. All the produced gas from the field is being injected back into the formation and no gas is being flared. The FPSO vessel in the Agbami field layout (Fig. 3) was built by South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering. The field (Fig. 4) is producing around 220000–240000 bbl/day of light sweet crude with an average value of 47 °API.

The bottom of the reservoir consists of water injection wells and the top of the reservoir consists of natural gas injection wells. The gas is being injected at the top pushing the oil down and water is being injected at the bottom and pushing the oil up. This process is known as the “Double Displacement Process” and the oil gets squeezed out of the reservoir by the creation of an effective drive mechanism. Oil and the injected gas are miscible in first contact and thus miscible gas displacement process is taking place effectively in the field.

CO2 Injection Projects

CO 2 EOR is a proven process and more than 166 CO 2 EOR projects are currently active around the world producing more than 450000 bbl of oil per day (McGlade 2018). These numbers are expected to increase to more than 1.2 million bbl and 1.64 million bbl of oil per day in 2030 and 2040 respectively (IEA 2019). During the tertiary recovery phase i.e. CO 2 EOR (Fig. 5) CO 2 injection helps in repressurizing the reservoir and with miscible displacement generates significant incremental oil production.

Fig. 5—Different phases in the oil and gas production.

The first notable CO 2 EOR project is the SACROC project in the Permian Basin (Crameik and Plasssey 1972) and the first commercial-scale anthropogenic CO 2 EOR project is Petra Nova in Texas (2017). Technically SACROC was the first anthropogenic project started by Chevron in 1972 in the US as CO 2 from the neighboring gas plants was collected and transported to the field for CO 2 EOR. Chevron Denbury Resources Devon Energy ExxonMobil Kinder Morgan and Occidental Petroleum are some of the major companies performing CO 2 floods.

CO2 EOR/Storage Challenges

Technical:



Sweep efficiency improvements

Well injectivity improvements

Leakage and concerns along the faults

Fractures in the wells

Retention and recycling of CO 2

Operational:



Corrosion

H 2 S handling

S handling Surveillance and monitoring

Water alternating gas (WAG) optimization

Storage development plan

Commercial/Social:



Oil price

CO 2 price

price Tax incentives in different countries (45Q in the United States)



Currently the industry is injecting more pore volumes of CO 2 than earlier. There is more emphasis on maintaining wellbore conditions and improving sweep efficiency. Companies are targeting ROZ located below oil/water contact and far from the main pay zone (Harouaka et al. 2013). Chevron Hess Oxy and ExxonMobil have their ongoing CO 2 EOR ROZ projects in the Permian Basin in San Andres pay zone (Melzer et al. 2006). Various EOR field trials are being performed in the unconventional reservoirs particularly in Bakken and Eagle Ford formations (Thakur 2019).

Conclusion

CO 2 EOR is a proven technology and it has demonstrated success over the past 50 years in conventional reservoirs. Anthropogenic CO 2 capture and storage projects for EOR are growing and being implemented all over the world. CO 2 and natural gas EOR for unconventional reservoirs has the potential to double the recovery factor. There is additional potential for deep saline aquifers and ROZ/TOZ in Permian Basin. Retention of CO 2 is a concern that most companies have and we must work as a multidisciplinary team including geoscientists field operations personnel environmental scientists and others to address them. By running injection profiles and pressure tests and having a rigorous injection well management and surveillance approach companies can eliminate this concern. CCUS and CO 2 EOR can help to meet the demand for oil and gas in the future. According to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute there are currently 23 large-scale CCS facilities in operation or under construction around the world to capture around 40 million tons of CO 2 per year.

Taylor Heinicke's interview hasn't been done for a whole minute before his former coach comes into frame.

""He wants to add that today because of how much he's been working on his golf game he's going to give his old coach 3 a side"" Bobby Wilder wraps his arms around a laughing Heinicke already working an angle in their ensuing round of golf.

Wilder coached Heinicke at Old Dominion building a standout college football program that peaked during Heinicke's record setting years in Norfolk.

Those years taught Wilder what the rest of the football viewing public learned over the course of the last two years: Taylor Heinicke can quarterback with the best of them.

""I've been coaching for 32 years always coached quarterbacks and that's what separates good from great and good from average. What do they do in the last 2 minutes of the game? And that's where he always steps up and shines a very calming presence"" says Wilder recalling Taylor's 15 game winning drives at Old Dominion.

The opportunity to showcase the chops he honed in college came after an injury to Ryan Fitzpatrick thrust Heinicke into the starting lineup for the next 15 and a half games. Heinicke showed he belonged but doesn't appear to have done enough to be the starter with Washington trading for Carson Wentz and his rather large contract.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdnkubWlsL0Rlc2t0b3BNb2R1bGVzL0FydGljbGVDUy9QcmludC5hc3B4P1BvcnRhbElkPTEmTW9kdWxlSWQ9MjY1MiZBcnRpY2xlPTI5NTk4NzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cmdr.

NORFOLK Va. – In their final regular season home match of 2022 the Old Dominion men's tennis team celebrated its seniors on Senior Day with a 4-2 win over William & Mary.



Pre-match ceremonies recognized Oliver Nolan and Yevhen Sirous for their contributions to the ODU program and the Monarchs responded in doubles with two wins at the two and three spots to take the team point.



""What a great way to send our seniors out on Senior Day. We played a very clean dual match for nearly the first two hours but then let W&M back into the match"" said ODU Head Coach Dominik Mueller. ""Credit goes to Codie and Oliver Nolan for staying composed at the end. Codie stepped up big time at the end clinching the match with some big shots. A very impressive performance for a freshman.""



Nolan and Codie van Schalkwyk took the first win at number two with a 6-0 decision while Francois Le Tallec and Oliver Tobisch won 6-2 at number three to lock up the first point.



In singles the Tribe evened the match with a win at number three before ODU got a 6-4 6-4 win by Le Tallec at number one and a three-set win by Tobisch at number six 6-3 1-6 6-3 for a 3-1 Monarch advantage.



William & Mary pulled to 3-2 after a win at number two but the match was clinched with van Schalkwyk scoring a 6-4 6-7 6-3 win at number four.



""I want to thank Yevhen and Ollie one more time. They gave it all for ODU and made us better this year. They are unbelievable human beings and will achieve great things in life. I am proud that I could be a small part of their path"" Mueller added.



ODU now heads into the Conference USA Tournament starting on Friday at the Folkes-Stevens Tennis Center.

The data is now available in SEMI’s Worldwide Semiconductor Equipment Market Statistics (WWSEMS) Report.

China claimed the largest market for semiconductor equipment for the second time with sales expanding 58 percent to $29.6 billion to mark the fourth consecutive year of growth.

Korea the second-largest equipment market registered a sales increase of 55 percent to $25.0 billion after showing strong growth in 2020.

Taiwan logged 45 percent growth to $24.9 billion to claim the third position.

Annual semiconductor equipment spending increased 23 percent in Europe and 17 percent in North America which continues to recover from a contraction in 2020. Sales in Rest of the World jumped 79 percent in 2021.

Ajit Manocha SEMI president and CEO says: “The 44 percent increase in manufacturing equipment spending in 2021 highlights the global semiconductor industry’s aggressive push to add capacity.

“This drive to expand production capabilities extends beyond the current supply imbalance as the industry continues to ramp up to address a wide range of emerging high-tech applications that will enable a smarter digital world with countless social benefits.”

Global sales of wafer processing equipment rose 44 percent in 2021 while other front-end segment sales grew 22 percent.

Assembly and packaging showed exceptional growth across all regions resulting in an 87 percent market increase in 2021 while total test equipment sales rose 30 percent.

Compiled from data submitted by members of SEMI and the Semiconductor Equipment Association of Japan the Worldwide SEMS Report is a summary of the monthly billings figures for the global semiconductor equipment industry.

Equipment categories cover wafer processing assembly and packaging test and other front-end equipment including mask/reticle manufacturing wafer manufacturing and fab facilities.

In March Synaptics showcased innovations at tinyML Summit including edge AI tech with low-power SoCs relying on neural network engines for vision sound-detection and speech processing. In an industrial setting the technology can be used to remotely read multiple digital meters at once eliminating the need to create separate connections for each meter.

While such innovations are cutting-edge Synaptics has seen its share price plummet in recent months. There’s constant pressure on all semiconductor designers—not just Synaptics-- to iterate new products in a changing economy slammed by persistent supply shortages aggressive inflation and a growing war in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion there. Hurlston took the helm at Synaptics in 2019 after an impressive career in the tech industry including years at Broadcom as general manager of mobile connectivity products. He holds advanced degrees in electrical engineering and business administration.

In a wide-ranging interview with Fierce Electronics he addressed tech labor shortages supply chain problems and rising chip prices the need for R&D to continue to innovate competition with China the future of IoT and AI and the growing market for chips in automotive.

Despite it all Hurlston claims to love his job.

(The following interview excerpts have been edited for brevity and clarity.)

FE: How big is the IoT market for Synaptics and has the overall market progressed as quickly as you’d like especially for Industrial IoT?

Hurlston: Our revenue from what we call IoT is roughly $1 billion while the total addressable market is $20 billion to $25 billion. Our IoT is made up of a bunch of sub-sections such as wireless products like drones video surveillance and meter readers a mix of consumer and industrial videoconferencing chips docking stations and more. Overall we’re pretty broad with overall revenues of $1.5 billion to $2 billion.

Industrial IoT has been relatively slow and is not moving as fast as people projected. Consumer IoT is obviously a lot bigger. Automotive has been slow but we are starting to see a V in the curve with meaningful revenues in display drivers for auto. Our heritage has been a lot around touch and the circuit we make for auto has been the display driver and touch. It’s already a $100 million market for us and we think that can be bigger.

FE: Has Synaptics been affected much by materials shortages and how will that change this year with the war in Ukraine and the impact of inflation?

Hurlston: We have been hit hard in our supply chain and our customers have been hit hard by our inability to supply them in turn. It’s far short from what the demand is. We don’t see a near-term end of that. Despite all that it will come to an end and then we see outsized growth will cool.

Semiconductors are in so many devices now. Who would have imaged the automobile would become a collection of semiconductor devices? Semiconductors are growing a lot faster than expected. This really rapid growth with the pandemic is naturally going to slow down. People don’t think the current growth rate is sustainable.

FE: What’s been the impact of these macroeconomic gyrations on your company in particular?

Hurlston: Our share price is down 45% from the peak in November from $300 down to $160 [$153 on April 15]—a huge drop which obviously has had a big impact. There’s the Ukraine crisis inflation fears and a lot of worries. The share plummet has been a real shock. It’s quite sobering. Still we’re optimistic our internal numbers are good and we’re out of sync with the market. We’re actually hiring.

FE: How difficult is it to hire the talent you need?

Hurlston: Our biggest problem is getting talent. Wage inflation is probably outpacing the consumer market. The war for talent in tech is just immense and there are no safe harbors. We hire in the U.S.. Taiwan China Poland Israel UK and France. We can’t hire anywhere and job poaching is really tough. That’s one of the reasons we opened in an office in France to get as wide a footprint as possible.

FE: How successful have you been in working with colleges to get talent more directly?

Hurlston: We have plans to work with others in education and have kicked off an initiative to hire interns around the world in the U.S. and Poland. We were a little bit slower than we could have been.

FE: Some companies are working directly with community colleges in the U.S. because not all tech jobs require the top engineering degrees. Is that the kind of approach that’s needed?

Hurlston: Creativity is what’s required. Very few young engineers are coming out of universities and the U.S. has a particular problem. It’s a big concern of how we strike a balance to get hardware engineers with an EE major. Most grads want computer science jobs to work at places like Facebook and very few coming out are semiconductor engineers. The U.S. is losing competitiveness in this area. China is cranking out a lot of young engineers and they realize how important semiconductor engineering is. I feel that’s a major concern for anybody in this industry.

We have a footprint in China and a development center. There are super talented engineers in China and of course there’s a big pull from state-owned enterprises and companies fueled by the government and they pay outrageous salaries. The multinational companies used to be the big payers but that’s not true anymore.

FE: Do you think tech R&D may suffer in the economic climate that’s emerging?

Hurlston: The number of semiconductors going to IoT is exploding and that trend is not changing. Our spending on R&D has gone up the last few quarters and we have to weigh the short-term headwinds on price and the long-term macroeconomics in play. We have to be careful we’re not trading off the long-term market with some short-term concerns. We have to balance that every single day. Our tendency is to continue our R&D and spend assuming the markets work out.

FE: What percentage do you devote to your R&D?

Hurlston: It’s 20% about $100 million a quarter on $500 million in revenue.

FE: How do you determine the R&D value?

Hurlston: It’s a matter of definition. We have a set of metrics and we are in markets where we have to continue to iterate devices to keep pace and to reinvent keep on the treadmill and we have to evolve the offering. For example we provide touch in smartphones in one business and are one of the leaders where we generate one or two new chips a year. We move the tech forward not by leaps or giant strides. It is evolutionary and that drives the vector for our R&D spend. There are some investments that are true bets that catalyze a market. The idea of intelligence at the edge of a network is more of an R than a D and while there’s not a big business there yet we think it will be something rather big so we see if we can invest in the market.

FE: With something like IoT how do you set out a unique differentiator from others?

Hurls ton: It really depends on the market you are talking about. With touch on a phone which icon is being touched? Are you able to do that when the phone is in the hand and when there’s moisture? Our customers test for that.

FE: How does the demand for lower power in chips affect you?

Hurlston: With almost everything we do power is an issue and so having lower power makes a difference. With AI at the edge we know that a big driver of the battery in a phone is the display so we have a face-detect AI algorithm. So when the phone is close to the face when someone’s in the act of talking on the phone we shut down the display. It’s a simple AI algorithm and we lock it in. Our phone manufacturing customers beat it up to death in testing so they are not having fake shutdowns. They try to trick it a hundred different ways.

Here's another example of AI and machine learning… Today we can do simple things like read license plates or read meters or count people. We can count people coming of a room. Instead of passing that task to a data center you resolve it on a chip and the advantage is power savings where you don’t need to have a big engine with passing back to the data center and the latency involved and ultimately the cost.

Take the example of a general purpose low-power camera handed to a customer with tinyML to do something like identify sick chickens in a chicken coop that are sneezing. That’s a very specific use case but a general purpose approach takes data and generates an ML model compiled onto a chip.

FE: With all we’ve discussed and the challenges what’s it like being a CEO in your industry?

Hurlston: I love the job no question. Dealing with different constituencies customers employees and shareholders all with a distinct point of view and trying to come up with an answer that is mostly right and trying to balance all that is becoming increasingly challenging. With ESG now that’s more complex and having to worry about the environment and social issues—our workforce cares and our shareholders care. There’s a lot of pressure on our suppliers. We ask them about greenhouse gases and water usage and different contaminant levels. We’re certainly getting pressure to run environmental issues down the supply chain and its really a topic of conversation up and down.

FE: That brings me back to the supply chain and rising prices. Many times the price is much higher on some hard-to-find chips compared to two years ago.

Hurlston: TSMC said it was raising prices 20% on some chips and they are our largest supplier so our costs were up 20% and we were able to pass 20% on to customers.

FE: Some chip customers are willing to pay a much higher price than 20% more for certain chips just because they are so vital. Without a certain chip there’s no OEM product. It’s been rather a wake-up call don’t you think?

Hurlston: These past months have taught us that they semiconductors are super super important. I don’t believe we are going to see a reset in the price equation any time soon if ever. These new prices have more staying power.

In the wake of the recent sanctions imposed on Russia its government is developing a rather ambitious plan to become more independent from western technology. It involves a massive investment in domestic chip development and manufacturing and training personnel in this field.

Following the invasion of Ukraine Russia got hit with an unprecedented amount of international sanctions. While this has undoubtedly crippled the Russian economy it also cut off their access to an essential resource in this day and age semiconductors.

Companies like Intel AMD and IBM have stopped selling their products in Russia leaving the country unable to source western chips. While they could design the silicon themselves manufacturing them wouldn't be possible as foundries like TSMC and GlobalFoundries also halted sales to Russia and third parties that supplied to Russia.

The Russian government has devised a preliminary plan to tackle the issue. It involves investing around 3.19 trillion rubles ($38.3 billion) in developing the local microelectronics industry. This money will go to four main areas: development of local semiconductor fabrication technologies domestic chip development marketing of the said chips and training the local talent.

Approximately 420 billion rubles ($5 billion) will get invested in developing newer fabrication nodes and ramping up production. Russia aims to ramp up the local chip production using a 90 nm node by the end of the year. By 2030 they intend to manufacture chips using a 28nm process technology something TSMC did in 2011.

Russia also plans to launch a program this year that will focus on reverse engineering western electronics and eventually manufacturing them within Russian borders or in China. The finalized plan will be sent for official approval by the prime minister on April 22.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvY29ucy1wcm9kdWN0cy9lbGVjdHJvbmljcy9pbmRpYXMtY2hpcC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXB1c2gtdGltZWx5LWFtaWQtZ2xvYmFsLXN1cHBseS1kaXNydXB0aW9ucy1oY2wtY28tZm91bmRlci9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MDg5MTE1Mi5jbXPSAa8BaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2NvbnMtcHJvZHVjdHMvZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MvaW5kaWFzLWNoaXAtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1wdXNoLXRpbWVseS1hbWlkLWdsb2JhbC1zdXBwbHktZGlzcnVwdGlvbnMtaGNsLWNvLWZvdW5kZXIvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwODkxMTUyLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's chip manufacturing push timely amid global supply disruptions: HCL co-founder,"Find this comment offensive?

Korea Times file



By Lee Kyung-min



Major semiconductor firms are raising employee salaries to tackle a shortage of skilled professionals in the high-tech industry an effort underpinned by the government's policy to nurture young experts to strengthen the country's growth driver according to industry watchers Sunday.



The industry-wide move coincides with Korea's key semiconductor manufacturers revising their human resources policies to promote the early education and training of young high-achieving undergrads to reduce costs needed to train entry-level employees that have little to no experience in and knowledge of chipmaking.



The presidential transition committee said April 13 that the incoming Yoon Suk-yeol administration will create education and training courses to offset a feared shortage of about 30000 workers over the next decade.



Samsung Electronics has yet to set this year's salary raise but is expected to maintain last year's rate of 7.5 percent year on year.



Its major competitor SK hynix's rate was 8 percent last year and the entry-level salary was raised to 50.4 million won ($40992). This is higher than the 48 million won offered by Samsung Electronics and DB HiTek a local foundry firm.



The rush to offer greater monetary incentives is in line with a number of local universities seeking to establish learning courses to let high-achieving undergraduates to be contracted to begin their professional careers at the Samsung and SK affiliates.



Samsung Electronics opened the course in cooperation with Yonsei and Sungkyunkwan universities Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH).



SK hynix opened such courses at Korea University to be followed by Sogang and Hanyang universities this year.



Courses taught at the seven universities will foster experts in the logic chip industry an area where Korea lags far behind global competitor TSMC of Taiwan. Other programs will train students to help Korea remain as the global top player in the memory chip industry.



Data from the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) showed that Korea suffered a shortage of 1621 workers in the semiconductor industry in 2020 compared to 1332 in 2015.



The China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) said in a report last year that the world's second-largest economy will face a shortage of 200000 workers in the semiconductor industry next year.



Some 3500 non-U.S. semiconductor experts it added will be needed in the U.S. which will see a shortage of 27000 such workers a decade from now following a rapid expansion in the number of semiconductor manufacturing plants.

Explained here | Mint,"Twitter is trying to thwart billionaire Elon Musk's takeover attempt with a “poison pill"" - a financial device that companies have been wielding against unwelcome suitors for decades.

WHAT ARE POISON PILLS SUPPOSED TO DO?

The ingredients of each poison pill vary but they're all designed to give corporate boards an option to flood the market with so much newly created stock that a takeover becomes prohibitively expensive. The strategy was popularised back in the 1980s when publicly held companies were being stalked by corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn - now more frequently described as “activist investors.""

Twitter didn't disclose the details of its poison pill Friday but said it would provide more information in a forthcoming filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission which the company delayed because public markets were closed Friday.

The San Francisco company's plan will be triggered if a shareholder accumulates a stake of 15 per cent or more. Musk best known as CEO of electric car maker Tesla currently holds a roughly 9 per cent stake.

CAN A POISON PILL BE A NEGOTIATING PLOY?

Although they are supposed to help prevent an unsolicited takeover poison pills also often open the door to further negotiations that can force a bidder to sweeten the deal. If a higher price makes sense to the board a poison pill can simply be cast aside along with the acrimony it provoked clearing the way for a sale to completed.

True to form Twitter left its door open by emphasising that its poison pill won't prevent its board from “engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal"" at a higher price.

Adopting a poison pill also frequently results in lawsuits alleging that a corporate board and management team is using the tactic to keep their jobs against the best interests of shareholders. These complaints are sometimes filed by shareholders who think a takeover offer is fair and want to cash out at that price or by the bidder vying to make the purchase.

HOW DID ELON MUSK REACT TO TWITTER'S ANNOUNCEMENT?

Musk a prolific tweeter with 82 million followers on Twitter had no immediate reaction to the company's poison pill. But on Thursday he indicated he was ready to wage a legal battle.

“If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests they would be breaching their fiduciary duty"" Musk tweeted. “The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale.""

Musk has publicly said that its USD 43 billion bid is his best and final offer for Twitter but other corporate suitors have made similar statements before ultimately upping the ante. With an estimated fortune of USD 265 billion Musk would seem to have deep enough pockets to raise his offer although he is still working out how to finance the proposed purchase.

HOW HAS THIS DEFENCE WORKED IN THE PAST?

Takeover tussles often dissolve into gamesmanship that include poison pills and other maneuvers designed to make a buyout more difficult. That's what happened in one of the biggest and most drawn out takeover dances in Silicon Valley history..

After business software maker Oracle made an unsolicited USD 5.1 billion offer for its smaller rival PeopleSoft in June 2003 the two companies spent the next 18 months fighting with each other.

As part of its defense PeopleSoft not only adopted a poison pill that authorised the board to flood the market with more shares it also created what it called a “customer assurance programme."" That plan promised to pay customers five times the cost of their software licenses if PeopleSoft was sold within the next two years creating an estimated liability of up to USD 800 million for an acquiring company.

PeopleSoft also got another helping hand when the US Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit seek to block a takeover although a judge ruled in Oracle's favour.

Even though the company ended up selling to Oracle PeopleSoft's defence strategy paid off for its shareholders. Oracle's final purchase price was USD 11.1 billion - more than twice its original bid.

Palo Alto Networks partnered with the cloud provider to offer a managed firewall service designed to simplify securing AWS deployments.

Jeff Barr vice president and chief evangelist at AWS explains the benefits of Cloud NGFW for AWS:

Palo Alto Networks pioneered the concept of deep packet inspection in their NGFWs. Cloud NGFW for AWS can decrypt network packets look inside and then identify applications using signatures protocol decoding behavioural analysis and heuristics. This gives you the ability to implement fine-grained application-centric security management that is more effective than simpler models that are based solely on ports protocols and IP addresses.

With Advanced URL filtering customers can create rules to identify and handle network traffic based on feeds curated lists of sites that distribute viruses spyware and other types of malware. Other supported Palo Alto technologies are Threat Prevention to stop known vulnerability exploits and malware and App-ID to reduce the risk of attack by controlling traffic based on Layer 7 traffic classification.

Source: https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/blogs/how-native-is-cloud-ngfw-for-aws/ba-p/476736

Cloud NGFW can control traffic across VPCs without inserting IPS appliances to monitor and protect cloud workloads. Using Palo Alto’s technology on AWS was previously possible but not easy to set up requiring either a VPN connection or a so-called VPC insertion. Moreover the customer had to manage the firewall and the scaling of the infrastructure.

The cybersecurity company released a Getting Started with Cloud NGFW for AWS guide to document the setup of the new service and explains on its tech blog:

Cloud NGFW supports a variety of deployment scenarios. You can use AWS gateways such as Internet Gateway NAT gateway and Transit gateway in conjunction with NGFW endpoint(s) and VPC routing to support distributed and centralised deployment architectures. Cloud NGFW acts as a bump-in-the-wire in outbound east-west and inbound traffic paths in these architectures. The traffic packet headers and payload remain intact providing complete visibility to the destination (no SNAT/DNAT).

Nick Matthews principal product manager at AWS tweets about the partnership:

I think this is pretty cool - Palo Alto as a Service within AWS. We've talked for years about how we could enable third party services 'as a checkbox' and it's finally coming to fruition.

Matthews adds:

I think the elegant part here is these firewalls show up as a single network interface in your VPC - you're not messing with a stack of firewalls and load balancers and symmetry etc.

Amazon Firewall Manager supports other types of firewalls too: AWS WAF Shield Advanced VPC security groups AWS Network Firewall and Route 53 DNS Resolver DNS Firewall.

AWS Firewall Manager and Cloud NGFW are regional services with Cloud NGFW currently supported only in the Northern Virginia and Northern California regions. The service is available as a pay-as-you-go subscription in the AWS Marketplace and starts at $1.637/hr plus the traffic processed. The Threat Prevention and Advanced URL Filtering capabilities are charged separately.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2ludGVydmlldy9uZXRza29wZS11bmlmaWVkLXNhc2UtaXMtYXQtbGVhc3QtYS1kZWNhZGUtZnJvbS1wcmFjdGljYWxpdHkvMjAyMi8wNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netskope: Unified SASE Is at Least a Decade From Practicality,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/interview/netskope-unified-sase-is-at-least-a-decade-from-practicality/2022/04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2ludGVydmlldy9uZXRza29wZS11bmlmaWVkLXNhc2UtaXMtYXQtbGVhc3QtYS1kZWNhZGUtZnJvbS1wcmFjdGljYWxpdHkvMjAyMi8wNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2Vybm9vbi5jb20vMTctaGlnaGVzdC1wYXlpbmctY2l0aWVzLWluLXRoZS1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLWJheS1hcmVhLWZvci1zb2Z0d2FyZS1lbmdpbmVlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,17 Highest-Paying Cities in the San Francisco Bay Area for Software Engineers,"Too Long; Didn't Read

Of these the second is the more interesting partly because most humans especially journalists seem to be affected by it. It’s what leads them to assume that if someone is fabulously rich then she or he must be very smart. That’s why the super-rich are invariably surrounded by fawning sycophants – and also why they eventually come to believe that they themselves are geniuses.

Which brings us neatly to Peter Thiel Silicon Valley’s leading contrarian. With a net worth of perhaps $5bn (£3.9bn) he is undoubtedly rich though not in the Elon Musk Jeff Bezos or even Bill Gates league. But since he is the only public intellectual that the tech industry has produced there is a widespread belief that he must also be a deep thinker which is why organisations ask him to give “keynote” speeches.

The function of such addresses is to give an elevated tone to what are otherwise sordid proceedings which explains why Thiel was invited to address the 2022 bitcoin conference in Miami which was billed as “a four-day pilgrimage for those seeking greater freedom and individual sovereignty”. Given that the attendees at this shindig were likely subscribers to the view that he is a genius it was an easy gig for the great man. Think of it as Narendra Modi addressing the annual conference of the Bharatiya Janata party and you’ll get the general idea.

Thiel was there to tell the attendees that they were the Lord’s anointed. Bitcoin is the new gold that one day should take its place alongside the precious metal as the world’s store of value replacing equities (ie company shares) which at $115tn are currently much bigger than gold ($12tn). This will happen when the value of a single bitcoin (currently about £30000) will increase by at least a hundredfold making a single coin worth £3m. But it will only happen if a sinister cabal of old-world reactionaries – the “finance gerontocracy” of the veteran investor Warren Buffett Jamie Dimon (head of JP Morgan Chase) and Larry Fink (chief executive of BlackRock) – is defeated.

But if Thiel isn’t a genius or even a latterday Cicero he’s nevertheless dangerous

Stirring stuff eh? The strange thing is that this call to arms was delivered in such a shambling manner. Here is a literal transcription of the relevant passage starting 14 minutes into Thiel’s speech:

“Why has it [bitcoin] not yet converged with gold for um or even with the equity markets more broadly and what what is going to you know what is it going to take for this for this to happen? And ah I know that sort of the ways we oftentimes talk about um businesses or technologies you know how great the technology is how great the code is how great the math is you know how how it’s sort of innovative but I want to sort of suggest that we should maybe think of we should think of we should think of it at least in one dimension as sort of a political question and it’s a movement and it’s a political question whether this movement is going to um succeed or whether um whether the enemies of the movement are going to succeed in stopping us and so I want to maybe end with um you know an enemies list.”

Thiel’s rhetorical deficiencies make him an unlikely leader of a political movement. But the aphrodisiacal effect of his wealth meant that his speech was widely reported. Yet the strange thing is that his record as an investor seems patchy to say the least. He made his first pile from PayPal which was a shrewd bet. He was the first big investor in Facebook sure but then he tried to persuade Mark Zuckerberg to sell it to Yahoo for $1bn in 2006 and then sold much of his holding after the company’s IPO in 2012. He foresaw the banking catastrophe of 2008 but failed to sell out beforehand. And according to his biographer much of his wealth comes from his skill at finding clever ways to limit his tax exposure: his investments in Facebook Palantir and some others were made through a vehicle known as a Roth IRA that was originally intended for “ordinary” people – ie middle-class taxpayers. As David Runciman put it in his book review of Max Chafkin’s The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power: “Thiel is not a genius investor. He is like almost everyone else a nervous investor prone to panic and regret. He’s just another hedgie chasing his tail.”

But if Thiel isn’t a genius or even a latterday Cicero he’s nevertheless dangerous. In an essay published in 2009 he famously said that he no longer believed that freedom and democracy are compatible. And he’s using his money to try to change the balance of power in the deadlocked US Senate in the next round of congressional elections by giving two $10m donations to the Super Pacs that are backing two of his proteges JD Vance and Arizona Republican Blake Masters. In that sense Thiel looks less like a tech genius and more like the Koch Brothers – Charles and his late sibling David – who have done more to reshape Republican politics than anyone other than Donald J Trump. And that’s a good reason for taking him seriously whatever happens to bitcoin.

She called on companies to do more to address the matter.

Former PepsiCo Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi one of the most influential women business leaders in the world has asked companies to address gender pay gaps in stronger ways.

In an article in her newsletter “Insight” Indra Nooyi said she believed paying women less than men was a “burning hole in our collective conscience”.

Nooyi described the consequences of gender pay gap as “persistent and pernicious”. She said the matter affected almost every family.

“They (women) often start with a little less and they end up with far less because the issue compounds” Nooyi wrote. “Women are much more likely than men to be poor in old age.”

Nooyi added that for too long pay gap has been accepted as a fact and there have been endless arguments about its complexity.

""That has allowed the people at the top to hide behind excuses and to defer to slow-moving diversity equity and inclusion initiatives or to wait for public reporting or other legislation to play out” she added.

The 66-year-old executive asked senior business leaders to introspect.

“Ask yourself if you are doing the right thing. If this was your mother your sister your daughter would you treat them this way?” she added.

Nooyi called on companies to “set a bold tone” on the matter of pay gap.

“As we develop new post-pandemic employment routines big companies should set a bold tone for the whole economy on this issue. It’s about character -- the character of the company of the CEO of the human resources team and the board of directors.”

Nooyi had told Fortune magazine in an interview last year that asking for pay parity is an advice she gives to her own daughters.

The former PepsiCo CEO had drawn flak for saying in 2021 that she had never asked for a pay raise. Many saw it as her implying that even others should not ask for it.

Nooyi later clarified that it was neither a suggestion nor advice for others. She spoke about her and her husband being taught to never ask for anything growing up.

“I wish we were not that way. I wish we had the courage to go ask for. Whatever we had we thought was a lot"" she told Fortune.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vODM0NTg3L3RoZS11bmV4cGVjdGVkLXJlYXNvbi1tb3VudGFpbi1kZXctd2FzLWludmVudGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Unexpected Reason Mountain Dew Was Invented,"The Unexpected Reason Mountain Dew Was Invented

Love it or hate it there's no denying that Mtn Dew is one of the most unique sodas on the market. With a high caffeine and sugar content unusual flavoring wildly artificial coloring and a near cult-like fanbase of gamers and extreme sports enthusiasts almost everyone has a strong opinion about the soft drink but few people know how — or why — we were first invited to ""do the dew.""

Mtn Dew — formerly spelled Mountain Dew — was first obtained by PepsiCo in 1964 and was given its signature bright green coloring in 1974 according to Thrillist but it wasn't until the '90s that it became the brand we're all familiar with today. Pepsi made the decision to make the polarizing drink the official soft drink of extreme sports and changed the spelling of the name before introducing new flavors in 2001 solidifying its reputation as a pseudo-energy drink a reputation it would build on when Pepsi began marketing it to gamers. Since then the brand has expanded its line to include a dozen flavors including the new ""Legendary"" flavor coming exclusively to Buffalo Wild Wings.

But before it became the soft drink of choice for adrenaline junkies and online night owls it had a very different origin — one that was far from a ""soft"" drink. According to Mtn Dew's website the formula was first developed in the 1940s in Tennessee by brothers Ally and Barney Hartman. The reason? Smithsonian Magazine says it was because the brothers wanted a lemon-lime soda to mix with their whiskey!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L3BhdG5hL2JpaGFyLWNtLW5pdGlzaC1rdW1hci1vcGVucy1iYXJhdW5pLWJldmVyYWdlLXVuaXQtYmlnZ2VzdC1pbi1lYXN0ZXJuLWluZGlhL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwODcxNjI0LmNtc9IBlgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L3BhdG5hL2JpaGFyLWNtLW5pdGlzaC1rdW1hci1vcGVucy1iYXJhdW5pLWJldmVyYWdlLXVuaXQtYmlnZ2VzdC1pbi1lYXN0ZXJuLWluZGlhL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MDg3MTYyNC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bihar CM Nitish Kumar opens Barauni beverage unit biggest in eastern India,"BEGUSARAI: Chief minister Nitish Kumar inaugurated a beverage bottling plant arguably the largest in eastern and northeastern India on the premises of Industrial Growth Centre at Barauni on Friday.Varun Beverages Limited (VBL) one of the biggest franchisees of the multinational beverage company PepsiCo has set up the unit to produce beverages sold under various popular trademarks.To begin with the company has started production of carbonated soft drinks fruit juices and packaged drinking water.

There are four treatments currently available for the novel coronavirus however the most accessible and versatile is Paxlovid a medication that can now be prescribed to certain at-risk patients by a doctor.

""It's great to have this option"" Dr. Tara Kiran a family physician and Fidani Chair of Improvement and Innovation at the University of Toronto told CTV News Toronto this week.

""I think in the last couple of weeks when I've had people who've had COVID I've been referring them to our local COVID Assessment Centre and now we're getting all materials and processes in place in our own setting to feel comfortable being able to do this in a safe way for the right people.""

WHAT IS THIS TREATMENT?

Paxlovid is an oral medication that must be taken within five days of symptoms developing. Those taking the medication must take three pills twice a day for five consecutive days.

Kiran said that Paxlovid was originally studied in ""unvaccinated patients in the Delta era"" but there has been some research that suggests it's also effective with the Omicron variant.

""Scientific experts have said that if people are at high risk of progressing to serious illness then this is a medication where the benefits likely outweigh the risks and should be considered"" Kiran said. ""And they've made it clear kind of based on age and chronic conditions and the number of vaccination doses you have whether you would be considered high risk or not.""

WHO CAN GET IT?

The treatment is recommended for people who are at higher risk of severe symptoms or hospitalizations and not for the general public.

Earlier this week the province released a list of groups that are now eligible both for the antiviral treatment as well as PCR tests:

• Individuals aged 18 and up who are immunocompromised

• Individuals aged 70 and up

• Individuals aged 60 and up with fewer than three vaccine doses

• Individuals aged 18 and up with fewer than three vaccine doses and at least one risk condition (for example a chronic illness heart disease obesity diabetes ect.)

Individuals experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 can also take an online assessment on the province's website to determine if they should seek treatment.

The province has also said that a health-care provider may prescribe Paxlovid to those outside of these groups based on individual circumstances.

WILL MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBE IT TO ME?

Eligible individuals are being urged to contact their family doctor to discuss whether this antiviral treatment is right for them prior to potentially contracting the virus.

Kiran said that eligible individuals should come prepared with a list of medications they are currently taking.

""(Paxlovid) does have some potentially very serious drug interactions"" she said. ""And so we need to be careful about weighing the risks and benefits.""

Prior to asking a doctor to prescribe the medications patients should also confirm they actually have COVID-19 by taking either a rapid antigen test or going to a clinical assessment centre for a PCR test.

However Kiran urged people experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 who test negative on a rapid test to also get a PCR test as they are far more accurate.

WHERE CAN I GET THE DRUGS?

Paxlovid can be obtained at a clinical assessment centre or one of more than 2000 pharmacies across Ontario with a prescription from a doctor. The provincial government says that it anticipates additional pharmacies to take part in the program.

A full list of pharmacies dispensing the antiviral treatment can be found here.

ARE THERE OTHER ANTIVIRAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE?

There are two other medications that can be prescribed by a doctor to help alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19. The first is budesonide an inhaled medication the COVID-19 Science Advisory Table said had the potential to reduce recovery time by a median of three days.

The other medication is Fluvoxamine an oral pill primarily used as an antidepressant but studies suggest it could reduce risk of severe symptoms and hospitalization.

""Both of these medications have been found to be helpful to treat COVID"" Kiran said adding that "" they're not as helpful as Paxlovid.""

A fourth treatment option is Remdesivir a medication that must be taken intravenously at a COVID-19 clinical assessment centre or hospital once daily for three days.

DO I STILL NEED TO GET A COVID-19 VACCINE?

Health experts have said that while Paxlovid can help in reducing symptoms of COVID-19 and lessen the likelihood of hospitalization and death it does not provide the same level of protection as multiple doses of a vaccine especially when paired with public health measures such as masking and physical distancing.

""What we want to do more than anything is prevent you from having COVID in the first place"" Kiran said. ""So get the vaccines that are recommended for you. That's so important.""

""There's a lot of buzz about Paxlovid but I think it should always be in context of like prevention is better than cure.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiImh0dHBzOi8vdm9pLmlkL2ZyL2RlLXNwb3J0cy8xNTc1MTjSARxodHRwczovL3ZvaS5pZC9mci9hbXAvMTU3NTE4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sexy Boxer Ebanie Bridges Says Her Breasts Are Bigger Because Of The Pfizer Vaccine,"JAKARTA - Australian boxer Ebanie Bridges said her quality is often overlooked because people are more interested in her breasts.

In January 2021 Bridges said that her breasts grew after being vaccinated against COVID-19.

The 35-year-old woman commented on an article claiming that the Pfizer vaccine causes women's breasts to become bigger.

""No lie I've been feeling my boobs are big lately... definitely from the vaccines it's all starting to make sense"" she wrote on Twitter at the time.

Bridges herself beat Maria Cecilia Roman to become the IBF bantamweight champion in March and some fans are finally starting to recognize her abilities.

After Brigdes posted a video of his victory against Roman on Twitter one of his followers stated that he had underestimated the Blondie Bomber's boxing abilities.

""Totally wrong about Ebanie Bridges much better than I thought"" the message reads.

Bridges later tweeted the message and stated that he was used to the lack of recognition for his boxing abilities.

""You must be bothered by my breasts and can't see the skills"" he said.

""Don't worry you're not alone lots of haters out there can't forget my boobs... Glad you can see that you're wrong.""

Not only that. Bridges also launched a scathing attack on his critics.

""Fuck you guys who think I can't fight"" he told DAZN Sports.

""I can fight. I can box I can fight and I can look cool on the scales so hopefully I've proved a lot of doubters wrong.""

According to Permanent Secretary Doctor James Fong their vaccination team is currently discussing further details with counterparts in New Zealand while efforts to source more through other development partners are ongoing.

He says their school vaccination program has also been progressing as 88% of all persons over 12 years have had two doses of the COVID 19 vaccine.

Doctor Fong also adds that since the lifting of quarantine measures and increased international travel the community and border surveillance screening data continue to report a low positivity rate despite the ongoing pandemic and the continued evolution of Omicron variants.

He adds they also note the risk of transmission in children under 12 years of age and are exploring the option of requiring children under the age of 12 to also undergo pre-departure testing before traveling to Fiji.

Currently inbound travelers aged 12 years and above must produce proof of a pre-booked and pre-paid rapid antigen test to be administered after 48 hours but before 72 hours of arrival in Fiji.

Doctor Fong says there will be exemptions for those who have tested positive and recovered from COVID-19 within the 30 days before travel and have fit-to-fly certificates.

Failure to comply with arrival testing once in Fiji will result in a spot fine of $1000.

Doctor Fong stressed the measures that will continue in terms of prevention are the promotion of vaccination personal COVID-safe hygiene habits and workplace ventilation and air cleaning measures.",,,

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Portland won the game 2-1 in double overtime taking the series 4-2. Advertisement

It’s all over for the Prince George Cougars.

Josh Davies ended the Cats’ terrific season 5:40 into double overtime with a gut-wrenching shot from 30 feet out sending the Portland Winterhawks to the WHL championship series with a 2-1 victory in Game 6 of the Western Conference championship Monday at CN Centre.

The longest game in Prince George’s 30-year WHL history ended in sudden death and it came seconds after Borya Valis’s close-range shot at immortality at the other end of the rink was blocked by Portland defenceman Tyson Jugnauth. The puck skipped to Josh Mori who fed it up to Davies and he wired a low wrist shot into the far corner behind Joshua Ravensbergen.

“They got a couple good chances in our end and we got a good block Josh Mori made a nice play and I joined the rush and after that I kind of blacked out” said Davies. “I saw the puck go in the net and the rest is history.

“Our team was ready for big moments like this this is what we grinded out all year for. Now that the moment has come we couldn’t be happier. We’re in the dance now and we’re ready to go.”

The Winterhawks will now await the winner of the Saskatoon Blades-Moose Jaw Warriors series to determine who they will be playing in the next round.

Davies a Florida Panthers draft pick in 2022 missed four games of the series with an injury and his return to the lineup after being sidelined in Game 1 came just in time for the ‘Hawks.

Both teams had glorious chances to end it in the first overtime period.

Portland failed to convert a 3-on-1 chance just before the three-minute mark when Ravensbergen stuffed the shot from Diego Buttazzoni. Thirteen minutes into overtime ‘Hawks captain Gabe Klassen got the puck in deep and tried to tuck it between the goalie’s legs but Ravensbergen somehow came up with the stop.

The Winterhawks took a penalty 8:20 into overtime and came out of it unscathed holding the P.G. power play without a shot. The Cougars buzzed the net numerous times with great looks but came up empty trying to put one past Spunar.

The opening goal of the game came with a minute left in the second period but nobody knew that for certain until after the clock had run out. The goal from Winterhawks exquisite playmaker Nate Danielson came as a result of a close-in shot that crossed the line and was instantly cleared by Cougars defenceman Hudson Thornton as the Portland players briefly celebrated. The play continued and the period ended with Thornton bouncing a high shot that nearly found the back of the Portland net behind Jan Spunar.

The Cougar coaching staff was already heading into the locker room when video goal judge Lance Van Helvoirt confirmed Danielson’s shot had indeed crossed the goal line. He got on the phone with referee Bobby Jo Love to tell him it was a good goal giving the Hawks a 1-0 lead to take into the second intermission.

It didn’t take long for the Cougars to tie it up.

Zac Funk gained the puck behind the goal line and pushed it over to Riley Heidt who wasted no time dumping it out into the slot for Valis who blasted it in for his ninth of the playoffs much to the delight of Cougar fans in a sellout crowd of 6016 who leapt to their feet with an ear-splitting roar.

Both teams had their chances gunning for the go-ahead goal. Mori joined the rush and Ravensbergen kicked out a dangerous-looking shot just before the Cougars went on the power play midway through the third period. The puck was in the Portland zone for most of that two-minute session but they couldn’t beat Spunar.

With less than two minutes left in regulation time Chase Pauls made a nice play with his glove at the blueline to knock down a Portland clearing attempt and his shot deflected off Ondrej Becher in the slot and just missed the net high.

Winterhawks head coach and general manager Mike Johnston noted that while the series produced a few lopsided scores he thought all six games reflected how close the two teams were. The Cougars finished just one point ahead of Portland atop the Western Conference standings and both teams raised their game in the series to an amazing level that produced highly-entertaining hockey that impressed everyone in the building.

“I know there was some games where there was a spread on the score and it looked like one team was maybe winning it easier but I don’t think through the whole series there was more than a one-goal difference between the teams” said Johnston. “Both teams played outstanding in the series. Both teams have a core of really good players and both play a style that up-tempo and fast as you saw tonight.

“I’ve been on the other side with a good team like P.G. had and you’re home trying to squeeze it out and you miss it. We were fortunate You got to get a bounce and we got a bounce. It was a big character win for us because we were down a few players. Playing a series without (Luca) Cagnoni our top-minute defenceman was a big loss for us but they lost (Terik) Parascak a really key player for them.”

The Winterhawks were eliminated in the second round in the previous two playoff years and Johnston said the core of his team learned from that and used it to overcome their adversity this season.

“Now we pushed through the third round it’s hard in playoffs” he said. “Getting that experience with P.G. having a lot of returning players they’ve got to be one of the favourites heading into next year.”

If that is the case Cougar overagers Funk Thornton and Pauls won’t be there to see it having now played their last junior hockey game.

“I’m almost speechless it’s such a tough feeling honestly” said Thornton the Cougar captain after spending about half an hour after the game in the room with his teammates. We’ve been through so much this year as a group and we’ve come so far and this city deserves so much.

“We try to give our best every single night and at the end of this you wanted to give them a championship and obviously we didn’t do that so it’s pretty disappointing. Overall we had a tremendous season and the group that we have is so special we’re brothers for life.”

The Cougars established franchise records for wins and points and finished the season as the No. 1 ranked team in Canada. They truly believed they had what it took to go all the way.

“That’s what’s so disappointing and the guys really feel it we didn’t think we were going to lose” said Cougars head coach and general manager Mark Lamb. “It was a really good year when you get by the disappointment which I can’t get by right now yet. When I look back in a couple days and reflect on it it will be a lot better but it really hurts right now.

“Winning is so so hard and the guys really got a feeling of it tonight. They played so well bit they will learn. Portland is a winning organization and they have been for a few years now and we look at that and that’s where we’re at now. We’re turning into one of those organizations .”

Spunar picked up his 12th win in 14 playoff starts and looked unbeatable at times as did Cougar goalie Josh Ravensbergen and they put on a classic goaltending clinic with both teams testing them relentlessly. The Cougars outshot Portland 49-38.

Just as they did in their two wins in the series in Portland the Winterhawks got off to a great start and the 17-year-old rookie Ravensbergen was the reason they were not be down by a goal or two after the opening period.

Led by Danielson the WHL’s player of the week who came into Monday’s game with a goal and nine assists in the series the ‘Hawks forced the Cougar goalie to make three saves in the opening minute.

The Cougars finally got their offence untracked on a four-minute power play that came 4:17 in when Davies took exception to Nick McLennan’s crushing hit that knocked Ryan Miller off his feet and into the boards and was served a double roughing penalty.

The penalty came seconds after Davies was denied by spectacular glove stop from Ravensbergen off the rush on a feed into the slot from Miller. With Davies in the box came close a couple times but the 19-year-old Czechian goalie was locked in on the task at hand.

Portland came out guns-a-blazing in the second period and severely tested Ravensbergen at least three times in the first five minutes including a glove stop to deny Kyle Chyzowski on a 2-on-1 setup and keep the game scoreless.

Inspired by their goalie’s heroic efforts the Cougars were finally able to deliver sustained pressure for the first time since their extended power play in the first period. The Funk-Heidt-Valis line delivered a dominant shift and threw everything but the kitchen sink at Spunar and he had to come up with three huge saves.

The Eastern Conference final resumes with Game 7 Tuesday night in Saskatoon. Four of the six games in the series have required overtime.

LOOSE PUCKS: The Cougars’ previous longest game happened April 10 1997 in Game 1 of the Western final in Seattle. Peter Roed ended it for the Cougars 1:59 into the second overtime. The Thunderbirds went on to win that third-round series in six games … The Winterhawks will board an Air Canada charter for the flight back to Portland Tuesday morning … Cats forward Hunter Laing was named the WHL’s rookie of the week.

Even though the habit of smoking is relatively less in the lives of athletes from time immemorial how often do we encounter them having a puff? Limited or even nil to some point. Considering that with an F1 driver that’s not a luxury they can afford.

F1 drivers are highly trained professionals. Not only do they need to put their 100% into the race week but also they need to be fit for the race to a whole different level. The drivers have core strengths a few other professionals can match. For every driver the core strength is very important and that comes from the functioning of the internal organs perfectly.

It is believed that smoking damages the lungs and causes cancer. Hence a damaged pair of lungs can be very crucial in determining a driver’s long run in the sport. A healthy driver’s heart rate is 45-50 BPM and when racing it can even reach up to 200 BPM. So it’s very important for drivers to have healthy diets and certainly smoking is a big no for them.

Some drivers who smoked publicly

As the drivers have their personal preferences some smoked in private whereas some were public in their approach. A few big names who smoked are the seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher James Hunt Kimi Raikkonen Jules Bianchi and of course 2016 F1 World Champion Nico Rosberg and his father Keke Rosberg. Talking about their smoking it is believed that Michael loved his cigar and Nico was quite open about it.

Among all the drivers named above James Hunt topped the list. The 1976 Champion was a chain smoker. Seeing his other habits we could also call him a “party animal.” Hunt was a brave fearless and gifted driver who used to smoke and drink even minutes before the race. Unfortunately James died of a massive heart attack in 1993 in his native home in Great Britain.

The biggest tobacco sponsorships in F1

Interestingly in the earlier days of motorsports cigarette brands were popular and the biggest sponsors. Smoking back then was not only cool but also appealing. In the 1970s and 1980s tobacco branding gripped the sport like nothing else. From brand logos showing on the cars to the uniforms and trackside advertisements brands took over everything to gain exposure on TV. Some of the biggest brands like Marlboro Philip Morris John Player Benson and Hedges etc even sponsored teams.

After the World Health Organization (WHO) banned all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship companies were forced to remove all cigarette branding. Soon after the clampdown began against these public advertisements and sponsorships the companies started going back door.

According to the STOP (Stopping Tobacco Organizations and Products) report British American Tobacco (BAT) paid McLaren an estimated $20 million during the 2019 season while Philip Morris International (PMI) paid Ferrari an estimated $75 million. Ferrari continued to showcase PMI’s Mission Winnow on their car uniform and on boards. Meanwhile McLaren did that with Lyft Vype and Vuse (BAT’s tobacco alternative products). Even in 2020 the report suggests that F1 has made more than $100 million from tobacco brands.

Is weed allowed in F1?

Even though many sports have a history of weed addiction F1 is different. Weed or Dope are often considered performance enhancers however they’re the least found in F1 drivers. In fact the Motorsports drivers under FIA are one of the least active dope users according to the reports.

Talking about this former FIA medical delegate Dr. Gary Hartstein told the UAE’s The National in 2013. “Those guys are clean. I don’t say that because I am optimistic or naive I say it because I was deeply involved in the FIA’s anti-doping and I know what these guys need to drive to the best of their ability. There is nothing on the prohibited list that would allow them to do that period. And they know that.”

To be an F1 driver one needs to have great mental and physical endurance good concentration muscle strength (particularly in the neck and upper body) a hefty dose of talent and lightning-quick reaction times. And none of this would work if the drivers are too down with weed.

Why F1 doesn’t have doping scandals?

Tomas Enge a Czech former racing driver was sanctioned by FIA twice for doping. He is the only F1 driver to have ever failed a drugs test. Enge took part in three F1 races and that was all before he was caught in 2012 for taking banned substances. The list of banned substances includes cocaine cannabis etc.

WATCH THIS STORY: Most Dangerous Crashes In F1 History

Although there are multiple random drug tests throughout the season in F1 almost all the drivers pass those tests. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that if a driver consumes drugs he not only risks his life but also the lives of other drivers and even the Marshalls that are on the track.",,,,,,,,,,,,

World Record – Katinka Hosszu 2:06.12 (2015)

American Record – Ariana Kukors 2:06.15 (2009)

U.S. Open Record- Kathleen Baker  2:08.32 (2018)

2021 Olympic Trials Champion- Alex Walsh  2:09.30

 2:09.30 FINA ‘A’ Cut- 2:12.98

At the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials the top three in the women’s 200 IM were just .04 of a second apart with Alex Walsh and Kate Douglass going 1-2 to make the Olympic team by a hair. However the two dropped significant amounts of time from trials which culminated in them taking the silver and bronze medals at the Tokyo games and being established as world-class in the event.

The Favorites

Walsh and Douglass’s Olympics performances as well as a dominant NCAA showcasing in which they combined for six individual titles and four American records make the Virginia duo the favorites to replicate their Olympic trials finish and qualify for World Championships this year.

Alex Walsh the reigning Olympic silver medalist has established herself as America’s top IMer in the course of a year. She holds a best time of 2:08.65 from Tokyo where she was just 0.13 seconds short of becoming an Olympic champion. Recently she added another honor to her resume when she broke Ella Eastin’s NCAA US Open and American record in the 200-yard IM with a time of 1:50.08 to win a national title.

We’ve only seen Walsh swim the event in long course once this year when she went 2:11.96 at an intrasquad meet last week hence why possibilities for how she will perform at trials are endless. As the fourth-fastest American woman in the long course version of the event Walsh just needs to drop a few more tenths to take down Kathleen Baker’s U.S. Open record of 2:08.32.

Walsh’s college teammate Kate Douglass isn’t too shabby either. Douglass famously ran down Madisyn Cox in the final 50 meters of the 200 IM to finish second at U.S. trials and then did the same thing at the Olympics to snatch the bronze medal from Abbie Wood. Since then she has also won herself a bronze medal at the 2021 Short Course World Championships although her time of 2:04.24 (short course meters) from prelims would have been fast enough to win gold in the finals.

Despite the fact that Douglass broke three American records in her three individual wins at NCAAs she didn’t swim the 200 IM at the meet – meaning we haven’t seen her full potential in the event. Holding a long course best time of 2:09.04 it is very likely that she will be able to dip under 2:09 this year and go 1-2 with Walsh once more.

Young Guns and College Stars

The fastest time coming into trials belongs to rising sixteen year-old phenom Leah Hayes who clocked a 2:11.22 at the Westmont Pro Series in early March. A swimmer for the Fox Valley club in Illinois Hayes just missed out on an Olympic trials final when she finished tenth in the semifinals with a time of 2:12.89. Since then she has dropped 1.67 seconds in the event and will most likely be the top junior finisher at trials – rendering her a spot on the Junior Pan Pacs team.

Another junior swimmer who could make some noise in this event is USC commit Justina Kozan a high school senior who swims under Mark Schubert‘s The Swim Team. She finished 44th at Olympic trials last year and was well off her best time of 2:11.55 from 2019 but then she impressed us all when she clocked a 2:11.96 at the 2021 Speedo Summer Championships a few months later. In that swim she closed in a blistering 29.75 freestyle split which was faster than the last 50 of all of the Olympic finalists from Tokyo. If Kozan can drop another 2:11 and close really fast once more she is guaranteed to finish top 8.

Stanford swimmer Torri Huske was largely overshadowed by Walsh in the 200 IM race at NCAAs this year but she still swam a very fast time of 1:51.81 to place second. Although better known for her butterfly Huske dropped nearly two seconds in the 200-yard IM this year. She finished fourth at trials with a time of 2:10.38 and her incredible versatility in both long course and short course could have her placing very high in the event.

However there is a possibility that Huske will drop the 200 IM to focus on the 50 free which happens on the same day as the 200 IM. In fact the two events are only separated by the men’s 200 IM and the men’s 800 free giving her around 15 minutes of time in between.

Huske did the opposite at NCAAs going for the IM instead of the sprint despite having top 8 times in both events. Although that was because the field in the 50 free at NCAAs was much more crowded than the 200 IM field. At trials it will be a very different story. A 2:10 is fast but it’s likely Huske won’t be able to touch Walsh or Douglass if she doesn’t go at least a 2:09-mid. On the other hand Huske was third in the 50 free at 2021 trials just 0.16 away from making the Olympic team in the event. This year it looks to be a much more promising event for her so avoiding a double so she can have a stronger 50 free wouldn’t be surprising.

Evie Pfiefer who recently finished up her college career with Texas couldn’t get out of the semifinals in the event at 2021 trials finishing ninth with a time of 2:12.59. However her best time of 2:11.53 could have easily been top 8.

Leah Smith Beata Nelson and Melanie Margalis come in as the trio of veterans looking to redeem themselves after missing the Olympics last year.

Margalis holds a best time of 2:08.70 a time that would have been fast enough to medal in Tokyo. However that time was set back in 2017 and she hasn’t been able to hit that mark ever since.

A 2016 Olympic gold medalist Margalis failed to qualify for Tokyo and finished 6th in the 200 IM at trials with a time of 2:11.7. However she recently placed fourth behind Douglass in the event at Short Course Worlds and won a bronze medal in the 400 IM at the same meet. In addition her recent change in training base from Georgia to Georgia Tech may bring positive change for her. Although the 400 IM is more her forte there’s no doubt that the experience of multiple international meets under her belt will bring her good results in the 200 IM as well.

Leah Smith also recently switched training locations making the move from Arizona to Texas last fall. She didn’t swim the 200 IM at trials but put up a personal best time of 2:11.67 at the U.S. Open last December. We aren’t sure if she will be swimming the event though considering that she could put her full focus on events like the 200 free 400 free and 400 IM where she has a better chance of making the team.

Although she used to be primarily a mid-distance and distance freestyler she’s had some very impressive IM showcases after she began swimming for Carol Capitani and could very likely avenge her failure to make the Olympic team with a worlds berth.

A star in short course meters and short course yards Beata Nelson has never really made her way to international stardom in long course. She had a very successful season in the International Swimming League last fall which included breaking the American record in the 100 IM with a time of 57.72. However USA Swimming’s selection standards for Short Course Worlds which prioritized long course times snubbed her from racing at the meet.

Nelson finished seventh at trials last year with a time of 2:11.55 and has the second-fastest time in the country currently which is a 2:11.76 from the Westmont Pro Series.

Retired Or Not?

The biggest name from 2021 trials that won’t be swimming this year is Madisyn Cox. Last May she put up a time of 2:08.51 at an in-season meet which would have won gold at the Olympics. However she was a bit slower at trials going a 2:09.34 to miss a spot on the Olympic team by .02 of a second. She has since retired to go to med school but if she was still swimming she would definitely challenge Walsh and Douglass for a worlds berth.

Meghan Small and Emma Barksdale were both finalists at 2021 trials but neither of them have swum at a meet since then.

And what about Kathleen Baker the U.S. Open record holder who holds a faster PB than anyone that we’ve just listed? Last year she suffered a foot injury a month before trials which affected her performances and caused her to miss out on Tokyo. She failed to make finals in the 200 IM placing 12th with a time of 2:12.95 off her personal best of 2:08.32.

Baker has only swum in a few ISL meets after trials (she was entered in the San Antonio Pro Series but ended up not swimming) and we have received no confirmation on whether she will be swimming in Greensboro in two weeks. But if she’s fully healthy and ends up showing up we could have another contender in our hands.

Dark Horse – Katie Grimes: The Sandpipers of Nevada standout has a much better chance of making the Worlds team in the distance freestyles and the 400 IM but her coach Ron Atiken recently told SwimSwam that the 200 IM would also be in her trials lineup. Her best time is a 2:15.77 a far shot from the best. But her recent success in the 400 IM which includes posting a 4:00.66 in the event in yards at winter juniors make us wonder what her potential in the 200 IM is.

Keep up to date with all of SwimSwam’s previews for the meet with our official preview index here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVyY2l0eW1hZy5jb20vc29jaWV0eS9nbGVubi1iZWNrLXNvdXRoLWRha290YS1nb3Zlcm5vci1rcmlzdGktbm9lbS1ob3VzdG9uLWNodWNrLW5vcnJpcy1nYWxhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Glenn Beck and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem Are Drawn to Houston by Chuck Norris' Kicking $1 Million Gala,"Partygoers at the Kickstart Kids 29th annual Boots and Black Belts gala frolic to the sounds of Pat Green in the ballroom of the Hilton Americas-Houston.

What: The 29th annual Kickstart Kids’ Boots and Black Belts gala

Where: The Hilton Americas-Houston

PC Moment: Highlight for many in the gathering was the opportunity to rub shoulders with conservative political commentator Glenn Beck along with his wife Tania and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem best known at the moment for signing an order restricting the teaching of critical race theory in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms in her state.

Following a stirring martial arts performance by Kickstart Kids students and instructors generosity flowed as participants were plentiful during the paddle raise and during the live auction. The auction items alone were worth noting: a Chuck Norris tribute single action revolver a tour of Glenn Beck’s Mercury Studios and a catered lunch a trophy whitetail deer hunt a Bayou Place Ballroom party and a Taft McWhorter painting. It all added up to a $1 million night.

Close to 40 sponsors led by title sponsor American Telecast Products and Total Gym contributed to the evening that raised funds for the program that provides thousands of middle and high school students with valuable lessons in building character resiliency and community in order help them navigate the daily challenges of adolescence. The martial arts character development program was founded by martial arts world champion actor and philanthropist Chuck Norris in 1990. At that time it was named Kick Drugs out of America.

Norris and wife Gena Norris and Alice and Keith Mosing chaired the $1 million evening for which Kirksey Gregg Productions beautifully dressed the ballroom to theme.

Bristol Bears Women 0

Harry Scott-Munro at Sandy Park

These days don’t come around very often.

After a slow start Exeter Chiefs Women pulled out a performance of sheer quality to brush aside Westcountry rivals Bristol Bears 66-0 and secure their place in the inaugural Allianz Cup final against Harlequins.

The Chiefs scored ten tries in all Hope Rogers and Jennine Detiveaux bagging braces alongside further tries from Linde van der Velden Kate Zackary Clara Nielson Charlie Willett Daisy French and a penalty try.

Meg Foster and Gabby Cantorna slotted two conversions each whilst Patricia Garcia added an extra three to move past 100 points in a Chiefs jersey.

The cancelled match against Saracens meant that Susie Appleby’s side had gone three weeks without a match but on a beautiful sunny day in Devon any cobwebs were swiftly brushed away.

The rust didn’t show in the opening exchanges though as the hosts raced out of the traps. With the scrum forcing the Bears into reverse a shunt on halfway sent the Bears backwards at a rate of knots allowing Zackary to pick up from the base and charge half the length of the field and crash over under the posts for a stunning individual score.

From that point on the Bears to their credit kept themselves in the game as they drew a series of penalties from the Exeter breakdown allowing Lucie Skuse to kick the corners and keep the pressure on. Every time though the Bristol line-out malfunctioned under extreme aerial pressure from Poppy Leitch and van der Velden."

Designed by Perkins + Will the CHOP Hub for Clinical Collaboration rises just to the south of the CHOP Buerger Center. The building rises 377 feet and 19 floors high.

The building which features a wonderfully crafted stone and glass exterior was proposed back in April 2019 two months before the SLS International Hotel was revealed to be revived into Arthaus. Site work was quickly underway in October and construction had started with the caisson installation in the same month. The first crane was on site in February 2020 and two more cranes joined in the next few months. The concrete core was above ground by September and was quickly rising with steel eventually following. The core had topped out in February 2021 just like Arthaus and the building received its exterior in May with the building topping out in late July.

The tower cranes that supported the tower during the construction were placed in unordinary spots as the southwest crane was placed next to HVAC space while the other two cranes were placed on top of the CHOP Buerger Center. So far the two tower cranes that were on top of the neighboring CHOP tower have been taken down as a derrick crane is still in place at the top. The southwest crane is currently being taken down by each mast section. Curiously there has been no progress on the metal cladding for the pinnacle of the building for the past six months.

The building has an anticipated completion date of 2023.

**

US artist Nia Keturah Calhoun is recording history in the making with her paintbrush. A mural in North West Washington DC honors Ketanji Brown-Jackson the 51-year-old judge who was confirmed by the Senate last week.

""I wanted to celebrate this momentous occasion while still honoring a really really nuanced past Nia Keturah Calhoun said. So a lot of the mural is very dark because it's representing we had to get through a long period of oppression to get to a Black woman being on the highest court of the land. But there is a rising sun coming from the East and it's shining directly on her because it's a brand new day.""

The mural project is a joint effort between She Will Rise an organization campaigning for a Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court and No Kings Collective.

The local artist who created the design insisted to pay tribute to Jackson’s history and the history of African-Americans.

""If you look at the two green lines behind me one represents the East coast of America and the other represents the West coast of Africa and the journey that her and her family took figuratively and literally to get to where she is. She talked about going from segregation to the Supreme Court in one generation. And so there is a lot of sharp jagged shapes that represent the glass ceiling that she had to break through to get to where she is.""

The mural was inspired by the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s as well as African imagery.

The art piece is dear to D.C because Justice Jackson was born right there. When it is completed the mural will show a young Ketanji Brown Jackson with her father who is a lawyer.

The first black woman who served as federal judge Constance Baker Motley will also be featured. The thousands of D.C resident will walk everyday past the colorful mural.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2NyaWNrZXQvYXJ0aWNsZS93aGVuLWktZmVsbC1pbi1sb3ZlLXdpdGgtY3JpY2tldC1wZXRlci1kYXZpc29uLWZzd3Y5d2J3dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When I fell in love with cricket: Peter Davison,"It started on the local ground.

Unfortunately my growing love of cricket coincided with the slow decline of the English game. The more I watched the worse we got.

PPL-T – as well as four major exploration and production or integrated companies: Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. CNQ-T Suncor Energy Inc. SU-T Cenovus Energy Inc. CVE-T and Imperial Oil Ltd. IMO-T

All seven companies are members of the S&P/TSX 60 Index of large Canadian stocks.

In their compensation discussion and analysis included in the shareholder circulars the companies emphasize the role of share and option awards which can decline in value as well as the annual bonus in making the vast majority of executive pay “at risk.”

Certainly it was a good year for the companies’ shareholders: The three pipeline companies’ shares returned between 20 per cent and 37 per cent in 2021 according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The others returned between 54 per cent and 102 per cent with Cenovus the champion.

The companies too viewed their financial results as superior: All the companies that used targets for their annual bonuses paid them out above those targets with most using “performance scorecards” that rated their final numbers well above expectations.

Cenovus and Suncor scored themselves more than 80 per cent above target while Enbridge’s evaluation came in at 93 per cent above target.

TC Energy gave itself the lowest rating 10 per cent above its overall target performance. After a workplace fatality in 2021 the company gave itself a zero rating on its safety score which makes up 20 per cent of the overall rating.

That was “to reinforce the message that these incidents are not acceptable” wrote Thierry Vandal the chair of the board’s human resources committee and Siim Vanaselja the board chair.

All told the seven men received annual bonuses totalling $15.51-million up from an aggregate $10.45-million in 2020.

Enbridge the most valuable of the seven by market capitalization also has the highest-paid chief executive officer Al Monaco. He made $19.03-million in 2021 up 11.6 per cent from $17.05-million in 2020.

Mr. Monaco’s pay package included a salary of $1.65-million a bonus of $4.62-million and $11.1-million in share and stock option awards.

Murray Edwards executive chairman of Canadian Natural made $16.11-million up nearly 19 per cent from $13.57-million in 2020. Mr. Edwards takes a $1 salary each year but received $13.6-million in share and stock option awards and a $2.49-million bonus. (While Tim McKay has the CEO title at Canadian Natural Mr. Edwards is consistently the company’s best-paid executive.)

Pembina Pipeline’s Michael Dilger had the biggest increase in compensation but only because he received $6.18-million in severance when he left the company in November. His total pay package of $14.35-million also included $5.21-million in share and stock option awards and a $1.47-million bonus. Mr. Dilger made $7.97-million in 2020.

Cenovus Energy’s Alexander Pourbaix had a jump of 47 per cent to $13.99-million up from $9.51-million in 2020. He received $9.6-million in share and stock option awards and a $2.9-million bonus.

Suncor’s Mark Little made $11.80-million up 16.4 per cent from $10.14-million in 2020. He received share and stock option awards valued at just more than $9-million and a bonus of $1.96-million more than triple his 2020 award.

At TC Energy François Poirier made $9.81-million in his first full year as CEO including a $1.1-million bonus and share and stock option awards valued at $6-million. His predecessor Russell Girling made $14.55-million in 2020.

Imperial Oil CEO Brad Corson made $8.75-million in 2021 up nearly 95 per cent from a pay package just under $4.50-million in 2020. Quirks in pension accounting were responsible for more than $1.5-million of the reported compensation increase.

Exxon Mobil Corp. holds 69.6 per cent of Imperial Oil’s shares and pays the cash compensation including pension benefits of Mr. Corson a veteran Exxon executive.

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Walt Disney’s original vision for Walt Disney World in Orlando was a model for a healthy civic society among many other examples. Conservatives now simply disapprove of the corporation’s chosen morality which includes commonly accepted progressive ideas about multiculturalism and personal identity.

The story of fighting back against that gradual seemingly inevitable leftward cultural creep is more or less the story of conservatism itself. The incentives and pressures that have led conservatives on this particular quest however — one that’s not only almost certainly hopeless but that has led them into sinister rhetorical territory in referring to opponents of the law as “groomers” or manipulative pedophiles — are quite modern and reveal how much both our cultural and political landscape have shifted over just the past decade of American life.

Walt Disney’s personality and imagination are baked into the company that bears his name. From “Steamboat Willie” to “The Avengers” there’s an irrepressible optimism a love of sound and visuals for their own sake and a dogged (to his critics facile bordering on irresponsible) determination to make even the macabre or the tragic ultimately fun. If that sounds indistinguishable from the “American character” as hazily defined in pop culture it’s not by accident.

Disney’s original critics from the left accused the company of whitewashing American life and spreading the post-war nuclear-family myth to unwilling recipients across the globe. What both the company’s cultural architects and critics could both agree on is that it represented at least by the standards of pop culture the middle-brow American mainstream.

The conservative critique of Disney today is premised on the idea that by aligning with liberal social causes it’s left that mainstream behind. Yes there is polling that shows the specific Florida bill in question is mostly popular with voters. But right-wing political entrepreneurs like Chris Rufo the impresario of last year’s “critical race theory” panic have turned a discrete disagreement over a piece of legislation into the fulcrum for a full-fledged culture war.

They now accuse notionally LGBT-friendly companies like Disney of “grooming” children — an astonishingly cynical rhetorical flourish that by misappropriating a term used to describe pedophiles manages to conflate homosexuality and pedophilia profoundly disrespect actual survivors of child sex abuse by using their experience as a political cudgel and invoke the specter of far-right conspiracy theories like “Pizzagate” all at once. (The backlash has also predictably and depressingly caught sex education in its blast radius which has been repeatedly proven as the most effective tactic to prevent sexual abuse.)

The approach recalls the anti-gay crusades of the 1970s. A soundbite from conservative activist and erstwhile pop star Anita Bryant that’s made the rounds since the introduction of the Florida bill could have come from the keyboard of Rufo or any number of today’s anti-gay activists: “Homosexuals cannot reproduce so they must recruit. And to freshen their ranks they must recruit the youth of America.”

To middle-American small-c conservative parents of young children waiting until after third grade for their kids to learn about homosexuality — or simply teaching them about it themselves in the privacy of their own home as is their right — sounds pretty reasonable at least to look at the polling. But to argue that corporate America is engaged in a mass conspiracy to turn your kids gay decidedly does not. The conservative culture-war tactics of 2021 as exemplified by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s successful campaign were predicated on real and widespread dissatisfaction with liberal management of the Covid-19 pandemic. By contrast Disney’s move toward broader LGBTQ-friendliness is in lockstep with the American public; support for gay rights has been on an unbroken and steep rise for the past decade.

The GOP attacks on Disney are reminiscent above all else of their unsuccessful campaign against the NFL with its support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Both are among the few remaining monocultural institutions in American life and present an irresistible opportunity to make a broader case about the national “character.” Ideological conservatives are nowhere near the rooms in which decisions about those institutions’ publicly-professed politics are made and therefore seek to steer the conversation from the outside. And in both cases conservatives have conflated corporate messaging with support for extreme edge cases within each issue like police abolition or medical youth gender transition hoping that Americans will do the same.

Embedded in that effort is the recognition that when it comes to the core issues at hand — support for the racial justice movement and LGBTQ rights — the ship has sailed leftward and has been doing so since the 1960s if not before. If you’re a committed conservative activist that’s a genuine cause for lamentation. If you’re an ambitious Republican like Ron DeSantis it’s a potential opportunity to win the base’s fealty. In going on the offense against Disney he and other Republicans like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene are betting they can do that without alienating the vast middle. But in their choice of target and the hateful and off-putting character of their attack to all but the most extremely online conservative activists they’ve unwittingly revealed just how little leverage they really wield when it comes to America’s cultural mainstream.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUub3JnL2xhdGVzdC9yZW1lbWJlcmluZy10aGUtdHJpYW5nbGUtc2hpcnR3YWlzdC1mYWN0b3J5LWZpcmUtY29yZHMtMjIwNDE2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remembering the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire - Progressive.org,"On March 25 1911 a fire broke out at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company in the Asch Building in New York City claiming the lives of 146 workers. Many of the fire’s victims—the majority of whom were women and many of them teenagers—became trapped on the building’s upper floors because the exit doors had been locked by their bosses as an anti-theft policy. With no means of escaping some of the workers jumped to their deaths to escape the flames.

As Edvige Giunta and Mary Anne Trasciatti write in the introduction to the new essay anthology Talking to the Girls: Intimate and Political Essays on the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire “assaulted the senses of middle- and upper-class New Yorkers. People saw smoke bodies plunging out the windows to be smashed on the ground below firemen standing around helplessly with broken nets.”

Talking to the Girls explores the wide-ranging effects of the 1911 fire on victims’ and survivors’ family members artists teachers and labor activists.

Talking to the Girls explores the wide-ranging effects of the 1911 fire on victims’ and survivors’ family members artists teachers and labor activists. With many of its essays written by authors with personal connections to the disaster Giunta and Trasciatti have woven together a collection that not only memorializes the tragedy but covers the ways as they told The Progressive it “continues to act as a catalyst for many forms of activism from the street to the classroom.”

Ellen Gruber Garvey’s “The Triangle Factory Fire and the City of Two Who Survived” for example relates the tale of her great-uncle’s father a Triangle worker who survived and who may have received money from the factory owners for changing his testimony about whether or not the factory doors were locked (testimony for which she can’t blame him as it helped him “protect his own small corner of the universe”).

Tomlin Perkins Coggeshall’s essay “The New Deal Began with My Grandmother” co-authored by Charles Hoffacker offers family memories of Coggeshall’s grandmother Frances Perkins Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of labor who implemented labor advances such as the forty-hour workweek a ban on child labor and a national minimum wage.

In the essay “Another Spring” artist and activist Annie Rachele Lanzillotto describes her own work memorializing Triangle victims while simultaneously fighting to assert her own right to housing (artists and activists in her generation she notes are being gentrified out of their own New York City apartments and homes).

In “Teaching the Triangle Fire to Middle School Students” Kimberly Schiller details her work as an educator helping her eighth-grade students learn about the Triangle fire and the stories of its victims. The photograph used on the book’s cover was taken by Schiller and it shows her students holding aloft “shirtwaist kites” commemorating the fire victims at a memorial march in New York City in 2019.

In “Solidarity Forever!” union organizer May Y. Chen relates her history with the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU) not only sharing its history but also a 1982 strike by garment factory workers in New York’s Chinatown.

During a recent presentation sponsored by the Italian American Museum of Los Angeles the editors and two of the book’s contributors spoke about what they hoped to accomplish with its publication. Mary Anne Trasciatti’s description of the book stands out: “Doing the book was itself a commemorative act . . . this was a labor of love and it was a work of memory activism.”

What do the editors mean by “memory activism?”

The term Giunta and Trasciatti explain refers to “individuals whose encounter with a historical narrative shapes their knowledge of the past and understanding of the present inspires their vision for the future and motivates them to engage in some sort of action to realize that vision.”

It’s an appealing idea—that a connection to and sustained study of a historical event like the horrific Triangle fire can serve a purpose in the future. Clearly the editors and many of the book’s contributors have their eyes on the future.

In “Triangle in Two Acts: From Bubbe Mayses to Bangladesh” Annelise Orleck introduces readers to both her grandmother a woman who once worked at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory as well as to Bangladeshi garment union leader Kalpona Akter.

In the book’s concluding essay artist Richard Joon Yoo describes the process through which the forthcoming Triangle Fire Memorial was created and will soon be installed. When the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition held a competition in 2013 to design a permanent memorial to the fire Yoo and his fellow artist Uri Wegman submitted the winning design. Involving the public in the memorial’s creation was always part of the plan: The pair hosted public events at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology where more than four hundred attendees and more than one hundred volunteers began work on a huge ribbon which will be cast in metal and installed on the Brown Building—as the Asch Building is now known—in 2023.

The workplace fires and disasters are still with us even if we can’t witness them as plainly as a factory fire on our city block.

The Triangle fire may have assaulted the senses of middle- and upper-class New Yorkers in the early twentieth century but unsafe and exploitative work conditions persist in garment factories throughout the country and the world.

Giunta and Trasciatti tell The Progressive that “no matter the time or place the unfettered pursuit of profit is a dangerous undertaking.” They also note that “stories of workers’ struggles to keep safe during the pandemic and of inhuman conditions at meat-packing facilities Walmart stores and Amazon warehouses right here in our own backyards remind us that workplace safety is just as urgent a concern for American workers today as it is for workers anywhere else in the globe.”

The workplace fires and disasters are still with us even if we can’t witness them as plainly as a factory fire on our city block. But the Triangle fire disaster continues to inspire and as the editors put it “many of the workers now organizing and fighting against their exploitation know the story of Triangle and are inspired by it.” This includes the Amazon workers on Staten Island who recently voted to unionize: “For them Triangle is not a story from the distant past but one that rings true because their situation is not so different from that of the workers who came before them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmVncm9jZXIuY29tL25vZGUvNjUyOTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Publix Honors 6 Associates for Community Service,"Publix recently honored six associates with a community service award named after the company’s founder.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Apps are a rising force in the world of commerce. In 2021 alone consumers spent an astounding $170 billion on apps -- up 19 percent from the previous year. Users spend about 87 percent of their time on mobile devices on apps and unlike websites which are generally free to use many apps require purchases.

Those statistics aren't surprising when you consider the benefits of apps over web browsers. Apps are more user-friendly and visually appealing. The content fits different screen sizes perfectly loads faster and navigation is more intuitive. Some apps can also use a device's hardware such as the accelerometer or camera.

Faster load times are especially significant considering that 40 percent of website visitors will leave a site if it takes more than three seconds to load. Faster load times also make checkout processes smoother than on a browser. For these reasons and more apps are eating into websites' revenue. As JMango360 reports 40.4 percent of all users purchase more from a company after installing the company's e-commerce app.

Apps also reach a previously untapped niche of customers. Websites cast a wide net and often reach the merely curious. For customers seeking richer more interactive content apps are far more effective. Younger users are also more likely to use apps -- twice as often as those over 45. That's a valuable share of the market that you can't afford to ignore.

All that said hiring someone to do mobile app development is not often practical for small businesses. In those cases there's another option.

Enter the progressive web app

A newer approach is to use a progressive web app (PWA). These apps have many specific advantages. They're easy to build share and access and organizations can use them for numerous purposes. They also offer automatic updates instant downloads and offline use. Also unlike native apps PWAs can be used across all devices.

Of course PWAs aren't the right choice for every small business -- it depends on whether the app will employ the native functionality of a device. For example native apps can access a device's Bluetooth connection or camera but PWAs can't. If you need extra security or extremely fast speed a native app might be a better choice.

Given the business advantages of apps and the advent of PWAs it seems like a no-brainer that leaders of small and medium-sized businesses would race to launch their own software. But sometimes finding a suitable developer can be difficult. And even if you do find one their fees may be too high for your budget.

Fortunately business owners can opt for a no-code solution to get the job done without breaking the bank.

3 tips for getting started with no-code apps

Before you plunge into developing a no-code app here are three steps that will set you up for success:

1. Get clear on which features you need for your app

Any project worth doing needs to be thought through carefully from the initial planning stages and development without code is no different. Consider which exact features you'll need for your app such as a drag and drop design interface database integration analytics and reporting features scheduling capabilities or e-commerce functions. Be sure to choose a platform that uses templates as they'll help you build an app quickly and visually which is the most intuitive approach.

Also see if the no-code solution provides a way to extend the app using code in case you might need a developer to tweak it in the future. No one wants to have to start over from scratch at that point and many no-code solutions can be low-code too.

2. Choose the right no-code app builder

Be sure to check a platform's website for price transparency. Ask yourself: Can the platform scale with your company? Is it regularly updated? What companies have used the platform successfully already? Questions such as these will help you gauge the platform's suitability for your needs over time.

When choosing a no-code app builder look for platforms that offer the features you identified in the previous step. This may also help determine whether you need a native app -- such as when you need to use some device functionality that a PWA can't provide.

3. Create your fusion team

App development should never happen in isolation so bring in a wide swath of stakeholders to get input on the app's creation. Build what's known as a ""fusion team"" -- a combination of groups from across the organization to give input on developing an app for a specific function. For example ByteDance the company behind TikTok and other highly successful apps has achieved success in this way by using shared-service platforms (SSPs) to foster effective teamwork.

With SSPs ByteDance can support highly flexible specialized teams to work on specific apps while calling on centralized business technology and operations functions for support. This allows the company to deploy people as needed from these teams.

Join the no-code future

Apps are critical to business strategy these days and with the availability of no-code solutions there's no reason not to have one up and running for your business. By doing a little homework using a PWA solution finding a platform that works for your company's needs and getting a great team together you can create an app with little to no coding and capture greater market share.

But don't delay -- the same option is available to your competitors. Fortunately getting started with mobile app development is easy. Before long you'll be enjoying the increased brand recognition and customer loyalty that comes from an app -- without the massive expense associated with developing a native one."

The G20 remains the most powerful forum for global economic governance. Given its membership its mandate and its influence it has been appropriately called the ‘economic steering committee of the world’. The G20’s agenda is spread mainly across the Finance Track and the Sherpa Track. The Finance Track led by Central Bank governors and finance ministers has remained the most crucial pillar of the G20. It covers issues related to international finance sustainable finance and broader global macroeconomic priorities. The Sherpa Track led by a government-appointed official covers issues related to development trade education healthcare digital economy and more. Each issue is supported by ministerial meetings working groups task forces and engagement groups. Both the Finance and Sherpa Track have evolved significantly over the years. Nonetheless the G20 remains a ‘leaders-led process’ with the heads of governments shaping the agenda of the forum. G20 follows a rotational presidency every year thus allowing each member country to shape the global economic governance during their presidency. In December 2021 as a run-up to its G20 presidency in 2023 India joined the G20 Troika of the rotational presidency with Italy and Indonesia. India is in the process of identifying areas of cooperation with other G20 members to shape its presidency. The India–UK partnership at the G20 is underpinned by strong bilateral diplomatic relations shared values and common interests. As India and UK co-chair the G20 Framework Working Group (FWG) since its inception; it is natural indeed imperative for the two countries to co-design and co-develop a global governance agenda that resonates with all the members of the G20. In this context the Observer Research Foundation in partnership with the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the UK government organised a delegation in March 2022 to London. The delegation aimed to discover shared interests to drive a collaborative approach towards global challenges and create meaningful engagement between India and the UK structured around issues and platforms that give either country substantial leverage. The delegation’s visit aggregated the information examined the issues and provided necessary policy recommendations for developing and implementing the G20 agenda. By initiating discussions with UK-based research institutes such as the Overseas Development Institute London School of Economics’ Grantham Research Institution on Climate Change and the Environment and the LSE Ideas—the visit enabled the development of a sustainable network between UK and India based think tanks to aid India–UK G20 collaboration.The Indian delegation met Ms. Veda Poon Director International Finance at HM Treasury UK to strengthen the alignment between India and the UK on issues of the G20. The aim of the meeting was to enable a greater understanding of Indian and UK viewpoints on shared issues relevant to G20 such as sustainable finance current macroeconomic developments and the digital economy. The meeting explored India’s probable G20 agenda. The Indian delegation highlighted the likelihood of India’s G20 Presidency delinking its climate track with the energy track to expand the discourse on loss and damage beyond the energy sector. Coal remains a mainstay for India’s power generation and is unlikely to substantially change in the next few decades. For emerging economies like India it would be crucial to look at the coal sector transition from the lens of just transition. If India is expected to phase out coal it is likely to lose a few hundred thousand jobs across different allied sectors thus it is crucial for India to explore the role of international financial institutions and other countries in helping with the transition. The meeting also discussed India’s major policy push towards sustainable cities bio-fuel infrastructure finance sustainable infrastructure for agriculture and R&D. From the UK point of view the meeting highlighted the importance of carbon pricing and its macroeconomic impact country platforms climate-related financial disclosures taxonomy and the role of the domestic private sector in lowering emissions. From a digital economy perspective the meeting highlighted the crucial role of digitalisation and financial inclusion in the finance track. It emphasised the added importance of cyber security decentralised finance coordinated response to cryptocurrency or central bank digital currencies and the need to enhance digital literacy for the Indian G20 Presidency. The meeting also discussed the potential challenges India might face during its G20 Presidency including the possibility of discontinuity in the agenda-setting within the Troika due to the lack of a permanent secretariat at the G20.While economic activity is predicted to return to pre-pandemic levels in advanced economies the global financial and monetary system is still vulnerable to external shocks especially for the emerging markets and developing economies. There are key risks related to COVID-19 macroeconomic policies and other geopolitical crises that can cause major headwinds for the emerging market and low-income economies. Due to the uncertainty induced by the pandemic the global economy continues to witness high inflation and increasing public and private sector debt levels. The advanced economies have experienced a supply-demand mismatch which has negatively affected the recovery trajectory. The renewal of mobility restrictions in some economies has weakened the service sector and caused continued supply disruptions. The labour market recovery has been highly uneven in most G20 economies. The adverse impact of the pandemic has been felt by the vulnerable section of the labour force—including older workers and women. Amid rising inflation geopolitical tensions increasing interest rates and tapering asset purchases G20’s agenda for global macro-economic stability remains crucial. In 2022 the Framework Working Group (FWG) discussed the economic risks and the best strategies to balance monetary and fiscal policies especially in view of the limited fiscal space and high financial market volatility. In consultation with the Government of the UK and Overseas Development Institute (ODI) ORF co-hosted an in-person roundtable on the G20 with policymakers officials experts and civil society experts from UK India and other G20 countries. The roundtable sought a greater understanding of global governance issues in both—the Sherpa and Finance Tracks—to serve as a necessary reference and source of ideas for policymakers in India and the UK for the G20. It initiated positive discussions between the two countries at the G20 for solving serious global governance issues and identifying potential areas of collaboration under India’s Presidency.In consultation with the UK Government ORF organised a meeting with LSE Ideas to discuss the themes for the G20 Finance Track during India’s Presidency in 2023. The meeting was co-chaired by Mihir Sharma of ORF and Hugh Sandeman Senior Fellow at London School of Economics. The discussion explored how the G20 can work to ensure that the regulatory framework for cross-border capital flows enhances the amount of private sustainable finance to the developing world. It sought to discuss the framework of rules that lenders seek to impose and within which they operate. This included —terms maturity loan agreements the structure of financing risk appetite pricing of loans the ability to transfer loans or assets to new owners and criteria for sustainable lending (i.e. environmental social and governance conditions) prudential regulation by financial authorities of the lenders capital adequacy rules imposed requirements for reporting on sustainability (ESG) of loans rules on the structure of liabilities for funding international loans and credit ratings provided by rating agencies. It also discussed the regulations adopted by receiving countries including issues such as overall capital controls by borrowing countries; macro-prudential controls on categories of foreign borrowing (such as those imposed historically by the Reserve Bank of India on the amount and terms of overseas borrowing by sectors like real estate); taxes dividends to foreign lenders and the regulation of industrial sectors in borrowing countries into which foreign capital is flowing. It discussed the credit risk of borrowing countries—including the consistency of government policies on tax and capital controls the ability to provide a stable legal environment with clear jurisdictional rules including the ability to obtain arbitration under contractual agreements without challenge by local courts. Furthermore it explored the development finance policies including— the development of further co-lending with private sector sources by development finance institutions and policies for offsetting the pro-cyclical nature of lending to higher-risk borrowers or countries.The adoption of sustainable finance is a priority area for India at the G20. In the Third G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in July 2021 India’s Finance Minister underlined the need for aligning recovery strategies with climate action and the importance of ‘timely fulfilment of international commitments on climate finance and technology transfer’. In 2021 the Government of India along with the United Kingdom announced the Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF)— investing GBP 120 million of seed capital each through India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF). Thus India-UK collaboration at the G20 will be key in furthering the shared commitment to the development of the environment and climate risk management in the financial sector whilst mobilising mainstream finance towards the transition to a sustainable economy. For this purpose ORF and the Grantham Research Institute (GRI) engaged in a meaningful discussion on ways to strengthen India’s G20 Presidency for mobilising and unlocking global commercial and development capital toward serving sustainable objectives in emerging economies. The meeting was co-hosted by Mihir Sharma of ORF and Nick Robins Professor Sustainable Finance Grantham Research Institute.The discussion explored areas such as innovative financial mechanisms and instruments; the standardisation of global standards and frameworks; possible ways to align domestic and regional carbon pricing; and the impact of monetary & fiscal policies. It discussed the role of Multilateral Development Banks and the need to scale up their lending by a factor of 3 in the next 5-7 years. It also explored the scope of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero which aims to realign the private sector business models with net-zero ambitions and assess its implications on mainstream private finance and capital flows between international borders. Furthermore the meeting discussed the importance of improving domestic capacities in the form of building a bankable pipeline of shovel-ready projects. It emphasised the need to enhance the “country platform approach” in order to increase the private capital flows to developing and emerging economies. The meeting stressed the need to design appropriate green financial plumbing needs including taxonomies creating asset classes and addressing counterproductive regulations.The delegation comprised the following Indian dignitaries and thought leaders:The delegation was a reflection of India’s diverse set of policy experts with significant variation in age gender experience and affiliations—and thus could offer different perspectives on India’s G20 priorities.This event report has been written by Shruti Jain",,,,,,

The reforms needed to achieve these goals are multifaceted. According to Chinese president Xi Jinping the government will “promote strengthening improvement and expansion of state capital effectively prevent [the] loss of state assets deepen the reform of [SOEs] develop a mixed-ownership economy and cultivate globally competitive world-class firms.”10

It is important to note that in this process not all SOEs will be treated equally. To optimize the allocation of resources a threefold criterion for identifying the SOEs to be reformed is in place. Only those SOEs that are most representative of their industries have the most potential to benefit and have the greatest capacity to integrate the reforms successfully will be chosen.

The how-to of mixed-ownership reforms

The success of China’s reforms – again in view of SOEs becoming world-class enterprises – hinges on their approach to further introducing mixed-ownership and equity diversification into their business models. There are six important strategic points to be aware of.

Preparing for reform

To ensure the reforms are effective in their target organizations certain preparations are necessary. These include SOEs examining the market environment such as the competitive landscape; identifying industry trends and tailoring their strategic planning accordingly; taking an inventory of existing resources relative to their business objectives; and mapping out clear long-term development goals. These prescriptions for SOEs are to ensure they gain the most benefit from the implementation of the reforms.

Balancing interests

Mixed-ownership describes the ability of an investor to take a financial stake in an SOE. The implications require SOEs to balance the interests of three core stakeholders. One is the company itself and its long-term development needs which is to say a given SOE should not build an asset portfolio that is misaligned with its own interests. The second is the company’s prospective investors whose interests revolve around their ability to see returns from their positions. The third is the government which wants to the see the reforms implemented in the optimal and most cost-efficient way. Aligning the interests of these three stakeholders is critical for the present reforms to return the desired benefits.

Good corporate governance

Corporate governance is another strategic element of the current reforms. As China’s SOEs have “corporatized” – that is adopted the characteristics and structure of modern corporations – they have also maintained their identity as part of the state economy. The intention behind what has been called the “three groups and management” corporate governance framework is to advance SOEs’ marketization competitiveness and accountability. The “three groups” refer to shareholders boards of directors and supervisory committees; while the “management” dimension refers to SOEs’ senior management. The roles and interests of each are important to note.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Responding firefighters finding a smoke condition in the area but unable to locate any fire began to search the surrounding area. That was when they discovered the smoke was coming from a blaze involving several rows of solar panels on the roof of Ice Land on Tennis Court. Firefighters gained entry to the building and also reportedly found a small fire in an electrical room with a “moderate” smoke condition throughout the interior. The fire was extinguished using hoselines and Truck 17’s aerial master stream. The blaze was officially declared under control at 4:12 p.m. The cause of the fire is under investigation by fire officials and police.

According to the Ice Land Skating Center website:

Fourteen Stellantis brands including Peugeot Fiat and Jeep will use Qualcomm’s vehicle cockpit and 5G telematics technology starting in 2024 with the Maserati brand being the first out the gate said the companies which did not disclose the deal value.

Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in a statement the collaboration helps the company more closely manage the complete electronics supply chain.

Qualcomm general manager of automotive Nakul Duggal told Reuters more automakers are working directly with chip makers rather than just relying on their other suppliers to act as a go-between.

“If you go back even a couple of years it was quite uncommon for (automakers) to make a decision like this” Duggal said. “This is now becoming much more common.”

He added Qualcomm’s recent acquisition of self-driving tech software company Arriver gives its so-called “digital chassis” the ability to offer a full set of driver assistance and self-driving capabilities in addition to cockpit and telematic technology. But the deal with Stellantis this time does not include that newer offering.

Qualcomm said that since it first unveiled its driver assistance and self-driving system – called Snapdragon Ride – in 2020 its automotive business deal pipeline has increased to $13 billion last year from $3 billion in 2017.

In a statement the two companies said the in-car communication and infotainment systems for Stellantis is being designed and engineered together with tech giant Amazon.com and Taiwanese manufacturing company Foxconn (2317.TW).

The insider Yogesh Brar made a statement that the hardware of the cameras of future smartphones for the most part will be identical to the current generation. I must say that we were expecting this. Previously Google used a 12-megapixel Sony IMX363 sensor from the second to fifth generation of the Pixel inclusive. Nevertheless the smartphones of the corporation have become a kind of measure of the quality of mobile photography; over the past few years due to the constant improvement of algorithms proving that the power is in the software.

Now the choice fell on the 50-megapixel Samsung GN1. Apparently Google will again offer 50 MP and 12 MP sensors in the Pixel 7 changing only the software component and finalizing the neural networks that the company has been focusing on lately. If we talk about the Pixel 7 Pro then it should have a triple camera where the third sensor is a 48 MP telephoto lens.

Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro cameras will only evolve in software

Apparently Google will try to squeeze the maximum out of the “hardware” and bring the quality of photos to a new level. The announcement of the Google Pixel 7 series is expected in the fall of this year and both smartphones are expected to receive OLED displays but the basic version will have a diagonal of 6.3 inches while the Pro version will have 6.7 inches. The smartphones will be running on the proprietary second-generation Tensor chip.

The Tensor SoC for Pixel 6 smartphones turned out to be unique in its kind; as it contains two Cortex-X1 superstores. Neither Qualcomm nor MediaTek has such SoC. But as the reports Google is already working on a new generation SoC.

In the firmware code of the Pixel 6 the Cloudripper code designation was found; which is associated with the second generation Tensor SoC. However Cloudripper is the code name for a test platform for a potential Tensor 2; since it has the abbreviation GS201. The test platform for the current Tensor SoC recall has the GS101 code number.

What Tensor 2 will be is a big question. But if the company sticks to the current architecture then Tensor 2 could get two Cortex-X2 super-cores; while Qualcomm and MediaTek’s top next-gen platforms will have one each.

That rivalry may be a bit one-sided however if new reports are to be believed.

4 Reviews

The Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 is expected to replace the Snapdragon 778G Plus as Qualcomm's most powerful chipset for the mid-range segment. Details of the SoC leaked recently but new information seeks to curtail hopes of fans expecting a chipset in the mould of the MediaTek Dimensity 8100.

As revealed by leaker Yogesh Brar the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 will offer performance beneath the Snapdragon 870 but above the MediaTek Dimensity 1200. That's disappointing since its closest rival the Dimensity 8100 matches the Snapdragon 888 in raw performance and blows it away efficiency-wise. But then the Dimensity 8100 looks to be a gem of a chipset and it'd be foolhardy to expect the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 to match it.",,,

Positive marijuana drug tests for employees soared in U.S. workplaces last year according to Quest Diagnostics' annual drug index published on March 30.

Quest Diagnostics one of the nation's largest drug testing laboratories reported that employees testing positive for marijuana spiked across all job industries from 2017 to 2021. Food service jobs had the highest number of positive marijuana drug tests at 7.5%.

Quest Diagnostics doctor discusses data from report

Quest collected data from over 11 million unidentified urine hair and oral fluid drug test results between January and December 2021.

Dr. Barry Sample the director of science and technology at Quest Diagnostics is a member of the data collection for the report.

""We have been publishing the data of our drug testing going back over 30 years to 1988. These are the results of drug testing and how it evolved"" Sample said. ""We added industry data five years ago for what we are reporting.""

Quest Diagnostics gathered data from three categories of employees who were drug tested: federal-mandated employees safety-sensitive workers and employees in the general workforce.

Federally mandated and safety-sensitive workers are characterized as pilots bus and truck drivers and workers in nuclear power plants for whom routine drug testing is required by government agencies according to Sample.

According to the report positive drug tests for cocaine and marijuana increased for federally mandated and safety-sensitive employees required to get tested under federal law.

The report also gathered data from pre-employment drug testing for new employees job candidates and current employees. Sample said employees may be required to undergo drug testing based on state laws. Companies in several states have voluntary drug testing programs and post-accident drug testing programs.

Post-accident drug tests are tests performed by employers to test an employee involved in an accident in the workplace.

According to the report positivity rates for marijuana in the general U.S. workforce based on over six million urine tests increased by 8.3% (3.6% in 2020 compared to 3.9% in 2021) the highest positivity rate ever reported in the drug testing index. Over five years positivity rates for marijuana in the general U.S. workforce increased 50% (2.6% in 2017 compared to 3.9% in 2021).

Sample cited several factors related to higher positivity rates of marijuana drug tests for employees including the legalization of marijuana in multiple states and changing attitudes among society toward pot use.

""If the employers aren’t testing for marijuana it won’t show up in our data. I think more states are allowing more recreational use of marijuana"" Sample said. ""Society's attitudes are evolving toward marijuana and more states are legalizing it. Marijuana can have safety impacts. No drug test will inform us of how frequently a person has used marijuana it just shows that they have used it sometime in the past.""

Sample said companies should look at their workforce and create drug policies to the specific job functions and responsibilities adding that he doesn’t believe there is a ""one-size fits all approach.""

Politicians push to end marijuana drug testing for employees

In March 2021 a California assemblyman introduced a bill in the state legislature to end common pre-employment drug screenings for marijuana.

Assemblyman Bill Quirk proposed a bill that would make it unlawful for employers to use tactics such as hair or urine tests to determine if someone has consumed marijuana in the past. If passed the law would prevent employers from using that evidence as grounds for discrimination against an employee by denying or terminating employment FOX2 San Francisco and the Sacramento Bee reported.

In Atlanta a commissioner for DeKalb County pushed for a change in pre-employment drug testing for the area. Currently applicants who apply for a job in DeKalb County are required to take a drug test.

Commissioner Ted Terry said in January it made sense to take this approach given the change in marijuana laws across the country adding that DeKalb County needs ""to keep up with the times.""

The commissioner said his drug testing proposal would not apply to police or firefighters or individuals who drive large trucks but employees in clerical or desk jobs.

State marijuana laws and the impact on employee drug testing

The number of states that legalized marijuana for recreational use rose to 18 from eight plus Washington D.C. FOX Business reported.

Virginia made the use of marijuana legal on July 1 2021. Under the law individuals who use marijuana for medical purposes in the Commonwealth and have a prescription from a doctor have the most protection.

RELATED: Proposed CA law would do-away with most pre-employment marijuana tests

The law prohibits employers from discriminating against those employees and terminating or disciplining them for having marijuana in their system. However recreational users have the least protection because the law does not stop businesses from drug testing employees.

Virginia is an at-will state and an employer can terminate or discipline an employee for marijuana use. FOX 5 DC reported.

In New York an employer can’t test you for marijuana in most cases even if you smell like pot according to guidance from New York State’s Labor Department.

FOX 5 New York reported that the guidance states ""observable signs of marijuana use that don't indicate impairment on their own cannot be cited as an articulable symptom of impairment.""

Recreational marijuana was legalized in New York in 2021 allowing residents to legally possess up to three ounces of cannabis outside their home and up to five pounds at home.

Cannabis was removed from the list of controlled substances and now allows people 21 years old to use the drug. However marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Employees required to be tested under federal and state law would still get tested including commercial vehicle drivers and New York Police Department staff.

The U.S. House of Representatives on April 1 voted to pass legislation to legalize marijuana at the federal level a major step taken to decriminalize cannabis in the United States.

The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act list and decriminalize it. The measure would require federal courts to expunge prior marijuana convictions and conduct resentencing hearings for those completing their sentences.

The MORE Act still needs approval in the Senate before it could head to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.

Amazon stops testing job seekers for marijuana

Last year Amazon said it would stop testing job seekers for marijuana. The company is changing its stance as states legalize cannabis or introduce laws banning employers from testing for it according to FOX11 Los Angeles.

In March 2021 a New York man sued Amazon saying the company rescinded his job offer at an Amazon warehouse because he tested positive for marijuana even though the city banned employers from testing job applicants for cannabis in 2020.

Amazon said in a blog post that it will still test workers for other drugs and conduct ""impairment checks"" on the job. And the company said some roles may still require a cannabis test in line with Department of Transportation regulations.

And in the ’90s and 2000s the preppy youthquake mall-fashion outlet Abercrombie & Fitch told a very big story. It was a story of where America — or at least a powerful slice of the millennial demo — was at. As recounted in the lively snarky horrifying and irresistible documentary “White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch” (which drops April 19 on Netflix) that story gets less pretty the closer you look at it even as the models who were used to market it were gorgeous.

As a company Abercrombie & Fitch had been around since 1892. It originally catered to elite sportsmen (Teddy Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway were loyal customers) but after falling on hard times and kicking around as an antiquated brand the company was reinvented in the early ’90s by the CEO Mike Jeffries who fused the upscale WASP fetishism of designers like Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger with the chiseled-beefcake-in-underwear monochromatic sexiness of the Calvin Klein brand to create a newly ratcheted up you-are-what-you-wear dreamscape of hot clubby elitism. The models — in the catalogues on the store posters on the shopping bags — were mostly men mostly naked and all ripped like the missing link between Michelangelo’s David and “Jersey Shore.” The rugby shirts and fussy torn jeans weren’t all that special but they were priced as if they were. What you were buying in many cases was really just the logo — the Abercrombie & Fitch insignia splayed across sweatshirts and Ts which signified that you too were a member of the ruling echelon of youth cool.

The brand was unabashed in its insider/outsider snobbery but the problem with it — and there was a major problem — wasn’t the clothes. It was the fact that not just the company’s advertising aesthetic but its hiring practices were nakedly discriminatory. Abercrombie & Fitch was selling neo-colonial jock chic infused with a barely disguised dollop of white supremacy. Like the models the sales people who worked on the retail outlet floors all had to conform to an “all-American” ideal — which meant among other things an exclusionary whiteness. At an Abercrombie boutique the text was: We’re white. The subtext was: No one else wanted.

Popular on Variety

In “White Hot” Alison Klayman the ace documentarian who made “Jagged” “The Brink” and “Take Your Pills” shows us how Abercrombie & Fitch rose to an insane of popularity by taking a certain strain of sexy preppy entitlement that was already out there and kicking it up into the aspirational stratosphere. She traces the incredible ride the brand enjoyed (it was iconic for well over a decade but then flamed out the way that only a white-hot fashion phenom can) and she interviews many former employees including several from the executive ranks who explain how the sausage was made.

At colleges Abercrombie reps targeted the hunkiest dudes at the hippest fraternities to wear the clothes figuring that the image would spread from there. (You feel the start of influencer culture.) The mall stores were shielded by shuttered doors and inside they were bathed in dance-club beats and musky clouds of A&F cologne. The ads were all about frat boys with the look of rugby and lacrosse jocks who became in the quarterly coffee-table catalogues the stud next door. (The godfather of Abercrombie models was Marky Mark in the Calvin Klein ads.) There were some girls in the ads too and celebrities before they were famous like Olivia Wilde Taylor Swift Channing Tatum Jennifer Lawrence Ashton Kutcher and January Jones.

Bobby Blanski a former A&F model says “They literally made so much money marketing clothes. But advertising them with no clothes on.” But that made sense since “the clothes themselves were nothing special” according to Alan Karo an Abercrombie fashion marketing and advertising executive. It was the label the brand the club the cult. The journalist Moe Tkacik recalls that the first time she walked into an Abercrombie outlet she said to herself “Oh my God they’ve bottled this. They have absolutely crystalized everything that I hate about high school and put it in a store.”

There’s a dimension of the Abercrombie story that has a perverse parallel with the movie industry. In his seminal book “Empire of Their Own” Neal Gabler captured how the moguls who created Hollywood were in no small part forging an onscreen identity that was the opposite of their own — a white-picket-fence America of idealized WASP conformity. You could argue that on a karmic level because those moguls were Jewish they envisioned that other world as a kind of dream and thus elevated it into a mythology.

Something comparable went on in America with youth fashion. Preppies and the preppy look had been around for decades. But the preppy as signifier as advertising icon as the image of who everyone wanted to be didn’t come to the fore until the 1980s. The counterculture had been a scruffy literally hairy affair; the ’80s throwing over all that moralistic rebellion-against-the-system stuff would be sleek shaved and beige. The new rebel like Tom Cruise in “Top Gun” or Charlie Sheen in “Wall Street” was a rebel precisely because of how wired he was into the system: of military hardware of finance of high living. (He drove a fuck-you Porsche.) The WASP preppy culture that become a new symbol of cool was spearheaded on the fashion front by that trilogy of designer-mogul giants Calvin Klein Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. Two of them were Jewish and so was Bruce Weber the legendary photographer who created the exclusionary youths-romping-in-nature-with-a-golden-retriever image of Abercrombie’s “Triumph of the Will” meets Chippendale’s aesthetic.

Were the Abercrombie & Fitch adds homoerotic? Yes and no. Weber like Calvin Klein was gay (and so was CEO Mike Jeffries) and on some level the ads were suffused with homoerotic sensation. But it’s not as if their effect was limited to that gaze. What was more important to the Abercrombie essence is that by the late ’90s the preppy-as-icon had become a signifier of the one percent. This is part of what you were aspiring to when you bought into the Abercrombie lifestyle which promised a golden ticket out of the doldrums that defined everyone else.

What Klayman captures in the documentary right from its jaunty cut-out-and-punk-bubblegum opening-credits sequence is that far more than the fashion labels that paved the way for it Abercrombie & Fitch became pop culture. And you could chart its rise and fall through pop culture. The definitive sign that the brand had become larger-than-life arrived when LFO referenced it in its 1999 hit of hip-hop nostalgia “Summer Girls” with the line “I like girls that wear Abercrombie & Fitch” which did for A&F what Sister Sledge’s designer shout-out in “He’s the Greatest Dancer” in 1979 (“Halston Gucci…Fiorucci”) did for the fashion revolution of the ’80s. There was a dumb-lunk misogynistic poetry to the LFO line which should have read “I like girls WHO wear Abercrombie & Fitch.” But by sticking with referring to women as “that” the line inadvertently caught the essence of the A&F mystique. Namely: I like objects wearing objects.

Three years later though in the first Tobey Maguire “Spider-Man” film Peter Parker’s high-school bully nemesis Flash Thompson was dressed in Abercrombie like a John Hughes villain of the ’80s. The brand was still riding high but one of its market managers interviewed in the doc says that he immediately saw this as an ominous sign. People were starting to get onto what Abercrombie stood for and this had consequences. That same year one of their joke T-shirts which featured antiquated slogans displayed ironically flaunted Chinese caricatures in rice-paddy hats with the slogan “Wong Brothers Laundry Service — Two Wongs Can Make It White.” This drew protests from Asian-Americans who picketed outside the stores and by the time that kind of thing was being given a spotlight by “60 Minutes” you had a PR disaster.

Klayman shows us records of the store’s guide to The Look: what was acceptable for its sales people to wear and more important not to wear (dreadlocks gold chains for men). The company employed very few people of color and those it did have were mostly confined to the back room or to late shifts where their job was to clean up. These practices were so overtly discriminatory that in 2003 a class-action lawsuit was filed against Abercrombie. The company settled the suit for $40 million admitting no guilt but entering into a consent decree in which they agreed to change their recruiting hiring and marketing practices. Todd Corley who was hired to oversee diversity initiatives is interviewed in the film; he made a few inroads but in other ways was the symbol the company needed to try to change without changing too much.

As a fashion brand Abercrombie & Fitch was a bit like the Republican Party — fighting to hold onto the hegenomy of a white-bread America that was in reality losing its power and influence. Yet as the documentary makes clear the fade-out of Abercrombie as a cultural force wasn’t only about the revelation of its racist practices. This was also the last pre-Internet gasp of Total Mall Culture: the mall as the place you hung out and went to buy what was cool after learning about it on MTV. That now sounds as quaintly distant as “Fast Times at Ridgemont High.” But what has never gone away — and may have only gained in influence — is the obnoxious youth-cult aristocracy that Abercrombie incarnated: the idea that the cooler the hotter the more expensive you look the more of a lout it invites you to be.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Antonio Brown has become a popular name in the NFL even though he isn’t a part of it anymore. The free-agent WR who has been a prominent figure in the sport has been able to garner media attention. As he moves forward in life he is living his life to the fullest. He has also been very open regarding his dramatic situation with the Buccaneers and other situations. Now he is giving a rather grotesque justification for his actions.

The situation arose during the Buccaneers vs. Jets game. The wide receiver had a fallout with the Buccaneers. After a while cameras spotted Brown pulling his jersey off before racing onto the stadium in the middle of the action and waving to the fans with a “peace out” gesture as he left the stadium.

Brown mentions “I feel like man everything I did I did it because my heart believed that was what I needed to do. And in life sometimes you got to listen to your heart because that’s the only way I could go to sleep at night.”

WR Brown has competed for four franchises during his tenure including a nine-year stint with the Pittsburgh Steelers that came to an abrupt end in the year 2018. He played for the Oakland Raiders for a short time before being discharged as their relations collapsed. Soon after he joined the New England team. But that too was short-lived.

Even though he mentions an NFL return as inevitable he needs a commitment from a franchise so that he can do the surgical procedure. There’s no doubt that Antonio Brown is among the best wide receivers in the game. However his looming problems with the NFL have been problematic and his resurgence looks rather doubtful.

That could save the GPU crypto mining community some coin on the electric bill.

In Chemnitz Germany a one-man hobbyist PC gaming researcher by the name of Igor Wallossek recently found a way to cut the power consumption of the Nvidia RTX 3090.

A report about the home lab electronics caper by Hassan Mujtaba for WCCF Tech explains why this is a breakthrough for anyone who uses the GPU:

“NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card is without a doubt the most power-hungry graphics card ever launched sipping over 500 Watts of power and requiring insanely massive GPU cooling solutions to keep the heat in check.”

Of course cryptocurrency industry watchers know it’s not just full-time gamers who stand to save some money if Igor’s efficiency mod to the chip is replicable by others.

Unless they’re using the ASIC chips specially designed to mine cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Dogecoin (DOGE) Litecoin (LTC) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Monero (XMR) Zcash (ZEC) and others— GPUs remain the most effective way to mine cryptocurrency.

Igor Labs Mods Nvidia RTX 3090 for Big Efficiency Boost

Out of the box the RTX 3090 has a manufacturer reference TGP (total graphics power) of 450W. That’s how much power the graphics subsystem requires to run the chip and keep it from overheating. WCCF Tech says most custom models run at closer to 500W. But Igor Labs found a way to limit power consumption to 300W— a 37% drop in its TGP rating — without losing nearly as much gaming performance. This was tested using 10 games at 4K resolution.

That yields an appreciable amount of electricity cost savings for the Nvidia GPU’s computations and the “insanely massive” cost of cooling the RTX 3090 (with electricity fed to the entire graphics rig through a 600 Watt rated PCIe Gen 5 16-pin connector which is designed to accommodate future graphics chips rated for 600 Watts).

That could save some money for the GPU mining industry

Graphics processing units are optimal for solving the SHA-256 hash algorithm problems that play a key role in the elaborate computational and economic architecture of proof of work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (and Ethereum for the past seven years until mainnet merges with the Beacon Chain to create network consensus using proof of stake).

While the RTX 3090 is a powerful miner with a hashrate clocked at 135 MH/s on the Dagger Hashimoto implementation for Ethereum mining WePC has recommended a more energy-efficient solution because the rig is such a power hog. Igor’s modification to limit the Nvidia card’s electricity usage could bump the RTX 3090 up the GPU mining leaderboards for key benchmarks like hashrate power consumption and daily profit/days to break even.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9zYXBwaGlyZS1wcmVwYXJpbmctcmFkZW9uLXJ4LTY5NTB4dC10b3hpYy1saW1pdGVkLWVkaXRpb24tYS1sZWFrLWZyb20taXRhbGlhbi1yZXRhaWxlci1zdWdnZXN0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sapphire preparing Radeon RX 6950XT TOXIC Limited Edition a leak from Italian retailer suggests,"This Sapphire Radeon RX 6x50XT series pricing is insane

Some early ‘pricing’ information has been listed by an Italian retailer.

There is just no way that Radeon RX 6950XT the upcoming flagship RDNA2 GPU will cost twice as much as RX 6900XT. Yet this is what the screenshots captured by @momomo_us from an Italian retailer called “Breakpoint.it” appear to suggest.

Sapphire Radeon RX 6900 XT Toxic Liquid Edition Source: Hexus

Models such as TOXIC Limited Edition would cost 3133 EUR NITRO+ OC would retail at 2961 EUR and NITRO+ PURE might cost 3048 EUR. That’s almost twice as expensive as the RX 6900 XT models sold by the same retailer.

The RX 6750XT alone is a dead give away that those prices make no sense otherwise customers would have to pay 1419 EUR which is probably something around three times as much as expected MSRP (suggested retail price). In fact we should probably mention the card listed below have all been removed from Breakpoint’s website which further suggests it was a placeholder.

More importantly though the data provided confirms that Sapphire is preparing at least seven new models based on the updated 18 Gbps memory. That’s including RX 6950XT Toxic Liquid Edition. The company already offers such model with full Navi 21 GPU except it is limited to 16 Gbps memory. The 6950XT variant would also have increased TDP (supposedly around 450W).

All these cards are now set to launch on May 10th. However we still expect AMD to make an announcement sooner.

Whether you like it or not custom Radeon RX 6400 graphics cards are coming.

ASRock is preparing a new model designed in an ITX form factor. Following a launch of Radeon RX 6500XT AMD’s first graphics card with 6nm Navi 24 GPU board partners are now getting ready to unveil their RX 6400 models as well. Those cards will feature custom cooling solutions.

The RX 6400 card pictured below is part of the Challenger ITX series. Although it is relatively a small card it is still a dual-slot design just as the 6500XT model.

One can immediately notice that the coolers are not the same in fact even the fin array behind the fan has been replaced with an aluminum heatsink and the fan itself is also smaller. The most significant change is visible with a naked eye though the 8-pin power connector is missing. This is because RX 6400 has lower board power than 6500XT (53W vs 107W).

ASRock Radeon RX 6400 vs RX 6500 XT Challenger ITX Source:VideoCardz

The RX 6400 graphics card has 768 Stream Processors and 4GB GDDR6 memory across a 64-bit interface. As noted before Navi 24 is a power-efficient GPU but it was not designed for gaming. The RX 6500XT was already named ‘the worst GPU’ in RDNA2 series due to limited bandwidth lacking encoding capabilities and requirement of PCIe Gen4 x4 interface because it is visibly slower on Gen3. With even fewer enabled cores RX 6400 will be a though sell for anything else than integrated GPU replacement or Home Theater systems.

Saweetie donned a matching outfit that consisted of a red printed halter top and minskirt. The set is reminiscent of a ‘90s Coogi sweater but its reinterpretation into this outfit had a modern and trendy twist. The top had green strings for a pop of unifying color and the skirt had a thick red elastic waistband for security.

Halterneck tops feature an open back with straps that secure around the neck exposing the shoulders. Marilyn Monroe is famed for popularizing halter necks thanks to her iconic white halterneck dress in ​​”The Seven Year Itch.” Halter top shirts were also popular in the ‘90s coming back with the modern style revival.

Accessories-wise Saweetie popped on several gold necklaces including a Chanel piece — and chunky gold hoops. Her cobalt blue tresses were vibrant as well and popped alongside her outfit.

Gold shiny heels completed her ensemble. Although her entire shoes are not in the shot it’s evident that the shoes had a height of approximately 3 inches and included a thin ankle strap for maximum security.

Saweetie has made a name for herself within the fashion industry and worked with labels PrettyLittleThing Crocs and Reebok. She even launched her own line of nail polishes with the help of Sinful Colors.

Coachella is scheduled for April 15-17 and April 22-24. The multiday music festival which includes numerous established and emerging musical performances features headlining sets by Harry Styles Billie Eilish The Weeknd and Swedish House Mafia and others.

Victoria’s Secret model Elsa Hosk got ready for the pool in two very different looks.

More from Footwear News

Hosk stood on some steps posing in the first post before a rock wall. The model wore a red fitted Balenciaga baseball cap atop her head with the brand’s name written on the brim in white. The stylish model went for primary colors rocking a blue yellow and red Chanel chain bag on her shoulder. The model also wore an unreleased Heavy Manners swimsuit in red and yellow embellished with little yellow flowers and a yellow lettuce hem. The model however isn’t wearing any shoes in the post.

The second post to Instagram also features Hosk at a Revolve pool party wearing all white this time. The model wore a studded peach bikini under a white silky button-up dress. Hosk belted the whole affair with a studded silver and white leather belt with an exaggerated buckle. The model wore a gold chain necklace and sported her hair up in a very Pam Anderson-inspired messy bun. The Swedish model seems to favor Balenciaga donning one of their metallic silver shoulder bags with heart keychain detailing. The bag is dotted with silver or metal studs and hardware making for a grungy vibe. Once again the model doesn’t provide a shot of her shoes but the look might not even need them. However a wedge sandal or even some clean white sneakers would make this outfit pop.

See what supermodel Hosk wore while pregnant feat a super cozy coat.

Even Elon must be jealous of this Slantnose racer.

Some say the future of cars is electrification but that doesn’t mean we all have to be driving Teslas. Bisimoto himself has converted a Porsche 911 Slantnose to be completely electrified. Yes that means the flat-six engine around back has been yanked replaced by electric motors and batteries. While this will surely anger purists you can’t argue with the performance specs of this Porsche.

As you can probably tell this is a Porsche 935 and complete blasphemy. Before you dismiss this car which Bisimoto built for SEMA watch the video below and see it in action. This thing is wild in so many ways and should help quell some fears of an electrified future.

Bisi Ezerioha the founder of Bisimoto points out that the tuning potential of electric motors are limitless. They provide potential you never get with internal combustion engines. It wasn’t until he was doing a job with Honda that the man realized exactly what was going on and that experience changed his outlook.

In fact Bisi says he took a new Acura NSX to a local dragstrip and was smoking Hellcats. We’ve all seen videos of Teslas doing that same thing but it’s great to hear how you don’t have to drink the punch Elon is handing out since there are alternatives.

Seriously this all might make you cringe but just watch the video. If you still think electric cars are dumb evil or whatever that’s fine. But this Porsche build is pretty amazing and sure beats any Tesla out there just in coolness factor.

We’ve pointed out that while electrification might be the future that doesn’t mean we have to yank out all the internal combustion engines from classic cars. Some fanatics might think that’s wise but you’re really destroying history doing that. However this build shows that as we move forward we don’t have to abandon all our fun.

There’s the vegan punk rocker with a soft spot for kittens and botanicals who fearlessly strolls into a local florist shop and presses his nose into a sunny bouquet. There’s the hot-rod racing granny who’s also an electrical engineer. There’s an ice sculptor a dog walker and a suburban mom with a talent for chopping wood.

The message? Despite your severe asthma Tezspire can help you “be you.”

The eclectic lineup of CGI characters made their TV debut last week in the companies’ first DTC commercial for the drug. We see them embracing their authentic lives unafraid of pet dander cold air pollen or other potential asthma triggers presumably thanks to taking Tezspire.

The “Be You” campaign was born out of patient insights showing that unpredictable asthma attacks and “triggers that come out of nowhere” can prevent people from being their true selves said Kate Tansey Chevlen Amgen’s sales and marketing head for Tezspire.

The diverse cast whose bios appear on the Tezspire website is also a nod to the drug’s label and its ability to help a broad range of severe asthma patients. The ad emphasizes that “no matter what type of severe asthma you have Tezspire can help”—playing up what analysts see as the drug’s competitive advantage.

Tezspire is indicated for severe asthma regardless of the cause of inflammation setting it apart from Sanofi and Regeneron’s heavily advertised blockbuster Dupixent GlaxoSmithKline’s Nucala and other biologics on the market that target eosinophilic forms of the disease.

The companies chose animation to further stand out among those other brands said Elizabeth Bodin AZ’s vice president for respiratory and immunology in the U.S.

“These fun characters come to life in a really vibrant way” she said allowing Tezspire’s message to “break through the noise in what we know to be a rather crowded category.”

The companies have launched a “360 surround sound” campaign airing ads on digital platforms including cable and connected TV audio and social media channels including TikTok. They’re also testing the waters with gaming and weather apps the latter of which have been largely untapped by pharma.

Asthma patients often turn to weather apps to check pollen counts or humidity levels “so we know that patients are there” said Chevlen. “We’re excited to see what kind of engagement we get there.”

AZ and Amgen launched Tezspire in January after winning FDA approval for the monoclonal antibody last December as an add-on treatment for severe patients 12 and older. Before the DTC campaign AZ and Amgen ran an unbranded awareness campaign tapping E! host Nina Parker to help patients learn how to “break the cycle” of uncontrolled asthma though it was not directly linked to Tezspire.

Analysts have pegged peak sales of the drug at $2.5 billion in 2030.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Missed pickups and bad attitudes among complaints.

_______________

Elected officials will be talking about the hauler’s performance at the Wednesday city commission meeting. This is pursuant to complaints about the hauler from residents earlier in the month.

City officials were not happy with what they heard having dealt with calls about Republic firsthand as mentioned by more than one. In turn the city has convened a list of performance issues that Republic will be asked to cure.

There was some talk about terminating the contract with Republic at the last city commission meeting but city staff isn’t recommending it. The contract took eight months to execute and with supply chain hiccups and driver shortages Margate could put itself in an even worse position like stoppages.

Moreover Margate city staff believes that not all complaints are legitimate including some when customers say they were missed.

“We suspect that some percentage of the missed residential pick-ups are a result of late set-outs” said a performance summary memo dated Friday. New trucks will be equipped with 3rd eye technology to determine which party is to blame for a missed pickup and whether the customer should be charged for a return visit.

Other complaints stem from materials that Republic doesn’t pick up such as construction/demolition debris hazardous waste or if carts are not 3’ apart.

World of Hyatt members received exciting news in 2021 when it was announced Hyatt was buying up 100 all-inclusive properties. Among the AMR Collection list was the Zoetry brand known for mixing wellness luxury and romance throughout its seven properties in the Caribbean and Central America including the Zoetry Agua Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.

Serene relaxation picture-perfect views and great dining options are delivered at a high price tag. Here are seven things you should know before booking your stay.

Cost

Zoetry Agua Punta Cana is one of the more expensive all-inclusive resorts in the Dominican Republic. Rates for a double room start at $503 per night and rise to $1000 per night in peak periods like Christmas. At this price in what is an otherwise affordable destination guests expect perfection and this wasn't always delivered.

This property has not yet been added to World of Hyatt but it will be officially added on May 9 and included in the program's new award chart for all-inclusive resorts.

I was offered an upgrade to an ocean-view suite for an additional $250 per night at check-in. A quick tour revealed it was larger than the base junior suite with garden view I had originally booked and had a tiny plunge pool but lacked privacy since it was right next to the pool bar so I declined and stayed with my original room.

Pros

It was easy to relax and truly unwind with plenty of peaceful and private spaces in a beautiful setting.

The nightly entertainment was surprisingly good for a small property.

All rooms were spacious airy suites with a personal concierge available at all times via WhatsApp.

Excellent food options in a variety of beautiful dining settings.

Room service delivered perfectly cooked french fries quickly.

Cons

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

There were numerous service failures at this premium price point.

Daily activities were frustratingly not revealed until late the night before.

Cocktails were poorly mixed using bottom-shelf spirits.

The main pool bar was promptly closed at 5 p.m. despite many guests still enjoying beverages.

Vibe: Romantic getaway

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

While there was the odd family and group during our stay it was mostly couples enjoying a quiet peaceful and romantic getaway. With fewer than 100 rooms on this huge property low occupancy and plenty of space to stretch out it never felt crowded and we didn't see many guests outside of mealtimes and performances.

If you are looking to meet new people and be constantly entertained choose somewhere else but if you want your daily troubles to melt away Zoetry Agua is a great option.

The main pool bar was the only real space to socialize with other guests though staff regularly checked on guests everywhere in the resort to offer refills. I was surprised to see the Caicu pool bar promptly closed at 5 p.m. sharp each day (I was staying over a weekend) much to the vocal dismay of the handful of guests enjoying the sunshine while quenching their thirst. This seemed like an odd cost-cutting measure at this price point for guests who clearly wanted to keep the festivities going.

Room

Our garden-view junior suite was located on the second floor back from the beach which ensured both a restful night's sleep on the four-poster bed and a lovely view of one of the many swimming pools from the suite's spacious deck. At 775 square feet it was huge for a base room. I loved the vaulted thatched ceilings and while I'm not usually a fan of so much contrasting dark wood throughout it gave a real sense of place in this tropical setting. A fruit plate bottle of chilled prosecco and local rum were waiting for us when we arrived in the room. Unfortunately the fridge stocked with some complimentary sodas and local beers took a good 24 hours to actually chill but an ice bucket was only a quick call away to speed up the process.

Essentially three separate areas the bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom. The combination of a huge toilet room double sink soaking tub and shower stocked with Bulgari toiletries was a true luxury experience.

Dining and drinking

I was impressed with the number of dining options for a resort with fewer than 100 rooms. Breakfast and lunch were both offered in the beachside Indigo restaurant a breezy open-air space just steps from the ocean. It was never more than half-full and service was excellent with drinks refilled before we even asked for them. Staff proudly served locally sourced coffee encouraging us to try it in the traditional Dominican style (black with sweetener).

I recommend both the Mexican chilaquiles for breakfast and the Argentinian steak for lunch.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 7 (Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

There were also lighter meals available poolside including surprisingly good freshly prepared sushi and a less impressive Tex-Mex pop-up buffet that was definitely quantity over quality. Fortunately these were the only buffet-type offers at the resort.

There were three separate dinner venues to choose from serving Dominican (Piragua) Mediterranean (Amaya) and Italian (Olena) cuisine. We tried the first two and the ambiance service and cuisine were luxurious and romantic. Despite staff insisting Dominican cuisine wasn't the greatest it was our favorite especially the zesty and fresh octopus salad entree.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

Over at the bar it was a much less successful affair. The cocktails were dreadful in presentation ingredients and taste. I tried a strawberry daiquiri which was served up in two minutes but tasted of nothing but the cheap local Bacanal rum and sickly sweet sugar syrup as there was no fresh (or frozen) fruit to be seen. The margarita was like sucking on a lemon with no balance of salty sweet and sour. No fresh fruit juices or smoothies were available during our stay.

Activities

With a focus on privacy and relaxation I wasn't expecting a busy schedule during my stay. I observed sunset horse riding along the beautiful beach as we arrived and excitedly told our personal concierge we would love to do it during our two-night stay. He then rattled off the available times — we'd just missed one chance and the next option was well after we checked out — with no awareness of how disappointing it was that neither option was possible. He promised to send us a list of the following day's activities by WhatsApp each evening but these did not arrive until 10 p.m. each night as we were preparing for bed. It was frustrating to have to wait until so late to plan the following day.

There was a decently appointed and deserted gym for any guests keen to balance the unlimited meals and drinks with some exercise.

An advertised wine tasting one afternoon at the Canoa lobby bar never happened with the local sommelier not receiving an invite and the bartender barely knowing the difference between white and red vinos.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

What did impress was the circus show on the first evening. Expecting some basic juggling and slapstick clowning guests instead were treated to a full trapeze constructed in the resort lobby just for that night with a talented troupe of locals hurling themselves above guests' heads with bartenders ensuring guests' thirsts were quenched. It was a great show and a brilliant use of the space.

Recommendation

The Zoetry Agua Punta Cana gets most of the basics right. The property is gorgeous and well designed from the spacious all-suite rooms to the endless private spaces to truly unwind. I haven't felt that genuinely relaxed in a long time listening to the birds chirp as the sun set by the pool with a local rum in hand. The cuisine options are varied and high quality and each dining space is a lovely place to linger over a leisurely meal and chat with the staff.

At the prices charged both the drinks and the overall service need work and there should be flexibility on the pool bar's closing time. Servicewise activities should be organized confirmed and communicated to guests much earlier. If these few hiccups can be fixed this will be a spectacular all-inclusive property."

CYPRUS 10

The Malta rugby national team were back to winning ways in the FIRA-AER Conference 1 South when they eased past Cyprus at the Tony Bezzina Stadium.

Playing in tricky windy conditions the Maltese struggled to get going in the opening stages as they struggled to break down a solid Cypriot defence.

But when they found themselves 3-0 down after a Cyprus penalty the home side suddenly clicked into gear and managed to score three tries without reply through Jethro Zammit Randich (2) and Robert Holloway to take complete command of the match.

Cyprus tried to hit back after the break but the Maltese held firm to wrap up their commitments in style as they ensured they finished second in the group behind Croatia.

Malta pressed on the accelerator right from the outset as they put huge pressure on the Cypriot defence who resorted to all means to try to keep out the home side.

Chris Dudman had the chance to put the hosts in front from a central penalty kick but fired off target.

Jews have started Passover celebrations Muslims are marking Ramadan and Easter has arrived for Christians.

It's a time of reflection and a moment to affirm a commitment to faith for believers. But is it also an opportunity for adherents to alter their investment plans and base them on religious principles?

Religious or faith-based investment funds provide one answer. These portfolios all try to provide investors with solid returns without buying stocks or bonds issued by objectionable or ""sinful"" companies though those definitions vary.

Most Americans probably don't invest in this manner though faith-based investing is getting easier to do with the advent of more religious mutual- and exchange-traded funds. These portfolios have professional money managers at the helm who can among other tasks sort through companies based at least partly on the types of businesses they operate.

Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are both examples of broadly diversified portfolios that investors usually can purchase for a few thousand dollars if not less. The two categories vary in a few key respects — one being that people can buy or sell mutual funds only at a single daily closing price while ETFs can be traded at various prices throughout the day.

Not a large grouping of funds

While religious funds have existed for decades they haven't taken the investment world by storm. The funds are still comparatively few in number with relatively small assets under management.

Investment researcher Morningstar doesn't even break out religious funds as a separate category instead lumping them in the larger ESG — or environmental social and governance grouping — which numbers around 600 funds.

Broader ESG portfolios often are more geared to avoiding carbon polluters other environmental violators and companies engaged in animal testing/abuses. Religious funds are more focused around lifestyle issues.

While Christian funds predominate among the religious offerings Islamic funds also have gained a following such as the Amana mutual funds managed by Saturna Capital. The Amana funds steer clear of businesses engaged in liquor pornography gambling and banking. They also avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities favoring dividend-pay stocks for income.

For example large holdings in the Amana Income Fund include dividend payers Eli Lilly Microsoft Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Rockwell Automation and Pfizer.

Another Islam-focused portfolio the Azzad Ethical Fund excludes those types of corporations as well as tobacco producers weapons manufacturers some insurance companies and corporations suspected of being connected to human-rights abuses.

Different areas of emphasis

Even under the same general religious banner faith-based funds differ somewhat in their investment emphasis especially when screening out companies.

The Ave Maria fund family for example favors corporations that follow or at least don't violate anti-abortion Catholic values. The fund group said it avoids investments in several key areas — corporations engaged in or supporting abortion including Planned Parenthood pornography embryonic stem-cell research and companies with policies deemed to undermine the sacrament of marriage.

Incidentally advisers to the Ave Maria funds range from Detroit Archbishop Allen Vigneron to economist/Fox News anchor Larry Kudlow to Lou Holtz the Notre Dame football coaching legend.

By contrast the new FIS Biblically Responsible Risk Managed Fund based in Scottsdale enunciates a longer list. This fund won't invest in corporations believed to be involved in abortion contraception embryonic stem-cell research/human cloning human-rights violations pornography alcohol tobacco armaments or gambling.

""This fund is designed for the broad Christian community"" said manager Steven Nelson a former Catholic youth minister. ""For most Christians our fund will have appeal.""

The fund also seeks to invest in companies that it deems are building a healthier society and acting as responsible corporate citizens.

Much is in eyes of the beholder

But in many cases portfolio managers don't always have a clear-cut decision on whether a corporation would make an acceptable faith-based investment — not just based on business operations but also in terms of which groups or causes a firm supports with its philanthropic dollars or promotional efforts.

For example some Christian portfolio managers will blankly avoid companies that say donate to gay-rights groups or Planned Parenthood Nelson said. His fund also avoids such companies on donations made within the past two years but not longer than that.

It also comes down to context. For example if a company like Verizon gave $5000 to an objectionable nonprofit group clearly reflecting an employee match Nelson said he wouldn't remove or avoid the stock on that basis. ""But some managers would"" he said.

Top stock holdings in the FIS Biblically Responsible Fund which trades under the ticker symbol ""PRAY"" include Palo Alto Networks Apple Medtronic Ecolab and Zimmer Biomet. The fund also holds shares in two Arizona-based corporations — trash hauler Republic Services and GoDaddy the technology-services provider for small businesses.

Do religious funds sacrifice returns?

To the extent that religious funds aren't widely embraced that could partly reflect a perception that by weeding out stocks or bonds in certain industries investors will sacrifice performance.

Yet one study from the Christian Investment Forum showed solid results.

The study tracked the returns of 35 Christian stock funds against other stock funds over the 15 years through December 2020. Christian funds gained 7.1% annually on average over that period compared with 6.3% annually for the other stock funds. The study also attributed a slight performance edge to nine Christian bond funds against fixed-income funds in general 4.2% annually compared with 3.8%.

While based on a relatively small number of both stock and especially bond funds the results offer some support for the religious-investing cause at least for individuals who share similar values.

The study ""dispels some of the long-standing perceptions that incorporating faith-based criteria in addition to traditional investment criteria is correlated to underperformance"" wrote the study's author John Siverling.

With its own 15-page performance manual low production costs and a bargain price for shoppers it is marketed as the world’s most popular meat chicken.

Owned by the global breeding firm Aviagen the Ross 308 has been bred to reach its kill weight in just 35 days growing more than three times faster than the conventional breeds of the 1950s.

While families across the country gather this weekend the Ross 308 will be an affordable option for the Easter Sunday roast. A whole chicken can be bought for as little as £2.46.

Animal welfare campaigners claim the cost of such low-priced meat is being paid for by the chickens which grow so fast their hearts and bone structures can struggle to cope. They want retailers to stop selling the Ross 308 and the Cobb 500 the UK’s other main fast-growing breed citing research showing these chickens had higher mortality lameness and muscle disease than slower-growing breeds.

But the poultry industry warned this weekend that adopting slower-growing breeds could increase the price of a standard chicken by more than 30% at a time when consumers face a cost of living crisis. This puts meat chickens – known in the industry as broilers – at the centre of one of the biggest animal welfare battles since the 2012 ban on barren battery cages for hens.

There are now 325 retailers and firms in the UK and Europe including Marks & Spencer Waitrose KFC and Premier Foods that have signed up to the Better Chicken Commitment the international initiative to phase out the use of fast-growing breeds which campaigners call “Frankenchickens”.

The commitment requires companies to adopt slower-growing breeds by 2026 including some produced by Aviagen with higher welfare outcomes and reduced stocking density.

All the major food supermarkets in France have signed up to the commitment. The Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs said in February that one of its welfare priorities was to implement the commitment.

However most of the major supermarkets in the UK including Tesco Sainsbury’s and Asda are yet to sign up to the pledge and there is concern among campaigners that the cost of living crisis may be used to stall the campaign.

The environment secretary George Eustice warned last month that the price of chicken could rise significantly because of higher energy costs and feed prices affected by war in Ukraine.

Campaigners say poultry has been produced too cheaply and farmers need to be paid more to ensure better conditions for the meat chickens.

On the modern food plate the chicken can be cheaper than chips. A 1.4kg Willow Farm whole chicken in Tesco costs just £2.89 (£2.07 per kg) compared to a 1.6kg bag of McCain home chips costing £3.50 (£2.19 per kg).

Connor Jackson chief executive of the animal welfare group Open Cages which has conducted covert investigations into broiler farms said: “It’s very sad that these animals’ lives have become worth so little. We call them Frankenchickens. The science is clear that fast-growing chickens like the Ross 308 are doomed by their genetics. These have been engineered to grow so incredibly fast and their bodies just cannot handle it.”

Jackson said secret filming at broiler farms supplying big supermarkets has shown birds struggling to walk or collapsing under their own weight or dying from heart failure and dead birds were filmed lying among the flocks. Chicken producers say they are committed to animal welfare and the overwhelming majority of birds are clean and healthy.

The modern broiler industry expanded in the US and Britain after the second world war. Large-scale breeding firms used genetic selection to produce birds with faster growth rates efficient conversion of feed to muscle growth and a higher yield of breast meat.

More than 1.1 billion broilers are produced each year in the UK with the Ross 308 the most popular brand. Millions are reared on farms which can house more than 200000 birds.

A 2019 study by Aarhus University in Denmark and Wageningen University in the Netherlands found a Ross 308 took 32 days to reach 1.8kg compared to a broiler developed from 1957 commercial meat chicken which took more than 100 days to reach the same weight.

The fast-growing breeds are helping to provide a cheap and plentiful supply of meat but in recent years research has highlighted animal welfare concerns. A report by the RSPCA in March 2020 found the fast-growing broilers had significantly higher mortality (including culls) a greater risk of being lame and were more affected by the breast muscle diseases wooden breast and white striping.

The report said: “Although current genetic selection programmes may be justified by some on the basis they result in an animal that provides a cheap efficient source of meat and protein there is no acceptable justification when such programmes have serious inherent flaws and are associated with poor health and welfare.”

Andrew Knight a professor of animal welfare and ethics at the University of Winchester said: “With these really rapid growth rates it can be difficult for the heart and circulatory system to keep up with the expanding body mass. A proportion of these animals suffer from heart failure. It’s also difficult for the bones ligaments and tendons to keep up with the rapidly increasing body mass meaning that a proportion of these birds become severely lame.”

The animal welfare charity the Humane League UK unsuccessfully sought a judicial review against the government over the production of fast-growing chickens which it considers is in breach of the 2007 welfare of farmed animals regulations which state animals can only be farmed if they can be kept “without any detrimental effect on their health or welfare”. The charity said last week it intends to appeal.

Richard Griffiths chief executive at the British Poultry Council said farmers needed healthy chicken but considered fast-growing breeds like the Ross 308 could be reared with good animal welfare. He said there were concerns about the pace of growth but improved farming technology and breeding were making a difference and the adoption by the industry of slower growing breeds and reduced stocking density would have a significant environmental impact because this woud require more feed and more space. But it could also increase the price of fresh chicken by more than 30%.

“We are a dynamic industry and we respond to consumer demand but there are several factors involved including a cost of living crisis.”

Rob Morton 49 of Morton’s Family Farm in Norfolk rears the slower-growing Hubbard JA787 chicken for the Christmas market and hopes to expand production year round. “It makes a better-tasting bird because they have time to mature.”

A British Retail Consortium spokesperson said supermarkets offered customers affordable choices at high standards including those in the Better Chicken Commitment: “All major UK supermarkets take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously.”

A spokesperson for Aviagen which has its headquarters in Alabama in the US said: “Our first priority is and has always been the welfare of our birds. Welfare characteristics are a major part of modern broiler breeding and are among the absolutely top selection priorities for all of our breeds we supply.” The spokesperson said the company bred a range of birds to suit different requirements including the Better Chicken Commitment.

Dr Tracey Jones director of food business at Compassion in World Farming said last week it was possible to implement the Better Chicken Commitment despite rising food prices. “It is going to be difficult but we need to be eating less meat. We could then perhaps afford to pay for better-quality chicken.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9kdC5jby5uei9ydXJhbC1saWZlL2hvcnRpY3VsdHVyZS9mbHlpbmctaGlnaC1zZWVkcy1zdWNjZXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flying high on the seeds of success,"Main image: Topflite marketing manager Carolyn Webster and general manager Greg Webster; clockwise from top left sunflowers are still a staple seed for the pet food business; Greg Webster checks out a paddock of canary seed.

When Greg Webster was growing up on a farm in rural North Otago he vividly recalls his father Jock telling him never to be a farmer.

It was the 1980s — an era that was ""so tough"" for farmers who were battling crippling drought and huge interest rates.

""They were under the pump. Some of that probably rubbed off"" Mr Webster recalled this week.

As well as farming at Totara Jock Webster was also an innovative thinker establishing a birdseed business with his brother-in-law Ross Mitchell.

From humble beginnings selling by mail order to bird breeders Topflite as it is now known has grown to be New Zealand’s largest bird rabbit and guinea pig feed provider.

At its helm as general manager is Greg Webster who now owns half the business with his wife Carolyn.

He was proud to be the next generation involved with the family-owned business and New Zealand-grown success story factors which resonated with customers in the burgeoning pet industry he said.

The Mitchell family settled at Rosedale near Weston in 1871 and become linked to the Webster family when Ainslie Webster — Jock’s sister — married Ross Mitchell.

After completing a degree in agricultural science at Lincoln in 1970 Jock got a job as a scientist at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research but after 13 months he decided it was not for him.

He had several job offers including one from Ross Mitchell who was farming with his brother Bruce.

Mr Mitchell thought they might be able to help him into a farm something Mr Webster had always dreamed of having.

In 1977 he achieved that dream of buying a property at Totara where he and his wife Helen raised their children Nick Jane and Greg.

In 1974 the first sunflower crops were planted at Rosedale. The intention was to the seed for oil as the Mitchell and Webster families looked for a better return outside conventional crops.

Greg Webster said both his father and uncle had an ability to look at opportunities and be willing to try them — in this case undertaking research on how to grow sunflowers.

Ross Mitchell travelled to the United States visiting universities and learning about the equipment they needed.

They realised there was a market for birdseed and initially they were selling the seed in bulk until the processor failed to pay the bills.

So they thought they would have a crack at doing it themselves initially under the Mitchell and Webster name.

As well as selling by mail order they had a few distributors who would buy containers of seed off them at harvest time to distribute to bird breeders.

Canary seed was added but it was still a reasonably basic operation based at the Mitchell family’s farm.

The Topflite brand was developed in the 1990s and they started doing seed mixes for birds. Jock Webster did a lot of work to get the formulations right.

His son described the growth of the business as a ""slow burn"" — Faye Stewart a big part of the business for more than 20 years and his father would travel around the country ""slowly chipping away"" and getting more retailers.

The business continued to expand the range over the years to rabbits guinea pigs chooks ducks and wild birds and its products were now stocked by about 700 retailers in New Zealand.

Greg Webster attributed a lot of that to the work done in those early years.

Pet store Animates was one of its big customers and Topflite had supplied that business since it started with only one store.

Heeding his father’s advice Greg left Waitaki Boys’ High School and headed to the University of Otago to study business.

Always keen on finance numbers and business his plan was to head to London afterwards and work in finance.

In the background Topflite was always ""there"" and he did some work there during university holidays as well as some market research for a couple of studies and also worked on some product development.

""I was always involved in some level.""

After studying marketing and accounting he got a job at KPMG in Auckland where he attained his chartered accountant qualification.

KPMG employed graduates each year so there was a good group of young people there. As he recalled it was good training and good fun.

He headed to London in 2009 a year after the Global Financial Crash and enjoyed the lifestyle of the big city.

He worked for global paint company Akzo Nobel in a treasury-type function for three and a-half-years.

He met his future wife Carolyn in London through mutual friends.

Both had been to the University of Otago but had not bumped into each other.

The daughter of an English mother and a New Zealand father Mrs Webster grew up in South America and attended school in the United Kingdom.

She was drawn to London by both school and university friends living in the city and was working in financial PR when the couple met.

While in London Mr Webster saw some opportunities relating to feeding wild birds which was a ""huge"" business in the UK. He got in touch with a large manufacturer and organised to bring some lines to New Zealand.

The couple returned to New Zealand in 2013 with the first of their three children 6-month-old Molly in tow.

They had enjoyed a ""pretty good run"" in London and had done lots of travelling but life was changing with a young family.

While it was always a possibility it was not obvious at that stage that Mr Webster was going to work for Topflite and he also looked at other options to get wider business experience.

The family moved to Mt Maunganui and a role was created for him in sales and business development. He also did a ""fair bit"" on the financial side.

Moving there was a way to ease back into the New Zealand pace of lifestyle. Mrs Webster started to get involved ""around the edges"" in the likes of label design fitting it in around family.

Before moving to North Otago in 2016 Mr Webster began work as Topflite general manager and was regularly back in his home district.

Coinciding with that was the establishment of a distribution hub and head office in the industrial area in north Oamaru as it was ""overflowing"" at Rosedale he said.

Succession also needed to be dealt with; Greg and Carolyn now co-own Topflite with Greg’s cousin Peter Mitchell (Ross and Ainslie Mitchell’s son) and his wife Sandra while Greg’s brother Nick and his wife Kate have a dairy farming and sheep and beef operation.

Peter Mitchell is at the helm of Rosedale Farming Company which continues to be a key supplier to Topflite providing about 35% to 40% of the raw material it used from land both owned and leased.

Greg Webster said a big turning point for the company was securing a contract to supply Farmlands after the South Island’s CRT and the North Island’s Farmlands merged in 2013.

Previously Topflite had supplied CRT stores and a few Farmlands stores.

Winning that contract got the company a lot greater market share in the North Island and its business had consistently grown since then.

""They’ve been a big part of our growth story"" he said.

As well as from Rosedale Farming raw materials were also sourced from other areas particularly Canterbury.

Some lines such as millet seed that did not grow well in New Zealand were imported but Topflite endeavoured to ""keep that to a minimum"" as the New Zealand-grown ethos was still a very important part of its story and it was still growing sunflower seeds and canary seed in North Otago as it did in the early years.

""We have tried to stick to what’s worked for us and been successful taking a natural product as much as possible not messing with it and focusing on the quality of the product"" he said.

This year crops had struggled during what was a ""particularly average year"".

There had been little sun something sunflowers needed but they had ""just"" enough sunflower seed for the next year.

One of Topflite’s challenges was it was competing with other specialised crops farmers could grow sometimes putting pressure on prices it had to pay.

And as Topflite kept growing Rosedale Farming could not keep matching that growth — unless it was continually expanding its footprint — and so Mr Webster was keen to find more long-term partners.

That he acknowledged was a good complaint to have.

Peter Mitchell was heavily involved with the arable industry so his insight continued to be extremely valuable. Coming from a farming background also helped.

""We’re farmers at heart as well. We understand the complexities [of the industry]"" Mr Webster said.

While no longer a director of Topflite Jock Webster was on an advisory board which met every two months.

That initiative had been ""fantastic"" with external advisers providing an independent view and giving ""a nudge"" when needed.

It also freed up Greg to do more innovation-focused projects something that he really enjoyed. The pet industry was increasingly competitive and they needed to ""keep bringing out new things"".

The company recently completed a strategy reset and a big focus was on making sure it had a pipeline of product development hence the recent expansion into the dog food market.

This month Topflite launched the Hound brand selling New Zealand-raised freeze-dried meat treats packaged in eco-friendly compostable bags film or recyclable cardboard.

Demand for locally sourced pet food has risen sharply during the pandemic when global supply chains were unreliable and shipping costs were rising.

Freeze-drying fresh meat ensured 97% of its original nutritional value was retained from its raw state.

With 99% of moisture removed it was a lightweight treat that was blood-free and minimally processed with no additives preservatives or fillers.

As people were increasingly concerned about the origin sustainability impact and nutritional value of their food they wanted the same for their pets Mr Webster said.

A few years ago he did some courses through Icehouse and part of a market validation exercise was identifying opportunities.

He chose dog treats and given how quickly the pet industry was growing he reckoned he should have ""nailed it down"" then. Since then it had always been on the radar and was about finding the right opportunity.

Dogs were becoming an important part of the family in New Zealand although the country was still a fair way behind other countries such as the United States or China where some doting dog owners had treadmills installed to take their dogs for walks inside or took part in fashion shows for dogs he said.

Covid-19 had provided opportunities for Topflite as people were spending more time at home unable to travel and had more money to buy another dog and feed it nice things — or they got a bird or rabbit Mr Webster said.

Pet ownership had increased during the pandemic. Many people had built chicken coops — treating the hens like pets more than egg layers — or fed wild birds which were especially noticeable during lockdowns when there were fewer cars around.

People had also become much more supportive of New Zealand-grown products and businesses. And Topflite’s story was a ""real story"" he said.

Topflite did not export any products. It went through a project last year with an export consultancy to explore the possibility but seed and grain was ""really tricky"" with customs-related issues.

It might happen at some point in the future but in the meantime there were still plenty of opportunities in the domestic market Mr Webster said.

Providing the dog treats rollout went well then there was a possibility of adding meal options.

The wild bird feeding sector was still ""massively growing"" and Topflite continued to look at developing products that were good to feed native birds.

About four years ago Topflite added hay to its range repacking it for convenience and that had grown a lot.

Cats were also another possibility for feed options.

Topflite — a finalist in the primary industry category in the 2020 Westpac Otago Business Awards — employed about 30 staff.

While it had always preferred to stay out of the spotlight it now realised the importance of brand recognition particularly when it came to staff recruitment.

""People don’t know what we’re doing and [that] it’s a decent-sized business. Most people think it’s going to be a little garage"" he said.

Recruiting staff could be a challenge sometimes but increasingly people were willing to move to North Otago which was a far cry from Mr Webster’s own days growing up in the district.

He acknowledged the Mitchell and Webster families had shown great foresight — ""a lot of people probably thought it was crazy at the time"" — and a lot of the design and engineering work done by Ross Mitchell was still in use at Rosedale.

Agriculture had been the main driver for the revival of the town particularly the development of irrigation in the district in which Jock Webster played a key role.

Greg felt fortunate to have the opportunity to return to North Otago and to be involved in a business like Topflite and continue the family involvement with the business.

Mrs Webster was Topflite’s marketing manager and the couple endeavoured to keep a balance between work life and family life spending time in Central Otago and the Waitaki lakes area.

There were always challenges and areas to improve but Mr Webster believed the business was on a ""pretty good curve"".

""Things are growing. Manage the madness really because it’s growing reasonably quickly especially the last two years makes it quite busy.""

As for the family’s own bird involvement? They have four chooks and some quail and Mr Webster was contemplating building an aviary during the Easter break.

And keeping watch at the Topflite headquarters was Bert the resident office cockatiel for about 18 years.

His longevity Mr Webster — not missing a marketing opportunity — quickly attributed to living solely off Topflite seed.

Last Updated 2 years ago

The construction of the soon-to-be world’s largest cruise liner began last week – with the ship set to sail in 2024.

And to mark the milestone a steel-cutting ceremony – for what will be Royal Caribbean’s sixth ‘Oasis Class’ vessel – took place in France on April 5 at the Chantiers de l’Atlantique shipyard.

Along with the first piece of vessel’s steel being cut the ceremony also saw the official unveiling of the cruise liner’s name – with the latest addition to Royal Caribbean’s fleet being called Utopia of the Seas.

Having outlined the company’s “excitement” for reaching the opening stages of the ship’s construction work Royal Caribbean International’s President and CEO – Michael Bayley – also made the following statement at last week’s ceremony:

“On the sixth Oasis Class ship vacationers can look forward to the signature combination of Royal Caribbean experiences and many brand-new adventures that has and will continue to make the Oasis class of ships the ultimate vacation for guests of all ages.”

You can watch a short video from the steel-cutting ceremony by clicking here.

Utopia Of The Seas – What We Know So Far

Although Royal Caribbean has not announced the full details of what to expect from their upcoming cruise liner – we do know that it is set to become the first of its class to be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG).

LNG is currently the cleanest fuel available to power passenger cruise liners – and so Utopia of the Seas is certainly a step in the right direction when it comes to a cleaner and greener future in the cruise world.

This will not be the company’s first LNG-powered ship however with Royal Caribbean's next addition – Icon of the Seas – also to be fitted with an LNG fuel tank.

Utopia of the Seas is set to also feature other applications – that are due to be powered in a more environmentally friendly way – which should hopefully lead to the ship being more energy efficient and therefore less harmful to the environment.

Further details on Utopia of the Seas are due to be released at a later date.

When Will ‘Utopia Of The Seas’ Be Ready To Welcome Passengers?

The new addition to Royal Caribbean's fleet of ‘Oasis Class’ passenger cruise ships – which has aptly been named Utopia of the Seas – is due to make its first passenger-filled voyage in the spring of 2024.

With the ship’s construction only just beginning last week (5 April) – it is expected to take around 30 months to complete.

Royal Caribbean Also Owns The World’s ‘Current’ Biggest Cruise Ship

Although Utopia of the Seas is set to claim the crown of being the world’s biggest cruise liner it will not be the first time that Royal Caribbean has seen one of its ships crowned with this title.

That is because just last month its latest addition to its fleet of ‘Oasis Class’ vessels Wonder of the Seas set sail for the very first time – with the ship currently being the world’s largest.

The cruise liner took the title from yet another Royal Caribbean ship – Symphony of the Seas – with Wonder of the Seas measuring at an eye-watering 236857 gross tonnage (grt) in weight and 1118 feet in length.

Symphony of the Seas measures at 228081 grt in weight and 1184 feet in length.

However it will not be long before there is a new ‘number one’ when it comes to the biggest cruise ships on the planet – with Utopia of the Seas set to measure at a whopping 231000 grt.

In other news Royal Caribbean has recently welcomed back the self-service option to its onboard buffets – which follows the recent removal of all travel advisories for cruise cruises by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Apart from a mentorship session with Ian Spencer Sandals’ Regional Public Relations Manager for Montego Bay the students all received gifts and were treated to refreshments at the event held at the Montego Bay Boys’ Club complex.

For their part and to mark the event member of the boys’ club’s female band put on a musical feast and entertained the large audience with top-class musical renditions.

‘Spreading the Love’ is a series of events that both Sandals the SDC are fostering in a number of Montego Bay inner-city communities.

In his welcome address Racino Brown SDC Community Officer for the Montego Bay Division was effusive in her praise of Sandals Resorts and the many team members from Sandals Montego Bay and Sandals Royal Caribbean who turned out to assist in motivating and feting the youngsters.

“We are so happy Sandals has seen it fit to continue ‘spreading the love’ with us as the young people from this area are in need of mentorship and assistance. We at the SDC are happy with the partnership and look forward to launching more programmes in this area” said Brown.

Evett Malcolm SDC Field Supervisor for Montego Bay who was also present at the event along with a number of other SDC community relations officers including organiser Warren Morle pledged the support of her team to the charitable efforts noting that “The SDC and Sandals will continue this effort as we seek to shape the minds of the young people in these beloved communities and assist in every way possible.”

Spencer expressed delight at being part of the community thrust by Sandals and the SDC in the inner-city communities.

“I grew up on this here Barnett Street just a few metres from here” stated Spencer. “So as a product of the inner-city I am happy that I am able to be part of a company that is committed to giving back to this country. I walked in these students’ shoes when I was younger so I know the hardships that people are facing especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.”

To loud applause from the gathering Spencer said “You have our commitment that we will continue these efforts.”

He also praised the SDC for its work in transforming the lives of young people in the Greater Montego Bay area and said the agency has been providing a critical service.

The Sandals regional PR manager said a Sandals mentorship effort is to come on stream in the Greater Montego Bay area shortly in an effort to provide career guidance to the young people.

He also praised the work of the boys’ club in unearthing and shaping the talents of youngsters in the community for several decades.

“I grew up listening to the boys’ club marching bands and the various musicians so I know first-hand of your work” said Spencer.

The musical instructor at the boys’ club who simply goes by the one-word moniker ‘Cava’ thanked both Sandals and the SDC on behalf of the recipients. He said the students were very happy for the treat and looked forward to a continued partnership among all three organisations to help in the upliftment of the youth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlZmV2ZXIubmV0L21haWRlbi12b3lhZ2VzLW9mLW5ldy1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcHMtd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maiden Voyages of New Cruise Ships What You Should Expect,"There’s just something special about being the maiden voyage of a brand new cruise ship. From being the first one to sleep in your cabin to special parties that some cruise lines throw there’s anyways a unique excitement that you’ll find on these cruises that you won’t find on regular sailings.

Over the past month I’ve had the opportunity to sail on the inaugural cruises on several different new cruise ships. I’ve actually been able to sail on quite a few over the past few years. If you are looking to cruise on a maiden voyage on a new ship in the future here are some things that you should know.

Service May Be Slower at First – If there’s one thing I’ve noticed more than anything else about a ship’s first sailing service can be a bit slower than usual. It takes a few weeks to get all the kinks out and for the crew who are working together for the first time to find their rhythm and work efficiently as a group. This is especially true in the main dining room.

On my most recent cruise there was considerable improvement from the first couple days of the cruise to the end of the sailing. Simple things like drink service times were much faster at the end of the cruise compared to the beginning.

Special Deck Parties/Events – One great thing about being on the first cruise on a new ship are the special parties and events that a cruise line may throw. While every cruise line does things differently one sailing I was on had a sailaway party on the pool deck with free drinks for everyone.

Also it’s common for the fireboats to come along side the ship and spray water as you leave port for the first time and as you enter ports of call for the first time.

When I was on the first sailing on the world’s largest cruise ship Royal Caribbean’s Wonder of the Seas thousands lined the port entrance in San Juan as we left that evening. They were cheering blowing airhorns and shining the flashlights on their phone. It was a super cool sendoff from one of my favorite ports that only happened on the maiden voyage.

Shows May Not Be 100% Ready – This one was true for my recent sailings on two new cruise ships. Due to supply chain issues not all costumes and props had arrived. After one show they told us that they were still waiting on 95% of their props.

Also a few of the shows they told us that they weren’t quite ready yet. While they did give us a short preview of one of them it wasn’t the same as the full experience that many cruisers love. The cruise lines said that the full shows would be ready in about three weeks time.

Commemorative Gifts – Cruise lines will many times leave small gifts in your stateroom on maiden cruises. From hats to sextants that doubled as a bottle opener it’s always a nice surprise finding gifts on your bed when you come back from dinner.

A few times cruise lines have given me a certificate to commemorate sailing on the cruise ship’s inaugural voyage.

If you are looking for the best possible cruise experience and you want to sail on a brand new cruise ship you may want to wait and sail on the 3rd or 4th sailing. If you don’t mind a few hiccups and want to be the first on a new ship then go ahead and book the maiden cruise.",,,,,,

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RveW90YS13aWxsLWNoYWxsZW5nZS10aGUtbWF6ZGEtbWlhdGEtZGlyZWN0bHktd2l0aC1pdHMtcy1mci1zcG9ydHMtY2FyLXJlcG9ydNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toyota Will Challenge the Mazda Miata Directly With Its S-FR Sports Car: Report,"Way back in 2015 Toyota tantalized us with the prospect of a Mazda MX-5 competitor called the S-FR concept. This big-mouthed sports car promised two-plus-two seating in an even smaller lighter package than the 86 contrasting the two-seat Mazda. Though the S-FR fell off the radar Toyota apparently didn't forget about it as Japanese media indicates the S-FR is finally cleared for production.

Citing Best Car Magazine which typically publishes original reporting in print before sharing it online Forbes says the S-FR will launch in late 2026 or early 2027. It's reported to be in co-development with Daihatsu and Suzuki which were previously rumored to be working on a small mid-engined model together. It seems that project has evolved into a more conventional front-engined rear-wheel-drive coupe that'll become the S-FR—with a larger more powerful engine.

Toyota S-FR Racing Concept. Toyota

Specifically the S-FR is reported to use a three-cylinder turbo engine making around 150 horsepower to turn the rear wheels. Curiously rumors of a revived Toyota Starlet with a GR performance version specify a similar engine; 150 hp from a 1.3-liter engine downsized from the one in the GR Corolla. This also matches the displacement of the engine in the Daihatsu Vision Copen concept from October which would seem to preview Toyota's next sports car. Or at least Daihatsu's version of it.

The S-FR's design will reportedly be overhauled for production with a smaller grille and altered headlights. There was no word as to the potential implementation of the S-FR Racing concept pictured above with its aggressive rear wing canards splitter and diffuser. These could feasibly be offered as accessories or even as exclusives on a hypothetical GR model. That's purely speculative on our part though.

Price-wise Toyota is reportedly targeting the equivalent of $22700. That wouldn't just undercut the Mazda MX-5 by around $6000 but also make it one of the cheapest new cars on sale in the U.S. period—if it makes it here. Toyota is reportedly undecided about selling the S-FR in the States where it already sells the similar GR86. Offering both could easily cannibalize sales potentially without taking as much share of Mazda's pie as intended.

There's also the question of where it'd fit with the supposed Celica reboot which could culminate in a thrifty fun rear-wheel-drive coupe to compete with the Honda Prelude. It too seems like it'd contend for S-FR and GR86 customers weakening the prospects for all involved. If the S-FR does come around my money's on it staying out of the States just like the Starlet is supposed to. I mean with Mazda locking down the small sports car market and the GR86 addressing one size up why even bother?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9yb3NzaS1icm90aGVycy1sZWxsaW8tZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2thcmVuLXMtcmVudHoteW91bmdzdG93bi1vaGlvL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9yb3NzaS1icm90aGVycy1sZWxsaW8tZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2thcmVuLXMtcmVudHoteW91bmdzdG93bi1vaGlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karen S.

While it may not be looking for another big deal M&A is core to its growth strategy analysts say.

Here are eight companies analysts think Salesforce could look to acquire next.

Salesforce closed its massive $27.7 billion deal to buy Slack last year and has been focused on integrating the workplace chat tool with its platform ever since. It was the company's largest acquisition and its third big deal in three years after MuleSoft in 2018 and Tableau in 2019.

That's part of the reason Salesforce doesn't have plans for ""material M&A in the near term"" co-CEO Bret Taylor said in the company's most recent earnings call in March. ""Marc and I could not be more pleased with how the Slack integration is going and that remains our top priority as a management team.""

Cody Brown 23 pleaded guilty to charges of vehicular homicide and reckless driving causing injury during a hearing before Circuit Judge Howard Coates.

He received a 24-month prison sentence to be followed by six years of probation. Coates also revoked Brown's driver's license for three years and ordered him to attend a panel where he will hear statements from the families of victims of reckless driving.

Brown was arrested on the charges after Florida Highway Patrol investigators said he drove in excess of 120 mph moments before rear-ending a vehicle on southbound I-95 north of Gateway Boulevard early in the morning of May 18 2019.

FHP reports said Brown struck a Toyota Camry driven by Jennifer Lee Malm 40 who was killed in the collision. The impact of the crash pushed Malm's Toyota into a Dodge Avenger in an adjacent lane. The Toyota spun out as the Dodge flipped onto a grass embankment.

Investigators said Brown did not brake as his car approached Malm's sedan instead accelerating to 123 mph from 115 mph in the seconds before the crash.

The driver of the Dodge and a passenger in Malm's vehicle sustained serious injuries. Brown and a passenger in his Lexus sedan received treatment for minor injuries.

After the crash Brown told state troopers he was on his way that morning to his mother’s job at Gateway Boulevard and Federal Highway in Boynton Beach after finishing his shift at the Pelican Club a wedding and catering venue on Jupiter's waterfront.

Brown said he was traveling below the highway's posted speed limit of 65 mph but records from the car's event-data recorder showed that he was speeding FHP said.

According to her obituary Malm worked as a real-estate administrator for SBA Communications which is headquartered in Boca Raton for 12 years. She had three children and a grandchild and was engaged to be married.

Fast forward almost a decade they’ve amassed over half a million followers on TikTok started their own design collection (the aptly titled Probably This Collection) and this week released their own book simply titled “Housewarming”. They’ve also branched out into unique and inventive cocktail and dining recipes where they’ve crafted everything from a “Blossom Colada” cocktail or Turkey Andouille Gumbo.

What many might describe as the pivot in their career actually came during a time that many others saw game-changing moments in their own career occur; during the pandemic. Beau & Matt would kick off their videos saying “Hey sweetie it’s your gay uncles” as they subsequently launched into horticulture advice or offered up cocktail recipes. This dose of domestic normalcy coupled with the feel-good and homey vibe that Beau & Matt offered was the antidote many needed during those early pandemic days.

Designers pull influence from a multitude of places but for Armato & Ciolino their inspiration comes from New Orleans Lousiana which they both call home and their career is almost an overarching love letter to. Ciolino told Nola that “We’ve always found a real advantage in being somewhere that inspires us and also has a really unique point of view”. He went on to say that “We’ve been really fortunate to have New Orleans and Louisiana as a whole give us a really unique lens through which to look at the world and to look at design and to look at architecture and food and entertaining and community which are all really big pillars of what we do and explore in our brand day to day”.

Their book “Housewarming” is the next natural step for the boys of Probably This. Ciolino is able to pull from his background in the kitchen baking and cooking while Armato has significant experience in the service industry along with their shared love of The Big Easy all of which which is represented in “Housewarming”. Beau & Matt combine their talents effortlessly in the book which flows through everything from choosing the perfect paint color making the most of the space in your room or crafting the perfect cocktail to treat yourself at the end of the day.

Squashed in there somewhere is the number of Peeps that will be bought and consumed.

Almost too adorable to eat — but for some too tasty to ignore — the dyed marshmallow treat is part of a candy empire not always mentioned in the same grouping as Mars Nestlé or Hershey.

It’s Just Born maker of Mike & Ike Hot Tamales Goldenberg’s Peanut Chews … and Peeps.

Considered so vital to the nation’s collective psyche that Just Born was deemed an essential business in its native Pennsylvania back in 2020 it briefly shut down production to “flatten the curve” sending untold millions in negative sugar shock. That’s all in the past.

Just as candy corn evokes Halloween nothing says “Easter basket” like chicks and bunnies in day-glo colors.

So important is the candy that it called for a survey.

On March 22 Just Born released results of its Peeps survey of 1000 Americans finding that “68% of Americans have had their first experience with Peeps by the time they were 9 years old” making it sound more like a rite of passage than an eventual trip to the dentist.

Rite of passage is overstating it but peeps people have strong feelings — with 88% of Americans specifying “fresh” (unopened) Peeps in the survey ensuring a “pillowy texture.”

Helicopter parents like to unbox and position Peeps in decorative arrangements but the data says knock it off. Keep chicks and bunnies in their packaging. Think “pillowy.”

Also 64% of Americans prefer chicks to bunnies. It’s a survey-validated fact. There are too many possible punchlines for that stat. Could be tied to the Easter Bunny somehow.

Chicks Bunnies and Candy Money

As a retail holiday Easter holds its own because it features candy. Smart.

The National Confectioners Association (NCA) released its 2022 State of Treating report April 6 telling candy lovers everywhere what they already knew. It’s a lip-smacking business.

Key findings tell us that candy is almost a $37 billion segment ruled by chocolate at over $21 billion in sales last year (up over 9% from 2020) and that “78% of all adults believe it is perfectly fine to occasionally treat with chocolate or candy.”

We’ll let someone else try to define “occasionally” as it relates to candy consumption. (“Daily” is just a more frequently occurring form of “occasionally.”)

Showing how deeply engrained Easter candy is for Americans the NCA said 40% of Americans “are connected to a store or confectionery brand on social media.”

Seeing that we’re bringing data to bear on candy the NRF’s Easter sales outlook contained some findings that may harsh your sugar high. Yes inflation got to candy too.

According to the NRF’s 2022 analysis “If the price of an Easter-related item is higher than expected 42% of consumers said they will look for it at another retailer and 31% will find an alternative like another brand or color.”

Where we buy isn’t changing however with 50% of shoppers favoring discount stores 41% preferring department stores and 35% Easter shopping online this year same as in 2021.

But this story is mostly inspired by Peeps so in that spirit a few closing fun factoids.

Taken directly from a list compiled by The Food Network here’s a “did you know” moment:

Peeps have been the best-selling nonchocolate Easter candy more than 20 years.

Yellow is the biggest seller followed by pink then blue.

When introduced in 1953 each chick took 27 hours to make by hand using a pastry tube. Today it takes about six minutes.

Roughly 2 billion Peeps are produced annually enough to circle the Earth two and a half times. With Peeps.

Has NASA considered that as part of the asteroid defense plan?

A 10-mile-wide comet smashes into a double band of Peeps and instead of an extinction level event you’ve got biggest marshmallow roast in human history. Talk about togetherness.

And the Beckham family look to be back on home soil in England as Victoria 47 took to her Instagram account on Friday to share an Easter snap of her daughter Harper 10 with Coco the bunny.

The animal lover who played the role of bridesmaid at her big brother Brooklyn's wedding last Saturday looked adorable she was seen cuddling up to her pet.

It comes after Harper looked every inch the angelic bridesmaid on Saturday as she stepped up to her duties for brothers wedding to Nicola Peltz.

The ten-year-old appeared to be having a ball at the bride's $103million family estate in Palm Beach Florida as she wore a gorgeous plain white dress finalised with a navy belt and ballet-esque shoes.

She wore her lengthy locks coiffed in neat curls for her brother's big day and sported dainty earrings with a complementary bracelet.

Nicola 27 and aspiring chef Brooklyn 23 were married in an early evening ceremony in one of three massive tented structures constructed on the sprawling ocean front lawn of father Nelson's $103million compound in Palm Beach Florida.

Guests including tennis legend Serena Williams TV chef Gordon Ramsay and Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria could clearly be seen enjoying cocktails.

The 300 revellers then moved to the banqueting tent – where DailyMail.com can reveal Brooklyn and Nicola's first dance to a live singer belting out Only Fools Rush In made famous by Elvis Presley.

The couple took to the dance floor at 8.10pm and finished to loud cheers from the guests. And the second song was the Ben E. King classic Stand By Me we can also reveal.

On Friday Scott 38 snapped a photo of Mason laying in his lap.

He captioned the pic: ""Best day ever. My little guy hasn't fallen asleep on me like this since he was 8.""

The father-son duo appeared to be laying on a couch together.

Scott shared the post on his Instagram Story days after the premiere of The Kardashians.

Scott was snubbed by the Kardashian family – including ex Kourtney Kardashian – at a family barbecue.

During the gathering Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian realized he was absent in the midst of the event chatting about it privately inside the SKIMS mogul's house.

Khloe 37 later visited with Scott to catch up and talk about the event as well as Kourtney's new romance with fiancé Travis Barker.

The Good American co-founder noted that it was perhaps for the best that Scott wasn't there as her Poosh founder sister and her rocker boyfriend were packing on the PDA.

While some fans felt pity for Scott who spoke glowingly of Kourtney and Travis he faced backlash from others of a comment he made on the show.

AGE RAGE

Khloe popped by Kourtney's ex's home to chat wearing what appeared to be workout gear.

Scott admired Khloe as she walked into his kitchen wearing a skintight top and leggings.

""God must have broke the mold when he made you"" he quipped.

Khloe leaned on the counter and replied smiling: ""Just hoping.""

Scott joked: ""Get these cameras out of here and let's go upstairs then"" prompting Khloe to laugh.

In a confessional she described the Talentless mogul as her ""bestie"" adding that he's like a ""brother"" to her.

Viewers at home seemed to disagree however and slammed the way Scott talks to her.

""Does anyone else find Khloe and Scott's relationship so f**king weird? Like they flirt..?"" one wrote.

Another added: ""Scott is so flirty with Khloe"" and added a vomit face emoji.

Later in The Kardashians premiere Scott was ripped for saying he wants his next girlfriend to be in their late twenties.

""If I want to find somebody real and serious and somebody I want to actually spend my life with it would have to be somebody more age-appropriate. You know upper twenties"" he said.

In a confessional he went on: ""But not over 30. Or whatever. I don't care if I love somebody I don't care about their age.""

When asked if he was ""sure"" about that he confessed ""not sure about that"".

Scott has faced backlash over the years for dating women who are considerably younger than him following his split from Kourtney in 2015 after a 10-year relationship.

Scott began dating Sofia Richie in 2007 when she was 19 and he was 34. They split three years later.

He later started dating Amelia Hamlin when she was also 19 and he was 37.

They split in late 2021 after controversy over the 18-year age difference.

Victoria Beckham celebrated her 48th birthday in style on Sunday and took to Instagram to share an insight into her festivities.

The fashion designer told her followers how she had ""woken up"" to four giant bouquets of pink roses hydrangeas and tulips on a coffee table and appeared to be abroad for her big day.

Victoria said she was feeling ""very blessed"" as she shared a video of her daughter Harper 10 reading a handwritten card as well as sharing a snap from husband David which showed the couple kissing in a rare display of affection.

Contact the WSWS to tell us about the conditions you face and to discuss organizing a rank-and-file committee. Workers’ identities will be kept confidential.

Late Thursday night the United Food and Commercial Workers union claimed the ratification of a new three-year contract covering Southern California grocery workers at Ralphs Albertsons Vons and Pavillions. The agreement which the union claims passed by 87 percent was reached to avert strike action after workers voted to authorize a strike.

The contract covers 47000 employees at 540 grocery stores from San Diego to San Luis Obispo. It follows the April 9 approval of a separate contract between six of the seven UFCW locals and the Stater Bros grocery chain. Many workers have expressed anger that the entire process was carried out undemocratically. Despite being given an option to vote electronically on whether to authorize strike action workers were forced to show up in person over a short three-day period to cast their votes for a contract which they were never even sent copies of. Instead they were only able to view the deal in person during the voting itself.

Kroger the parent company of the grocery chains agreed to raises of 19 to 31 percent spread across three years over current pay levels for most workers while part-time workers were guaranteed 28 hours weekly an addition of four more hours per week.

Part-time employees make up the majority of the grocery store workforce around 70 percent. The casualization of this section of workers was made possible by the unions over the course of decades. The 28-hour minimum guaranteed for part-timers is a win for the company who will now use it to exploit the bottom tier of workers to the fullest extent.

Of the remaining 30 percent of workers who are full-time there are three tiers. At the end of the three-year contract the highest paid will make $26.75 up from from $22.50 (an increase of 19 percent). The second tier lower-paid deli workers and shelf stockers will go from $17.02 to $22.27 an increase of 30 percent. The lowest third tier baggers and clerk’s helpers will see a 6 percent rise from $15.39 to $16.34.

The grocery companies expressed their satisfaction with the deal. An official statement from Ralphs said the company was “pleased” with the agreement and Albertsons called it “fair and equitable.”

Burt Flickinger the managing director of Strategic Resources Group a retail consulting firm told the Los Angeles Times “This is the best contract for the employees in 20 years but also for the companies [emphasis added]… We have the most acute worker shortage since World War II. Higher wages and benefits are an investment in worker loyalty and productivity.”

Flickinger also noted that in 25 years union membership in Southern California grocery stores declined from 90 to 35 percent as non-union chains like Target and Walmart expanded into food. This in itself is a devastating indictment of the unions who have presided over decades of concessions that have closed the gap between union and nonunion wages. Workers increasingly see the UFCW as a pro-company outfit that takes dues from their paycheck and does little else.

In January at the start of negotiations the companies offered just a $1.80 raise an hour over three years for the highest-paid long-term employees including cashiers. While they ultimately agreed to $4.25 this was still short of the $5 increase that the union was fighting for. However even this amount would not have kept up with the rising cost of inflation.

Sara a San Diego Vons worker told the WSWS “I honestly think the Union tricked us; the contract obviously doesn’t benefit us so I didn’t even bother signing it because it’s just a dollar raise a year. The five dollars an hour promised should have been automatic. Gas is expensive food is expensive we need more pay and the store can afford it.” She also added that the price of gas is taking a heavy toll. “I have to care for my parents which means I need to drive an hour or more a day.”

Sara has worked at Vons since 2015 and said that she was consistently scheduled to work between 36–39 hours per week so that she remained below the 40-hour threshold for full time which would entitle her to full time benefits. “Then they put me in 7 days a week to make it harder to get a second job. I turned down a promotion because the responsibilities would outweigh the raise which was only 25–50 cents more an hour.”

She added “The stores give the union money out of our pockets. I think the union needs to be publicly audited!”

In 1990 according to a report by the Economic Roundtable the highest-paid food clerk for a Southern California Kroger store made $13.65 an hour or the equivalent of $28.32 today. This 22 percent decline in wages occurred as the company made more and more workers part time “so few of even the best-paid frontline employees make middle-class incomes.”

Grocery workers have also been on the front lines of the pandemic with little to no protections against the airborne virus. According to the UFCW Local 770 there have been at least 10248 confirmed COVID-positive cases among members of the LA-area local since the beginning of the pandemic. Both the number of those who have died or those suffering from persistent issues and Long COVID are not provided however it is likely that dozens of Local 770 members have died.

The fact that such a staggering number of workers have been allowed to be infected with likely thousands dying across the country while the UFCW worked to keep them on the job reveals the role of the UFCW as a corporatist arm of management. The UFCW has presided over the abysmal and deadly conditions while grocery workers have been on the front lines of the pandemic meanwhile sabotaging every struggle that would jeopardize its cozy relationship with the grocery giants.

The fight has really only just begun. If workers are to win in a struggle for better pay and working conditions they must draw the lessons of these experiences organize independently and in opposition to the trade union bureaucracies which are tied to the Democratic Party that has long overseen extreme social inequality in the state and beyond.

Another group of young undocumented immigrants from El Paso Texas landed at the Westchester County Airport on Thursday night the New York Post reports.

The children then boarded three buses waiting for them with one traveling to the Walt Whitman Service Area in Cherry Hill New Jersey where several teens disembarked and met up with adults who were waiting for them just after midnight.

Former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino a Republican gubernatorial candidate called the resumption of flights 'a big middle finger to hard-working New York taxpayers.

'It's frustrating. It's outrageous' he told the Post.

The Biden administration has resumed its secret charter flights of underage migrants from the U.S.-Mexico border to Westchester New York Pictured migrants disembarking from a flight in August

President Joe Biden's (pictured) administration said the flights were being used 'transport unaccompanied minors to vetted sponsors or relatives with whom they will await the outcome of their immigration proceedings'

Former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino posted a video of buses at the airport last week that he said was carrying migrants coming from the border

Astorino said the ongoing flights are 'a big middle finger to hard-working New York taxpayers'

Just last week Astorino filmed another set of young migrants leaving the airport last week as part of the after-dark flight program which was reportedly suspended following an investigation last year.

Analysis of online tracking data suggested that 21 flights since August 8 have brought around 2000 migrants caught after crossing the border from Mexico to the Westchester airport.

A White House official said that the flights were being used to 'transport unaccompanied minors to vetted sponsors or relatives with whom they will await the outcome of their immigration proceedings.'

The Department of Health and Human Services which helps match the young migrants to sponsors said in a statement: 'It is our legal responsibility to provide safe appropriate care to unaccompanied migrant children during the time they are in our custody and that includes transportation to vetted sponsors.'

The White House did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.

Astorino had previously released bodycam footage of Westchester Police responding to one of the secret charter flights last year.

In the August 13 2021 footage Westchester Police Sgt. Michael Hamborsky is seen questioning federal contractors who are overseeing migrants embarking and boarding American Dream charter buses in the early morning hours on the tarmac of a Westchester Airport.

The footage shows Hamborsky speak to multiple contractors who are employees of MVM Inc. a private security firm that signed a $136 million contract with the federal government last year to transport undocumented immigrants and unaccompanied children around the country.

'I'm just trying to figure out what's what who's who and how I'm supposed to keep this secure' Hamborsky tells the contractors who give him the lanyards from around their necks.

'We're not allowed to have our picture taken when we get on base' one of them tells him.

'Un-f**king-believable' Hamborsky says. 'And who's that by? DHS?'

'Yes and the United States Army' the contractor replies. 'You're on a federal installation but DHS wants everything on the down low.'

Astronino said another flight from El Paso landed on April 9 with two shuttle busses waiting to pick up the migrants and transport them across Westchester

Bodycam footage obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino shows migrants arriving at Westchester Airport on August 13 2021 as part of the secret charter flight program

The continuation of the flights from the Southern border to Westchester comes as the U.S. saw an average of nearly 6000 people a day crossing the border in February according to the most recent data from the US Customs and Border Protect.

On Friday 21 states signed onto a lawsuit against the Biden administration to stop it from lifting the Title 42 aTrump-era policy that allowed instant expulsion of asylum-seekers at the U.S. southern border.

State officals fear lifting the order would bring in a greater flux of migrants into the U.S. after President Joe Biden had announced last month that the policy would end on May 23.

Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody who joined the suit on Friday said in a statement: 'Ending Title 42 would be a disaster and further the chaos at the southwest border that is making it easier for drug cartels and human smugglers to advance their illicit practices in our country.'

In February 55 percent of the more than 164000 migrants encountered at the border were expelled under the order.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuY292ZXJjb2xvcmFkby5jb20vYmVzdC1ob3RlbHMtaW4tbG9uZS10cmVlLWNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Best Hotels in Lone Tree Colorado,"Lone Tree is a southern suburb of Denver just minutes from the Denver Tech Center and one of the premium shopping destinations in Colorado the Park Meadows Mall.

You don't think about it because you don't want to think about it.

When you get on a plane you might get lucky and sneak a peek into the cockpit.

You're more interested though in getting to your seat and hoping you're not next to some malodorous individual who'll be spreading out once airborne a spreadsheet on their laptop.

Perhaps though if you're flying Southwest Airlines you should try and look into your pilots' eyes and wonder how they're feeling.

This thought comes not from me. Not directly anyway. It comes from Southwest's own pilots. This week their union wrote to Southwest's new CEO Robert Jordan and offered some disturbing thoughts.

""Fatigue both acute and cumulative has become Southwest Airlines' number-one safety threat"" the union said.

Just that sentence might make one or two customers wonder. The union did however add more substance.

Also: Southwest Airlines had a great new idea for customers (then it ruined things)

""Over the last 12 months our Pilots have filed an ever-increasing number of ASAP [Aviation Safety Action Program] reports showing errors that can be directly correlated to fatigue"" said the letter.

Which doesn't sound entirely reassuring.

The union insists that the problems that existed last year during the pandemic are really no better this year. It suggests that for this year there have been 350% more fatigue reports than in March 2019.

The pilots take aim at Southwest's operational systems.

""Continued and deliberate deficiencies in the management of our network and pilot scheduling have destroyed our efficiency and now even safety is becoming untenable"" they say.

When it comes to efficiency the pilots recently gave this example: ""As SWA experiences disruptions more often deadheads [pilots being repositioned] from reassignments will continue to hinder operational recovery due to the lack of modernizing the tools needed to utilize Pilots online and at outstations efficiently.""

Recently CEO Jordan himself admitted that the airline's internal technological systems weren't of a stellar nature. Yet it's precisely at times of stress that you need those systems to be at their most efficient.

Yes Southwest has been hampered by bad weather. And for its part the airline insists it's made changes to its schedules last November which caused pilot fatigue reports to diminish.

But there's another in its way equally troubling aspect to all this one that has other potential long-term consequences.

As Bloomberg reported Southwest isn't finding more pilots because it can't find more pilot instructors. In an economy where many are being choosy about where and when they work hiring becomes a highly competitive and frustrating activity.

Some might say airlines deserve it as they fired so many people during the recession. Others might add that Southwest's pilots aren't alone in presenting such complaints.

American Airlines pilots have gone so far as to make ads showing how badly they say they're being treated.

Also: United Airlines just made a huge announcement that'll drive customers crazy

Coincidentally both groups of pilots are currently in negotiations over a new contract.

Airlines are lauding the prospect of an extremely busy summer of people desperately wanting to travel because they haven't done much over the last two years. But how can customers expect operations to be reliable?

It's the safety warning though that'll trouble customers the most.

Perhaps it's just a scare tactic. The creation of fear so often brings results.

Some customers might though be tempted to ask their pilots if they've had enough sleep the night before.

Just you know in case.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8xNi9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lLXBpbG90cy1mYXRpZ3VlLXNhZmV0eS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNC8xNi9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lLXBpbG90cy1mYXRpZ3VlLXNhZmV0eQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fatigue is starting to put safety at risk pilots say,"CNN —

Pilots at Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines say pilot exhaustion is on the rise and they’re pressing the airlines treat fatigue and the mistakes that result as a safety risk.

“Fatigue both acute and cumulative has become Southwest Airlines’ number-one safety threat” the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association or SWAPA told airline executives in a letter this week.

The causes the pilots say include cancellation chaos caused by severe weather and climbing demand for air travel testing the mettle of still-recovering airlines.

Passenger numbers are about 90% of 2019 levels this month according to Transportation Security Administration data but major US passenger airlines are about 3000 employees short from that time period according to Bureau of Transportation Statistics data. Thousands of pilots retired – either by choice or aging out at 65 – during the pandemic and research presented by the Regional Airline Association says 2000 pilots reach mandatory retirement age this year. Mandatory retirement numbers are expected to grow over the next 6 years.

Southwest executives identified staffing as one of their key priorities this year setting a goal of hiring 8000 new employees. Forty percent of those will be flight crews.

More hiring alone will not solve the fatigue issues SWAPA president Casey Murray says.

“A lot of our delays and issues that we’re having have to do more with scheduling and connecting pilots with airplanes” Murray told CNN in an interview. “It is inefficient scheduling processes that are affecting when we work in a very dynamic environment.”

The union wrote in the letter to executives that the number of pilots who reported being unable to work because of fatigue skyrocketed last fall including a 600% spike in October and hit “another staggering 330% increase” last month. “April is already setting fatigue records” SWAPA wrote.

Federal rules set baseline limits on hours pilots may work and require rest periods. The limits for major US airlines include 30 hours of flying time each week and at a minimum 9 hours of rest between shifts.

But pilots report the stresses of the job and changes because of storms can leave them worn out before hitting those benchmarks.

Southwest Airlines acknowledged a climb in fatigue reports filed last month – 35 reports for every 10000 duty periods compared to 10 reports for the same metric in March 2019. Spokeswoman Brandy King said the numbers show an effective system.

“The increase is expected as it’s common to experience an elevated level of fatigue calls during irregular operations and in March the industry faced weather and airspace delays that resulted in disruptions across the network” King wrote in a statement to CNN. “The March increase in Pilot fatigue calls is a result of the system working as designed allowing Crew to determine if they are too fatigued to fly.”

Delta Air Lines pilots are holding a series of demonstrations at airports this month drawing attention to their fatigue concerns.

“Our pilots are tired and fatigued” Evan Baach a captain at Delta and official with Air Line Pilots Association or ALPA told CNN affiliate KSL at a Salt Lake City airport protest. He said pilots are working “longer days with shorter nights at home.”

Jason Ambrosi chairman of the Delta group at ALPA said that pilots are responsible as “the last line of defense” in aviation safety but “too often we are being pushed to our limits as Delta tries to add back flying and capture revenue.”

ALPA wrote in a message to Delta members last month that the pandemic presented “several opportunities for Delta to re-set its broken pilot staffing issue.” As air travel rebounds now the union wrote unresolved problems are becoming more apparent: The number of pilots available to step in and cover for an issue caused by weather maintenance or a sick colleague is significantly smaller.

“Delta Flight Operations continues to run the operation at red line” the union note reads. “So if it feels like you are working more and seeing less control over your schedule – you are right; you are.”

Delta told CNN that its scheduling follows federal rules for pilot work and rest hours.

“We continuously evaluate our staffing models and plan ahead so that we can recover quickly when unforeseen circumstances arise and the resilience of the Delta people is unmatched in that regard” spokesman Morgan Durrant said. “All of our people including our pilots are working hard to restore our airline and deliver for our customers as we emerge from the pandemic. We are grateful for and proud of their efforts.”

Last year pilots from all carriers filed about 60 reports of mistakes or other incidents involving fatigue to the federal Aviation Safety Reporting System. The reports are posted to a federal website anonymously without identifying names or airlines.

Some pilots wrote they were tired after handling training responsibilities. Others said airline managers asked them to handle too many extra flights because of short staffing.

“Both of us were yawning and eye rubbing halfway through our 6+ hour flight… I was physically unable to keep up” one captain wrote in November despite having “appropriate average sleep the night before.”

“But ‘we’ press on - don’t we?” the pilot continued. “Our threats are threefold of the pre-Covid environment. We’ve been facing delays shortages planning and staffing issues that are NOT being taken into account in building schedules. Why? Because we pilots are counted upon to make it work.”

The union executive said in the letter that pilots are filing steadily increasing numbers of Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) reports blaming fatigue for errors they make and the union says it’s the “direct result of operational mismanagement by the company.” It says changing pilot schedules is now the norm rather than the exception and issues with hotel bookings and tight scheduling are compounding the problems.

The airline denies it’s as big a mess as the pilots claim and the increase in fatigue complaints are a natural result of a challenging couple of months weatherwise. “The increase is expected as it’s common to experience an elevated level of fatigue calls during irregular operations and in March the industry faced weather and airspace delays that resulted in disruptions across the network” Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King wrote in a statement to CNN. “The March increase in Pilot fatigue calls is a result of the system working as designed allowing Crew to determine if they are too fatigued to fly.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL3VzLW5ld3Mvc291dGh3ZXN0L3BpbG90cy1ncm91cC1sZWFkZXItYWlybGluZS1zdHJ1Z2dsaW5nLXRvLWNvbm5lY3QtcGlsb3RzLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL3VzLW5ld3Mvc291dGh3ZXN0L3BpbG90cy1ncm91cC1sZWFkZXItYWlybGluZS1zdHJ1Z2dsaW5nLXRvLWNvbm5lY3QtcGlsb3RzLWFpcmNyYWZ0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pilots group leader: Airline struggling to connect pilots aircraft,"CHICAGO (NewsNation) — As airlines across the country experience quality breakdowns Casey Murray president of the Southwest Airlines Pilot Association (SWAPA) maintains the roots of the issue can be traced back to the cockpit.

“Well we’ve actually seen a disturbing trend that started last summer. What’s happening is Southwest is having issues connecting pilots to aircraft” Murray said on NewsNation’s “Rush Hour.”

And it’s not just Southwest. American JetBlue and Spirit have also been facing hardships canceling thousands of flights after technology and weather problems leaving travelers stranded and looking for help nationwide.

Just this past week in Florida passengers struggled to reach their destinations because of staffing issues and weather. The same was the case in Boston. And Friday in Las Vegas workers at Spirit were picketing over mass flight cancelations. Similar protests took place in Orlando and Dallas this month.

According the Murray it’s a problem that stems from IT issues and the scheduling process that gets pilots where they need to be.

“Once we start seeing delays once we start seeing weather issues it’s taken Southwest five six seven days to recover and our customers are the ones paying the price” he said.

This week in fact Murray wrote an open letter to Southwest executives stating that cases of fatigue among SWAPA’s members are at a 200% increase from last year with more dramatic rises in recent months and that there is a real safety concern that needs to be addressed.

NewsNation reached out to Southwest about Murray’s letter. The airline said the large increase in pilot fatigue calls is a result of the system actually working as designed.

But Murray said it’s not that simple.

“Well the system is working and our pilots assure that it’s working and that they’re flying in the safest possible manner that they can. But the fact that it is working so well is indicative of a deeper problem: the numbers of pilots and and how they’re being used” he said.

Murray added that the derogation of Southwest’s pilot use is something he had identified as far back as four years ago something he had tried to get the airline to address.

“The reason for the open letter — which is something that we take very very seriously — was we haven’t seen any (change) and we think our guests deserve better” Murray said.

Murray said the aim for SWAPA is to make sure the trends do not continue and to thus avoid seeing worse issues over the summer.

As far as a solution Murray said his organization is in talks with leaders at Southwest and he hopes to see fewer cancelations.

“All we want is for the airline to run safely and as efficiently as possible and make sure that we don’t continue to see our guests not get to where they want to be” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC1sb25nZXN0LXJvdXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Boeing 737 MAX Routes Are The Longest?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC1sb25nZXN0LXJvdXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Laila Dalton

A Phoenix Starbucks store is facing a federal complaint for retaliation against unionizing employees.

Laila Dalton and Alyssa Sanchez both say they were retaliated against for supporting the union.

The results of the store's union vote should be known by the end of the month.

Employees at a Starbucks in Arizona who began unionizing earlier this year allege the coffee giant has engaged in a pattern of retaliation for organizing – leaving workers with cut hours threats and harassment and the loss of their jobs.

While waiting for a hearing regarding a complaint they filed with the National Labor Relations Board about the poor treatment employees who remain at the store say working conditions inside are getting worse.

""Things have really started to shift and change and now I'm at the point where like this job is causing my mental health to be at such a low point. I think the lowest it's ever been in my entire life"" Tyler Gillette a Starbucks employee of two and a half years told Insider.

Gillette is an experienced training barista who worked at several locations before helping to open the Scottsdale & Mayo location in Phoenix Arizona last year.

Gillette as well as three other current and former employees of the location said a change in management at the end of 2021 signaled a shift in working conditions. The once warm and friendly environment turned cold and rigid. Suddenly scheduling accommodations were denied requests for days off were left pending and management began ""cracking down"" on every little rule.

Several employees inspired by unionization at Starbucks locations in Buffalo began to discuss organizing their store earlier this year.

Laila Dalton a 19-year-old former barista at the Phoenix store is a vocal advocate of unionizing at her location but says retaliation began almost immediately after beginning to publicly organize – and eventually led to her being fired.

""After I handed out the ballot cards on my next shift I was punished basically for wanting to start a union and create a better work environment so we can all have a voice"" Dalton told Insider.

The harassment increased — one coworker said Dalton had ""a target on her back"" — with Dalton a supervisor on the floor with no extensive history of disciplinary action being written up for infractions like wearing headphones after closing ""improper call outs"" for absences while in the hospital and after her aunt died and recording the meetings where she said she was harassed to tears.

Signs held by Starbucks union supporters as they protest for Laila Dalton's reinstatement April 6. Laila Dalton

Federal union-busting complaints

Dalton as well as Gillette and their coworkers Alyssa Sanchez and Bill Whitmire filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board on January 26 alleging Starbucks had violated federal law by retaliating against union supporters.

In its March 29 response to the complaint Starbucks denied all allegations of retaliation made by employees of the Arizona store.

Starbucks Workers United a growing union effort that began with Buffalo New York Starbucks employees has filed more than 20 complaints alleging similar retaliation directed toward union supporters.







As union efforts have gained steam at Starbucks locations nationwide — with multiple stores voting unanimously to unionize — the coffee company has faced increasing reports and formal complaints regarding union-busting tactics and retaliation. In Memphis Tennessee seven would-be union workers were fired for what Starbucks called ""safety"" reasons after they invited press to a closed store to discuss their efforts.

In Buffalo at least two stores that attempted to unionize were closed entirely which Starbucks said was a coincidence.

At the store in Phoenix two union organizers are facing cut hours one had her hours cut down until she had to find a new job and Dalton was fired in what she calls ""100% retaliation"" for organizing. Dalton's firing was not included in the original complaint of retaliation.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Insider: ""Any partner's interest in a union does not exempt them from the standards we've always held. We will continue enforcing our policies consistently for all partners. And any claims of anti-union activity are categorically false.""

""We are 100% committed to following the NLRB process"" the spokesperson added.

Starbucks prepares for union fight

For its part Starbucks appears to be preparing for increased union activity. The coffee chain recently hired a new strategy chief as unionization efforts ramp up across the US and on Wednesday began advertising for an in-house lawyer with experience in 'strike contingency planning.'

In an April 4 Town Hall meeting his first since returning to Starbucks as CEO and the same day Dalton was fired Howard Schultz said the company was being ""assaulted in many ways by the threat of unionization.""

While Dalton remains active in trying to organize the Phoenix store and hopes to be reinstated following the results of the NLRB hearing on June 14 she says workers who remain at the store have been telling her how much worse work has been since the union effort has gained more attention.

""Everyone is texting me keeping me in the loop. And I mean it sounds like they're really trying to intimidate them"" Dalton told Insider. ""They're starting to take people one by one starting to ask them if they have any questions about why I got fired or any questions about how to vote on how to vote on the ballot.""

A reinstatement rally

Sanchez left Starbucks after her managers declined to accommodate her schedule which she said was directly related to organizing. While she didn't want to leave her position and was never officially fired she said her hours were cut until she couldn't afford to continue working with the company and found a new job.

Whitmire a supervisor and union committee member remains at the Phoenix location but says the store environment has become hostile and his hours are being cut down from full-time to part-time.

Gillette told Insider the company appears to be doing something similar to them. Both employees previously had consistent schedules of over 30 hours to make ends meet. Since publicly supporting the union both have had their hours cut nearly in half.

""I'm at the point where I have to for my own well being I have to really consider quitting which is exactly what they want — and they've done this to so many other people; pushed them to the point where it's like for their livelihood and for their sanity they have to quit. We have to quit"" Gillette said.

Starbucks union supporters protest for Laila Dalton's reinstatement on April 6. Laila Dalton

In addition to the cut hours Gillette — who is transgender and autistic — said they are now also facing increased harassment about their gender and disability since publicly supporting the union. Coworkers and managers now consistently misgender them and they said they were forced to take a two-week leave of absence until they could get medical documentation that said they were cleared to work after requesting accommodations to make their shifts more comfortable.

""It's causing my mental health to really suffer. It's messing with my livelihood. I wasn't able to pay rent this month. So now if I don't figure something out by the end of this month I'm gonna be homeless because Starbucks is royally screwing me over"" Gillette said.

At the Arizona location despite the impacts of the managerial crackdown on former and current staff union support has been increasing. Employees and regular customers of the store held a reinstatement rally on behalf of Dalton on April 6 and the remaining workers are holding an official union vote this week. Ballots are due April 19 and the store should know if its union efforts were successful within two weeks after that.

""They could try this on me. I'm not scared. I still have a smile on my face. I still know that I will be back and I am confident about this election because it doesn't really matter what management does"" Dalton said. ""We have such a great team and we love each other so much.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rob3VzZWtlZXBpbmcuY29tL2hvbGlkYXlzL2Vhc3Rlci1pZGVhcy9hMzYwMDgxMDEvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLW9wZW4tZWFzdGVyLWhvdXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Starbucks Open on Easter 2022? - Starbucks Easter Hours,"We've been independently researching and testing products for over 120 years.

Restaurants like Brady's Cafe and The Robin Hood bar and grill have operated out of the building since it was constructed in the 1920s making it a landmark in the Kent community. Many people were concerned about what would become of the structure after the Starbucks that previously inhabited it closed in 2021 because of low sales during the pandemic. Kent State University bought the property in 2016 and there had been speculation the building would be demolished.

Kent Starbucks closes:Kent Starbucks at East Main and Lincoln streets is closing its doors this weekend

In May Cleveland Bagel Café will become the newest business to call the nearly 100-year-old building home.

Local businessman Mike Beder announced on social media Wednesday that he along with Evan Bailey Charlotte Varney and Nicole Jabbour Awad will be partnering with Cleveland Bagel Co. to bring bagel sandwiches for morning noon and night to the area.

The reaction online to Beder’s posts was overwhelmingly positive with students alumni and Kent residents pleased about the incoming shop.

“Thank you sweet baby Jesus! (And Mike and team!!) I’m in Franklin Hall and about to be your best customer!!” one user commented on Facebook.

“Glad to see something go into the building that so many alumni and students have spent countless hours in! 🙌🏽 Congrats ☕️” commented another.

Beder operates several other businesses in the city including Water Street Tavern Venice Café and Kent Sportswear. Beder also owned Tree City Café which carried Cleveland Bagel Co.’s bagels until he sold the business in 2021.

When the university initially reached out to him about the opportunity Beder was hesitant because he didn’t want to open another run-of-the-mill coffee shop. His perspective turned around when he realized how Cleveland Bagel Co. could fit into the business.

Along with the five sandwiches Cleveland Bagel Co. normally offers customers the Kent shop will have four additional sandwiches (including a pizza bagel) house baked bagel chips fresh juices and a full espresso bar.

The restaurant will be open daily from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. to best serve college students within the university’s nearby journalism fashion and architecture schools.

What will truly separate Cleveland Bagel Café from its competitors is the atmosphere the building provides Beder said. The interior has been spruced up but he has no plans to make any structural changes.

“It’s a very unique and cool structure that college students and the Kent community have been visiting for 100 years” he said. “The opportunity to do something fresh in that space while also keeping the historical atmosphere of it was big to us. I think the space is something that sets us apart just as much as the (menu) offerings.”

Cleveland Bagel Café will be located 436 E. Main St. in Kent on the corner of Lincoln Street. While the opening date has not been nailed down yet updates will be announced on the restaurant’s social media and website.

Some people may have fond furry memories of getting visits from the Easter Bunny. Others may have unwittingly joined a collection of children who shrieked cried or ran with terror at the sight of Peter Cottontail. Is it possible that belonging to one of those groups helped shape the responses to a bunny sighting at a coffee giant?

At one Starbucks the manager decided to celebrate Easter in an idiosyncratic way. ""My store manager bought an Easter bunny costume and I wanted to share these gems from this morning"" the OP u/EfficientPiece2773 explained before sharing four photos on Reddit. In the pictures the Easter bunny simply stands or sits staring with unblinking cartoon eyes and a wide frozen smile. The one exception shows the manager cuddling a puppy although the eyes remain open. The unsettling imagery reached a new level the next day when the same account shared a polaroid in which light effects distorted the costume further and a pinprick black hole lurked in the background.

The responses reflected two polarizing emotions: terror and delight. ""This is so [futuens] cursed I love it"" one commenter wrote. ""What store do you work at? Can I transfer"" another asked. On the other end of the spectrum a creeped-out Redditor informed the OP ""I am never coming to your Starbucks ever respectfully."" A supervisor backed up this opinion saying ""I would stay at least 3000 feet from this Starbucks."""

Canon Peter LeValley Spencer Obituary,"The Rev. Canon Peter LeValley Spencer who for 31 years served as rector of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Wickford leading that historic parish through a period of tremendous growth died on Thursday April 7 after a long illness. He was 83 and lived in Green Hill.

Father Spencer was the second-longest-serving rector in St. Paul’s 316-year history. For three decades he led the parish as “shepherd fisherman sometime tax collector but usually nursery man” as he remarked to the vestry and parish in 2001. He described his ministry as “tending the tree of St. Paul’s” which “became strong and broad and beautiful” and “unique among all Episcopal Churches south of Boston and east of Hartford.”

Father Spencer originally joined St. Paul’s as curate in 1967 at the invitation of then rector Rev. Canon Frederick Belden. In 1971 he was called to be rector after Canon Belden was elevated to Bishop of Rhode Island. Previously Father Spencer had served as curate at St. Paul’s in Pawtucket after completing his studies at General Theological Seminary in New York City.

The second oldest Episcopal parish in the state St. Paul’s began a resurgence under Canon Belden and this growth continued under Father Spencer who cultivated his organizational skills as an officer in the United States Navy. Membership in the parish doubled by 2001.

Above all Father Spencer strove to build a “community that is not dependent on clergy.” This allowed him more time to focus on the quality of pastoral care and to support a range of local vibrant ministries dedicated to helping people in need in the community. “Always the deeds are done quietly and without fanfare” The Standard Times reported in 2001. His emphasis on outreach and accompaniment left an indelible impression on the parish and remains a hallmark of St. Paul’s to this day.

Father Spencer said he always tried to adhere to the original vision of St. Paul’s: to serve as a source of renewal for people who then go out into the community. That vision extended across denominational lines to local Roman Catholic Baptist and other churches in pursuit of an outward-focused culture committed to meeting the needs of others.

Asked once how he wanted to be remembered Father Spencer said ""I think helping people realize what they have to do to be an authentic Christian—to be compassionate and honest.""

Peter LeValley Spencer was born in 1938 and grew up in West Warwick not far from the LeValley family homestead (circa 1722) on Phenix Hill. He was proud of his deep Rhode Island roots via both the Spencer and LeValley lineages. He attended Classical High School in Providence (class of 1956) and went on to Brown University (class of 1960) to study chemistry and religious studies. While at Brown he joined the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps and served two years in active duty before entering General Theological Seminary where he earned a Master of Divinity in 1965.

In retirement Father Spencer served on the Board of Trustees of Saint Elizabeth Community and assisted at various parishes in the Diocese. Among other pastimes he tended many a garden growing tomatoes for his wife and grapes for his wine. He loved nature from the shores of Green Hill Beach to Trustom Pond to the White Mountains in New Hampshire all of which he summited at least twice. He enjoyed taking trips to New York City and further afield to Italy. Never was he without a loyal black dog by his side.

Father Spencer was married to Eugenia (Bruno) Spencer for 61 years. In addition to his wife he leaves his loving children: Peter L. Spencer Jr. and his wife C. Ashley of Alexandria VA; David L. Spencer of Exeter; Mary L. Spencer of Ashaway; and Sarah E. O’Neill and her husband Samuel of Cambridge MA. He was the cherished grandfather of Piers L. Spencer of Arlington VA Jackson D. Spencer of San Antonio TX Hugh D. O’Neill of Cambridge and Owen S. O’Neill of Cambridge. He was the brother of Susan B. Roebuck of Snug Harbor.

Father Spencer’s Requiem Eucharist will be held Saturday April 30 2022 at 2:00 P.M. in St. Paul’s Episcopal Church 55 Main Street Wickford. Burial in the Old Narragansett Church Cemetery will be private. Calling hours are respectfully omitted.

Kindly omit flowers. Gifts in his memory to Saint Elizabeth Community in Warwick will be appreciated.

Arrangements have been entrusted to THE CRANSTON-MURPHY FUNERAL HOME of WICKFORD.

CLOUD — The public university in this central Minnesota city was once the second-largest in the state with 16000 undergraduate students crowding its lecture halls filling its dormitories and cheering on the nationally ranked Huskies hockey team.

Higher Ed Fewer Learners An occasional series about how declining enrollment is reshaping higher education.

Today St. Cloud State University's campus on the banks of the Mississippi River serves as a harbinger of the powerful forces battering the nation's colleges and universities. Enrollment has plunged by almost half tenured faculty have been laid off the football team has been cut and a towering residence hall has been shuttered.

Colleges across the country have been losing students since 2010 as tuition increased demographics shifted and Americans grew more skeptical about the value of a degree. In Minnesota total undergraduate enrollment has plunged by almost a third to levels last seen in the late 1990s according to the state Office of Higher Education outpacing the more gradual drop in U.S. undergraduates.

""This is a code-red moment for not only just St. Cloud State but other regional institutions"" said Robbyn Wacker St. Cloud State's president. ""To survive in the current landscape of higher education you have to create a new model.""

The sprawling Minnesota State system which consists of 30 community colleges and seven universities including St. Cloud State has borne the brunt of the state's enrollment decline. Its undergraduate population fell from nearly 200000 in 2010 to just under 150000 in fall 2021.

Flagship campuses like the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and selective private colleges such as Macalester and Carleton have maintained steady enrollment mirroring a national trend in which wealthier institutions are thriving while cash-strapped schools fight to survive.

Student bodies began shrinking before the pandemic but its disruptions to classroom learning and campus life are accelerating the enrollment spiral which threatens to worsen labor shortages and change the career trajectory of a generation of Minnesotans.

""Businesses today are saying they can't get people with the kind of skills that they need and that can only get worse if more students continue to opt out of higher education or be forced out because they can't afford it anymore"" said Doug Shapiro executive director of the National Student Clearinghouse research center.

Students question value

Jude Breen is in no rush to enroll in college. The senior at Como Park High School in St. Paul is planning to take a gap year after graduating this May and work in construction or continue his current job at the Merit Chevrolet dealership in Maplewood.

Breen said he is considering studying to become an electrician or auto mechanic at a local technical college the following year but he is not sure.

""A four-year university isn't what really interests me"" Breen said. ""I don't think it's affordable to the regular American household.""

The share of Minnesota high school graduates who enroll in college has been decreasing state data show from 70% in 2014 to 66% in 2019. That drop accelerated amid the pandemic with just 62% of Minnesota's 2020 high school graduates enrolling in college.

A Gallup poll last year found nearly half of U.S. parents would prefer their children pursue noncollege paths such as apprenticeships trade school joining the military or starting a business instead of enrolling in a four-year university. That followed a 2019 poll finding that only 51% of Americans thought a college education was ""very important"" down from 70% in 2013.

With enrollment falling by almost half St. Cloud State is a harbinger of the forces hitting schools across the nation.

About half of Minneapolis Public Schools' 2020 graduates enrolled in college down from nearly two-thirds of 2017 graduates. The percentage of Minneapolis graduates of color who go to college has decreased at an even higher rate.

""The achievement gap is growing. A large number of students of color are not pursuing postsecondary options"" said Clinton Ferguson a licensed school counselor at Southwest High School in Minneapolis.

Ferguson attributes the drop to a variety of factors. Some students weary of online learning do not want to continue it in college. Others are working to support themselves and their families. And many are worried about the ongoing pandemic and the cost of college.

Since 2010 annual tuition has risen from $12300 to $15400 at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities from an average of $6900 to $8900 at Minnesota State's seven universities and from $4900 to about $5700 at the system's community colleges.

The average student loan debt for Minnesotans earning bachelor's degrees was $24793 in 2020 about 10% less than what graduates owed in 2012 according to the state Office of Higher Education. State and national grant awards increased during that span and colleges expanded scholarships.

Many college students still say they are under financial pressure. The community college student association LeadMN recently surveyed about 7700 students at Minnesota State's two-year colleges and found 90% had struggled to pay for school and living expenses. About two in five students said they had considered dropping out.

""I'm dancing on a very sharp edge right now"" said Marcelus Ifonlaja 24 a junior concurrently enrolled at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul and Minneapolis Community and Technical College.

""I'm dancing on a very sharp edge right now ... I had no idea it was going to be this difficult. I think that tuition should be lower.""

Ifonlaja spent time in the foster care system growing up and was homeless at one point. Without his scholarships and two part-time jobs with which he barely gets by he said college would be out of reach.

""I had no idea it was going to be this difficult"" said Ifonlaja who's studying finance. ""I think that tuition should be lower.""

Sweeping consequences

The consequences of fewer people going to college could be far-reaching.

Those with just a high school diploma earn significantly less on average than people with bachelor's degrees and so spend less and pay less in taxes. They are more likely to be unemployed and need government assistance and have lower life expectancy. They are less likely to vote and more likely to divorce.

About 11% of Minnesota adults with only a high school diploma were in poverty in 2019 according to state data. That's compared to just 3% in poverty among Minnesotans with a bachelor's degree.

Usrah Abawari a senior at Highland Park High School in St. Paul is planning to attend college in Texas this fall though she does not yet know what she will study. She believes a college degree provides the clearest path to success.

""Financial stability is one of the biggest factors … in going to college"" Abawari said.

A growing share of high school seniors are taking different paths however such as going straight into the workforce now that wages are on the rise and job openings are plentiful.

Eight of the state's top 10 in-demand occupations require only a high school diploma meaning those professions most of which pay less than $50000 annually stand to benefit from more young people choosing work over college.

But Minnesota Higher Education Commissioner Dennis Olson cautioned ""We need to remember that the jobs that are available today are certainly going to maybe provide some short-term good opportunities for folks but … they may lose later on down the line the potential for long-term opportunities.""

Minnesota is projected to need many more elementary school teachers accountants auditors managers marketers and engineers over the next 10 years all of which require bachelor's degrees.

""The four-year degree and higher-level degrees continue to remain important for Minnesota because we have such a strong headquarters economy"" said Amy Walstien education policy and workforce development director for the Minnesota Business Partnership. She predicts the state could face labor shortages in professions that require college degrees if enrollment does not rebound.

This year's high school seniors do not appear to be any more interested in college than 2021's graduates. The percentage of Minnesota seniors who have filled out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA a key predictor of college enrollment is up 1% compared to last year national data show.

Making matters worse the number of U.S. high school graduates is expected to begin decreasing after 2025 due to a birth rate decline that started in 2008. Many colleges in Minnesota and elsewhere are in worse shape than expected ahead of the demographic dip.

""If [colleges] continue with status-quo policies we may be facing some really uncomfortable choices"" said Carleton College economics Prof. Nathan Grawe who wrote a book on how the demographic changes could affect higher education.

Grawe pointed to the Connecticut state college system which is in the process of merging 12 of its community colleges and the Pennsylvania system which announced last year it would consolidate six of its universities as cautionary tales.

Colleges forced to adapt

The Minnesota State system is combining five of its colleges — Hibbing Community College Itasca Community College Rainy River Community College Mesabi Range College and Vermilion Community College — into one institution after their enrollment fell 35% over the past decade. Each of their physical campuses in northeastern Minnesota will remain but they will share accreditation student services marketing and other offices benefiting the new college's bottom line.

Other Minnesota State colleges have begun sharing resources without formally merging. Inver Hills Community College and Dakota County Technical College share a president a financial aid office and more than 60 positions said Michael Berndt president of the two schools.

""We are able to manage our costs a lot through that strategy"" Berndt said.

Bill Maki Minnesota State's vice chancellor for finance and facilities said the system will continue to consider merging resources ""where it makes sense to do that.""

There is some concern among faculty that such mergers could result in personnel reductions. Others believe these moves could bring positive change reducing competition and increasing collaboration between Minnesota State's 37 autonomous schools.

Students ate lunch in a cafeteria at St. Cloud State. School leaders say increasing retention and recruiting nontraditional students will be critical.

System leaders say they do not expect enrollment to return to the level it was a decade ago. But an influx of federal COVID-19 stimulus funding has bought time to search for solutions.

Minnesota State Chancellor Devinder Malhotra cited two strategies the system is taking to stabilize or increase enrollment in the coming years: expanding student support services to increase retention and recruiting more nontraditional students such as working adults.

""There are communities where there is pent-up demand for higher education. And we are uniquely positioned to bring those students in"" Malhotra said noting the system's colleges and universities are less selective and more affordable than others.

St. Cloud State is adding several new online master's degree programs in hopes of capitalizing on steady demand for graduate school. The university's leaders are also considering making hybrid learning a permanent offering for most classes — giving students the choice to attend in person or online on any given day — and adding more program start dates so students are not limited to enrolling only at the start of the fall or spring semesters.

""We absolutely need to be creative about how we make it possible for students to work and grab some credits work and grab some credits"" said Wacker St. Cloud State's president. ""Not making it a bifurcated choice of either you work or you go to school. That just doesn't make sense anymore in the new reality of our marketplace.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Jvc3Rvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tYXJhdGhvbi1tb25kYXktaXMtYmFjay13aGF0LXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdGhlLTEyNnRoLWJvc3Rvbi1tYXJhdGhvbi8yNjk1NjExL9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Jvc3Rvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tYXJhdGhvbi1tb25kYXktaXMtYmFjay13aGF0LXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdGhlLTEyNnRoLWJvc3Rvbi1tYXJhdGhvbi8yNjk1NjExLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marathon Monday Is Back: What to Know About the 126th Boston Marathon,"Monday morning thousands of people will line up at the finish line to cheer on some of the best of the best runners at the 126th Boston Marathon.

The race starts in less than 24 hours.

People have been flying in from all over the world and are planning on running for different charities.

Last year the marathon was held in October. This is the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began that the marathon will be held on Patriots Day.

This year is also special because the Boston Marathon is celebrating 50 years of the first official women’s division.

There will be 30000 official participants including runners from 122 countries and all 50 U.S. states. The event is expected to inject more than $200 million into the Greater Boston economy.

Quan Pho will be one of more than 28000 people running on Marathon Monday and says he counts every step in life as a blessing after coming face to face with death in 2016.

More than 9800 volunteers will assist athletes on their journey from Hopkinton to Boston. Participants competing and raising funds for various charities and nonprofit programs are anticipated to raise in excess of $30 million.

A lot of people have been doing shake-out runs this weekend loosening up for the big day.

“We both have teenage girls at home so 100% I’m thinking about that along the way. How can I use what I love to fuel other young athletes particularly women and girls to do the same” one excited marathon runner said.

Public safety precautions

Local state and federal agencies are all involved in the planning and coordination of public safety during the marathon. Here are some key points to know:

Officials stressed there are no credible threats to the marathon at this time but safety and security are at the forefront of planning.

There will be enhanced security checkpoints on Monday from Kenmore Square to the finish line. At these locations the public will be asked to submit to bag checks. If crowds get too heavy at a particular location checkpoints may temporarily close while police wait for those crowds to thin.

There will be an enhanced police presence throughout the weekend. On Monday specifically there will be a full department callup meaning all available personnel will be working. All neighborhoods will still have their usual coverage.

There will be uniformed officers as well as plainclothes officers and detectives among the crowds.

The Boston Athletic Association held a press conference at 10 a.m. Thursday alongside FBI and Homeland Security officials where authorities said there are no known threats against the marathon but emphasized the importance of speaking up to report anything suspicious -- in person or on social media.

There will be extra patrols throughout the MBTA officials said noting that after last week's shooting in a New York City subway station Boston officials are in close contact with their partners in New York.

“There is no evidence credible or otherwise to suggest that the MBTA system is a target"" Chief Kenneth Green of the MBTA Transit Police Department said.

Authorities are asking the public to keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary and report anything suspicious to police immediately.

“We’ve asked people every year for a long time we’re asking you to be vigilant"" Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief Gregory Long said.

Public drinking and publicly smoking marijuana are prohibited.

Boston EMS also has a comprehensive plan to ensure the health and safety of everyone during the weekend's events and on Monday.

Mayor Michelle Wu also noted that COVID-19 cases have been rising in Boston and suggested taking measures like getting tested before and after attending any events. Wearing masks indoors remains optional but is suggested as one of the best ways to help limit the spread of the virus.

Russian athletes banned

Race organizers announced earlier this month that Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be allowed to compete in this year's Boston Marathon as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Runners who had previously been accepted to represent the countries in the 2022 Boston Marathon and currently live in either country will no longer qualify the Boston Athletic Association said.

Citizens of Russia and Belarus who do not reside in either country will be allowed to compete but cannot run under either country's flag.

Days later the US Department of Energy the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency the NSA and the FBI jointly released an advisory about a new industrial control-system hacking tool set of unspecified provenance dubbed Pipedream that seemingly hasn't been deployed against targets but that the operators of industrial systems need to proactively block.

Russia's war on Ukraine has resulted in massive data leaks in which spies hacktivists criminals and regular people looking to support Ukraine have grabbed and publicly released huge quantities of information about the Russian military government and other Russian institutions.

Blockchain analysis researchers from Elliptic and Chainalysis said on Thursday that they had traced the massive quantity of cryptocurrency stolen last month from the Ronin network bridge to the North Korean Lazarus hacking group. The US Treasury also announced expanded sanctions against North Korea Lazarus and the group's affiliates. The attackers stole large quantities of the Ethereum currency ether and some USDC stablecoin totaling $540 million at the time. (The value of the stolen funds has since risen to over $600 million.) Lazarus hackers have been on a cybercriminal rampage for years breaching companies orchestrating scams and generally gathering profits to bankroll the Hermit Kingdom.

NSO Group the Israeli developer of the powerful and widely used spyware Pegasus was declared “valueless” in filings in British court this week. The assessment described as “abundantly clear” came from the third-party consultancy Berkeley Research Group that has been managing the fund that owns NSO. As a stunning number of autocrats and authoritarian governments have purchased NSO tools to target activists dissidents journalists and other at-risk people the spyware maker has been denounced and sued (repeatedly) by tech giants in an attempt to limit its reach. Targeted surveillance is big business and a nexus where espionage and human rights issues converge. Reuters reported this week for example that senior EU officials were targeted last year with unspecified Israeli-made spyware.

T-Mobile confirmed it had been breached last year (for what felt like the millionth time) after hackers put the personal data of 30 million customers up for sale for 6 bitcoins or about $270000 at the time. Recently unsealed court documents show though that the telecom hired a third-party firm as part of its response and the firm paid the attackers about $200000 for exclusive access to the trove in the hopes of containing the crisis. Paying hackers through third parties is a known but controversial tactic for dealing with ransomware attacks and digital extortion. One of the reasons it is frowned upon is that it often doesn't succeed as was the case with the T-Mobile data which attackers continued to sell.

In a report this week researchers from Cisco Talos said that a new type of information-stealing malware called “ZingoStealer” is spreading rapidly on the app Telegram. The cybercriminal group known as Haskers Ganghe is distributing the malware for free to other criminals or anyone who wants it researchers said. The group which may be based in Eastern Europe frequently shares updates and tools on Telegram and Discord with the cybercriminal “community.”

The Apple iPhone 12 series is still great and it’s a viable more affordable alternative to the iPhone 13 series. iOS isn’t everyone’s cup of tea though. You may want to move to the Android side and you’ll be glad to hear there are plenty of iPhone 12 alternatives. Here are some of our favorite ones.

Editor’s note: We will regularly update this list of the best iPhone 12 alternatives.

The best iPhone 12 alternatives

1. Samsung Galaxy S22 series

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Powerful Android flagship phones stuffed with a ton of features.

Samsung promises three years of system updates for its phones.

Available in a wide variety of markets. Samsung is Apple’s arch-rival in the mobile space and the Galaxy S22 range is the Korean firm’s latest offering. These phones pack 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED 2X screens Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200 processors water resistance and wireless charging. Reviews: Galaxy S22 | Galaxy S22 Plus | Galaxy S22 Ultra

The Galaxy S22 Ultra is the most feature-packed model of the bunch delivering a QHD+ screen 108MP primary camera 3X and 10X zoom cameras a 5000mAh battery and up to 12GB of RAM. Those wanting the best specs on paper will want to look at this model. Otherwise the S22 and S22 Plus share an FHD+ screen a 50MP primary camera and smaller batteries.

Samsung’s phones offer a higher refresh rate than Apple’s 60Hz iPhones resulting in a more responsive screen and animations. But not everyone can spot the difference between a 60Hz screen and a 90Hz or 120Hz panel. Furthermore the 3X and 10X cameras on the Ultra should also deliver much better zoom quality than even the top-end iPhone. In any case the $800 starting price and three years of system updates make the S22 series one of the more attractive iPhone 12 alternatives.

2. Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Powerful flagship phones with high-end experiences.

They lack an IP rating.

Available in global markets (no US release though). We’ve been eyeing the Xiaomi 12 series since late 2021 when it was launched in China. These phones were very hard to get anywhere else but we’ve since seen a global launch making it easier to recommend the device. That said the Xiaomi 12 and Xiaomi 12 Pro are still hard to get in the USA but there are multiple ways to import them.

Availability issues aside these devices are definitely amazing iPhone 12 alternatives. They come with great high-end specs including a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor 8-12GB of RAM and 128-256GB of storage. Both also feature AMOLED displays with a 120Hz refresh rate but the Pro version has a slightly larger 6.73-inch QHD+ screen as opposed to the 6.28-inch 1080p panel found on the Xiaomi 12.

Of course the Pro version is the better of the two. It comes with an excellent 4600mAh battery a triple 50MP camera setup and 120W charging. It’s also not much more expensive than the base Xiaomi 12. That said you might enjoy the more manageable size of the Xiaomi 12.

3. OnePlus 10 Pro

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

Awesome design and powerful performance.

Water resistance and wireless charging.

OnePlus tends to support its phones for as many as three versions of Android.

Now available globally even in the USA. Like the Xiaomi 12 series the OnePlus 10 Pro was first released only in China making it hard for us to recommend it as an iPhone 12 alternative. It has since been launched globally though and even North Americans can buy it from all major retailers.

The OnePlus 10 Pro is not only a great iPhone 12 alternative but it’s also one of the best high-end phones around as well as a pretty good deal considering what you get. We’re not fans of the speakers and software and the IP rating is exclusive to T-Mobile in the USA but it’s otherwise a competent phone. More: OnePlus 10 Pro review

Specs include a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 up to 12GB of RAM and as much as 512GB of storage. The display is gorgeous featuring a 6.7-inch QHD+ AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The 5000mAh battery offers stunning battery life and you can charge at 80W (60W with the USA version).

4. Sony Xperia 1 III

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Stunning video capabilities are similar to dedicated cameras.

It sports a fantastic 4K HDR OLED 120Hz display.

The design is elegant and simple.

Battery life is solid. The Sony Xperia 1 III is a costly phone but it’s worth the extra price to many. Plus Apple users are already used to higher price tags on the high-end of the spectrum. Not to mention you get what you pay for. The Sony Xperia 1 III is very well built has plenty of great features and won’t disappoint enthusiasts.

We can start by mentioning its display which is still among the best in the industry. The 4K resolution is excellent but that’s not all the panel has going for itself. It’s also a very large 6.5-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate HDR and OLED technology. Also: Here’s our Sony Xperia 1 III review

Other specs include a Snapdragon 888 processor 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. The 4500mAh battery offers more than a day of regular use. And the camera is equally impressive with three 12MP sensors (standard ultrawide and periscope zoom) especially for video shooters. It can shoot 4K video at up to 120fps. The video quality and stabilization are stunning and you can even opt for the Cinema Pro app which is based on Sony FS cinema cameras.

We could say the Sony Xperia 1 III is not only a great iPhone 12 alternative but also an iPhone 13 one. And if you think the Xperia 1 III is a bit too pricey the Sony Xperia 5 III is also a great device that costs slightly less yet keeps most of the best features.

In a discussion of popular ’90s games names such as Pokémon Mario Sonic and more would of course make appearances. One that’s sometimes forgotten is Lemmings. Nevertheless the original game sold an estimated 15 to 20 million copies which puts it fourth in the list of game sales of the 1990s. These numbers mean it sold millions more than vaunted titles such as Street Fighter II and Final Fantasy VII. The story of how Lemmings achieved this unprecedented success is an interesting one.

A club kick-starts careers

In the 1980s the Kingsway Amateur Computer club as well as being a place for gamers provided a haven for technically gifted young individuals in Dundee Scotland to experiment with Commodore 64 and Spectrum machines. Dave Jones the oldest of the members gathered more friends during their work on their first game Menace (1988). This was the birth of DMA Design.

At the early stage employees commuted to an office space across from Jones’ father-in-law’s chip shop Deep Sea. Most of the members had still not even reached their 20th birthday. One of these young idealists Mike Dailly saw in the sprites of the game Oids (1987) an opportunity. The tiny 5 pixel sprites of the shooter could be replicated several times. Discussions about small high-fidelity sprites soon caught fire in the office.

DMA Design showed a demo of the little sprites to Psygnosis at the Personal Computer Show in 1989. The ambulant sprites had green hair because the colour showed up better on a PC’s EGA (Enhanced Graphics Adapter). Despite these advances the project went on the back-burner.

Hard work places the pieces

In between projects DMA Design refocused on the “lemmings” (the nickname for the sprites) in 1990. Dave Jones and Gary Timmons continued to work on essential aspects such as sprite animation as well as menu layout. To keep costs low the team filled the soundtrack with older unlicensed songs such as “How Much is That Doggie in the Window?” or “London Bridge”.

The mother of Scott Johnston another team member supplied the titular characters’ distinctive squeaks for the game. After DMA Design moved into an expanded office block they continued to develop their new project. During development team members competed against each other to build the best stages with the level editor with cash prizes for the most ambitious projects. In this way they encouraged each other to compose ever more devious puzzles. Developer Jon Dye said of those times:

It didn't feel like a company or anything like that it was just like being at a computer club. We were basically The Big Bang Theory but 30 years ago. We didn’t drink basically lived in the Pizza Hut around the corner and just went to the cinema all the time.

Artist Adrian Powell was able to use the features of the sprites to create the game’s distinctive cover art. Psygnosis the project’s publisher tested the levels in order to ascertain if it was ready for the public. At last on 14 February 1991 Lemmings arrived on store shelves. First day sales for the Amiga version was 55 000 — this dwarfed the lifetime sales of previous DMA Design titles like Menace’s 20 000.

Iterate a formula

Lemmings would become one of the most ported titles. After the Amiga version it would head to: the ZX Spectrum Acorn Archimedes Atari ST PC DOS Amstrad CPC NEC PC-9800 the Commodore CDTV and so many more. Because the design concept was simple meant it could make the jump to various platforms. The magazine Amiga Action reflected on the game’s launch:

It would take a very brave man to deny that Lemmings was the most innovative addictive and popular game of 1991. I for one cannot remember any other Amiga game that has received similar hype or publicity. 1991 must go down as the year of the Lemming.

There was no rest for DMA Designs though. Only months after the original game’s release they released the title “Oh No! More Lemmings” which added another 100 levels. It was available as a standalone or a cheaper supplemental data disk version for consumers who already had the first game. Reviewers felt it was well worth a purchase.

To spread the word DMA Designs released the free Xmas Lemmings 1991 demo. This title had a special Christmas theme such as Santa outfits for the Lemmings across all four of its levels. In a world before high-speed internet connections this was a clever way to introduce players to its addictive gameplay. The formula proved so successful that the developers also created Christmas versions in 1992 1993 and 1994.

A road to mayhem

Lemmings was such a runaway success that it convinced Sony to acquire Psygnosis its publisher and holder of the IP in 1993. The franchise expanded with Lemmings 2: The Tribes (1993) and All New World of Lemmings (1994). Other developers created 3D Lemmings (1995) Lemmings Paintball (1996) and The Adventures of Lomax (1996). Lemmings Revolution (2000) was one attempt to revive the name.

In 1997 DMA Design created another famous franchise — Grand Theft Auto. Take-Two Interactive bought the developer in the late 1990s. The company reconfigured the developer renamed it Rockstar North and moved it to Edinburgh not long after the takeover.

Couldn’t Lemmings be perfect for mobile gaming? Sony seemed to agree because it had Team17 developer a Lemmings remake in 2006 for PSP PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. Sony licensed the IP to Exient for in 2019 for the mobile title Lemmings: The Puzzle Adventure. The franchise has indeed seen many changes over the years.

But experts are urging Canadians to take caution and do what they can to limit the spread of COVID-19.

According to Dr. Peter Juni the outgoing scientific director of Ontario’s COVID-19 Science Advisory Table this means using more than one rapid antigen test (RAT).

“Don’t trust rapid tests” he told CTV News Channel on Sunday. “We don’t know yet how this works with [Omicron] BA.2. If it’s negative once [that’s] not enough.”

According to a science brief released by the Ontario Science Table in February RATs are believed to be less sensitive to the Omicron variant particularly when compared to their ability to detect the Delta variant. Additionally little remains known about how these tests perform when exposed to the BA.2 sub-variant Juni said. As a result he recommends Canadians take two rapid tests to confirm whether or not they are infected with COVID-19 before meeting with family and friends.

“Just one test – forget it that's not enough” Juni said. “[Take] at least two rapid tests at least 24 hours apart with no symptoms.”

Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19 is advised to not gather with others and should instead self-isolate he said. Common symptoms include a sore throat runny nose a new or worsening cough and fatigue.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch explained that COVID-19 rapid tests are designed to determine not only whether someone has the virus but if they are contagious at that moment. Taking more rapid tests raises the chances that any virus that exists will be detected he said.

“If you do two tests 24 hours apart you just increase the probability that you will detect the virus if it is indeed there” Bogoch told CTV’s Your Morning on Monday. “You'll presumably have more virus in the back of your nose when you're testing and that test will be positive.”

While rapid test instructions only require users to swab their nose Bogoch pointed to emerging data suggesting that when people swab the back of their throat and side of their cheek in addition to their nose this increases the chances of detecting any virus that may be present.

According to Bogoch it’s important to remember that rapid tests are not perfect as there have been instances where despite testing negative with an RAT people soon discovered they actually had COVID-19.

“We've got to be honest about rapid tests right? They were never perfect and they never should have been deemed as perfect” Bogoch said. “They're a helpful tool amongst several other tools to create a safer indoor environment.”

In addition to rapid testing Juni said those who are able to gather outdoors should do so in an effort to seek out better air circulation. Those who are gathering indoors are advised to limit the number of people in attendance avoid crowds and ensure there is proper ventilation.

“You can improve the ventilation by simple things like opening windows and doors” Bogoch said. “Rapid tests are to be used with good indoor ventilation vaccination [and] masking.”

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OMICRON BA.2

The Omicron BA.2 sub-variant recently emerged in Canada and other countries around the world. While evidence has suggested that the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant is more transmissible than its predecessor Omicron BA.1 it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease.

Initially Omicron BA.2 appeared to be spreading relatively slowly in Canada. However provinces such as Manitoba and Ontario have already announced that the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant is the most dominant strain circulating among communities.

This comes as COVID-19 case numbers are climbing yet again across Canada based on data compiled by CTVNews.ca. Those who have recently been infected with the virus or received their recommended vaccine doses are expected to have good protection against transmitting COVID-19 to others Juni said. Those who have not been infected or have not had their vaccines should take extra precaution he said.

“Quite a few people have protection through vaccination and a recent [exposure] already with BA.2 this new sub-variant” Juni said. “For all of us who haven't been infected relatively recently we just need to be really careful that we don't transmit and that we don't get sick ourselves.”

In Ontario about five per cent of the population is currently infected with COVID-19 according to data gathered by the science table.

“When you go somewhere and socialize it’s relatively certain if the group is a bit larger that there's at least one person in there who is infectious right now.”

As a result these recommendations go beyond the holiday weekend Juni said. He advises the continued use of good-quality masks such as a KF94 KN95 or N95s. If none of these is accessible Juni suggests layering a medical mask underneath a cloth mask for a snug fit.

“All of that will help and we just need to do that a few more weeks” Juni said. “When I now see that we’ve reached the crest if we are all a bit careful this will already help.”

The mobile connector bundle comes with an adapter that allows drivers to charge their cars from a standard 110v household outlet with other adapters available for purchase separately.

On Saturday night Twitter user @Tesla_Adri found that Tesla updated its support page to indicate the mobile connector bundle no longer comes with the car as it was previously listed as an accessory that “comes with vehicle.” It looks like there may be a mistake on this page though since the chart pictures a Gen 2 mobile connector bundle but shows the price for a $400 Gen 1 (Level 2) bundle (which is also available for purchase separately). Other changes spotted by @Tesla_Adri and Drive Tesla Canada provide further evidence that the Gen 2 charger is likely the one affected here.

In a reply to a user’s reaction to the situation Musk confirmed that the company will no longer include the Gen 2 mobile connector with new car purchases. “Usage statistics were super low so seemed wasteful” Musk explained adding that Tesla “will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit” in the future. It’s unclear which adapters Tesla will start including with the kit.

Musk provided another update hours later stating that “based on user feedback” Tesla will lower the price of the mobile connector to $200. He also said that Tesla will “make it easy” to order the mobile connector when purchasing a car and he encouraged customers to get a wall charger installed “well before” their car arrives.

The Gen 2 mobile connector is still listed as costing $275 on Tesla’s site and you couldn’t purchase one even if you wanted to; the mobile connector is currently out of stock and the same goes for the Gen 1 connector. That said it’s unclear how long either accessory has been out of stock or whether a supply chain shortage is contributing to Tesla’s decision. Tesla didn't immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. (Tesla disbanded its public relations team in 2019 and typically doesn’t respond to inquiries from the media.)

Reactions to Musk’s decision have been mixed. Although a mobile connector isn’t a necessity as Tesla owners can charge their car from a wall charger installed at their home or at a charging station some drivers say it’s comforting to have the mobile connector with them while traveling. The accessory can come in handy at campsites or when traveling in an area without charging stations as it allows drivers to plug their car into a standard outlet. It does charge at a much slower rate though with the Gen 2 charger providing about one to three miles of range after an hour of charging.

Some drivers also say the mobile connector servers as a much cheaper alternative to the expensive wall charger while others say they rarely use it at all. Connectors with a 120v or 240v adapter come standard with other EVs such as the Nissan Leaf Ford Mustang Mach-E Chevy Bolt and all BMW EVs. But as Elecktrek points out the Kia EV6 also doesn’t come with a Level 1 or 2 charging cable.

In 2020 Apple famously stopped including chargers with its new iPhones with Samsung and Google following suit. Although it’s easy to see parallels between this situation and Tesla’s it’s far too early to tell if Tesla’s move will create a domino effect among other EV makers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMi8wNC8xNi90ZXNsYS1nb2VzLWZ1bGwtYXBwbGUtc3RvcHMtZGVsaXZlcmluZy1jYXJzLXdpdGgtaW5jbHVkZWQtY2hhcmdpbmctY2FibGUtbm93LXNvbGQtc2VwYXJhdGVseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla goes full Apple and stops delivering cars with included charging hardware now sold separately (U),"Tesla changed its long-standing policy to deliver every vehicle with a mobile charging cable and instead it started selling them separately for $400 for level 2 charging and $275 for level 1.

The move is reminiscent of Apple removing the included USB charging brick with the iPhone.

Update: Tesla CEO Elon Musk says Tesla will reduce the price by $75 of the currently out of stock mobile charger in response to the backlash.

Update 2: According to Tesla’s chat unless you’ve already taken delivery Mobile chargers are now no longer included even though they were at time of purchase.

Update 3: Tesla internal communication now says that all deliveries “for the next several weeks” will come with the Mobile Connector included.

With charging being one of the biggest concerns for electric vehicle buyers it made sense for Tesla to include a mobile charging cable with every vehicle sold.

The included charging kit evolved over the years.

Tesla used to include a charging cable with both a NEMA 14-50 (level 2) connector and a connector for a regular outlet (Level 1).

The automaker later decided to drop the NEMA 14-50 connector from the included bundle and only included the NEMA 5-15 adapter which is for a regular outlet. You could buy the Level 2 connector separately.

With a max power output of 1.3kW the included connector enabled charging speeds between two and three miles of range per hour. It’s not much but it is still better than nothing and suitable for overnight charging.

For anything better Tesla owners would have to install a level 2 charging station at home.

Now Tesla has gone a step further and decided to not include any charging cable with its new vehicles.

CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla believes that the usage amongst owners was too low to justify supplying the cable with every new car delivery:

“Usage statistics were super low so seemed wasteful. On the (minor) plus side we will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit.”

The move is reminiscent of Apple’s decision to stop supplying USB charging bricks with new iPhones a few years ago and the company also cited wastefulness at the time.

However the similarities stopped there. Apple could rely on the fact that most customers already had several USB/Lightning bricks but that’s much less likely to be the case for Tesla buyers especially those new to EVs.

Also even if most users don’t use the mobile cables often it might be extremely useful to keep in the car for a worst-case scenario or early in the ownership experience before you can get a home charging station installed.

Compounding the concern is that both of Tesla’s mobile connectors are listed as “out of stock” on its website:

So for people taking delivery of new Tesla vehicles without included connector they are going have to find an alternative somewhere else.

Electrek’s Take

I’m not a fan of this move. I know everyone has a different situation but I know a lot of owners who primarily use their included mobile charger – obviously more so when Tesla included the NEMA 14-50.

Personally I did probably over 80% of my charging on my Tesla Model 3 with the included charger.

I think it just makes sense to sell an electric car with a charging device – even if it doesn’t end up being your primary charging product.

For what it is worth Tesla isn’t the first company to do this. We learned earlier this year that Kia’s EV6 wouldn’t be coming with a charging cable and at the time we said:

The EV6 doesn’t come with a Level 1 or 2 charging cable for better or worse. Talking to the team I think the thinking is why add a $1000 part and the complexity associated with it when people might already have a charging station at home might not have a garage and/or could probably pick one designed best for them for a cheaper price at an online retailer. For someone like me that has like five different EV chargers at the house already that makes sense but as a first-time EV buyer it adds significant complexity to getting an EV. Throwing in a $200 charge cable would make a lot of sense

That’s the message climate scientists have for politicians policy wonks and anyone (and everyone) willing to listen.

Members of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say that global carbon dioxide emissions must peak within the next three years to avert the most severe impacts of climate change. Their solution? Action that delivers “rapid deep and immediate” emissions cuts. For IPCC leadership this entails “having the right policies infrastructure and technology in place.”

One of those policies is incentivizing electric vehicle (EV) use. Fossil fuel-powered vehicles after all emit some 4.6 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Multiply that by the 250 million-plus autos in major markets like the United States and well you see the problem. Electric cars seemingly offer relief. After all over their life cycle — from digging up the raw materials to eventually laying the car to rest — EVs emit fewer greenhouse gases than their gasoline-powered counterparts. Hence increasingly hefty government investment in going electric.

Canada’s 2022 federal budget promises to spend $1.7 billion on EV incentives. That’s nearly triple what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has spent on such programs since 2019 and $200 million more than what Trudeau promised to fork out during the last election. Similar bets on electric autos have been made by Trudeau’s U.K. counterpart Boris Johnson and U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. And a list of other world leaders. For the political elite going electric is it would seem a cause célèbre.

But just because EVs can lower emissions doesn’t mean that they do. Or will. I know what you’re thinking. With little reliance on fossil fuels why wouldn’t EVs lower emissions? When plugged into a clean electric grid how couldn’t EVs be cleaner than the alternative: gas autos whose contribution to climate change is clear compelling and consistent. The status quo bogs down the fight against climate change right?

Not quite. Whether EVs reduce emissions lies in understanding the “counterfactual.” What would happen in the absence of an EV being used? This comparison is often framed as a choice between an EV and a gas guzzler. When viewed side by side the EV does come out on top. But that’s not the whole story. Because EVs generate more emissions during the manufacturing process relative to conventional autos (producing batteries is no small feat) and they must drive further to “burn off” their production emissions. Not doing so risks increasing not decreasing emissions relative to conventional autos.

When aren’t EVs driven as much? When they are used as second cars. This has little to do with EVs themselves. Instead less usage largely reflects consumer behavior in multivehicle households. Secondary cars are invariably used less than primary cars regardless of what fuels them. That’s good when secondary cars are gas-guzzling autos. But fewer miles covered in an EV can mean more emissions if the car doesn’t travel far enough to offset its production emissions. The problem? The majority of EVs are currently purchased as secondary not primary cars.

Fossil fuels are admittedly not the way forward. Evidence that the burning of gasoline contributes to climate change is to put it mildly overwhelming and worrisome. But propping up policies courtesy of taxpayer cash that worsen the status quo is equally worrisome. Public funds should instead be used to enact policies that yield meaningful results.

Where climate change is concerned this means incentivizing ways to decrease not increase emissions. Where EVs are concerned this entails subsidizing their use not solely their purchase.

Advertisement

Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. EVs can help address that challenge. But that’s hardly a sure bet. Even if EVs did reduce emissions that hardly makes EV subsidies the best use of government capital.

The issue isn’t as many argue solely about reducing emissions. Rather it’s about reducing emissions per dollar spent. Taxpayers may care about the planet but we too want a bargain.

Its low price as well as Linux platform and accessible GPIO make it useful in many places outside the classroom. But if you want to abandon the ease-of-use in favor of an even lower price the Raspberry Pi foundation makes that possible as well with the RP2040 chip commonly found on the Pico. [Jason] shows us one way to make use of this powerful chip by putting one in an audio digital signal processing board.

While development boards are available for this chip [Jason] has opted instead for a custom PCB which he designed himself and includes an integrated headphone amplifier and 3.5 mm audio jacks. To do the actual DSP work the RP2040 chip uses three 12-bit ADC channels and 16 controllable PWM channels. The platform is also equipped with the TLV320AIC3254 codec from Texas Instruments. With all of this put together he has a functioning open-source platform he calls the DS-Pi.

[Jason] has built this as a platform for guitar effects and as a customizable guitar amp modeler but with a platform that is Arduino-compatible and fairly easy to program it could be put to use for anything involving other types of music or audio processing like this specialized MIDI-compatible guitar effects platform which is built around the same processor.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Port City Daily/Shea Carver)

WILMINGTON — Global pharma leader Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is on the hunt for new office space in town specifically for its subsidiary PPD which it acquired in a $17.4 billion deal in December 2021.

The Fortune 100 company announced earlier in the week it was exploring opportunities to sell the former PPD headquarters. The 12-story building erected in 2007 is the tallest overlooking downtown Wilmington.

The move is designed to support business growth and enable the company to match current and future workspace needs according to a press release. The Covid-19 trend has many industries assessing more remote work options and scaling back on office space.

Just two months ago the 17-acre campus of the former Verizon Wireless call center on Shipyard Boulevard sold for more than $16 million. The majority of local Verizon employees were sent home to work at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 a move the company made permanent by August of that year.

Yet the scientific research industry has been offering flexible work options for years according to David M. Johnston Thermo Fisher senior vice president and president of clinical research at PPD.

“A significant percentage of our colleagues and job candidates prefer a hybrid work model coming into the office for collaboration purposes which necessitates more flexible workspaces and fewer dedicated offices” Johnston said in the release.

The PPD headquarters changed the skyline of downtown Wilmington 15 years ago. It was one of the first buildings to inspire revitalization of the north waterfront area now home to Riverfront Park multiple apartment complexes as well as an expanded Riverwalk and marina. The PPD building offers 400000 square feet of office space with surface parking a parking deck and an underground garage.

When Thermo Fisher Scientific took over four months ago speculation arose as to whether it would continue operating in the building. Acquisitions often come with changes but empty offices and parking spaces were more notable due to the pandemic.

Utilizing the building should it go on the market won’t be hard some local officials told the Wilmington Business Journal at the end of last year. Ninety-six percent of office space is occupied in the submarket of downtown Wilmington Wilmington Downtown Inc. CEO Holly Childs said.

“Class A office space is really hard to come by because there’s so little of the product” she told the journal.

Mayor Saffo added that demand for more apartments and hotels also remain on the rise downtown. Thus 929 N. Front St. “will be heavily used at some point in time whoever uses it” he also told the journal.

Based in Waltham Massachusetts Thermo Fisher is a supplier of scientific instrumentation reagents and consumables and software services. Its annual revenue equals approximately $40 billion and it employs more than 130000 worldwide.

Over 11000 work in North Carolina with PPD clinical research employing over 1700 people in the Wilmington region. It currently has 200-plus open positions in the area.

The company says it is in the early stages of the sale process and relocating which could take up to two years or more to complete.

“[W]e expect to continue to be a Wilmington growth story for years to come” Johnston said in the release. “The business remains committed to Wilmington both as an employer that continues to expand hiring locally and globally and as a good corporate citizen investing in the communities where our colleagues live and work.”

The hay the feed the trailers were all donated and headed to Bluff Dale Texas in a rancher convoy to help farmers and ranchers who lost much of their livelihood during wildfires this season.

“If these ranchers don’t get help they’re going to lose their cattle and its ultimately going to affect Texans or the rest of the nation” said Steven Ruiz who brought several bags of feed to donate.

The person organizing the convoy is Brian Firebaugh but better known as Cattle Guy-- a name he uses on the app TikTok where he makes videos.

His TikTok account has garnered nearly 300000 followers and reportedly raised about $30000 to buy feed and hay.

“It’s been incredible” Firebaugh said. “We wound up posting videos of these burned down ranches so people can actually see who they’re helping they can see what we are doing to help and we wound up asking for donations.”

It was one of those videos that Ruiz saw when he decided to donate to the cause and join the rancher convoy in person on Saturday.

“Started looking for hay couldn’t find any hay went to the local tractor supply grabbed some feed and decided to come out and help my fellow Texans out” said Ruiz.

Cattle guy says the convoy is a picture of Texans helping Texans through the power of TikTok.

“We often forget about our farmers and ranchers but this is just a clear indication that we have not forgotten about them.”

The convoy took the hay and feed to Bluff Dale which will be a distribution point to get the items to several communities in the state affected by wildfires.

Why this seemingly perfect Easter gift isn't perfect.,"(Image courtesy of For Duck's Sake) A sign at Clinton Pond urges visitors not to dump their domestic ducks.

It’s the time of year when cute baby ducks and geese are for sale at farm supply stores across Utah.

But all too often urban dwellers pick up those little birds on impulse become overwhelmed with the amount of care involved and drop them off at a pond or park to fend for themselves.

“It happens at pretty much every pond in Utah” said Amy Needham with Puddle Ducks Rescue.

Unlike wild ducks domestic ducks can’t take off when they’re attacked by predators. They can’t migrate when cold weather sets in. They’re bred for meat and eggs which makes them too fat to fly. Dumping a pet duck pretty much dooms it to a miserable and perhaps short life.

“It’s like dropping a kitten in the forest” cautioned Tiffany Young with Ducks and Clucks “and saying ‘Good luck tiger.’”

Domestic ducks require a lot of care — heat lamps to stay warm freshwater protection from predators and space to roam. But duck rescuers say they see people frequently picking them up on a whim as Easter gifts for kids. Young said she has taken in two groups of ducks that teens bought as part of “promposals.”

“It’s ‘I went to a dance with a boy and he left these on my porch to ask me’” Young said. “I’m like great that’s going to live for seven to 10 years. Now what’s your plan?”

RaeAnn Christensen with For Duck’s Sake rescue is fostering some ducklings. People who received two of them as a gift didn’t know how to care for ducks and the birds’ legs and feet became burned from sitting in their own feces.

(Courtesy image) RaeAnn Christensen with For Duck's Sake is currently rehabilitating ducklings gifted to someone who didn't give them proper care.

“There are no restrictions on ducks and adopting them. You can just buy them for 50 cents” from farm supply stores Christensen said. “Its such a systemic problem.”

She has helped rescue dumped domestic ducks and geese with all kinds of injuries — fishing hooks embedded in their cheeks bitten and infected wings broken legs. During a bad botulism outbreak in 2020 she said she had around 60 ducks in and out of her garage for over a month.

“It’s overwhelming because I’m not an actual animal services [provider]. I’m doing this because I saw a need” Christensen said. “How am I supposed to say no when there’s an animal in need? It’s heartbreaking.”

Under Utah code people are guilty of of cruelty to an animal if they abandon a creature in their care. But most shelters in Utah don’t take ducks or geese and domestic flocks don’t fall under the jurisdiction of state wildlife managers. Stores also don’t allow customers to return their birds in an effort to prevent the spread of disease.

With few options to rehome the birds “sometimes people will take their domestic ducks to places where there are other ducks” said Liz Sollis with Salt Lake County Parks and Recreation. “We’re not duck caregivers for lack of a better word.”

Sollis said Sugar House Park’s pond is particularly popular for dumped ducks. The pond had to be drained early last year due to drought and to fend off avian flu.

“That pond wasn’t intended to be a duck pond” she said. “It just became a duck pond.”

Last year Weber State University had to remove around 40 domestic ducks and geese from its ponds with the help of rescue groups.

“It came to a head last September because they kept increasing and increasing” said Weston Woodward director of campus services. “Once these animals get larger and not as cute to play with they get dropped off.”

In Highland City Highland Glen Park has become contaminated with E. coli due to all the wild and domestic ducks in its pond which is further exacerbated by the current drought the Daily Herald reports.

And it’s not great for wild and domestic ducks to mix.

“Our wild duck population ... they interbreed with dumped ducks and it ruins the genetic pool” Needham said. “It ruins their camouflage it reduces their instincts.”

Some advocates are trying to post signs in farm supply stores reminding shoppers that domestic birds are pets that require responsible care.

Tyler Stinson a spokesperson for IFA Country Stores said his teams are regularly trained on sales of poultry animals.

“We have in many instances not allowed purchases if we suspect it’s being purchased for a gift” Stinson said. “Unfortunately we can’t police every purchase and every transaction that happens and we do not have any control once they leave our premises over what happens to them.”

IFA stores typically don’t allow individual sale of chicks and ducklings since they’re flock animals that do better in groups. If customers try to buy a bird Stinson said employees are encouraged to ask whether they have a proper setup.

“They look very cute and harmless sitting there under a nice warm lamp where they’re comfortable” he said. “But as with any other living thing they make messes and require the right attention so they can thrive and be happy animals. And that’s ultimately what we want.”

For those who have their heart set on adopting a duck or goose — and have the means to adequately care for them — animal advocates urge Utahns to consider a rescue or foster animal instead of buying from farm supply stores.

“If they wait a couple weeks” Young said “there will be all the ducks they want and more because of people who dump them.”

And for anyone looking for an adorable last-minute Easter gift Young has some advice.

“A stuffed animal” she said “is a much better choice.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9zaG9wcGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzE3L2Vhc3Rlci1zdW5kYXktMjAyMi1zdG9yZS1jbG9zZWQtb3Blbi83MzEzODY0MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Easter 2022: Target closed; Walmart Home Depot Big Lots CVS open,"If your egg hunt leads you to do even more shopping this weekend it's helpful to know which stores are open and closed on Easter Sunday.

The 49-year-old plumber from East London described long unruly lines of angry passengers trying to determine the status of their flights and families sprawled out across the floor eating drinking and sleeping to get through long delays.

“First our flight was canceled and rebooked for a day later so we lost the first night of our hotel and then when we arrived for our new flight it was delayed by three hours” Mr. Crawley recalled this week from his hotel balcony in Spain. “It’s bliss to be here but honestly if I knew I had to go through the shambles at the airport again I would have probably chosen to stay at home in my garden.”

Mr. Crawley was not alone in his urge to seize the moment — or in encountering chaos when he did. Over the last two weeks travelers on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have endured long lines at airports flight delays or cancellations and plenty of frustration.

Thousands of Britons have flocked to airports for the start of the Easter vacation season which coincided with governments across Europe dropping coronavirus restrictions. But in the last two weeks more than a thousand flights have been canceled across Britain upending vacation plans for tens of thousands of passengers. Last Saturday alone British Airways and easyJet canceled more than 100 flights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vR01BL05ld3MvdmlkZW8vbmF0aW9ucy1idXNpZXN0LWFpcnBvcnQtcHJlcGFyaW5nLXRyYXZlbGVycy04NDExOTQzOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video How nation's busiest airport is preparing for travelers,How nation's busiest airport is preparing for travelers The general manager of Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta International Airport Balram Bheodari shared tips for travelers and the airport's efforts for smooth travel.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvcG93ZXJmdWwtd2F5cy1zdXBwb3J0LWNoYW1waW9uLXdvbWVuLXRyYXZlbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 powerful ways to support and champion women on your travels,"Intrepid Travel relaunched its series of Women’s Expeditions in 2022.

This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).

From running culinary tours in Mexico City to setting up an anti-poaching unit in South Africa women around the world are overcoming challenges to innovate and lead. With over half of the travel and tourism industry made up of women supporting travel is a great way to champion this — but with most women working lower paid manual jobs in this industry when we don’t travel consciously we’re statistically not investing in women. Sustainable and local travel can benefit women all over the world aiding to build community overcome hurdles (like the pandemic which financially impacted many women in lower paid jobs) create economic opportunity and educate girls to help build a fairer future. Here we round up some of the ways to help tip the gendered balance scales through travel.

1. Travel with other women

There are some companies out there that are specifically curating trips tours and expeditions for women travellers. After a short hiatus in 2022 Intrepid Travel relaunched its series of Women’s Expeditions. Aiming to aid women impacted by the pandemic the trips support communities in Pakistan India Jordan Morocco and Nepal. The tour leaders are all women who offer insight into the daily lives and challenges women face in other countries many of whom feel the economic impact the most while having less access to government support than those with higher-paid jobs.

Wild Terrains is another major player in this camp — their small group trips are just for women while also supporting women-owned businesses in the destinations they cover (Argentina Iceland Portugal France and Mexico). Girls Trip Tours meanwhile runs trips for women to Africa with activities centred around the empowerment of women.

2. Opt for women-owned businesses

With the majority of women holding roles that are lower paid in the tourism industry when we as travellers opt for chain hotels restaurants or shops for souvenirs those who benefit financially are statistically less likely to be women. There are some easy tools out there to help narrow down the search for women-owned businesses such as Women Owned. There’s also an abundance of alterative options for accommodation that support local communities and are run by women such as The Retreat Costa Rica Casa Palopó in Guatemala and Garden of the Gods Resort in Colorado. When buying souvenirs look out for small local companies to buy from such as Kazuri Beads in Kenya run by women who produce traditional beadwork products.

3. Take a hike

With a lot of adventure focused through the lens of cis white men some companies and individuals have taken it upon themselves to provide space to diversify this and offer more activities and stories. Black Girls Hike is a UK-based group centred around providing group hike trips activity days and training events for women of Black Afro/Caribbean descent — their aim is to provide a safe space while encouraging reconnecting with nature. In the U.S. there’s Hike Clerb an intersectional group for women to join. The group organises trails in California and New York and are now expanding to Toronto. Trails are selected with accessibility as the focus with walks often including an element of activism.

4. Choose your tour guide

When booking tours on your travels you can request tour guides who are women or actively seek out companies that specialise in this. Booking on to a trip with Varanasi Women Tours run by Priya Pandey in northern India for example would help support the first and only woman tour guide in the area. There’s ToursByLocals which in part aims to empower local women to become tourism entrepreneurs providing a platform to earn a fair wage. Solo travellers who are women can use the site to book tour guides in countries and regions around the world. Intrepid also offers this teaming up with Women in Travel to create Urban Adventures designed to celebrate multiculturalism in cities with women-led experiences and guides.

5. Aid through your tastebuds

Break bread around the world using companies that support women through food. Salt & Wind is an immersive food experience company that’s women-owned and offers unique and meaningful culinary endeavours in California Hawaii Italy Mexico Spain and France. Eat Like a Local is another based in Mexico City and run by native Rocio. Try Naya Traveler a tour company owned and managed by women for curated food tours around the world or head to Traveling Spoon where majority of the hosts are women — the company’s main aim is to create economic opportunities for local women and food producers around the world — offering cooking classes in-home meals and market visits in a wealth of destinations.

6. Champion communities

Supporting local women can come from celebrating (and financially contributing to) local crafts. TreadRight Foundation is a helpful tool — it’s a non-profit linked to Red Carnation Hotels with an aim to have a positive impact on people communities wildlife and marine life. Part of that initiative includes encouraging and enabling communities to thrive through community-based tourism — search the site to find ways of contributing like by visiting Pudakul a 100% Aboriginal and family-owned business offering culture and nature-based experiences in the Northern Territory of Australia.

7. Help women travel

Black Trans Travel Fund is a grassroots collective set up to provide financial and material resources to break down barriers and help Black transgender women with safer travel options. By donating to the collective your money can be redistributed to help Black transgender women travel more safely. Another way to help women see the world is to book a tour through Exodus Travels’ The Mountain Lioness Scholarship. The initiative set up in Tanzania sponsors local women to train as mountain guides aiding them to become expedition leaders in an industry typically dominated by men.

8. Support women protecting wildlife

Sustainability is an issue that takes in many factors but ultimately by supporting women on the ground we can create a better planet. When booking eco trips look out for women-led initiatives that you can support. The Black Mambas Anti-Poaching Unit in South Africa’s Balule Nature Reserve is a great example of this — the all-woman unit protects all boundaries of the reserve from poachers. It aims to give women a voice and to educate people on how we can live symbiotically with wildlife. By donating to such initiatives we can help to create a more regenerative future.

According to Emergen Research the global automotive telematics market size reached $ 100.70 billion in 2021 and is expected to register a significantly rapid revenue CAGR of 26.1% till 2030.

Key Drivers

According to the report increased fleet efficiency and improved safety boost automotive telematics market revenue growth. Vehicle telematics offers an advanced customer experience by keeping the vehicle fleet moving on schedule. For instance Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking solution enables users to track fleet positions and avoid traffic. It provides an alternative way to minimise the delay. In addition vehicle telematics tracks drivers' behaviour in real-time and discourages unsafe behaviour while good drivers are rewarded ensuring safety.

However power dependence and the high cost of telematics devices act as restraints to market growth. Devices require power sources to function. Battery-powered trackers are needed to keep on charging all the time to avoid the possibility of being out of charge during emergencies.

The cost of many telematics devices such as dashcams and smart route planning is high. Automotive telematics records various information of the users and can track vehicle movement which makes it vulnerable to hacking and this makes users hesitant to use it.

Major companies in this space include Trimble Inc. AirIQ Inc. Actsoft Verizon Airbiquity Inc. Ctrack Masternaut Mix Telematics TomTom International and I D Systems Inc.

COVID-19 pandemic has been having a wide-ranging impact on various industries including car and insurance companies. Pandemic has created economic pressure and this has acted as a constraint for the telematics market as the price of fully integrated telematics solutions such as dash cams smart route planning electronic logging devices (ELDs) and driver management are high.

In addition sales of cars have declined which significantly hampered automotive telematics market growth. However telematics improves customer experience and many benefits provided to drivers car companies and insurance carriers are expected to contribute substantially toward revenue growth during the forecast period.

Trends Innovations

The current trend of vehicle telematics especially in the transportation industry is expected to boost market revenue growth during the forecast period. Vehicle telematics works by installing a device with a SIM card and it provides access to accurate vehicle information such as location tyre pressure idling time and speed in real-time. As a result many US-based insurance companies are increasingly adopting vehicle telematics to help the insured save on their policies. In addition many companies use vehicle telematics for safe-keeping and locating their fleet vehicles.

North America

Market growth in North America is attributed to the increasing use of telematics by insurance companies. Increasing demand for various telematics solutions such as fleet management and navigation systems for commercial vehicles especially in the US substantially contributes to market revenue growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mandatory Credit: Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports

Star outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. has been sidelined since before the 2021 All-Star Game. Fans awaiting his return will not have to wait much longer.

Speaking during the MLB on FS1 Pregame Show before Saturday’s game between Acuña’s Atlanta Braves and the San Diego Padres on Saturday Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports reported that Acuña could be back in action during the first week of May.

Ronald Acuña Jr. is on track to return to the Braves lineup in early May.@Ken_Rosenthal has the latest ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/ikL0jD50Hr — FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) April 16 2022

“The Braves are targeting loosely May 6 — the start of a homestand against the Brewers — for Acuña’s return. He could begin a rehabilitation assignment as soon as Tuesday. He probably would play 5-6 innings in the outfield at first then maybe DH. The idea would be to build him up to nine innings and once they do that he should be good to go.”

This was welcome news for all baseball fans particularly fans of the Braves.

Can’t wait to watch a top 3 player in all of baseball win mvp this year https://t.co/4LHjmq4WSk — D A R R I N (@DarrinKneale) April 16 2022

Acuña has been one of baseball’s best players since his rookie season in 2018. Prior to his 2021 injury he was an MVP candidate hitting .283/.394/.596 with 24 home runs in 82 games.

The Braves won the World Series in 2021 despite Acuña being sidelined. Atlanta’s start to the 2022 season hasn’t been disastrous but has been inconsistent — especially on offense. Entering Saturday’s game the Braves were 4-5 and had been held to two runs or fewer in all but one of their losses (when they scored three runs) as well as in one of their wins.

So Atlanta figures to be getting Acuña back in the lineup at the exact right time.

Our government had failed. We needed masks gloves ventilators and body bags. We didn’t have them. They said they could get them. Many lied some stole others got rich enough to be noticed.

This is the story of pandemic pirates. When the Trump administration finally responded to the Covid-19 virus its solution was to award hundreds of millions of dollars eventually billions to anyone and everyone. So began a bonanza for government contractors grifters and cheats in our time of need. Over the course of two years reporter J. David McSwane chased private jets and fake test tubes to uncover the story of those who got rich while we got sick. He found a broken system that allowed some to grasp at wealth and glory while too many Americans died.

Robert Stewart Jr. strode with purpose through the exit of the private wing of Dulles International Airport a glinting Legacy 450 Flexjet whirring ahead of us on the tarmac. He turned to offer a caveat.

“I’m talking with you against the advice of my attorney” he said.

It was the morning of Saturday April 26 2020 — the year a plague upended our world and I fell into the absurd realm of those trying to profit from the despair. Stewart was sturdy early thirties filling out a tailored and shiny gray suit. On his lapel he wore an American flag pendant emblazoned with the word in all caps “VETERAN.” I couldn’t see his face behind his mask or through my fog-filled eyeglasses but his tone registered as a blend of bravado and trepidation.

It felt like foreboding as if embracing a dare to avoid a truth. I pictured him as a boy winking from atop the high dive at his friends below knowing the belly flop he’s about to perform will leave him red and stung yet warm with the perverse validation of having done it. The inquiry that led me to be here was honest though I can’t say altogether naive. I suppose I had dared him in a way.

Editor’s picks

I had called just the day before to ask how he intended to fulfill the terms of a $34.5 million contract he’d inexplicably landed with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs which operates the nation’s largest network of hospitals serving 9 million military veterans and their families. The deadline was nearing for him to produce 6 million N95 respirators the medical-grade masks which were in scarce supply but crucial to protecting healthcare workers toiling with a contagion about which we knew almost nothing. He said he was about to prove to me and the rest of the world that he was legitimate and in fact he’d soon be boarding a private jet to Chicago to oversee delivery of the masks to a VA warehouse just outside the city.

The stakes were high. He was a brand-new never-before-hired out-of-left-field yet suddenly bona fide federal contractor. The deal had been awarded without the usual competitive bidding under emergency guidelines that lifted red tape meant to weed out fraud patronage and waste. The federal government was desperate Americans were terrified and Stewart offered a solution with just a few emails. If he delivered more federal contracts were sure to come and he and his company might see generational wealth and a steady stream of business. I expressed amazement and some natural skepticism and asked to tag along on the flight. Eager to prove himself he agreed.

His was one of the biggest contracts the federal government had awarded in early 2020 when the Trump administration finally opened the financial spigot to address a politically inconvenient pandemic. Every state local and federal agency and hospital was locked in fierce competition to buy masks driving up prices. Extreme demand scarce supply and an inept federal government were congealing into a colossal “shit show” as one supply chain expert described it to me.

So there we were strangers ascending the narrow stairs to a private jet replete with leather captain’s chairs and free snacks and liquor shooters on a quest to find masks and fortune and maybe even save the world. His attorney had a late night and didn’t check in with Stewart that morning to confirm he’d make the $22000-a-day private jet that Stewart had booked for this caper. We were lifting off without him. That was fine by me. Lawyers have a way of slowing things down.

He exuded the trappings of a successful federal contractor — the suit the easy use of arcane contract lingo the private jet the limited liability corporation in Falls Church Virginia with proximity to the Pentagon and its steady outflows of public money. He claimed that 6 million 3M N95s were loaded in a Los Angeles warehouse with his name on them. The shipment would be coming into the Chicago area that weekend he said and I’d be there to watch it all go down.

But Stewart’s aura belied the fact that he clearly had no idea what he was doing. I couldn’t begrudge him this. Who among us truly knows what we’re doing? In a crisis no less? We rise to our occasions. This is America. The land of opportunity. A magical place with magical thinkers. Pull up your bootstraps. Take chances. Fake it till you make it. That’s why I was there after all to see how the hell he managed to get his hands on something almost no one seemed able to get. If he pulled it off it would be a great American story. If he failed it would be the type of story I tend to write — an investigation.

The federal government and Congress had failed to shore up the national stockpile. What supplies were in the stockpile were already depleted. In New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had decried on television the Wild West market that had emerged in the absence of federal preparation and response. He compared fighting against other states and cities for precious masks and ventilators to entering into a bidding war on eBay. In California Governor Gavin Newsom circumvented the federal mess and signed a huge contract to buy direct from a Chinese company a move that would earn him some criticism but maybe wasn’t altogether the worst idea. In Maryland the governor was conducting a sort of clandestine mission to get supplies to keep them from being commandeered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In Texas well they were being Texas.

The cable news networks had reported numerous anecdotes of healthcare workers improvising personal protective equipment sewing their own masks and donning trash bags instead of medical-grade gowns. At the same time federal law enforcement was beginning to nab price gougers who stocked up on supplies of hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes or used car salesmen who tried to sell masks that didn’t exist to struggling hospitals and government agencies. Then came the counterfeit masks made in China and peddled onshore by homegrown profiteers which made their way into hospitals and private medical offices. As the Trump administration made clear our fates were left to the free market where fear distorted our sense of reason and left us prey to the predators.

From this chaos rose alluring opportunities for those bold enough to chase the cash. It was a rare and tempting thing — the opportunity to make a killing and at the same time be rewarded with the satisfaction that your work could be credited with saving lives. Many mask brokers schemers counterfeiters and fakes I’d talk to in the coming months would in some way describe themselves as such capitalist saviors. Stewart was one and as a Black owner of a small veteran-owned firm — a double advantage when bidding on government contracts — he was in a damn fine spot to make something of the mess.

Still Stewart was an odd recipient for such an important contract. He had been named a key arbiter of a simple device that was the best defense against a virus that killed with horrifying complexity. Yet he had zero experience sourcing medical supplies. None. He was not a mask distributor nor an importer of record nor a freight forwarder. He knew little about how to navigate the supply chain which almost always leads back to China where American manufacturers had outsourced to keep wages low prices attractive and profits high. When I encountered his deal in the federal purchasing data in mid-April along with dozens of other peculiar deals we’d track down at ProPublica I wondered what the contracts told us about the federal government’s plan to combat Covid-19. It smelled of panic. It seemed inconceivable in any other context but I wondered: Was the plan to cast money out indiscriminately like chum into the sea and just see what bites?

These weren’t just any masks to which Stewart claimed to have access. They were the gold-standard N95 respirators manufactured by 3M the vaunted American company that brought us Scotch tape and the Post-it note. Capable of filtering out 95 percent of particles the N95mask most associated with dusty DIY home repair jobs had become an unexpected ticket to riches — if you could find a cache of them and sell to the highest bidder. Stewart saw early in this dark chapter of American history as many other profiteers did that these once-disposable face coverings had become indispensable. Total seller’s market.

N95s used to cost about $1 apiece. But Stewart had gotten the VA to agree to pay almost $6 apiece. At the time that was about a 350 percent markup. Multiply that margin by a quantity of 6 million and you end up with a fat payday for a guy who’d never been awarded a federal contract let alone one into the tens of millions. If it worked he could buy his own private jet and I would soon find he was considering it. This sort of margin was the very definition of price gouging something that would swiftly result in criminal charges during a localized catastrophe such as a hurricane. But the moment was too large too chaotic to know for certain whether this was the result of one man’s avarice or out-of-control market conditions. We’d seen nothing like this — a national emergency that simultaneously threatened every community every business every American. Whether it was gouging or not federal and state and local agencies signaled they would be willing to pay.

Once inside the tiny fuselage Stewart sat on the starboard side facing the cockpit and I sat on the port side facing him careful to stay as far from his air as I could manage. I did not yet have a legitimate filtering respirator and had agreed to not hold ProPublica liable for risks I’d accepted with open eyes.

“This is about helping folks” Stewart began to tell me. “About being able to say to my mom and dad ‘Thank you for all the work you did.’ Now we are about to help six million people — well six million masks.”

As the jet rolled up to the runway I asked him again.

How did you get your hands on 6 million N95 masks?

I did not expect his answer.

His story had changed entirely. He no longer had claim to the masks he said were waiting for him at the port of Los Angeles. He said they’d been sold out from under him the night before. Poof gone or so he claimed.

Why are we flying to the VA distribution center outside Chicago then? I asked. Why didn’t he cancel the flight? “It was kind of a faith thing” he said shrugging as he clutched an old Bible as if it were a government contractor’s sacred talisman.

He said he didn’t know how but he was going to deliver 6 million N95s and meet his deadline Sunday at midnight. He’d been working the phones all night and had a promising lead on an investor who could secure the masks for a fee. The deal involved “the attorney general of Alabama” he said and one way or another he was going to deliver. Faith had gotten him this far. Besides look at the jet. Surely this was someone who meant business.

“It comes down to me and my credibility” he said. “Why would anybody pay twenty-two thousand dollars to have a ghost box delivery? It doesn’t make any sense.”

He was right. It didn’t make sense. I gazed out the window as the metal wings grabbed the wind and ascended over my broken country. Our quilted patchwork of land and cities and roads and people floated by and I thought of the devastation coming for it of what it meant if this trip went bust. The projections were dire. Any chance of “flattening the curve” had all but diminished. Nature was coming for us with fatal intent. Nurses and doctors below were terrified as patients diagnosed with Covid-19 the disease caused by SARS CoV-2 came rolling in. We had not yet lost hundreds of thousands of lives but it was clear we would. Within the VA hospital system nurses and doctors were being rationed per shift just one surgical mask those thin blue masks that offer far less protection than an N95. Nurses with whom I exchanged emails and texts were being gaslighted by their superiors who dismissed legitimate news reports of this dire shortage as “fake news.” But the healthcare workers saw it firsthand and each time they donned the subpar masks they wondered if any help was on the way if this might be their final shift. But help had been outsourced. To Stewart and others. Help was working on a wing and a prayer. And there I was a passenger aboard a delusion floating over a nightmare.

The journey that day with Stewart would get yet more weird and disheartening. And his story would launch me off on a wild chase to catalogue the opportunism greed and incompetence that frustrated the American response to Covid-19 at every turn. It would take me to California Texas Ohio Colorado Chicago New York Pennsylvania and into secret warehouses stakeouts at industrial strip malls and for a moment into the cannabis industry. Some of the journey might have been funny if the consequences were not so dire.

As for Stewart I may never understand why he would do what he was about to do. Maybe it was arrogance. Maybe he sincerely believed he could pull it off. Maybe it was as he said an act of faith — a belief that will and a dash of providence might make him an overnight millionaire and a hero to America in its time of need. Such a feat deserves to be observed to be retold.

I wish I could have told that story but no this story is something worse. What began as journalistic curiosity about supply shortages and a quest to find answers for Americans who were dying or trapped in nursing homes and apartments would morph into a nearly two-year examination of America’s underlying conditions. This is the story of the bad guys of the Covid-19 era. It is the story of us. In the eyes and actions of many men I would get to know from April 2020 and into the fall of 2021 — it was mostly men — I saw an ugliness that hides beneath our national mask. I saw greed masquerading as entrepreneurial spirit selfishness as rugged individualism opportunism as patriotism recklessness as bravery. I saw hope as well and love but someone else can write that book. In reviewing thousands of records tracing the Covid-19 era I found confirmation of what many might have felt: Our obsession with unfettered capitalism hurt us every step of the way.

Long before the pandemic the national stockpile had been financially hobbled by partisan brinksmanship — prudence supplanted with political expedience. What money was left to prepare for a national emergency — hoarding masks ventilators gloves and more — had been tied up with profit-driven corporations. One company leveraged its monopoly on an anthrax treatment to exact ever-increasing prices on the federal government depleting a budget that could have been used to buy N95 masks. Ventilators machines that breathe for patients whose respiratory systems were decimated by the virus had run out not for a lack of planning but because of poor oversight of companies that place profit above all else. The small company the government hired to produce the machines had been purchased by a multinational conglomerate which increased prices and delayed production.

The Trump administration took belated action in spring 2020 and issued the first of nearly $40 billion in contracts for everything from masks to buildings to pharmaceuticals and test kits. The earliest deals were awarded under emergency measures without bidding. Various federal agencies would claim they vetted thousands of private contractors who emerged to reap the benefits of our devastation. But story after story would prove this was a lie. Records obtained through state public records laws the federal Freedom of Information Act and congressional inquiries would show contracts were handed out to anyone with an email address and the pocket change to register a company in their home state. Political connections got many companies to the front of the trough. In this deluge Trump lieutenants steered contracts to allies and untested companies wasting money and more important time. Similar deals were cut at the state and local levels.

The supply shortage was not a foregone conclusion. It had been predicted for many years under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The country was in deep trouble long before the case counts began to rise on the coasts in early 2020 yet there was a tiny window in which a few people tried to lock down supplies for hospitals before the profiteers could get them and hold us hostage. Subpar and counterfeit masks that claimed the same level of protection as an N95 but were in fact dangerous and ineffective flooded into this vacuum. The federal government flat-footed and making up rules on the fly tried to catch up and catalogue which masks could be used in hospitals and which were garbage. This ad hoc regulation was slow and often ineffective. What barriers did exist were overcome by creative mask brokers who discovered they could repackage poor-performing masks and sell them to hospitals anyway threatening healthcare workers the American people would at first praise and later abandon.

Efforts to stop the spread of the virus by closing nonessential businesses were undermined by entrenched capitalist interests and division-stoking politicians and the fringes to which they are captive. In Texas and elsewhere the sentiment that it was better to keep commerce going even during the most terrifying months even if it threatened American lives was an acceptable trade-off. As with the mad hunt for supplies the patchwork of states that favored opening their economies too soon versus those that chose science would cancel out any meaningful national response allowing a pandemic that could have lasted for weeks and months to become an era of intense division and despair.

Our crimes — against morality civility and the law — played out in the ubiquity of the 24-hour partisan news cycles on social media and in small-time schemes perpetrated by our neighbors. Testing already delayed by government bungling was further set back as FEMA hired a company that had formed that very week to deliver testing supplies to all 50 states and territories. The company’s founder had a documented history of fraud allegations against him and the company had no medical expertise or truly any expertise at all. Instead of delivering tubes I would find the company conspired to deliver unusable contaminated plastic mini soda bottles thrown together with shovels in a nondescript warehouse. The company got away with more than $10 million. Americans got screwed. Forget the money. This scheme and many others wasted time when time was being measured in body bags.

To keep businesses afloat and ensure income for tens of millions of Americans Congress passed the Paycheck Protection Program. The program would rush nearly $8 billion out the door much of it into the hands of unsavory actors who used the windfall not to support employees but to buy themselves sports cars jewelry homes and yachts. One man took taxpayers for more than $7 million and bought a mansion and a fleet of cars before absconding to Europe. When he was arrested he said his actions were permissible under the Trump administration and that the transfer of power to President Joe Biden had prompted him to flee. Meanwhile many businesses and employees that needed that relief waited months for help.

If there is a silver lining it was the rapid development of vaccines. They were scientific miracles yes but also the result of massive investments of taxpayer money and government resources over decades. Their development bestowed obscene riches on a few wealthy people who had made prescient investments to benefit from such chaos. Meanwhile taxpayers paid for much of their development most of their production and deployment and will continue to pay for booster shots and new shields against viral variants in perpetuity all to the enrichment of shareholders and company executives.

For all their promise and salvation the vaccines themselves were undermined by the preexisting and profitable machinery of misinformation. Those who had mastered the craft of profiting from medical quackery and lies sprang to action spreading fear about vaccines while promoting disproven or dubious treatments they packaged and sold to the detriment of the American people.

Covid-19 would render in high definition the contrasts of an inequitable nation. At the same time families waited in miles-long lines for groceries at food banks the pandemic economy created about 500 new billionaires. Overall U.S. billionaires saw their wealth surge 62 percent or $1.8 trillion. In contrast the relief package Congress passed to keep poor and middle-income Americans from poverty totaled just a little more about $2.2 trillion.

When the world shut down in early 2020 workers at meatpacking plants were deemed essential. Tyson Foods placed full-page ads in national and regional newspapers proclaiming “The food supply chain is breaking. We have a responsibility to feed our country. It is as essential as healthcare. This is a challenge that should not be ignored. Our plants must remain operational so that we can supply food to our families in America. This is a delicate balance because Tyson Foods places team member safety as our top priority.”

At the same time according to court records a Tyson plant manager in Waterloo Iowa organized a “cash buy-in winner-take-all betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many employees would test positive for Covid-19.” Whoever won the kitty should spend it on therapy.

Across the country hundreds of meatpacking plant workers many of them low-paid immigrants and refugees died from the virus and more than 50000 were sickened. The plants kept churning out meat. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration asleep at the wheel for much of the pandemic softened rules that allowed the plants to underreport deaths and the agency was slow to inspect facilities where workers died if it did at all.

In countless ways Covid-19 would bring the hypocrisy of our stated American ideals into focus. Unemployment skyrocketed yet the stock market rallied for those wealthy enough to have skin in the game. Millions of Americans couldn’t pay the rent but purchases of second homes spiked as the wealthy fled cities. The deep-seated fissures in our healthcare and education systems and physical infrastructure itself were laid bare as the virus took its outsized toll on poor people and communities of color.

For all we didn’t know about the virus it sure knew a hell of a lot about us. Even as I sat in disbelief aboard that private plane in April 2020 the first of many on-the-ground reporting missions during the pandemic I could not fathom just how bad it would become. Call it arrogance ignorance or American elitism — I won’t argue. But I hadn’t allowed myself to worry until that moment. Cynical as we investigative reporters can be I still held a sort of blind faith that America despite our current discourse was just better prepared. Always. We’d be fine. We would come together like in World War II.

But with each reporting trip this faith would diminish. And as the cases and the death counts rose and plateaued and rose again and the schemes and steady flow of profits continued to reveal themselves I came nearer and nearer to answering the central question our children and history will ask of us: How did the most advanced the wealthiest country in the world with just 4 percent of the global population at one point come to account for one in five Covid deaths and nearly a quarter of all cases worldwide?

It was the cost of doing business.

—————

With inflation at a 40-year high to start 2022 consumers are more aware of the rising food and fuel costs. In a recent earnings call Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts the retailer would hold the line on prices to continue growing its grocery share.

“During periods of inflation like this middle-income families lower-middle-income families even wealthier families become more price-sensitive and that’s to our advantage” McMillon said. “So we’ve been through this before and we run with inflation around the world all the time. But inflation is a different environment in the U.S. right now than it has been in recent times for sure.”

“Everyday low prices” is at the heart of Walmart’s business model and McMillon said merchants are having more talks with suppliers to mitigate inflationary pressures on the business.

Walmart did see same-store sales rise 5.6% in the fourth quarter. The company reported grocery comps increased by the high single digits in the period with sales growth and market share gains aided by slightly wider price gaps than pre-pandemic levels expanded digital offerings. Walmart was seen as taking market share in grocery in the fourth quarter ending Jan. 31.

To test price gaps in Walmart’s home market of Bentonville the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal conducted on March 30 a price comparison against Aldi and Dollar General. The comparison results show Walmart does not have the lowest price on at least 19 grocery and consumable staples. The shopping list included store brands and a few national brands. The basket included eggs milk bread bacon canned tuna frozen chicken canned green beans canned chili deli ham mayo peanut butter saltine crackers cereal trash bags laundry detergent toilet paper toothpaste aspirin shampoo and conditioner.

The Walmart basket of the 19 items cost $64.16 16% more than the same items at Aldi. The Aldi basket cost $55 and had the lowest prices overall on 16 of the items compared. Aldi was the low price leader overall saving a shopper $9.16.

Dollar General’s total basket cost was $62.55 after coupons which was 2.5% less than the Walmart basket but 13.75% more expensive than Aldi. The most significant price gap between the three discount competitors was for a gallon of 2% milk and a dozen large eggs. The milk at Aldi was $2.27 compared to $4.03 at Walmart and $4.25 at Dollar General. The eggs cost $1.43 at Aldi compared to $1.91 at Walmart and $2.95 at Dollar General. Black Forest ham for sandwiches also showed wide price gaps between Aldi and the other discounters. The 8-ounce store brand of ham costs $2.99 at Aldi whereas the Great Value ham in the same size costs $4.78. Hormel ham sold at Dollar General costs $3.98 for 8 ounces.

The price gaps were closer between the competitors on branded items such as Tide detergent Jif peanut butter and Honey Nut Cheerios. Aldi had a small price gap with Dollar General and Walmart on the 28-ounce jar of Jif Creamy Peanut Butter costing $3.98. The same item cost $4.15 at Walmart and $4.25 at Dollar General. The large Honey Nut Cheerios cost $3.49 at Aldi compared to $3.98 at Walmart while Dollar General had the cereal on sale for $3.50 with a 75-cent digital coupon. Other national brands such as Tide Crest and Hellman’s mayo showed tight price gaps between the competitors.

Simply Tide detergent was priced at 14.7 cents per load with the Walmart bottle costing $3.24 for 22 loads. The same product bottled for 20 loads costs $2.94 at Aldi the same 14.7 cents per load at Walmart. Dollar General had a digital coupon for the Simply Tide product which took the final cost down to $2.75 per bottle. The Dollar General bottle came out to 13.75 cents per load at the coupon price. Without the coupon the Dollar General price was $3.25 for 20 loads and more expensive than the other two retailers.

The large tube of Crest toothpaste was cheaper at Dollar General because of the $1 coupon. The large tube cost $2 at Dollar General $3 at Walmart and $3.12 at Aldi for 0.2 more ounces than sold at Walmart.

Pantene 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner cost $3.47 at Walmart for 10.4 ounces. That equates to 33.3 cents per ounce. A 12-ounce bottle at Aldi costs $3.79 which comes to 31.5 cents per ounce a slightly better value than the smaller Walmart bottle. For the best value Dollar General’s 17-ounce bottle of the same product costs $5 equating to 29.5 cents per ounce.

Frozen chicken was another area where Aldi beat Walmart. A 48-ounce bag of Great Value skinless boneless chicken breasts was $8.37 at Walmart and $6.99 for the same size bag of Kirkland’s chicken brand at Aldi. That’s a savings of 19.7%. Dollar General sold a smaller bag of chicken a Tyson Foods brand which cost $6.95 for 32 ounces.

Toilet paper and other nonedible consumables like trash bags were closer in price among the three retailers. Using the Great Value store brand at Walmart Aldi’s store brand and Dollar General’s store brand that each compares to Scott’s 4-roll package the cost was $4.88 at Walmart $3.99 at Aldi and $3 at Dollar General which had the best overall value. Walmart had the best value on store-branded large kitchen trash bags at $6.92 for 50 bags. The comparable item at Aldi had 40 bags selling for $6.49 and Dollar General sold similar bags for $7. The cost per bag at Walmart was 13 cents compared to 14 cents at Dollar General and 15 cents at Aldi.

Scott Benedict an executive at Rogers-based WhiteSpyder and a former Walmart buyer said it’s sometimes hard to tell if product quality is equal when looking at private brand products. He said Walmart has worked to improve its Great Value private brand quality. Aldi is also known for high-quality private brands.

Benedict agreed that Walmart might not have the lowest cost on a basket of goods on any given day. Still the retail giant does offer shoppers more variety various size packs and a broader assortment of many grocery items. Aldi and Dollar General offer a limited inventory because they operate smaller formats. Walmart also has the edge in online ordering and pickup convenience at no added costs. Aldi partners with Instacart and there are delivery costs with online orders. Dollar General also offers online order pickup through the retailer’s mobile app that allows customers to apply coupons at checkout a feature Walmart does not provide.

Benedict said the item pricing game takes constant attention and retailers like Dollar General will use coupons to stay competitive on certain items. He said Aldi is a deep discounter with limited assortments but they are stout competitors in dairy fresh food and other categories. He also said pricing is relevant to locality and the competition in a specific market.

The award is given to those students teachers and support staff who’ve made significant contributions to St. Paul’s School and their community. It is inspired by the verse:

“Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves they should do so with the strength God provides so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.” (1 Peter 4: 10-11).

Blanton taught at St. Paul’s Lutheran school for 31 years before retiring in 2010 at the age of 62. She attended Calhoun Community College and Southern Benedictine College which is now St. Bernard Preparatory School. Though she did not always want to be a teacher her first husband was a coach and teacher and she was inspired by him to do the same. She first attempted to get a job in the public school system because the Lutheran schools generally hired from Lutheran colleges.

Blanton was informed of a position at St. Paul’s by a neighbor. The church knew her and her family and was selected to interviewed with the school committee. She was hired in 1976 as a fourth-grade teacher. “I was blessed to be hired at St Paul’s. I’ve always been a Lutheran. I’m a member at Trinity Lutheran Church in Hanceville and was involved and taught Sunday school for years” said Blanton.

She keeps in touch with several of her older students who were in her first classes. “I get notes from some of them. I feel like I’ve had a good relationship with most of them.” The award is given for Blanton’s impact on her students and staff but she says “I feel like I’ve gained a lot more from them than I ever gave to them. It’s such a wonderful family atmosphere. I’ve gained tremendous assets from my teaching there.”

Mrs. Blanton will be honored at the 3rd Annual Alumni and Friends Dinner and School Auction at Terri Pines on May 14 2022. Presenting the award will be Linda Kress Self who was a student at St. Paul’s and taught alongside Mrs. Blanton. Self-stated “Mrs. Martha Blanton was my fourth-grade teacher at St. Paul’s. I remember her to be one of the most engaged teachers that I have ever had as a student. She truly wanted to see us succeed grow and become lifelong learners. She is also a wonderful Christian example and lives a life that makes me so grateful to know her and have her in my life.

She was also my mentor teacher when I began teaching at St. Paul’s in 1994. I can remember sitting down with her that first year of teaching and the inspirational heart to heart talk she gave me. I truly felt at home teaching with her because of the relationship she built with me in fourth grade. I am so blessed to have been able to be a former student and co-worker of Mrs. Martha Blanton.”

Paloma Arciniega is one artist chosen out of around 60 applicants to create a mural inside the office space on the theme “What does LA mean to you?”

“There’s a lot of artists in LA” said Arciniega putting the finishing touches on her mural. “LA is a dream maker but it’s also a dream crusher.”

Arciniega’s mural depicts three musicians showing not only the joys of music but also the despair that artists can experience in pursuing a career in the arts. For Arciniega her portrait of Swedish multi-instrumentalist Gunhild Carling gives the mural an ultimately triumphant message.

“I think it’s very powerful just as a woman the way she shows up in front of a band of all men every time and she’s just like [triumphant growl]!”

Arciniega said she was inspired seeing the other artists working around her creating their pieces which cover a wide range of topics cultural influences and techniques.

Silverstein Properties the New York-based real estate developer who took ownership of the U.S. Bank Tower in 2020 started the installation project. He has already been doing similar art projects in New York.

Melanie Navas of Silverstein Properties says the art installation is all part of revamping the building and connecting to the surrounding communities.

“Part of that was kind of reimagining what an office building means to people and that it can be a creative space” Navas said. “Like arts and culture and dance and music can all come together.”

The U.S. Bank Tower is a commercial office building housing law firms financial institutions and as Navas explained the average Angeleno has had little access to the view from the 72nd floor.

“It was really amazing to come up here on the top floor nonetheless and be able to paint and do their art up here” Navas said.

For Arciniega it has been an emotional experience creating work in a unique location along with other artists she respects.

The small business banking experience is currently fragmented and typically requires in-person interactions even for simple banking needs. This presents an opportunity for banks to overhaul their processes and capitalize on a pivotal moment to acquire new customers all while staying compliant with regulations. As things stand there are barriers to small businesses in acquiring financial services online.

Most traditional banks have limited online capabilities with digital applications serving primarily as customer inquiry and initial app intakes requiring banker follow-ups. A high number of traditional banks require an in-person consultation to open small and medium banking (SMB) deposit accounts and credit cards. Many banks that have enabled online account opening for small business customers have not invested beyond the account opening experience. The number of physical bank branches is on a steep decline.

It's been a tumultuous two years for international travel. Now countries are looking to welcome visitors; and this year is looking to be one of the biggest and best years in travel.

While it may seem under current conditions that international travel should be avoided at all costs or partially many Americans who've managed to save up enough are now eager to finally get away and spend their summer abroad. With an eagerness to travel and immerse themselves in a completely foreign culture roughly 65% of surveyed travelers stated that they will be spending more this year on international travel than they have in the last 5 years.

The tourism industry has already shown signs of recovery making a slow comeback in 2021 with roughly 15 million more international passenger arrivals than in 2020 according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. But this year is expected to look even bigger; even if the cost of travel is now a bit higher than what it was pre-COVID.

Ways To Save On Foreign Exchange Without Paying Massive Fees

It's an exciting time to finally be able to get back in the air and visit a destination that you've never experienced before and while the joys of traveling can come with a lot of planning booking and timekeeping — one aspect many travelers seem to leave until the very last minute is their foreign currency exchange.

Exchanging your cash before leaving for your holiday might not be on the top of your to-do list. With all the banking apps and services available why would it be necessary to go do foreign currency exchange?

These services and banking platforms have made our lives immensely convenient; helping to connect us to the globalized economy. However it's important to familiarize yourself with foreign exchange and how it works before you set off.

What is Foreign Currency Exchange?

Foreign currency exchange sometimes referred to as forex is the conversion of one base currency to another. For example if you're traveling from the United States your base currency will be the US Dollar or USD. If you're traveling to South Africa you'll need to convert your base currency (USD) into the country's quote currency (ZAR).

Usually the currency you already work within your origin country is always referred to as the base currency. While some countries may use the same type of base currency it's the same for most other instances. For example there are around 170 different forexes currently being traded in the world so it's important to know what currency your destination country uses.

How Does Foreign Currency Exchange Work?

We'll cover some of this a little bit down in the article. However it's important to get a basic understanding first. The process works by swapping or converting one legal tender to another. These legal tenders or forex are usually paired with one another for example USD/ZAR; USD/EUR; GBP/EUR. The exchange rate between each of these various pairs depends on global market fluctuations. Thus it's not always to say that you will get a 1:1 ratio for your exchange.

When you do a foreign currency exchange with a set amount you will receive the amount in the quote currency (or currency that you're converting to) based on the day and time of exchange. This is solely based on the exact time of exchange and how the forex market may have been trading at the time. For example the USD is almost 15 times more valuable than the South African Rand (ZAR). Meaning that for every USD$1 you exchange you will receive around ZAR15 in return. These calculations are simply based on average trading prices and market fluctuations.

With that you should have some basic insight into how foreign currency exchange works and why it's important. Next let's dive into the 5 ways you can save money on your international trip this upcoming holiday.

Exchange Your Cash Before You Leave

In our modern day it sounds almost ancient to have cash on hand when you're looking to travel. While this might not be the most modern way to do things having cash before you leave your origin country is the best thing you can do.

Before you can convert your dollars into another currency you will need to check what currency is being used in the country you're traveling to. In most cases some European nations will most likely use the Euro but that's not true for all of them. Not all Scandinavian countries use a universal currency or the Euro. Additionally the Australian Dollar is not the same as the American Dollar. It's best to research what the local currency is beforehand just in case.

Now exchanging cash before you leave is not only the best option it's also the most cost-effective option. When you exchange your USD at your local bank or forex exchange merchant there's a good chance you'll get the best possible value for your conversion.

Some banks offer anywhere between 70 to 100 different foreign currencies making it the most suitable and affordable option. More so most of the time banks might add a smaller commission percentage or nothing at all on the amount that you're exchanging into. Luckily now that everything is digital you can order your currency online by phone or book an appointment. Of course it's advised to first contact your local bank before ordering any currency and if you're in a rush or forgot to make the exchange you can always make use of a forex exchange merchant or Bureau de Change in your destination country.

Look for the Best Exchange Rate

As earlier explained the exchange rate is the amount of foreign currency you will get for every USD$1 you convert.

It's important to look for the bank or a financial merchant who will offer you the best exchange rate. Not only will you get more value for your money but it will help to save a bit on exchange fees.

If you don't manage to make the exchange before you leave you can make use of other means within your destination country. ATMs might be easily accessible but there are fees and withdrawal costs that come along with them. It's advised to make use of an ATM only when you're in dire need of cash or if there is no other method of foreign exchange available.

Note that when withdrawing cash from a foreign ATM the fees you are charged can either be from your bank or the foreign ATM issuer. It may be possible that your bank can have a flat fee per withdrawal. If you're able to withdraw from your local banks' ATM in a foreign country there's still a fee or cost attached for using an ATM out of network range. Usually your bank or foreign exchange merchant will offer you the best exchange rate while giving you the added benefit of security knowing that the money came from a trusted source.

Don't Use Foreign Exchange Kiosks or ATMs at The Airport

Steer clear of making use of foreign exchange kiosks or ATMs at the airport. While they may offer a sense of convenience it comes with a price. Some exchange kiosks are notorious for charging higher transaction and exchange fees than your bank or other forex merchants simply for being more convenient and easily accessible. While this might not be the case for every kiosk or ATM placed in an airport there's a slight chance that you'll end up paying roughly 20% to 30% more on your currency exchange.

While your bank may have given you ZAR1500 for your $150 the ATM or kiosk may now only give you ZAR1410 (or less) for the same $150 exchanged. This may not seem like a lot of cash at the time that you're losing. But with time the more you exchange the quicker it starts to add up. Some of these ATMs may always charge high transaction fees on international bank cards even those that claim to be ""fee-free"" or offer the best type of exchange deal you're better off exchanging your cashback home or simply keeping it on your credit or debit card.

As a tip: Try and avoid ATMs that are placed in high tourist areas while they may be there at the right place and perhaps at the right time you're bound to end up paying more on transaction fees and withdrawal costs.

Limit Using Your Credit or Debit Card

It's also possible that you can pay for your holiday abroad by using your credit or debit card. This is one of the best ways to travel; it secures your cash and you don't end up with hundreds of dollars worth of foreign exchange. While paying with either a credit or debit card some banks and financial institutions may offer a forex debit card which allows you to transfer cash into the account and make use of the card in the country you're traveling to. Depending on who you bank with you may be eligible for a forex card or you can simply arrange for your bank to activate your current account so that it can be used in a foreign country.

Yes it's possible that you can use your US bank card abroad but it does come with a catch. Some banks can charge anywhere between 1% and 3% transaction fees when using your bank card abroad. While this might not sound like a lot of cash right now when traveling this can easily add up. When using your credit or debit card abroad it's best advised to arrange with your bank beforehand as they will have more information on what the impending transaction fees might be and also how much your swipe or withdrawal limit may be.

In some instances banks may pause charges on your card while abroad and post you a bill once you've returned. There are a lot of small surprises that come with using your credit or debit card abroad. It's safe to say that while it's one of the more suitable options it's advised to read the fine print thoroughly or talk to your banker.

Avoid Dynamic Currency Conversion

Because our world is more globalized and digital than ever there's a chance you will come across dynamic currency conversion when traveling.

What is dynamic currency conversion you might ask?

In some places when paying for a meal or tickets by card the merchant's point of sale machine might give you an option to either pay in the local currency or perhaps in US dollars. While it may seem like the best option to pay in US dollars it's not always the case. Dynamic currency conversion does make the conversion a bit easier. However paying in the local currency is the best option you have. Always go with the local option there are hidden exchange rate fees and transaction costs involved. In some cases even both of these are charged at the same time. While it may seem obvious to work in USD educate yourself on the prices and the money before you leave.

There are however those instances where paying in USD might work out cheaper or it's perhaps the only option available. In this case you can select the option to pay in US dollars. If you choose to do this keep tabs on how often you're doing this to estimate fee charges.

Some Noteworthy Tip To Keep In Mind

Make use of foreign or international banking apps

Nowadays your bank might be able to offer a foreign exchange service that's preloaded on your banking app. If not make sure to check in with your bank before you leave.

These apps and platforms allow you to pay for expenses while on your trip. It's also a smarter and safer way to travel as you don't require carrying cash around.

International banking apps can also automatically exchange your cash before you use it. This way you'll have access to view the current exchange rate before doing a transaction.

Avoid Costs and Fees As much as possible

It's not at all possible to avoid transaction fees and withdrawal costs while traveling abroad as these are pretty standard but it is possible to minimize your exposure to them while traveling. That's why it's best advised to either exchange your cash before taking off. Another option is to get a forex credit or debit card from your local bank. These cards offer lower transaction fees and can be used in a variety of countries.

Notify Your Bank

If you're looking to travel soon it's advised to inform your bank in case of an emergency or if any suspicious activity is picked up on your bank account during your travels. Informing your bank about your travel plans can also help you find out more information regarding a few things; foreign exchange possible member discounts and rewards or any cards you might require.

Additionally the bank will also be able to inform you about your daily transaction and withdrawal limits. This is so that in case you run into a problem abroad you can increase it without flagging suspicious activity. It's best to inform your bank as to ensure your bank account can be used at your holiday destination.

The Bottom Line

Traveling comes with a lot of planning and foreign currency exchange should be one of your top priorities before leaving. Always make sure that you research the country that you're going to and see what the local foreign currency is. Try to avoid unnecessary costs and fees by exchanging your cash before you leave. This way you'll already have the cash in your hands when you land or in case of an emergency.

Simply working smarter with your foreign currency and most importantly enjoy your holiday.

The video was posted user @jubilee an account with 1.2 million followers whose mission is to create videos and form a “movement of empathy for human good.” As of Saturday the video received about 1.9 million views.

In the video the “ask me anything” interviewer asks the man who jubilee calls a “son of a billionaire” “How do you tip?”

The man Bobby Misner is the son of Tom Misner founder of the SAE Institute music school. Bobby is known for his life of fast cars beautiful girls and parties according to a 2019 article by Daily Mail. The Daily Mail reported that Tom is a billionaire.

“I think here (in the U.S.) there’s very much so this big tipping culture and a lot of the time I’m like—bruh like Uber Eats I’m not tipping. I’m sorry” Bobby says in the video.

Uber Eats drivers already get paid by the company he adds. Since he already has to pay taxes and delivery fees he says that adding a tip is too much.

“It’s like bruh I’m not made of money” Bobby says. “I’m not just like giving it out.”

The interviewer responds by trying to explain why tipping is important for delivery drivers. She says she once tried working for Postmates to see how it was and realized the drivers barely make minimum wage from the company.

“Right” Bobby says.

“I would suggest you can try doing an Uber Eats just to see what it feels like” the interviewer tells him.

Bobby’s comments sparked a debate among viewers. Several viewers called out his “I’m not made of money” comment.

“‘I’m not made of money’ sure” one viewer commented on the TikTok video.

“‘I’m not made of money’ son of a billionaire” another viewer commented.

Another viewer said “‘im not made of money’ u literally are.”

Some viewers said they always tip their delivery drivers despite having much less money than a billionaire’s son.

“I’m a lot less rich than that guy and I tip on Uber eats” one user said.

Another user wrote “i have like no money and i tip over 20% every time.”

“Are you telling me I tip more than the son of a billionaire?” another asked.

Other viewers said customers shouldn’t order delivery if they can’t afford to—or just won’t—tip.

“Don’t buy if you can’t tip. The audacity to try defending it is baffling” one TikToker commented.

“If you have enough money to order food to you home then you have enough money to tip” someone else said.

One comment read “The rich are the least empathetic ppl on the planet.”

The full Jubilee interview with Bobby Misner can be viewed on YouTube.

The Daily Dot reached out to jubilee via TikTok comment and to Bobby Misner via Instagram direct message.

An angry mum has attacked Uber for charging her £55 after her young son was sick in a cab on the way to hospital. Jessica Hunter says the 'clean-up fee' was taken from her account without warning.

He son Elijah aged three had been suffering seizures and was undergoing brain scans at Birmingham Children's Hospital. His mum had ordered a cab to take them for treatment from their home in Olton near Solihull.

But towards the end of the £10.50 fare journey Elijah was sick in the car. His mum says she cleaned it up using baby wipes with the Uber driver happy with her efforts.

Yet Jessica aged 29 a cleaner in a rehabilitation centre says she was later hit with a cleaning bill for the incident from Uber. It later refunded £40 after she complained.

Jessica told BirminghamLive: ""I explained to the Uber driver what had happened and that I had cleaned up the mess. He took a look and said he was happy. I have used Ubers many times and I have never had a problem before.

""But just over a week later I discovered £55 had been taken out of my account without warning. I was furious.

""I contacted Uber who said the amount taken was to pay for the cleaning of the cab after Elijah was sick. They then sent me a picture of a filthy cab there was no sign of sick as I had cleaned it up.

""In the end they paid me £40 back but kept £15 for 'cleaning services.' It really has left me with a sour taste in my mouth.""

Uber told BirminghamLive it would be investigating the incident. A spokesperson: “We are sorry that the rider had a poor experience and we are currently investigating what happened in this instance.

""For licensed drivers who use the app their vehicles are their place of work and any damage or mess can mean they are unable to continue working. When a driver claims a cleaning fee they are required to provide us with the details of the trip the passengers and the incident itself as well as photographic evidence and a validated cleaning receipt which our support team then investigates.""

The head of central operations of Uber India and South Asia was quoted as saying by the Economic Times that after listening to feedback from their drivers Uber has understood that the current spike in fuel prices is burning a hole in their drivers' pockets. To provide some relief Uber has decided to raise trip fares in cities such as Delhi-NCR and Kolkata by 12% and in Mumbai and Hyderabad by 15% respectively.

The Uber official told Economic Times that fuel price movements will be tracked going forward and further steps will be taken if necessary. The fare price hike will reportedly be limited to the car categories with auto rickshaw fares not being revised since they are dictated by states independently.

After cities like Delhi-NCR Kolkata Mumbai and Hyderabad Bengaluru is now facing the heat of raised fare charges although no official decision has been taken yet. Several users from Bengaluru took their woes on to Twitter with one user writing: “Cab fare charges are up by 1.5-2.5x yet Cab drivers refuse to switch on the ACs in Bangalore. What's going on @Olacabs @Uber?”

Meanwhile another one poked fun at the ride-hailing apps' practice of surging prices during rainy seasons writing: “In Bangalore if you throw a bucket of water from 20th floor. And before it will reach to the ground Uber and Ola will start showing surge pricing due to rain. #bangalorerains #uber #ola”

There have been similar fights against the fuel price hike in Bengaluru with the most recent one being Bengaluru's cab drivers starting a ‘no AC’ policy to bring forward the difficulties faced by Ola and Uber drivers amid the fuel price hike clubbed with low commissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY3liZXJzaGFjay5jb20uYXUvcmV2aWV3cy9vcHBvLWZpbmQteDUtbGl0ZS03OTktdWJlci12YWx1ZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPPO Find X5 Lite – $799 uber-value (smartphone review),"OPPO Find X5 Lite – $799 uber-value (smartphone review)

!– If there are no custom fields show nothing –>

OPPO reserve the name ‘Find’ for its flagship range. So by definition the $799 OPPO Find X5 Lite is a lower-cost flagship. Except that it is so different from its $1399 Find X5 and $1799 Find X5 Pro that I have trouble working out where it fits in the Find family.

To be clear apart from the Find name there is nothing in common with its bigger siblings. Is OPPO trying to cash in on the Find name? In fact the motherboard is used by the 2021 Reno 6 5G/Reno 7 SE 5G and OnePlus Nord CE 2 mid-range models. That makes more sense as Reno is the next sub-brand after Find. OnePlus is owned by OPPO and is one of the best-selling value brands in the USA.

So let’s position the OPPO Find X5 Lite. At $799 it is a mid-level 5G phone that competes with the Samsung Galaxy A53 and A73 (which we have on the testbed but it is too early to draw comparisons yet) except that OPPO has 256GB to Samsung’s 128GB.

The Find name means that it should get Android 12 13 and probably 14 yet it ships with Android 11. Let’s get on with the review.

New Deep-Dive review format

It is now in two parts – a five-minute overview for most readers and a separate 300+ line database-driven spec including over 70 tests to back up the summary. It also helps us compare different phones and features.

Other OPPO Find X5 Reviews:

First impression – another glass slab

OK this is where we get back to Glass slab territory. Apart from the laser direct imaging on the rear plastic cover it is just another Glass slab. Fortunately the back is attractive not a fingerprint magnet and offers quite a grippy surface.

There is a tri-camera and flash on the back a mono down-firing speaker below and OPPO’s usual right-side power and left-side volume rocker. It is fairly light at 160.6 x 73.2 x 7.81mm x 173g.

Screen – AMOLED 60 or 90Hz

It is a 2400×1080 20:9 8-bit/16.7 million colours 60 or 90Hz refresh AMOLED screen. We expect this type of screen for the price and it does not disappoint. It has 400nits and can play HDR/HDR10 content at up to 800 nits.

It is similar to the screens found in the Samsung Galaxy S22 and S21 FE so it is quite a good screen. It is not 1.07 billion colours like its bigger siblings.

Processor – mid-range

The 6nm MediaTek Dimensity 900 SoC is a mid-range processor offering all the power you need. It compares favourably with the Qualcomm SD730G.

Add to that 8 GB of RAM 256 GB of storage (most competitors have 128GB at this price) a dedicated microSD card slot and mountable external SSD storage and it is pretty good all around. The RAM can grab up to 5GB from storage swapping it as virtual ram (as Windows has done forever). We never found it wanting even under heavy loads.

The lack of throttling is excellent. It loses 11% after 13 minutes and then stabilises. Of course that reflects OPPO’s superior thermal management in all its phones.

Comms – Wi-Fi 6 AX NFC

It connects at HE40 600Mbps slower than the OPPO Find X5 and Pro at 1200Mbps and the Samsung Galaxy S22 at 2400Mbps. Still considering that most NBN connections are <100Mbps it is fine.

It has a USB 2.0 480Mbps connector so forget using it in cabled mode to connect to a TV – Chromecast is the go here.

Phone – city and suburbs

MediaTek modem technology is a step or three behind Qualcomm and as such it finds only one tower (out of four) albeit at a strong signal strength. It has all Australian 4/5G bands. It is a city and suburbs phone.

Battery – 65W high-speed charging

OPPO eats the competition’s lunch with a 65W fast charge (inbox) that fills the 4500mAh battery in about 35 minutes. The others take 1.5 to 2 hours. Add reverse cable charging and exceptional PC Mark 3 (typical battery use test) of 22+ hours and this is a phone you can charge every few days.

We recommend setting it to 60Hz refresh as the 90Hz reduces battery time by about 4 hours.

Sound – mono and not bad

OPPO uses an NPX Class-D amplifier and Digital Signal Processor for excellent low distortion mono sound. It is not fair to test mono speakers for fidelity but overall it has a pleasing sound signature.

OPPO claims it supports aptX (Qualcomm) but we suspect that is wrong as aptX is unique to Qualcomm. BT headphones can use SBC AAC LDAC and LDHC – all you need.

It actually has some high-bass but it focuses on clear vocals

Build – better than many

It has a Gorilla Glass 5 front plastic back and plastic frame. All fits together well and it is up to OPPO’s usual high standard. Add a two-year warranty (S22 Ultra 1-year) and excellent local after-sales support and you can see why it scores so highly in customer satisfaction ratings. There is no formal IP rating so assume IP52 – rain resistant.

Android 11 and ColorOS12

My only minor disappointment is that it does not ship with Android 12. Even so it should get Android 12 13 and maybe 14 and regular security patch updates.

It has all the Google Apps and OPPO substitutes (as OPPO cannot use Google Apps or services in China). These duplicate Apps like the too many commercial apps – AliExpress Amazon Booking.com Facebook LinkedIn O Relax PUBG Soloop TikTok etc. – are all uninstallable.

OPPO Find X5 Lite Camera

All smartphones use sensors made by Sony Samsung and lesser-known makers like OmniVision and GalaxyCore. Any primary sensor over 24MP uses binning (combining pixels) to produce an image of at least 8MP. Even the 108MP found on the Samsung S22 Ultra bins to 12MP. They all use AI to post-process images – the degree depends on the SoC power.

All have a primary wide sensor. Some have ultra-wide telephoto (and periscope) macro and depth (including Lidar) sensors. They all use a mix of plastic and glass lenses. So we can tell immediately if the camera is performing at or above spec.

This has a 64MP primary (bins to 16MP) 8MP Wide-angle and a 2MP Macro. The sensors are average for this price and return acceptable results.

It lacks the OPPO Find X5/Pro MariSilion X camera processor and the Hasselblad tuning.

Sample Shots

Day (well an overcast one): Primary sensor – the colours are slightly washed out and dynamic range is limited. Details in the shadows and highlights are OK. You can also shoot at 64MP which has more dynamic range but removes any AI.

Day: Ultra-wide. The 8MP camera does a good job but the colours and dynamic range differ from the primary sensor. There is a distinct loss of detail.

Macro: A 2MP macro shot means mean average detail and it is vital to hold the camera at 4cm and very still

Daylight zoom: It is good at 2x but 5x and 10x are noisy and lose detail

Office Light (<400 lumens: Good detail and slightly oversaturated colour. The level of Bokeh is adjustable.

<40 lumens: The standard (not night mode) takes acceptable shots but lacks details and colour depth. Night mode improves the detail and saturates the colour a little

Selfie: A 32MP (bins to 8MP) selfie ensures great single and group selfies with natural skin tones and details and a range of filters to enhance any image.

Video (we are not video experts): You can shoot at 4K@30fps on Primary (EIS Electronic Image Stabilisation) for a reasonably stable image. The processor cannot keep up with the post-processing needed and it is best to shoot at 1080p@30fps.

Overall the camera is fine for general use. It is not a patch on the OPPO Find X5 or Pro.

It is an OK shot but lacking a little dynamic range – sparkle

This is using the 8MP wide-angle and while the shot is OK it is also lacking in colour saturation and range

2X using the primary sensor. Pretty good detail and little noise

5X using the primary sensor – reasonable detail but the background has lost definition

10X – don’t go there

Macro uses a 2MP sensor. its critical to get the 4cm focal length right and hold very still

Office Lught 400 lumens – a great shot with good detail and average colours Bokeh is good (adjustable) but the forward detail suffers slightly

<40 lumens – its an OL shot but lacks details and colour stauration

Night mode does a great job bringing back details (see the text on the Word document) and more colour without introducing too much noise.

CyberShack’s view – The OPPO Find X5 Lite is a sheep in wolf’s clothing

I have been reviewing smartphones for over a decade. One of the first things I do is try to position them relevant to similar competition. It may be a Find by name but it is a Reno by nature. It is a great Reno – but a below-average Find!

At $799 the OPPO Find X5 Lite is a well-specified well-performing phone that holds its own against all comers. It is a tad more expensive than the $699 Samsung A53 (Exynos 1280 4/128GB) or the $799 Samsung A73 (SD778G 6/128GB) – but it offers more including more storage and a 65W SUPERVOOC charger in the box (Samsung has dropped chargers). You will have to wait for the Samsung reviews – before the end of April.

Post Script – Excitement factor

These reviews are technical – we test over 70 aspects of each phone and report objectively. But sometimes we forget the emotional aspects of the test device.

We have the OPPO Find X5 Lite OPPO Find X5 OPPO Find X5 Pro and OPPO A76 on the testbed. We also have other brands ranging from $199 cheapies to $2000 premium flagships.

I was excited to test the OPPO Find X5 Pro and it lived up to expectations – I like bright shiny expensive things. I initially had no such feelings about the Find X5 but as we tested there was a growing excitement – hey this is really good.

Once I had worked out that this is more a Reno than a Find my expectations settled down. It met or exceeded every expectation I have for a $799 phone.

Buyers should not be brand snobs and look at OPPO’s extensive features and value. It is very competent but not exciting.

Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.

Much of the world is dazzled by singer-actress-entrepreneur Ariana Grande. And I get it—her songs are infectious and she has the bubbly personality and gorgeous looks. Along with millions of others I’ve followed along and often supported much of her work from her six beloved albums to her stints on TV and in movies. So when Grande launched a cosmetics line R.E.M. Beauty I listened up. And as Reviewed’s beauty editor it’s my job to see if it’s any good.

What is R.E.M. Beauty by Ariana Grande?

Credit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser R.E.M. Beauty launched in 2021.

The line’s name correlates to our sleep cycles with the rapid eye movement (or R.E.M.) cycle being “the phase of sleep during which your most creative limitless and vivid dreams occur” as the brand site states. But also it’s a callback to Grande’s song “R.E.M.” from her 2018 album titled Sweetener in which she sings about not wanting to wake up from her dream-like romance. Now the beauty brand which launched in 2021 aims to “empower you with the tools you need to bring your most vivid limitless and creative dreams to life.”

The line available at Ulta Beauty comprises products for the eyes lips and face including powder and liquid eyeshadows lip glosses and lipsticks liquid and pencil eyeliners and highlighters. R.E.M. sent me several items to test and I used each on their own or together to create both bold and subdued makeup looks. After spending a few months testing these are my thoughts on the items ranked from best to worst—though I have to admit there isn’t one in the bunch that I plan to spend my own money on.

1. Midnight Shadows Eyeshadow Palette

Credit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser The Midnight Shadows Eyeshadow Palettes each contain three matte and three shimmer shades.

What it claims: These eyeshadow palettes come in three color combos each of which contains three matte and three shimmer shades. For a palette of six total colors you’ll pay $24. “Midnight Snack” consists of taupe blue and purple hues; “Babydoll” has tan terracotta and cocoa shades; and “Principessa” provides gold copper and black tones. Each one should offer easy blendability and “vivid color” on the eyes.

What it’s like to use it: I tested the “Babydoll” and “Principessa” palettes which between the two left me with plenty of warm earth tones to mix and match. One one occasion I used a creamy pink shade from “Babydoll” and a mid-tone brown from “Principessa” to recreate the look Ariana wears in the campaign photos. Otherwise I used shades from both palettes and blended a warm light brown into my crease and complemented it with a shimmery gold bronze or terracotta shade on the rest of my lid to punch it up. That said if you only bought one color combo you'd have enough complementary shades to choose among for creating a variety of looks.

Regardless of the colors I used the eyeshadows were easy for me to pack onto the lid and blend using makeup brushes from Sephora. I preferred to apply the shimmers with my fingers (a typical practice for me) to prevent from dulling the sheen they can provide. The palm-sized slim palettes are great for storing and travel too. If there’s a color combo you think you’ll wear every day (Principessa for me) you’ll be pleased with the travel-friendly packaging.

2. On Your Collar Matte Lipstick

Credit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser The On Your Collar Matte Lipsticks offer a matte look but a moisturizing feel.

What it claims: This lipstick which costs $19 a tube claims to have an “ultra-smooth” formula that’s long-lasting and comfortable on the lips despite its matte finish. It comes in six nude colors: “Tiramisu” (mauve) “Drive-In Movie” (rose) “Wine N Dine” (chestnut) “Roller Skates” (peach-pink) “Bubbly” (pink) and “Twilight” (cocoa).

What it’s like to use it: On Your Collar soared toward the top of my list after trying the shades “Drive-In Movie” and “Roller Skates” because they are exactly as described. The formula feels pillowy soft gliding onto the lips and the finish is matte but doesn’t emphasize any dryness—an issue I have with other zero-shine products. The colors appear pigmented meaning one swipe on each lip is all I need for a transformation. After application I can still rub my lips together without any pilling or discomfort also unlike other matte lippies.

The only downside to these for me is the overpowering vanilla scent. The actual fragrance is pleasant but I could do without it given that it sits right under my nose. Luckily it dissipates—or I become numb to it—after some wear time and you should only need to reapply it once or twice a day aside from after eating or drinking.

3. Midnight Shadows Matte Liquid Eyeshadow

Credit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser The Midnight Shadows Matte and Lustrous Liquid Eyeshadows each come in a range of tones.

What it claims: These matte liquid eyeshadows come in a squat tube with a doe-foot applicator for $16 each. They claim to have a pigmented waterproof and crease-resistant formula that gives the skin a smoother appearance. They are available in 10 pink and tan shades ranging from “nude cream” to a “deep brown.”

What it’s like to use it: Any ad for a liquid eyeshadow formula bills it as an easy one-and-done swipe of color on the lid. But to me tapping a powder onto my eyes with a finger or brush is easier than swiping on a cream and trying to blend it as it dries. My own bias aside I thought these were easy to work with as far as liquid shadows go. The two shades I used “NVM” (taupe) and “BRB” (mauve) showed up well and felt creamy enough to blend across my eyelid. A single light tap of the doe-foot applicator imparted plenty of formula especially if I only wanted to place the shade in the outer corner of my eye to add dimension. Using only my fingers to blend I could diffuse the eyeshadow upward without any fuss to avoid a harsh line on my pale skin where the pigment stopped. These matte shades also worked fine with the powder eyeshadows if I wanted to layer on a color from one of the palettes. If you’re interested in trying liquid eyeshadows these are a solid choice but powders will always seem easier to me.

4. Practically Permanent Lip Stain Marker

Credit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser The Practically Permanent Lip Stain Marker brings pigment to the lips without texture.

What it claims: With a weightless feel the Lip Stain Marker $16 claims to deposit color onto the lips with a natural-looking finish. It comes in four colors: “Booked N Busy” (mauve wine) “Miss Berry” (cool berry) “Popular” (strawberry pink) and “Full Out” (raspberry red).

What it’s like to use it: This lippie is appropriately named as it looks—and even smells if you ask me—like a slim marker and leaves a tint on the lips without a discernible texture or matte or shiny finish. The shade “Booked N Busy” darkened my light pink lips to a subtle plum hue that’s noticeable but not too bold. When applied on bare lips the formula felt tacky when I rubbed my lips together but it was more comfortable paired with a lip balm. I like this marker particularly because it’s low-fuss but it didn’t “wow” me. But if I’m going to wear something on my lips I’d prefer a moisturizing formula that conditions my lips while depositing color at the same time.

5. Midnight Shadows Lustrous Liquid Eyeshadow

Credit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser Ariana Grande's R.E.M. Beauty references the singer's 2018 song.

What it claims: The Lustrous versions of the liquid eyeshadows have the same pigmentation and crease-resistant claims—and the same $16 price—as the matte alternatives but impart a shimmer finish. The 11 colorful shades range from “Lab Coat” (iridescent white) to “Milky Way” (metallic teal) to “Telescope” (silvery black).

What it’s like to use it: These were not as easy to work with as the matte liquid shadows. I had the shades “Fembot” (iridescent pink-blue) “Comet” (gold) and “Lava” (deep copper). All three shades looked stunning upon initial application but as I blended them out the color and shimmer dulled. And while they blended fine with the matte liquid shadows albeit with the dull outcome they looked patchy and unwearable if applied over powdery eyeshadows. Ideally you could use these to add a touch of sparkle to the center of the lid despite the eyeshadow look (and formula) you’re already wearing but that’s not possible with these. You either need to wear them alone or with the other liquid shadows and even then you may see a reduction in shimmer and color particularly with the lighter tones.

6. At The Borderline Eyeliner Marker

Credit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser The At The Borderline Eyeliner Marker claims to be ultra black and smudge-proof on the eyes.

What it claims: This $19 liquid eyeliner claims to last for 48 hours with its waterproof smudge-proof formula. It’s available in one color “Midnight Black.”

What it’s like to use it: I have a hard-and-fast rule about removing my makeup before I go to bed so I did not test the 48-hour claim this liner makes but it didn’t budge at all while I was wearing it and took some rubbing to remove it with my Garnier Micellar Water and a cotton round. Claims aside I did not like the eyeliner at all. I’m out of practice with liquid eyeliner but this one did not make picking up the old trick any easier. The tip of the felt liner is too flexible which caused me to create a much thicker wing than I wanted.

What do I like about R.E.M. Beauty?

Credit: REM Beauty / Reviewed / Jessica Kasparian I attempted to recreate Ariana Grande's look using REM Beauty.

The outer space theme that threads throughout the branding including some of the packaging and product names is playful and fun. I can see how it may come across as gaudy to others and I would agree if the products were bulky or oversized to incorporate the theme but each item fits well in a vanity or makeup bag and would not cause anyone to glance at you funny if you were to break out your lipstick in public. Together the visuals and makeup give a whimsical feel to the brand that make it more enticing to me as a consumer.

What do I dislike about R.E.M. Beauty?

Credit: Reviewed / Jessica Kasparian I used the REM Beauty products to create a subdued makeup look.

Unfortunately I was not overly impressed by any product I tested from the brand. Sure I liked some of them and they did what they claimed to but they didn’t seem innovative or great enough to replace anything else already in my makeup routine. Someone who is a major fan of Grande may disagree with me. But as far as celebrity beauty brands or new makeup launches go this one didn’t dazzle me.

Should you try R.E.M. Beauty by Ariana Grande?

Credit: REM Beauty If you're a fan of Ariana Grande you may adore R.E.M. Beauty.

Whether R.E.M. Beauty is worth it to you depends on your dedication to Ariana Grande. If you just need to restock your lipstick or liquid eyeliner I don’t think you need to go out of your way for the brand. But if you can sing every word to “Positions” forward and backward maybe you’ll be happy to just own a piece of the singer’s creative endeavor.

And because the grass is always greener on the other side as soon as my mane hit my middle back I got the itch for short hair again — typical. The slew of cute wavy Amélie-like haircuts hitting my IG feed were too much to resist. Also this time around I was prepared to approach my chop differently with some pro tips and an arsenal of the best products for a perfect French bob.

As I sat in the salon chair with mountains of my long strands at my feet I watched my go-to stylist Stefanie Luna work her magic on my full type 2B hair. She explained that the key to getting that Parisian effortlessly wavy bob was to follow a less-is-more policy. She spritzed a little here dabbed a bit there and gently blow-dried my mane with a diffuser leaving it partially damp so the rest could air-dry. Perfection. My natural waves framed my face nicely running imperfectly parallel to my jawline. My wispy bangs hung with ease but not quite as lazily as curtain fringe.

Now for context my pre-COVID years with short hair saw me taking every hot tool under the sun to my hair curling or straightening to get my bob to behave and look well perfect. The thing about a French girl bob is that the more work you do the less natural the style looks. I accepted this challenge.

Now about four or five months since I took the plunge I’ve got the look down to a science. A science that takes me all of 10 minutes to prep and style — and lasts me about three days (sometimes four!). Ahead take a look at the steps and products that keep my curly bob looking so good I may never go back to long hair again.

The celebrity hairstylist was behind Megan Fox's wet hair look at the 2021 VMAs is part of the Kardashian-Jenner glam squad and has created looks for the likes of Lori Harvey Jennifer Lopez and Madonna.

It goes without saying that some of Fitzsimons' high-profile clients get their hair styled frequently which means they need to go above and beyond with maintenance if they want to keep their hair looking and feeling healthy. In fact he sees some of them on an ""almost daily basis"" he tells Shape.

The number one piece of advice Fitzsimons gives to those clients — and anyone else who grills him about how to have healthy hair — is to never skip heat protectant before using hot tools. ""You can do all the in-between care in the world but if you are frying your hair with hot tools it's going to be too late by the time you try to repair the damage later"" he says. That's because heat can break hydrogen bonds in hair which can leave hair more fragile and prone to breakage.

And after you've applied the protectant you're also going to want to resist the urge to crank up the temperature. ""One of the most common factors that prevent people from achieving strong full and shiny hair is using heat tools on a temperature that is way too hot"" says Fitzsimons who created an eponymous hair-care line that launches at Ulta today. ""Having heat all the way up on a blow dryer or a heat styling tool is not necessary to achieve a look and it really damages the strands.""

If you're already diligent about heat protection you can move on to some supplementary steps that Simons recommends for promoting hair health. A lot of people make the mistake of getting ""super aggressive"" with their hair when towel drying it he shares. (ICYDK your hair is extra fragile when wet since the cuticle layer opens up and strands become stretched out. They are more prone to breakage in this state.) Swap your bath towel for a microfiber or t-shirt towel — which have a less rough texture than traditional towels — and squeeze the moisture out of your hair instead of rough drying he suggests. Your diet also factors into the health of your strands he adds. (If you're curious salmon chickpeas and eggs are a few of the best foods for hair growth according to dietitians.)

Lastly adding a weekly hair mask or treatment to your routine can take your hair health to its highest potential says Fitzsimons who developed his take on the ultimate nourishing treatment for his own range. ""The best product from my line that someone can use if they want to keep their hair as healthy as possible while also addressing damage would be the AF1 Repair Leave-in Conditioner"" he says (Buy It $14 ulta.com). ""It contains ingredients such as ceramides hydrating castor oil glycine and edulis seed oil that help detangle repair strengthen and increase shine on all hair types.""

To recap in Fitzsimons' view minimizing heat damage should be your top priority if you're after strong healthy hair. Adopting a gentle towel-drying method eating a nutritious diet and applying occasional hair treatments will earn you extra credit. For those with thinning hair try using a hair serum like Luseta Biotin and Collagen Hair Growth Serum to stimulate new hair growth and repair existing locks.

How to Shop for Makeup Brushes

The majority of the best makeup brushes today are synthetic because over the last decade many brands such as have shifted toward clean beauty and have switched over to using synthetic materials. Synthetic brushes are highly effective products that don't break the bank while also being cruelty-free — making them a win-win for us.

Celebrity makeup artists and Emma Peters of AlephH Beauty agree that synthetic brushes have some pretty great benefits for the everyday person. “In recent years synthetic brushes have made quantum leaps and have been developed to completely mimic animal fibers even down to having a cuticle and tip which allows for better pick up of product” says Peters who has 30 years of pro artistry experience. Unlike natural hair brushes synthetic bristles are compatible with all formulas of makeup like liquids creams and powders.

According to Patinkin it's important to note that synthetic brushes take a little longer to wash and dry than natural brushes.

After several years of building my collection here are the best makeup brushes that are available on your favorite sites including everything from Amazon to Sephora. Some of these brushes have been staples I've been using for years while others are more recent discoveries that I gravitate toward time and time again.

The February 2022 statistics showed a promising recovery of the air cargo industry globally. While the demand in terms of cargo tonne-kilometres (CTK) augmented by 11.9 percent in comparison to February 2019 it rose up by 2.9 percent since February 2021.

On 11th April the Air Council International (ACI) World released its world airport rankings along with the statistics showing that global air cargo went up by 124 million metric tonnes i.e. 3.5% in 2021 in comparison with the numbers in 2019. On the same page the top cargo airports lead this growth in numbers with 15% more cargo handling than 2019.

Air cargo volumes at the top 10 airports representing collectively around 25% (34.2 million metric tonnes) of the global volumes in 2021 gained 12.4% in 2021 year-over-year (or 15.0% vs. 2019 results). The gain can be attributed to the continued increase in demand for online consumer goods and pharmaceutical products.

Let us take a look at the top 10 cargo airports in terms of global business handling.

Hong Kong International Airport

The current COVID-19 restrictions have rendered Hong Kong unable to function as an international cargo hub with its full glory and IATA says that the airport will be pushed off the list along with being difficult for it to recover. Though this will most probably impact Hong Kong’s position in the 2022 statistics but for the year that just went by Hong Kong retained its position at the top of the list for busiest cargo airports. In 2021 it processed a total cargo volume of 5.02 million metric tonnes which was 4.5% more than that in 2019 and 12.5% more than 2020 values. Similarly it was also the top airport to process international freight valuing to 4.98 million metric tonnes which is 12.8% more than 2020 and 6% more than 2019.

HKIA expedites clearance by providing integrated Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) linkage between the eight major air cargo operators and the Customs & Excise Department. It has also been fully equipped to serve as the preferred gateway in Asia for transporting COVID-19 vaccines to global destinations by leveraging its excellence in cold-chain infrastructure pharmaceuticals handling and extensive air network at an advantageous geographic location.

Memphis International Airport

Memphis Airport is at the second position again after briefly holding the top spot in 2020. It handled total cargo volume of 4.48 million metric tonnes which was 3.6% more than 2019 but 2.9% less than 2020. It did not make to the list of top airports on the basis of handling international freight.

FedEx is Memphis International Airport’s most prominent air cargo operator with around 400 flights per day and handling around 180000 packages per hour. Cargo East features approximately 1.4 million square feet of ramp area. The facility includes more than 36000 square feet of building space and features a high level of security cold storage and hazardous materials storage as well as business-friendly lobbies reception areas front office administration and management spaces. Short-term commercial building space (4000 – 200000 sq. ft) is also available for lease in the airport area.

Shanghai Pudong International Airport

Shanghai Pudong International Airport has trained 3rd spot by handling 3.98 million metric tonnes of cargo i.e. 9.6% more than 2019 and 8% more than 2020. It is also at the 3rd position for processing 3.24 million metric tonnes international freight 14.9% more than 2019 and 9.9% more than 2020.

Shanghai Pudong Int’l Airport Cargo Terminal Co. Ltd. (PACTL) is one of the major cargo hubs in China and a Sino-German venture found in 1999. On the basis of IATA Standard Ground Handling Agreement it offers services like Cargo and mail handling Special cargo handling (DG VAL AVI etc) Document handling Cargo tracing ULD pallet / container handling Customs control etc. They boast of a cool chain infrastructure Bulk cargo operating system strong room live animals room and much more as a part of their air cargo infra.

Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport

The Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport comes next with 3.55 million metric tonnes cargo handling which is 29.5% more than 2019 and 12.6% more than 2020. It hold the 7th position in International Freight handling processing 2.24 million metric tonnes of freight in 2021 25.5% more than 2019 and 9.8% more than 2020.

Air carriers can create new opportunities for global cargo logistics and integrated alliance partner networks by taking advantage of expanded cargo transfer rights at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC). Since January 2004 the law permits air cargo to or from a foreign country to be transferred to another airline in Alaska without being considered to have broken its international journey. For air carriers ANC is less than nine hours by air from 90 percent of the industrialized world. Its liberalized air cargo transfer rights and location allow for both cost and operational efficiency.

Seoul Incheon International Airport

Next in the list is the Seoul Incheon International Airport handling 3.33 million metrics tonnes of cargo in 2021 20.4% more than 2019 and 18% more than 2020.

The airport was constructed and opened for business in 2001 to share the demand for air transport in the 21st century and to serve as a hub airport in Northeast Asia. The value of goods exported and imported via Incheon International Airport for the past two decades is estimated at USD15 trillion or some nine times South Korea’s gross domestic product in 2020. Exports and imports handled at the airport amounted to nearly 34% of 2020’s total trade value as it handled high-price products such as semiconductors and medicines.

Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport

Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport handled 3.05 million metric tonnes of cargo in 2020 placing it at the 6th position in the list of world’s busiest cargo airports.

Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport

At the 7th position in the list is the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport for handling 2.81 million metric tonnes of cargo in 2021 28.9% more than 2019 and 20.7% more than 2020. It also went up to the 6th position for international freight handling with 2.79 million metric tonnes in 2021 going up by 29% since 2019 and 20.2% since 2020.

It is operated by the Taoyuan International Airport Corporation. In 2016 it was ranked the best airport for its size in the Asia-Pacific region by Airports Council International. It is an important regional trans-shipment center passenger hub and gateway for destinations in Asia.

Los Angeles International Airport

The Los Angeles International Airport at the 8th place in the list of busiest airports in the world handled 2.69 million metric tonnes cargo in 2021 28.7% more than 2019 and 20.7% more than 2020. It is also not present in the list of airports handling most international freight.

More than 1000 flights depart and arrive every day carrying cargo and more than half of the air cargo at LAX arrives and departs in the bellies of passenger aircraft. The most exported air commodity in terms of tonnage from LAX is vegetables fruit and nuts with 15.1% of the total weight.

We booked this property for five days during a Canada/Montana trip in Sept/Oct 2022. We had a fantastic time. The property owner Brett replied quickly to the booking request and he ensured we were all set as we were about to arrive as well as checking in with us mid-stay. The house was outstanding and had a bit of everything – great view of Flathead Lake wonderful floor plan and the furnishings/decor/art all fit perfectly with the setting and the house design.Although our trip only consisted of only my son and me I dare say a very large family or a group of several friends would have well more than ample room due to the many bedrooms various indoor/outdoor sitting areas and the second kitchen in the separate wing of the house. We made good use of the boathouse and the area on the lake shore as well and spent many hours kayaking along the lake. The water is shallow well out from the shore (can see the bottom) so I wouldn’t be skittish at all about letting a young child kayak along the shore.We were entertained by groups of deer that would graze in the yard each morning and late afternoon plus it was a great spot for bird watching considering the variety of birds and geese.In past years we booked a different properly on Flathead Lake. It was sold and no longer available. We didn’t think that house could be topped but this property has quickly become our favorite.

We had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful home last week. Wonderful Family Vacation! Views are amazing! If I could give it six stars I would!

We had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful home last week. Wonderful Family Vacation! Views are amazing! If I could give it six stars I would!

As good as the photos are the house and setting is even better in real life. Lots of rooms to spread out in for small group gatherings and spacious big rooms for meals. The spices and olive oils in the kitchen engaged the chefs the little girls loved the atmosphere go the bunk room. Washer & Dryer were fantastic! The boat hoouse was so cool and the SUP and kayaks added to the fun.Try it you won’t be sorry.

The Rookery is a dream! We didn’t want to leave. The fully-stocked house and grounds are gorgeous. There is charm in every room inviting you to relax and enjoy. We had three generations gathered together and each one took full advantage of quiet reading areas lake play indoor and outdoor games and breathtaking views. My kids explored the bay on kayaks and paddleboards swam played “king of the log” and hunted for rocks along the coast. Nights are for bonfires and taking in the incredible sky views as the sun set. While there (early July) we had a front row seat observing a robin coach her babies out of the nest watched a deer and her fawn have breakfast every morning and listened to numerous bird varieties sing out in the grasslands. You can easily walk to downtown Bigfork for coffee lunch or shopping. If you are a runner there is a great four-mile loop through the neighboring golf course.Brett the owner is attentive and excited for you to have a great time; Shane the caretaker was available and super nice to work with. You will LOVE this place.

(Ellen Schmidt/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @ellenschmidttt

The family of a Las Vegas man who was denied health insurance coverage for a lung cancer treatment then later died said Friday they hope a $200 million civil verdict issued by a Clark County jury against their health insurance provider prompts significant change.

“Maybe this won’t happen to the next person” Sandy Eskew wife of the late Bill Eskew said Friday. “Maybe they will change the way they do things. They just can’t be doing this. They don’t know more than the doctors. It’s just wrong.”

Bill Eskew’s loved ones and his family’s two attorneys Matthew L. Sharp and Doug Terry said Eskew’s health issues started in summer 2015. He was playing golf with his son and a friend in northwest Las Vegas when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his arm upon hitting his first shot of the day.

“He said ‘I think I dislocated my elbow’ ” his son William Eskew Jr. recalled.

“He started sweating” his son said. “He was in pain. I ran and got my truck I drove it down. I got him in the truck and I rushed him over to the hospital.”

What Bill Eskew thought was a dislocated elbow however turned out to be far worse.

“They took X-rays and they said ‘No it is a pathologic fracture from lung cancer’ ” Sandy Eskew said. “We did not know he had lung cancer. It was a nightmare.”

Bill Eskew was committed to fighting for his life but around the same time the family’s health insurance provider announced it would no longer be offering private health insurance. So the family had to find a new provider by Jan. 1. Sandy Eskew took a third job to pay roughly $1100 a month for a policy with Sierra Health and Life. She informed an insurance broker before the policy was secured that Bill had lung cancer and that the family was interested in pursuing a treatment known as proton therapy if he was a candidate.

The proton therapy treatment ultimately was recommended by Eskew’s doctors at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas because it can target the location of the cancer Terry said while causing less damage to a patient’s healthy tissues. Despite the recommendation the coverage was denied by Sierra Health.

”He was devastated” Sandy Eskew said. “He couldn’t understand why an insurance company would know more than his doctor. … He would ask me that question every day.”

The family said they had no choice but to proceed with another type of radiation treatment which caused major damage to Bill’s esophagus. What followed was a year of suffering because Bill could not swallow food or water without immense pain. Bill died in 2017 roughly a year after his treatment started.

“It was awful” said Bill’s daughter Tyler Eskew. “We watched him wither away.”

Provider to appeal

Sandy Eskew said she had inquired about her new health insurance policy prior to securing it.

“They knew I was looking at proton therapy if he was a candidate” Sandy said.

After her husband’s death she hired her attorneys to find out how Sierra Health could have denied the coverage. Sharp and Terry said they filed a lawsuit then learned that Sierra Health had what Terry called a corporate medical policy that dictated it would not cover proton therapy for lung cancer claiming it was not medically necessary.

“Sandy did not know about this when she bought the policy” Terry said.

The family sued in 2019 and won an initial $40 million verdict this month in District Court in Las Vegas. The civil jury then awarded another $160 million in punitive damages against Sierra Health in the courtroom of District Judge Nadia Krall.

Sierra Health is a UnitedHealthcare company which is owned by UnitedHealth Group. The company plans to appeal a spokeswoman said.

“We are disappointed by the jury’s verdict” UnitedHealthCare spokeswoman Maria Gordon Shydlo said in an email. “The verdict and damages awarded do not reflect the facts of the case or the laws that apply here” she said.

Tyler Eskew said her father was a loving man who was all about family. He cherished his grandchildren and enjoyed living in Las Vegas. She and her brother said they hope that the family’s litigation leads to change at Sierra Health.

“That’s why you get insurance” Sandy said. “So you can have peace of mind. They are supposed to take care of you.”

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group (WBG) held the Civil Society Policy Forum from April 4 to 15 ahead of the organizations’ 2022 Spring Meetings to be held in Washington D.C. In this context a coalition of organizations fighting for public healthcare services took the opportunity to raise the alarm about the privatization of health.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the WBG increased private investment in healthcare. This is despite the fact that in many countries privatization of healthcare has resulted in the commercialization diminished quality and limited access to healthcare.

During the session “The World Bank Group’s Investments in Private Healthcare Provision: What Implications for the Right to Health?” panelists drew attention to the repercussions of privatization.

Commercialization leads to two-tiered healthcare

As the private sector arm of the WBG the International Finance Corporation (IFC) plays a major role in development. Marco Angelo global health advocate at Wemos noted how IFC investments in healthcare increased during the period from 2017 to 2021. But although IFC projects focus on improving quality and availability of health services and products Wemos found that only one out of 88 projects mentions equitable access as an expected development impact. Angelo emphasized: “while the IFC investments that go to the manufacturing and supply of healthcare products have the potential to strengthen health systems the IFC also invests in areas whose contribution to Universal Health Coverage and specifically equitable access is less likely.”

Rossella De Falco program officer on the right to health at the Global Initiative for Economic Social and Cultural Rights (GI-ESCR) shared findings from GI-ESCR reports on Kenya and Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Nigeria the gradual commercialization of healthcare services since the mid-1980s has created a dual system of care in which access is determined by socioeconomic status and wealth—health is a commodity not a right. In both Nigeria and Kenya the GI-ESCR report concludes access to COVID-19 treatment testing and vaccines is driven by such inequity. Moreover many private facilities overcharge issue fake tests or use expired reagents for testing while underfunded public healthcare services remain unable to meet the demand for care.

Allana Kembabazi from the Initiative for Social and Economic Rights decried the IFC’s direction of money towards for-profit healthcare models expressing concerns about an apparent dichotomy within the World Bank’s institutions. “One arm of the Bank is working to eradicate poverty while another arm the IFC is contributing to it by promoting private investments in healthcare” Kembabazi said. “We know that out-of-pocket payments and expensive health services result in health inequalities so it is hard to understand why the World Bank would push these models.”

Inadequate funding and neoliberal arguments undermine public health systems

WBG panelist Andreas Seiter Global Lead for Private Sector in the World Bank’s Health Nutrition & Population Global Practice observed that private healthcare is in demand and paid for by citizens who can afford it particularly in countries where public health services delivery is weak. He agreed that for-profit health care if left alone can lead to inequality. Baba Aye of Public Services International highlighted that the problem is not an inherent weakness of public health systems instead the problem is inadequate funding and ideological arguments against public health.

There are clear ways in which entities such as the WBG and IMF can support and invest in increasing healthcare resources while strengthening public services including offering more support for larger public investment in health.

GI-ESCR’s reports recommend that both Kenya and Nigeria increase budget expenditure on healthcare to at least 15% in line with the Abuja Declaration. These governments should ensure universal access to health insurance reverse current prioritization of private sector engagement in healthcare and invest in strong quality public healthcare systems for all.

Civil society has also identified specific areas of concern where private sector investments and interventions in global health pose significant risks. To address these risks STOPAIDS developed a set of principles based on those areas of concern with regard to engagements wherein “aid is used to fund for-profit private sector actors to contribute to global health goals and where there is partnership or engagement between public and private actors to achieve specific health goals and advance the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agenda.”

Panel moderator James Cole of STOPAIDS presented those principles which state that private sector engagement in global health could be acceptable if it didn’t undermine public healthcare; was patient-centered and driven by social accountability for health rather than based on commercial interests; had a demonstrated public health impact which is evidence-based and promotes equitable access; has strong transparency and accountability mechanisms in place; and promotes human rights. Finally the STOPAIDS principles warn that entities such as the WBG should not promote private sector investment in health in countries where there is no effective regulation of the private health sector.

Entities such as the WBG and IMF as well as governments should heed these calls from voices on the ground and civil society around the world to enable meaningful progress towards realizing the right to health for everyone.

However the appointment has drawn criticism from Labor who said her appointment would mean cuts to Medicare.





Senator Ruston who is currently the social services minister along and women's safety minister will replace Greg Hunt who is retiring from politics.



""Anne has demonstrated the stakeholder management the financial skills but most important having a big heart to be able to deal with the many issues that you need to deal with in the health portfolio"" Mr Morrison said during a media conference outside the Children's Hospital in Westmead Sydney.





""I think she'll make a fine successor to Greg should the Australian people wish to return us to government on 21 May.""



Senator Ruston said it's an ""absolute honour"" to be given the Coalition's health portfolio should it win re-election.





“I follow in big footsteps and big shoes ... a man who will be recognised into the future as the greatest health minister this country has ever had"" she said.





Earlier on Sunday Liberal frontbencher Jane Hume threw her support behind the appointment.





""I am so pleased for her [Ms Ruston]. She is a highly qualified and highly experienced member of our cabinet"" she told Sky News' Sunday Agenda program.



""She has dealt with the portfolio in social services as a very successful minister there dealing with what's important to millions of people's lives. So I think she will be a terrific appointment.""





But the appointment drew criticism from Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese who said it signals the Coalition if re-elected would make cuts to Medicare.





Speaking to the media after attending a church service in Cairns Mr Albanese said Senator Ruston ""has made it clear that she wants to take the universal out of universal healthcare"".





""She has made it very clear that if we have a re-election of the Morrison government we will see more cuts to Medicare more cuts to Medicare over the next three years"" he said.

Source: AAP / MICK TSIKAS Senator Ruston responded to historical comments where she is reported to have said the spending on Medicare was unsustainable saying that because of the strong economy circumstances are different now.





""I think the comments you were referring to were back in 2014 and we are standing here today having come through a pandemic with an extraordinarily strong economy ... I think we have demonstrated as a government that it is a strong economy that affords the supports that Australians rely on"" she said.





When asked what has changed now given higher debt levels Senator Ruston said: ""I think our policies as they relate to healthcare and economy are all clearly laid out for everyone to see going forward.





""Our government has been absolutely clear we are not cutting Medicare. In fact I think our track record - in terms of the increased spending across all elements of our healthcare system - stand for themselves.""





Mr Morrison said he would not announce who will replace Senator Ruston in her current portfolios until after the election.



Major parties commit to diabetes funding

After attending a church service in his home seat of Cook in Sydney on Sunday Mr Morrison and Mr Hunt also announced a $273 million commitment to make the treatment of type 1 diabetes more affordable.





The funding commitment would subsidise continuous glucose monitoring devices for all Australians living with type 1 diabetes.





“Our plan for a strong economy means we can invest in life-changing equipment for diabetes patients and make more medicines cheaper for more Australians” Mr Morrison said.





The opposition spokesman for health Mark Butler said Labor would match the government's announcement - a bipartisan commitment that has been welcomed by Diabetes Australia.



“Continuous and flash glucose monitors are life-saving and life-changing for people living with type 1 diabetes” Diabetes Australia Group CEO Justine Cain said.





“This is smart policy that will save the health system millions in the long run.""





The federal government also spruiked its investment of more than $60 million in mental health and suicide prevention in Western Australia following a bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and the state governments.





Mr Hunt said the deal will see the delivery of new health services for children as well as support for people following a suicide attempt and those with eating disorders.





""This landmark partnership ... will have a significant impact on the lives of many Australians across the state including young Australians and children who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic"" he said.





""It will help save lives and protect lives.""





Labor on Saturday announced it would provide $14.8 million to support Melanoma Institute Australia to deliver melanoma nurses across every state and territory.



Labor Greens questioned on health policy costings

On Sunday Mr Albanese was asked again about Labor's $135 million policy to trial 50 urgent care clinics across the country which he said will offer an alternative to busy hospital emergency departments for families.





The clinics will treat patients needing urgent medical attention including broken bones minor burns and stitches for cuts to free up congested emergency departments.





Questions have been raised about the policy's costings and how it would be staffed.



Mr Albanese said the plan is not expected to lead to any additional cost on the Medicare Benefits Schedule [MBS].





""You will see that when all of our costings will be released for every policy [of ours]. We are doing policy in exactly the same way as Liberal oppositions have done for election after election"" he said.





The Greens were also questioned on a plan to add dental to Medicare at a cost of $77.6 billion over a decade - the equivalent of $8 billion a year.



Announcing the policy at the National Press Club on 6 April Greens leader Adam Bandt said it would be funded by taxes on billionaires and large corporations.





Mr Bandt was questioned on Sunday on the costings done by the Parliamentary Budget Office which concluded there was a high degree of uncertainty on the Greens' policy of a billionaire's tax.





He conceded there is uncertainty over the policy telling Channel Nine's Today show that compliance would be an issue.





""Because of course they'll [billionaires will] do whatever they can to try and avoid paying tax. Another way of funding it [the dental plan] is making the big corporations pay their fair share which brings in over $330 billion over the decade.""

Así lo han expresado a Efe distintas fuentes del sector que ven una oportunidad sobre todo para las bodegas de menor tamaño y consideran que España podría pasar de los 1.000 millones de euros en exportaciones de vino a Estados Unidos en cinco años.

Para el director general de la Federación Española del Vino (FEV) José Luis Benítez el mercado estadounidense es ""potencialmente el más importante"" que tienen en este momento los bodegueros españoles.

""Estados Unidos es un mercado en el que podemos crecer mucho sobre todo en valor vendiendo más caro y llegando a más sitios. Es un mercado con mucho potencial súper interesante y donde todavía tenemos recorrido"" ha dicho Benítez.

En números según datos del Observatorio Español del Mercado del Vino (OEMV) Estados Unidos fue en 2021 el segundo mayor comprador de vino envasado español en términos de valor con una facturación de 2318 millones de euros lo que supuso en 129% más que el año anterior.

Mientras el crecimiento en volumen de los envíos a Estados Unidos fue del 66% hasta los 461 millones de litros lo que situó al país como el quinto destino de los caldos españoles en 2021.

Mercado seguro a pesar de los aranceles

Para el director general del OEMV Rafael del Rey la recuperación de las ventas a Estados Unidos está siendo ""extraordinaria"" y viene acompañada de las mejoras que en general experimentaron las exportaciones españolas el año pasado.

Pero en el caso estadounidense este aumento vino impulsado no solo porque la pandemia comenzó a aflojar sino por el fin de los aranceles que este país había impuesto en 2019 a la importación de algunos productos europeos entre ellos el vino español y que acabaron en junio de 2021.

Los aranceles tuvieron su origen en la guerra comercial entre Airbus y Boeing pero más allá de eso Estados Unidos se presenta como un mercado que ""ofrece seguridad jurídica"" ha indicado Benítez.

Para Álvaro Giménez CEO de la consultora especializada en internacionalización Gimenez & Sigwald Wine Associates Estados Unidos es una ""alternativa segura y duradera frente a la volatilidad de los mercados asiáticos y de América del Sur"" y más en un contexto geopolítico alterado con la guerra en Ucrania ha dicho a Efe.

Este experto ha expresado también que en Estados Unidos hay transparencia burocrática una sólida regulación de acuerdos comerciales firmes fiabilidad y estabilidad del entorno legal empresarial y de aduanas y además ha valorado que existe una cultura del vino dado que se trata de un país productor.

Futuro prometedor

Según Giménez el vino español ahora solo representa en Estados Unidos entre el 6 y el 7% de la cuota de mercado mientras que países como Francia o Italia triplican la presencia española.

Esto ofrece un recorrido que en cinco años puede llevar a España a superar los 1.000 millones de euros en exportaciones de vino a Estados Unidos y doblar su cuota de mercado en función de los datos ofrecidos por su consultora.

""Estamos en una desventaja total con Francia e Italia pero España tiene una ventaja y es que ahora mismo el mercado está entendiendo que la mejor realidad calidad/precios es la del vino español. La tendencia es que los catálogos tengan cada vez más vino español"" ha resaltado Giménez.

En su opinión se trata de un mercado idóneo sobre todo para que las pequeñas y medianas bodegas españolas puedan vender el vino como un producto ""boutique"" y ""exclusivo"" pero ha asegurado que para que esto sea posible hay que ayudar a estas empresas a entrar en ese mercado con misiones comerciales directas entre otros instrumentos.

""En España producimos grandes vinos que cuentan con buenas oportunidades en el mercado estadounidense pero es fundamental saber llegar con una estrategia sólida con objetivos y públicos bien definidos"" ha expresado Giménez.

Los huevos tienen diseños artísticos que se elaboran de manera minuciosa en la temporada que van desde personajes de series animadas cuentos películas y con colores llamativos. “Los hacemos en casa mis hijos y yo empezamos a reunir las tapas todo el año en los días libres las decoramos luego ya en estas fechas venimos a vender es algo que hacemos en la familia el dinero nos sirve para pasear desde mi punto de vista ellos aprenden el valor del dinero” comentó Martha de la colonia Las Delicias.

Los precios de las tapas de huevo son variables conforme la decoración.

Pero la mayoría ofrece tres tapas por 100 pesos con colores sencillos y de 120 a 150 con más elaboración.

Aunque también se ofrecen por docena a partir de los 25 pesos.

En la rotonda de Las Fuentes se colocan varias familias vendiéndolas así como en calles de la zona centro en Bulevar Morelos Hidalgo Periferico y otras avenidas comerciales. “El recurso que juntamos de aquí es muy útil para comprarles ropa sacarlos a pasear o para completar el gasto diario empezamos a vender hace como una semana pero este domingo será más fuerte la demanda así que todavía nos preparamos los diseños se pueden hacer conforme lo pidan hay gente que busca todos de un color otros que quieren de videojuegos películas es para darle gusto a los hijos se rellenan de confeti” dijo Brenda vendedora en los alrededores de la zona centro.

Mientras que en internet se aprovechan los grupos de compra venta para promover las tapas ofreciendo entregas en puntos medio.

La tradición de la pascua consiste en que los infantes deben encontrar los huevos decorados para después quebrarlos llenos de confeti olvidándose así del tiempo que conlleva su elaboración.

Una tradición que en la frontera de Tamaulipas tiene mayor arraigo en contraste al interior del país y también forma parte de los festejos religiosos de Semana Santa y Pascua.

Las autoridades del Ministerio del Comercio Interior (MINCIN) en Villa Clara decidieron regular la venta de pañales desechables y toallitas húmedas ante la escasez de estos productos en el territorio.

La medida no “solucionará la situación de la poca existencia ” de estos artículos de primera necesidad para el cuidado y la higiene de los niños pero pretende lograr “una distribución más equitativa” explicó el MINCIN en una publicación compartida este jueves en su página de Facebook.

El post aclara que la entrega de las toallitas y pañales solo beneficiará a los niños menores de tres años siempre y cuando aparezcan censados e inscritos en la libreta de abastecimiento de su domicilio. “Cada municipio establecerá los puntos de venta necesarios (Santa Clara uno por consejo popular) independientemente de la cadena de tiendas a la que pertenece el punto” explica el texto.

Las autoridades locales señalaron que las bodegas de cada lugar se vincularán a los establecimientos comerciales donde “estará el censo con el número del núcleo y la cantidad de niños de hasta tres años”. El plazo para comprar estos bienes será de apenas 48 horas.

El post refiere además que para la adquisición de los pañales desechables y las toallitas húmedas será necesario presentar el carné de identidad del menor y la mencionada libreta de abastecimiento. Añade que “la venta se realizará según la existencia del producto” y que “se realizará por etapas según las edades y entrada” de los insumos.

De acuerdo con los directivos del MINCIN en esa provincia “se establecerá en cada municipio un punto de venta donde se atenderán los casos de menores encamados y otras patologías que lo requieran previa certificación por Salud”.

Más de 140 internautas reaccionaron a la publicación y dejaron comentarios negativos sobre esta iniciativa similar a la que ya se aplica en Cuba para otros productos de aseo y alimentación como champú pasta dental detergente pollo salchichas y aceite.

“¡Por favor! ¿Y las embarazadas? Necesitamos tener pampers para cuando nazcan los bebés revisen ese tema y permitan que compremos en la primera etapa. A nadie se le puede ocurrir que tengamos que esperar a que nazca el bebé y los inscribamos para poder comprar los culeros” afirmó una usuaria.

“¿Hasta cuándo? Tenemos esa fábrica en el Mariel y todavía no logra saturar las tiendas del producto el tema es maltratar al pueblo siempre porque una mujer con niño pequeño no tiene tiempo para tanto trámite qué vergüenza Dios mío” agregó una forista.

“¡Qué horror! ¿Quién les dio permiso de decidir hasta qué edad se pone mi hijo un culero? Hasta eso hay que aguantar aquí” “Este país está cada día peor no logran avanzar en nada es de retroceso en retroceso y nadie piensa en el pueblo porque seguro que los hijos de los dirigentes tienen todos los pampers y toallitas necesarias” escribieron otras personas.

Hace apenas una jornada Yusleydi Lezcano Palmero directora de Ventas Minoristas de la empresa estatal Cimex dijo a medios oficialistas que la escasez de pañales desechables que denuncian las madres cubanas no es tal sino que hay una sobredemanda del producto y por eso se agota en menos de 72 horas de estar a la venta en tiendas en CUP.

La funcionaria explicó que durante el primer trimestre de 2022 la disposición del producto puesto en tiendas era de un 94.3% más que en igual etapa de 2021 y aseguró que ellos como alternativa disminuyeron la importación del insumo para potenciar ""al proveedor Mariel"" es decir a la empresa vietnamita Thai Binh establecida en Cuba.

En marzo de este año una iniciativa similar a esta que se aplica en Villa Clara fue implementada en Sancti Spíritus donde se desató una avalancha de críticas pues la distribución se realizó a cada núcleo del territorio sin considerar si tienen niños o no. Según las opiniones de la población en las colas para adquirir el producto se ubicaron muchos revendedores que luego ponen los culeros y toallitas a la venta en el mercado negro.

Las estrategias lanzadas por las autoridades villaclareñas y espirituanas responden a la decisión del gobierno cubano de incluir estos bienes en la lista de productos regulados por su alta demanda.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmUtY29uc3VsdGEuY29tL25vdGEvMjAyMi0wNC0xNy9tdW5pY2lwaW9zL3JlcG9ydGFuLWJhamFzLXZlbnRhcy1kZS1wZXNjYWRvLWVuLW1lcmNhZG8tZGUtY2hvbHVsYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reportan bajas ventas de pescado en mercado de Cholula | e-consulta.com,

(Port City Daily/Shea Carver)

WILMINGTON — Global pharma leader Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is on the hunt for new office space in town specifically for its subsidiary PPD which it acquired in a $17.4 billion deal in December 2021.

The Fortune 100 company announced earlier in the week it was exploring opportunities to sell the former PPD headquarters. The 12-story building erected in 2007 is the tallest overlooking downtown Wilmington.

The move is designed to support business growth and enable the company to match current and future workspace needs according to a press release. The Covid-19 trend has many industries assessing more remote work options and scaling back on office space.

Just two months ago the 17-acre campus of the former Verizon Wireless call center on Shipyard Boulevard sold for more than $16 million. The majority of local Verizon employees were sent home to work at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 a move the company made permanent by August of that year.

Yet the scientific research industry has been offering flexible work options for years according to David M. Johnston Thermo Fisher senior vice president and president of clinical research at PPD.

“A significant percentage of our colleagues and job candidates prefer a hybrid work model coming into the office for collaboration purposes which necessitates more flexible workspaces and fewer dedicated offices” Johnston said in the release.

The PPD headquarters changed the skyline of downtown Wilmington 15 years ago. It was one of the first buildings to inspire revitalization of the north waterfront area now home to Riverfront Park multiple apartment complexes as well as an expanded Riverwalk and marina. The PPD building offers 400000 square feet of office space with surface parking a parking deck and an underground garage.

When Thermo Fisher Scientific took over four months ago speculation arose as to whether it would continue operating in the building. Acquisitions often come with changes but empty offices and parking spaces were more notable due to the pandemic.

Utilizing the building should it go on the market won’t be hard some local officials told the Wilmington Business Journal at the end of last year. Ninety-six percent of office space is occupied in the submarket of downtown Wilmington Wilmington Downtown Inc. CEO Holly Childs said.

“Class A office space is really hard to come by because there’s so little of the product” she told the journal.

Mayor Saffo added that demand for more apartments and hotels also remain on the rise downtown. Thus 929 N. Front St. “will be heavily used at some point in time whoever uses it” he also told the journal.

Based in Waltham Massachusetts Thermo Fisher is a supplier of scientific instrumentation reagents and consumables and software services. Its annual revenue equals approximately $40 billion and it employs more than 130000 worldwide.

Over 11000 work in North Carolina with PPD clinical research employing over 1700 people in the Wilmington region. It currently has 200-plus open positions in the area.

The company says it is in the early stages of the sale process and relocating which could take up to two years or more to complete.

“[W]e expect to continue to be a Wilmington growth story for years to come” Johnston said in the release. “The business remains committed to Wilmington both as an employer that continues to expand hiring locally and globally and as a good corporate citizen investing in the communities where our colleagues live and work.”

One in five adults has been in pain most days for at least three months — the minimum criteria for chronic pain — and for many pain has been a part of daily life for years.

Chronic pain can make it hard for a person to work socialize or even do tasks around the house like cooking or cleaning. It can also affect sleep and lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.

Opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are commonly prescribed to treat both chronic and severe acute pain but while they’re effective they’re also addictive and widely misused — 16000 Americans now die every year from in overdoses involving prescription opioids (though an increasing share also involve fentanyl).

Even when used properly opioids have a variety of side effects that makes them a less-than-perfect solution to pain. As a result we’re in dire need of more effective safe alternatives to opioids.

Here are a few promising candidates from the cutting edge.

Gene Therapy

How it works: Gene therapies treat or prevent health issues by targeting the genes linked to them. This includes replacing faulty genes with working copies and inserting new genes to interfere with ones causing problems.

Where we are now: One promising gene therapy for chronic pain relief targets the protein NaV1.7. People with mutations that prevent production of this protein don’t feel pain at all while those with mutations that increase its production are hypersensitive to pain.

Armed with that knowledge researchers at UC San Diego developed a therapy that treats pain by temporarily reducing production of the protein.

Gene therapies treat or prevent health issues by targeting the genes linked to them.

In March 2021 they announced that mice treated with the therapy had higher pain thresholds than untreated mice. The effect lasted for months and the animals exhibited no obvious side effects.

The gene therapy still needs to prove itself in humans — and many treatments don’t make the jump — but the researchers believe it could help people with a number of conditions that cause chronic pain including sciatica and osteoarthritis.

The drawbacks: Gene therapy is still experimental and there’s always the potential that the treatment will cause unexpected side effects. However because the treatment only temporarily dampens the gene rather than permanently altering it it is likely simpler and less risky than gene therapy that alters DNA.

Sodium channel modulators

How they work: NaV1.7 belongs to a group of proteins (known as “voltage-gated sodium channels”) that are involved with processing pain.

Instead of working on the genes themselves some researchers are developing non-opioid medications (called “sodium channel modulators”) to relieve pain by interfering with these proteins.

Where we are now: Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently announced the promising results of phase 2 trials testing its drug VX-548 as a treatment for acute pain following surgery.

During the trials patients were given either the new medication a placebo or the opioid hydrocodone. A high dose of the new drug outperformed the placebo at reducing pain and saw no serious side effects.

Patients who received the high dose of VX-548 reported more benefits than those who took hydrocodone but the trials were too small to confirm that it actually works better. Larger trials will be needed to compare the two types of meds as well as assess VX-548’s ability to treat chronic pain.

Medications that interfere with proteins called “voltage-gated sodium channels” may be able to provide chronic pain relief.

The drawbacks: Several of these drugs have made it to the clinical trial stage and failed. A key problem is that the meds have to be very specifically designed to target one of three sodium channels linked to pain (NaV1.7 NaV1.8 and NaV1.9) and not any of the others — if you inhibit NaV1.4 by accident you can cause partial paralysis.

This affects the drugs’ ability to make the leap from animals to humans because these channels are not all identical in mice and humans.

“When you home in very specifically on differences between sodium channels [in one animal] you end up with molecules that are so specific they’re not very good at inhibiting the channel [in a different animal” William Catterall a University of Washington pharmacologist told the Scientist.

Psychedelics

How they work: Studies in the 1960s and ‘70s suggested that psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin could help alleviate chronic pain. Exactly how isn’t fully understood but it’s thought the drugs induce neuroplasticity in the brain allowing it to rewire itself in beneficial ways.

Where we are now: The classification of many psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs — with “high potential for abuse” and “no accepted medical use” — dramatically slowed research into them but it’s now starting to pick up again.

In 2020 Dutch researchers published the results of a small trial that found that microdosing LSD — that is regularly taking an amount too small to induce a “trip” — increased participants’ pain tolerance.

Psychedelics are believed to induce neuroplasticity in the brain letting it rewire itself in beneficial ways.

Several other trials are ongoing. One out of UC San Diego is testing the ability of psilocybin — the psychedelic compound in magic mushrooms — to alleviate phantom limb pain. Another in Switzerland will see if LSD can help alleviate the pain of chronic cluster headaches.

“There are numerous mechanisms in psychedelic drugs particularly psilocybin but possibly others that could potentially affect chronic pain disorders” Amanda Pustilnik a neuroscience law expert from the University of Maryland told VICE. “Their potential could be tremendous.”

The drawbacks: There is still a lot we don’t know about how psychedelics work — or don’t — and their potential drawbacks. That means a lot more research is needed but because of how these drugs are classified getting studies approved is difficult. Getting a treatment approved is even harder.

Implants

How they work: Implants can relieve pain by interfering with the electrical signals that tell our brains something hurts.

Where we are now: Doctors have been using implants to manipulate electrical signals in the body and alleviate pain for decades but the technologies are now getting far more advanced.

Cambridge University researchers are developing an implant that stimulates the spinal cord to alleviate back pain. It’s so small that it can be placed using a needle so if future clinical trials go well the tiny device could help people overcome pain without surgery.

At NYU a team has demonstrated in rats what it says is the first computerized brain implant to target chronic pain. That device works by delivering pain-relieving stimulation to one part of the brain when patterns linked to pain are detected in another.

Implants can relieve pain by interfering with the electrical signals that tell our brains something hurts.

The drawbacks: Even if they work implants degrade over time so these devices wouldn’t be able to cure chronic pain permanently — after so many years they’d probably need to be removed and replaced.

Implanting a device into the body is risky too especially if the implant is being placed near the spinal cord or brain. That means this form of pain relief is likely to be reserved only for the most serious cases of chronic pain for the foreseeable future. ​​

Today’s solutions

While waiting for these therapies to clear trials people experiencing chronic pain do have treatment options other than opioids.

Research suggests that some chronic pain sufferers can benefit from marijuana even in microdoses too small to produce the drug’s characteristic “high.” Though the research isn’t yet conclusive the non-psychoactive marijuana compound CBD may also provide pain relief.

Virtual reality and green light therapy have also been shown to help alleviate chronic pain as has a psychological treatment called “pain reprocessing therapy” which teaches patients how to rewire their brains — without the use of drugs or surgical implants.

Still people experiencing severe chronic pain may find that opioids are the only thing that helps so ensuring that the drugs are prescribed only to those who need them — and that those people have help avoiding or overcoming addiction — is a key part of combating America’s massive chronic pain problem.

Former WWE superstar Alberto El Patron (likely best known as Alberto Del Rio in WWE) is reportedly making his return to a major promotion this month.

According to Emily Pratt of FanByte an industry source has indicated that the former World Heavyweight Champion will be returning at AAA TripleMania XXX. Alberto is booked to be the surprise partner for Laredo Kid because his original partner Aero Star is dealing with reported Visa issues.

Ringside News adds that the appearance has been in the works for over a week now and Konnan who books AAA ""felt like he needed a big star a big surprise'.

It will be interesting to see how the company books El Patron in his return match and whether or not the one-time Royal Rumble winner will become a regular. El Patron has been competing on the indie scene recently with his last match taking place on Match 31 2022. He teamed with El Hijo de Dos Caras vs. DMT Azul and Toscano at the Arena Olimpico Laguna in Gomez Palacio Durango Mexiko

As noted last month El Patron is also getting more involved with the world of MMA. He has inked a short-term deal with the UFC promotion to appear as a Spanish commentator and there is apparently interest from both sides in a potential long-term partnership.

Last December Alberto was cleared of all kidnapping and sexual assault charges made against him by his ex-girlfriend. Since then he has expressed his desire to return to WWE or join AEW. However a recent report noted that WWE Impact Wrestling AEW and MLW are uninterested in signing El Patron at this time.",,,,,,,,,

By Peter Vankevich

Even though he says his first attempt at decoy carving yielded “the ugliest bird you ever saw” the folk-art form grabbed John Simpson back in 1975.

Simpson who is the featured carver at this year’s Ocracoke Waterfowl Festival from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday April 23 at the Berkley Barn is also the president of the Ocracoke Island Decoy Carvers Guild which he helped co-found in 2018.

This will be the fourth festival which draws carvers and aficionados from all over the eastern seaboard.

In addition to organizing the event Simpson will have a booth to show his carvings many of which these days are shore birds.

But duck decoys are the main heritage of island carvers and that’s where Simpson started as a teenager back in 1975.

“I always enjoyed piddling with wood and my interest in carving took off by hanging out as a young person at Corky’s Store on Down Creek Road” he said. “Wilbur Gaskill would sit on the steps carving little birds and sold them to visitors as novelty items for $3. He had me sit next to him and showed me how to carve.”

That first attempt at carving was “out of cork from an old coastguard life jacket and it was the ugliest bird you ever saw” he said. “It was a scaup and I chose it because it was the easiest to paint with just white gray and black colors.”

But he comes from a family of decoy carvers so he couldn’t give up.

He is related on his mother Patsy Gaskins Simpson’s side to one of Ocracoke’s carving legends Gary Bragg (1881-1954).

Since that self-described inauspicious beginning Simpson has carved hundreds of waterfowl and shorebirds.

Simpson also paints two-dimensional works and even though he has honed that skill he says painting his carvings is his toughest challenge.

“I know it might seem funny but I have to be in just the right mood to do the painting” he said.

A highlight of the Waterfowl Festival is to celebrate a featured carver who gets to choose the festival’s featured species and Simpson chose the Northern Pintail.

Previous featured carvers David O’Neal Dan Robinson and Nathan Spencer all attribute their love of the art and their carving skills to mentors family members and neighbors.

Robinson who was the chief at the Ocracoke Coast Guard station took him under his wing so to speak teaching his carving techniques.

Simpson’s early carvings might not have been as bad as he describes.

At least one of them was an inspiration for last year’s featured carver Nathan Spencer.

Some years ago Nathan and his wife Janet cleaned out a shed for his cousin Patsy Simpson’s mother. He came across one of Simpson’s carvings of a bird in flight that he made when he was very young.

“I brought it home and studied it and I thought ‘I can do that’” Spencer said.

It is not only carving but John has a love of the history of decoys and has built a personal collection of carvings by visiting many waterfowl festivals over the years.

“My first decoy festival goes back to 1975 in Virginia Beach” he said. He immediately took to the fellowship of carvers noting how helpful everyone was by sharing carving techniques.

Two of the most famous master carvers in North America are the Ward brothers Lem (1896-1984) and Steve (1896-1976) who lived in Crisfield Maryland on the Eastern Shore.

Simpson fondly recalls meeting Steve at a decoy festival in Salisbury Maryland in 1975 who even at that young age encouraged Simpson to become a carver.

Waterfowl decoys are now considered Americana folk art and some carvings have skyrocketed in price rising to the six and even seven figures.

Simpson’s island roots go way back.

His great grandfather Joseph Merritt Burrus was the second to last light keeper for the Ocracoke lighthouse and the last one to serve under the U.S. Lighthouse Service from 1929-1947.

Recently thanks to some genealogical sleuthing by Philip Howard Simpson discovered that he is an eleventh-generation descendant of William Howard the alleged quartermaster for Blackbeard.

Simpson graduated from Ocracoke School in 1978 in a class of seven. The following year he took a job with the U.S. Postal Service in Elizabeth City which led him to Washington state in the mid-1980s.

Upon leaving the postal service in 2013 he returned to Ocracoke and soon thereafter started a music show on WOVV Ocracoke’s community radio station that he continues today now called “Classic Cuts and Such with John in the Studio” broadcast from 6 to 8 p.m. Saturdays and rebroadcast Tuesdays from 2 to 4 p.m.

Simpson also has a thriving island fig preserve business with Trudy Austin. So it’s not unusual at island events which include vendors to see John with a large table covered with his artwork carvings fig trees and fig preserves.

The Ocracoke Island Decoy Carvers Guild’s mission is to pass on the fine art of bird carving to others and it holds monthly meetings to which all are invited to attend.

Neighbors say they didn’t hear a thing but detectives are hoping surveillance cameras captured the shooter.

“We lost another creative beautiful soul too soon” said Brad Neal father of one of the victims.

Neal says his 31-year-old son Brandon and his girlfriend were shot to death in their bed sometime Thursday evening to friday morning in Brandon’s house.

“Thursday we were here and we moved a whole truck load out” Neal said.

Neal was helping his son move out of the house that had recently sold and says his son had problems with drugs and was trying to sober up.

“He is bipolar so he started self medicating and it spiraled recently since covid it got” Neal said.

“He came to our house on the beach and he came and met the interventionist and saw us and he was sad and he had shame but he also wanted help” Neal said.

Neal says he wants his son to be remembered for more than just his addiction.

“He was a saxophonist…he became a welder and a fabricator and would not only fabricate items for functional use but he also did art” Neal said about his son.

Los Angeles police have released few details while detectives confirmed two people were murdered in the home and say the act was not random.

Residents in the neighborhood say they want answers…

Cameras may be the answer detectives are looking for as several of the homes on Berkley Drive have cameras pointed right at the street.

—————

With inflation at a 40-year high to start 2022 consumers are more aware of the rising food and fuel costs. In a recent earnings call Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts the retailer would hold the line on prices to continue growing its grocery share.

“During periods of inflation like this middle-income families lower-middle-income families even wealthier families become more price-sensitive and that’s to our advantage” McMillon said. “So we’ve been through this before and we run with inflation around the world all the time. But inflation is a different environment in the U.S. right now than it has been in recent times for sure.”

“Everyday low prices” is at the heart of Walmart’s business model and McMillon said merchants are having more talks with suppliers to mitigate inflationary pressures on the business.

Walmart did see same-store sales rise 5.6% in the fourth quarter. The company reported grocery comps increased by the high single digits in the period with sales growth and market share gains aided by slightly wider price gaps than pre-pandemic levels expanded digital offerings. Walmart was seen as taking market share in grocery in the fourth quarter ending Jan. 31.

To test price gaps in Walmart’s home market of Bentonville the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal conducted on March 30 a price comparison against Aldi and Dollar General. The comparison results show Walmart does not have the lowest price on at least 19 grocery and consumable staples. The shopping list included store brands and a few national brands. The basket included eggs milk bread bacon canned tuna frozen chicken canned green beans canned chili deli ham mayo peanut butter saltine crackers cereal trash bags laundry detergent toilet paper toothpaste aspirin shampoo and conditioner.

The Walmart basket of the 19 items cost $64.16 16% more than the same items at Aldi. The Aldi basket cost $55 and had the lowest prices overall on 16 of the items compared. Aldi was the low price leader overall saving a shopper $9.16.

Dollar General’s total basket cost was $62.55 after coupons which was 2.5% less than the Walmart basket but 13.75% more expensive than Aldi. The most significant price gap between the three discount competitors was for a gallon of 2% milk and a dozen large eggs. The milk at Aldi was $2.27 compared to $4.03 at Walmart and $4.25 at Dollar General. The eggs cost $1.43 at Aldi compared to $1.91 at Walmart and $2.95 at Dollar General. Black Forest ham for sandwiches also showed wide price gaps between Aldi and the other discounters. The 8-ounce store brand of ham costs $2.99 at Aldi whereas the Great Value ham in the same size costs $4.78. Hormel ham sold at Dollar General costs $3.98 for 8 ounces.

The price gaps were closer between the competitors on branded items such as Tide detergent Jif peanut butter and Honey Nut Cheerios. Aldi had a small price gap with Dollar General and Walmart on the 28-ounce jar of Jif Creamy Peanut Butter costing $3.98. The same item cost $4.15 at Walmart and $4.25 at Dollar General. The large Honey Nut Cheerios cost $3.49 at Aldi compared to $3.98 at Walmart while Dollar General had the cereal on sale for $3.50 with a 75-cent digital coupon. Other national brands such as Tide Crest and Hellman’s mayo showed tight price gaps between the competitors.

Simply Tide detergent was priced at 14.7 cents per load with the Walmart bottle costing $3.24 for 22 loads. The same product bottled for 20 loads costs $2.94 at Aldi the same 14.7 cents per load at Walmart. Dollar General had a digital coupon for the Simply Tide product which took the final cost down to $2.75 per bottle. The Dollar General bottle came out to 13.75 cents per load at the coupon price. Without the coupon the Dollar General price was $3.25 for 20 loads and more expensive than the other two retailers.

The large tube of Crest toothpaste was cheaper at Dollar General because of the $1 coupon. The large tube cost $2 at Dollar General $3 at Walmart and $3.12 at Aldi for 0.2 more ounces than sold at Walmart.

Pantene 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner cost $3.47 at Walmart for 10.4 ounces. That equates to 33.3 cents per ounce. A 12-ounce bottle at Aldi costs $3.79 which comes to 31.5 cents per ounce a slightly better value than the smaller Walmart bottle. For the best value Dollar General’s 17-ounce bottle of the same product costs $5 equating to 29.5 cents per ounce.

Frozen chicken was another area where Aldi beat Walmart. A 48-ounce bag of Great Value skinless boneless chicken breasts was $8.37 at Walmart and $6.99 for the same size bag of Kirkland’s chicken brand at Aldi. That’s a savings of 19.7%. Dollar General sold a smaller bag of chicken a Tyson Foods brand which cost $6.95 for 32 ounces.

Toilet paper and other nonedible consumables like trash bags were closer in price among the three retailers. Using the Great Value store brand at Walmart Aldi’s store brand and Dollar General’s store brand that each compares to Scott’s 4-roll package the cost was $4.88 at Walmart $3.99 at Aldi and $3 at Dollar General which had the best overall value. Walmart had the best value on store-branded large kitchen trash bags at $6.92 for 50 bags. The comparable item at Aldi had 40 bags selling for $6.49 and Dollar General sold similar bags for $7. The cost per bag at Walmart was 13 cents compared to 14 cents at Dollar General and 15 cents at Aldi.

Scott Benedict an executive at Rogers-based WhiteSpyder and a former Walmart buyer said it’s sometimes hard to tell if product quality is equal when looking at private brand products. He said Walmart has worked to improve its Great Value private brand quality. Aldi is also known for high-quality private brands.

Benedict agreed that Walmart might not have the lowest cost on a basket of goods on any given day. Still the retail giant does offer shoppers more variety various size packs and a broader assortment of many grocery items. Aldi and Dollar General offer a limited inventory because they operate smaller formats. Walmart also has the edge in online ordering and pickup convenience at no added costs. Aldi partners with Instacart and there are delivery costs with online orders. Dollar General also offers online order pickup through the retailer’s mobile app that allows customers to apply coupons at checkout a feature Walmart does not provide.

Benedict said the item pricing game takes constant attention and retailers like Dollar General will use coupons to stay competitive on certain items. He said Aldi is a deep discounter with limited assortments but they are stout competitors in dairy fresh food and other categories. He also said pricing is relevant to locality and the competition in a specific market.

Over six decades years Walmart Inc. has gone from one humble discount store in Bentonville Arkansas to a $555-billion-a-year retail behemoth. By comparison the world’s largest retailer beats mighty Amazon Inc. in annual global retail sales by more than $200 billion.

Walmart’s strategy has always been an aggressive pursuit of low prices. And today its massive logistics and supply chain networks and management strategies are studied at business management schools where the company is used to explain important concepts and also to address related social issues such as the company’s market dominance and reliance on cheap imported goods. (You might be surprised at how many people work at Walmart in each state and what they are paid.)

For the consumer Walmart’s focus on eye-catching bargain-basement prices is a powerful draw. But this aggressive pricing strategy has its faults. Economies of scale can only go so far in driving down prices before they begin to affect the quality and selection of products. (That said large-scale retail operations do sometimes sell top-flight products at good prices. Click here to see some surprisingly good Costco Walmart and Target products.)

To determine the products that you are better served buying elsewhere than Walmart 24/7 Wall St. reviewed articles on the subject appearing on MoneyWise Reader’s Digest BestLife Consumer Reports Business Insider CheatSheet and Alot Living. The list’s overall message can be summed up with the idiom “You get what you pay for.”

While higher-end models are often available you’re better off browsing and buying at a retailer that’s focused on selling home electronics and appliances.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Small selection and more expensive Walmart’s selection of white goods like refrigerators and washing machines is more limited than competitors in this product category. You’re better off heading directly to Best Buy Home Depot or regional chains with better selections and competitive prices.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Small selection and more expensive Like all home appliances at Walmart the selection of vacuum cleaners can be smaller than what you can find at a retailer that’s more dedicated to the sale of such items. Prices aren’t always better at Walmart for these items either.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Poor quality or more expensive Walmart’s dedication to its “Save Money” slogan can lead to a tradeoff in quality and durability. This is particularly true with its selection of laptops especially for more expensive models peppered in with its ample selection of low-end clunkers. A good rule of thumb: Don’t buy electronics from a place that also sells fruits and vegetables.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality more expensive on the high end Walmart’s website currently lists 38 drone models from several brands ranging in price from $150 to thousands of dollars. But that inventory is slim compared to the many options available online that offer more brands at the same price range.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Sales people aren’t knowledgeable As with electronics in general Walmart isn’t the best place to shop for high-end photographic equipment. The best option for them is to find a good camera store with knowledgeable staff where you’re more likely to receive the best customer experience (such places do still exist). Otherwise find a camera department at a national or regional retailer that focuses on consumer electronics.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Video games are increasingly purchased and downloaded online either through a digital distribution service like Steam or through the PlayStation and Xbox online stores. But if you’re in the market for a video game burned onto CDs and sold in plastic boxes you’re likely to find better prices elsewhere especially if you look for used games online.

Source: byakkaya / iStock via Getty Images 8. Phone accessories

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive The phone accessories market is filled with an enormous selection of mobile phone accessories like cables adapters and automobile cradles. But so many of them are shoddy produced by obscure third-party Chinese manufacturers and they can conk out quickly or even damage your mobile device. Like its competitors Walmart does carry name-brand phone accessories but you’re not likely to be paying the lowest possible price for them.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More difficult to print photos from your phone Walmart’s Photo Center currently offers 4×6 prints for nine cents apiece from images that can be uploaded to the site with a registered account. Canvas sizes images (16 x 20) currently cost $34.96. But if all you need is photo printing you’re better off using an online service or going to an easier-to-navigate smaller office supply outlet with a printing center.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive on the low end Walmart sells popular battery brands at competitive prices. For example a 16-pack of Duracell Coppertop AA batteries is currently $12.78 at Walmart $3.20 less than The Home Depot’s current price. However if you’re looking for lower-cost brands with comparable performance Consumer Reports found Costco’s Kirkland Signature AA batteries (currently 48 for $13.99) were the best store-branded batteries.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Beleaguered department store chain Sears used to be the gold standard for in-store automotive centers — places where you could get an oil change while shopping for clothing kitchenware and tools. Walmart has taken up the slack in this space as Sears continues to shutter stores. But tires can be more expensive at Walmart. For example Costco tends to have better deals and (unlike Walmart) offers free rotations and balances for the lifespan of the tires.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality Buying cheap luggage can lead to your overstuffed bag bursting open at check-in — one of the reasons why luggage is sold in stores at major airports (at a huge markup). In this instance Walmart isn’t alone in selling luggage lemons as its competitors like Target aren’t any better. A Consumer Reports survey found that the best places to buy luggage include REI L.L. Bean or a dedicated luggage vendor like Luggage Pros.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality Even by the flimsy standards of mass-produced particle-board furniture Walmart is not the best place to find budget shelving tables or other self-assembled home furnishings. IKEA remains the gold standard for these affordable goods.

Source: sutteerug / iStock via Getty Images 14. Bedding

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality As with wood furniture Walmart is not a great place to purchase bedding. Higher thread-count sheets and pillowcases can be purchased elsewhere at comparable prices (relative to quality) and larger selections such as Bed Bath & Beyond or Macy’s.

[in-text-ad-2]

Source: artran / iStock Editorial via Getty Images 15. Meat and poultry

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality meats often more expensive Walmart is a decent place to buy non-perishable food items like canned food and frozen dinners. But with its massive supply chains complicated logistics operations and aggressive pricing strategies against its suppliers the quality of perishable foods can suffer. According to Consumer Reports a common customer complaint about Walmart is the quality of its meat and poultry.

Source: AlexRaths / iStock via Getty Images 16. Fresh produce

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality smaller selection Anyone who has shopped at both a bargain grocery store and a high-end market is likely to have noticed a difference in the quality and shelf life of fresh produce. Walmart’s content pursuit of the lowest prices means the quality and selection of fruits and vegetables suffers. Produce is usually better from premium grocery stores and prices tend to be competitive (for in-season fruits and vegetables) as they use it to lure customers to their higher-profit goods.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Brand names are competitively priced Walmart’s store brand may cost less than similar items it stocks but the value might not be that great. Reader’s Digest reported that when considering the sizes of Great Value products versus name brands the price difference is negligible. Additionally Great Value products can cost more than competing store brands like Costco’s Kirkland.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Walmart isn’t the best place to buy dog food. There are numerous alternatives that offer wider selections. If you have Amazon Prime you can set up regular pet-food delivery at a lower price (excluding the Prime annual membership fee.)

Source: Tero Vesalainen / iStock via Getty Images 19. Generic supplements

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality Navigating the world of dietary supplements involves walking through a minefield of misinformation and sketchy health claims that barely meet FDA standards. In 2015 New York prosecutors revealed that major retailers including Walmart were selling mislabeled herbal supplements. Generic brands aren’t always worse than name brands but when it comes to supplements it’s a “buyer beware” world.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive and/or lesser quality Sometimes a spoon is just a spoon. Other times you want quality flatware. Walmart fails at both ends. Cheap flatware generally costs less at dollar stores while the high-end stuff is better purchased elsewhere. Walmart offers decent prices for quality multi-piece pots and pans but there are plenty of better options for spoons knives and forks.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive and/or lesser quality If price is the only consideration dollar stores are cheaper; if you’re looking for quality Walmart’s offerings aren’t good enough

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive If you need to purchase these single-use plastics the only reason to do it at Walmart is because you’re already there picking up items for your family BBQ. Otherwise a dollar store is a better option.

Source: Kwangmoozaa / iStock via Getty Images 23. Jewelry

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Low quality Buying jewelry from the same place you buy canned beans and paper towels isn’t the classiest option to say the least especially if the jewelry is a gift. The price may be nice but at the cost of quality. At the same time the prices aren’t as low as they should be for cheap costume jewelry so buying jewelry from Walmart is the worst of both worlds.

Source: IKvyatkovskaya / iStock via Getty Images 24. High-end perfumes

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive While Walmart is primarily focused on low prices it does offer some luxury items like high-end $300+ perfumes from brands including Creed Aventus Maison Francis Kurkdjian and Bond No. 9. But don’t expect any bargains as you’re likely to find better prices from online retailers. For more pedestrian perfumes and colognes like Calvin Klein it’s possible that Walmart offers better prices than Amazon but it’s worth checking before buying.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Walmart’s toy aisles can certainly attract the attention of children with an enormous brightly colored selection. But as far as prices for toys and board games are concerned Amazon is winning the game against Walmart according to a 2019 report from Kiplinger.

Source: jfmdesign / iStock Unreleased via Getty Images 26. Name brand diapers

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Amazon upped its diaper game after it acquired Quidsi (previously known as Diapers.com) in 2010 for $545 million. Though Amazon shut down Quidsi in 2017 claiming lack of profitability the company ultimately came out as a dominant online provider of name brand diapers through its Amazon Family brand exclusive to Prime subscribers. Walmart hasn’t been able to beat these prices.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Though convenient gift cards aren’t very thoughtful presents — gifting cash or pre-loaded debit cards gives the recipient more freedom to purchase. On top of that billions of dollars locked into these cards go unused every year some of that winds up as free money to companies that issue these cards. But if you want to buy a gift card membership-only warehouse retailers like Costco or Walmart Inc.’s Sam’s Club are better alternatives.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: Consider a subscription instead Holding a paper booklet with words and pictures printed on it with ink may seem a 20th Century habit but magazines still populate shelf space at the checkout line and airport kiosk. But buying them from Walmart (or anywhere really) will cost you more than a print or digital subscription.

> Reason to shop elsewhere: More expensive Greeting cards are better purchased at a dollar store pharmacy or specialty store like Hallmark which will have a wide variety at comparable prices.

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjIvMDQvMTcvd2h5LXRoZS1nb3AtdHVybmVkLW9uLWRpc25leS0wMDAyNTYzOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney Didn't Leave the GOP Behind — Culture Did,"Disney has always been an explicitly morally instructive company; its characters were used as propaganda during World War II. Walt Disney’s original vision for Walt Disney World in Orlando was a model for a healthy civic society among many other examples. Conservatives now simply disapprove of the corporation’s chosen morality which includes commonly accepted progressive ideas about multiculturalism and personal identity.

The story of fighting back against that gradual seemingly inevitable leftward cultural creep is more or less the story of conservatism itself. The incentives and pressures that have led conservatives on this particular quest however — one that’s not only almost certainly hopeless but that has led them into sinister rhetorical territory in referring to opponents of the law as “groomers” or manipulative pedophiles — are quite modern and reveal how much both our cultural and political landscape have shifted over just the past decade of American life.

Walt Disney’s personality and imagination are baked into the company that bears his name. From “Steamboat Willie” to “The Avengers” there’s an irrepressible optimism a love of sound and visuals for their own sake and a dogged (to his critics facile bordering on irresponsible) determination to make even the macabre or the tragic ultimately fun. If that sounds indistinguishable from the “American character” as hazily defined in pop culture it’s not by accident.

Disney’s original critics from the left accused the company of whitewashing American life and spreading the post-war nuclear-family myth to unwilling recipients across the globe. What both the company’s cultural architects and critics could both agree on is that it represented at least by the standards of pop culture the middle-brow American mainstream.

The conservative critique of Disney today is premised on the idea that by aligning with liberal social causes it’s left that mainstream behind. Yes there is polling that shows the specific Florida bill in question is mostly popular with voters. But right-wing political entrepreneurs like Chris Rufo the impresario of last year’s “critical race theory” panic have turned a discrete disagreement over a piece of legislation into the fulcrum for a full-fledged culture war.

They now accuse notionally LGBT-friendly companies like Disney of “grooming” children — an astonishingly cynical rhetorical flourish that by misappropriating a term used to describe pedophiles manages to conflate homosexuality and pedophilia profoundly disrespect actual survivors of child sex abuse by using their experience as a political cudgel and invoke the specter of far-right conspiracy theories like “Pizzagate” all at once. (The backlash has also predictably and depressingly caught sex education in its blast radius which has been repeatedly proven as the most effective tactic to prevent sexual abuse.)

The approach recalls the anti-gay crusades of the 1970s. A soundbite from conservative activist and erstwhile pop star Anita Bryant that’s made the rounds since the introduction of the Florida bill could have come from the keyboard of Rufo or any number of today’s anti-gay activists: “Homosexuals cannot reproduce so they must recruit. And to freshen their ranks they must recruit the youth of America.”

To middle-American small-c conservative parents of young children waiting until after third grade for their kids to learn about homosexuality — or simply teaching them about it themselves in the privacy of their own home as is their right — sounds pretty reasonable at least to look at the polling. But to argue that corporate America is engaged in a mass conspiracy to turn your kids gay decidedly does not. The conservative culture-war tactics of 2021 as exemplified by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s successful campaign were predicated on real and widespread dissatisfaction with liberal management of the Covid-19 pandemic. By contrast Disney’s move toward broader LGBTQ-friendliness is in lockstep with the American public; support for gay rights has been on an unbroken and steep rise for the past decade.

The GOP attacks on Disney are reminiscent above all else of their unsuccessful campaign against the NFL with its support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Both are among the few remaining monocultural institutions in American life and present an irresistible opportunity to make a broader case about the national “character.” Ideological conservatives are nowhere near the rooms in which decisions about those institutions’ publicly-professed politics are made and therefore seek to steer the conversation from the outside. And in both cases conservatives have conflated corporate messaging with support for extreme edge cases within each issue like police abolition or medical youth gender transition hoping that Americans will do the same.

Embedded in that effort is the recognition that when it comes to the core issues at hand — support for the racial justice movement and LGBTQ rights — the ship has sailed leftward and has been doing so since the 1960s if not before. If you’re a committed conservative activist that’s a genuine cause for lamentation. If you’re an ambitious Republican like Ron DeSantis it’s a potential opportunity to win the base’s fealty. In going on the offense against Disney he and other Republicans like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene are betting they can do that without alienating the vast middle. But in their choice of target and the hateful and off-putting character of their attack to all but the most extremely online conservative activists they’ve unwittingly revealed just how little leverage they really wield when it comes to America’s cultural mainstream.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDM1b3JsYW5kby5jb20vbmV3cy9wZW9wbGUtZ2F0aGVyLW91dHNpZGUtb2YtZGlzbmV5LXNwcmluZ3MtdG8tcHJvdGVzdC10aGUtY29tcGFueXMtcmVzcG9uc2UtdG8tZG9udC1zYXktZ2F5LWxhd9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gzNW9ybGFuZG8uY29tL25ld3MvcGVvcGxlLWdhdGhlci1vdXRzaWRlLW9mLWRpc25leS1zcHJpbmdzLXRvLXByb3Rlc3QtdGhlLWNvbXBhbnlzLXJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLWRvbnQtc2F5LWdheS1sYXcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"People gather outside of Disney Springs to protest the company's response to ""Don't Say Gay"" Law","Dozens of people gathered outside one of the entrances of Disney World with banners and us flags to protest against the company for its response to the ""Parental Rights in Education Law"" signed by Governor Ron DeSantis.

One of the coolest theme parks in the world is Disney’s Animal Kingdom. Not only are Guests able to enjoy attractions like Flight of Passage Expedition Everest DINOSAUR and more but they can also hop aboard Kilimanjaro Safaris and take a real safari tour with a guide where animals can walk right up to your vehicle! The experience is truly immersive and makes you feel like you are in the middle of a real African safari.

To top it off Disney Animal Kingdom Lodge carries out that immersion as an animal sanctuary where Guests can see a giraffe and many other animals out their window. Disney takes amazing care of these animals and has created a top-notch conservation for them always ensuring they are in proper health and giving them the ultimate living conditions with sprawling lands.

Most recently however tragedy struck the Kingdom. At Disney’s Animal Kingdom Guests saw a zebra run full speed into one of the metal fences that protect the enclosure. It seems that the addition of two ostriches into the enclosure spooked the zebra and caused it to run straight into the metal wall.

WESH shared video footage of the aftermath which you can watch here. In the video we can see efforts are being made to save the zebra while shielding what is going on from Guests with a blue tarp. In the end the zebra tragically did not survive the collision. A Disney spokesperson responded to the tragedy noting:

“We are heartbroken over the loss of our Hartmann’s mountain zebra that passed away yesterday and we ask that you keep our dedicated animal care Cast Members in your thoughts.”

It seems clear that the animal care Cast Members are thoroughly devastated by this loss especially after working to try and prevent this outcome for the animal.

If you want to visit Disney’s Animal Kingdom there is a ton to see and do! You can head over to Expedition Everest in Asia to visit the terrifying Yeti. Pandora will bring your Avatar dreams to life with Flight of Passage bringing Guests into the world of the Na’vi. DINOSAUR is still filled with giant dinos at every turn and over at Kilimanjaro Safaris you can take a ride on a real safari and if you are lucky a giraffe might even step in your way! A Celebration of Festival of the Lion King is now running and the show is not one you should miss.

Discovery,"WarnerMedia and Discovery have officially merged to form Warner Bros. Discovery. Yep this means The Sopranos Euphoria and Batman 1000-Lb. Sisters Ancient Aliens and Property Brothers will live under the same roof as the marriage brings together Warner-owned films TV shows channels and its HBO Max streaming service with Discovery brands.

And just like that all this content is coming together like a New Age Voltron.

Excited? As an HBO Max subscriber who doesn't care much about Discovery shows I'm not. Streaming TV prices are going up and I'm constantly comparing which platform has the best throwbacks rotation of fresh titles originals and access to new episodes.

Cord-cutters like me mainly wonder how this merger will affect what we spend on streaming services each month. Netflix sparked outcry over its price bump earlier this year and customers took to social media threatening to jump ship. HBO Max sits on the same side of that expensive table costing us $15 a month for the ultimate ad-free experience and $10 if you don't mind ads. Meanwhile Discovery Plus charges its 22 million subscribers only $5 for its basic plan and $7 for the ad-free version.

Warner Bros. Discovery intends to welcome us into this merged realm with a bundle arrangement a la Hulu with Disney Plus and ESPN Plus -- at first. Then the plan is to create a unified streaming app where HBO Max's goodies are on the same platter as Discovery Plus offerings. But let's be honest: I don't want to see another price hike and you probably don't either.

Force-fed content? No thanks.

When Hulu added Disney Plus and ESPN Plus to its live TV packages it came with a $5 increase and no choice to opt out. Pay more and receive access to these other streaming services whether you want them or not. Will Warner do the same thing?

Though Discovery has some gems in its lineup not all of us happy HBO Max customers want access to its entire streaming catalog. I'm good. If I want I can catch Food Network or OWN shows on another streaming platform that I'm paying for. The same goes for die-hard Chip and Joanna Gaines fans who tune in regularly to the Magnolia Network. It's true you can stream back-to-back episodes of 90 Day Fiancé and more on the current Discovery Plus app but much of it is available elsewhere.

Because I don't watch sports Warner Bros. Discovery's plan to expand that branch of the empire really doesn't speak to me either. And with that said a bunch of old or new content that I'll never watch won't justify a higher subscription price. Paying more money isn't the stuff my dreams are made of. And on the flip side loyal Discovery Plus subscribers who don't want or have HBO Max probably aren't thrilled about potentially coughing up more than $5 a month.

Streaming is starting to feel more like cable TV

Streaming wars became a buzzy term to describe all the media giants becoming contenders in the video-on-demand game. Niche providers and smaller services account for some of that action but when HBO Max stepped into the gladiator arena in 2020 more than 10000 hours of premium movies shows and originals helped it hit the ground running.

In addition to watching HBO classics like Game of Thrones and Warner blockbusters (Harry Potter The Matrix) we get to stream DCEU titles Cartoon Network series like Adventure Time and Max Originals (The White Lotus). Hence the other buzzy term: Prestige Television. HBO falls into this category and it's one of the reasons people pay for it as a premium cable channel.

Integrating HBO Max and Discovery Plus will create a beefier catalog but at what cost to customers? James Martin/CNET

Discovery's brands in the US and internationally are most popular as linear cable networks. That includes Lifetime HGTV TBS Food Network and A&E. This definitely doesn't fit into the prestige TV category. In fact it's drastically different from the majority of Warner and HBO productions. Cable subscribers are pretty much set with Discovery content but they can get HBO Max as an add-on if they want.

As a streaming service HBO Max has exclusive titles and everything under the HBO and Warner banner. Stream its library on demand binge a show and enjoy no matter your age. But with the way these mergers are going all these channels are being mashed together into cable-like packages where you're paying for an extra set of networks you don't want or need. In some cases you're better off skipping a dedicated app and watching episodes on cable or a live TV streaming service like YouTube TV or Sling.

It's turning into a game of who offers what and where can I find it. Cable providers have been playing it for decades and streaming services are slowly morphing into the same system. Shelling out the same amount of money -- or more -- as I would for cable defeats the purpose of paying for a premium streaming service.

What Warner Bros. Discovery should do

The rebranded media giant wants to sell customers on the fact that now there will be more than 200000 hours of TV movies and live programming available to stream on demand. Typically that equates to a price hike. We've seen it before with Netflix Disney Plus Hulu and other providers who tell us that the cost increase is necessary to give us ""more value"" and to fund all the new projects that are in the pipeline. Why wouldn't Warner Bros. Discovery eventually follow suit?

It doesn't have to. After its bundle plans expire it should either keep the monthly prices the same or dare I say it lower them. Grandfather existing customers in with old pricing and snag newbies with a promotional rate before hitting them with a higher monthly fee.

As far as organizing the app gather Discovery networks into a singular hub in the HBO Max app similar to how there are already designated hubs for HBO Studio Ghibli and DC. Or divide the Discovery brands into their own hubs. Just don't spam viewers with ads for all the content that we're not watching. Let the algorithm reflect what someone is really interested in seeing.

It's unlikely that a combined mega app will give any of us the choice to opt out of specific programming -- for me it'd be the Discovery Plus stuff -- but surely these two titans can cut us a little bit of slack by keeping the cost the same. I'd hate to cancel my HBO Max.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaWxsdW1pbmVyZGkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMTcvd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LWZlaWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros Discovery Desire A New “Feige” To Overhaul DC,"Now that Warner Bros. Discovery is here DC is under new management and from the looks of it they’re not happy with the lack of direction in DC content across all entertainment mediums most especially in film television and streaming.

Discovery closed its 43 billion dollar merger with Warnermedia less than a week ago building the new foundation for scripted and unscripted content that is Warner Bros. Discovery. David Zaslav the CEO of the combined companies and his team have been playing with the idea of turning DC into its own solidified content vertical according to sources close to Variety.

RELATED: BATGIRL: LESLIE GRACE TEASES NEW FILM’S STORY AND POTENTIAL SEQUEL

The move would most likely impact DC feature film development in the Warner Bros. Pictures Group streaming series at Warner Bros. Television as well as content on cable television. Any way you look at it monumental changes are heading to DC entertainment in an effort to bring more coherency to their content so that they can have a better fighting chance against Marvel.

Warner Bros. Discovery’s Search For DC’s Own “Feige” Has Already Begun

Zaslav has already been scouting candidates with experience in developing and fostering popular intellectual property with the intent of potentially finding someone to function as a creative and strategic pilot similar to the Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige since before the merger closed. One of those candidates included Emma Watts a former head film executive at 20th Century Studios and Paramount but it does not seem likely that Watts will take the position. One of Variety’s insiders suggested that Zaslav was less interested in finding a creative guru and more eager to hire someone who had the type of business background needed to keep all the different factions at DC working more harmoniously.

It is the belief of Discovery insiders that DC lacks a functioning brand strategy despite the success of films such as Aquaman and The Batman. Most agreeably Discovery believes that iconic superheroes like Superman have been neglected and need to be revitalized. Despite Warner Bros. Discovery’s initiative to breathe new life into iconic characters they acknowledge the success of stand-alone stories like Joker and want to make more like that as well.

Zaslav has committed to funding $3 billion in synergies in the newborn company a clear indication of how important cost-cutting will be to Warner Bros. Discovery execs.

Upcoming DC Films projects include Shazam: Fury Of The Gods Aquaman: The Lost Kingdom” the long-awaited Black Adam film starring Dwayne Johnson and the untitled third Wonder Woman film starring Gal Gadot.

Could Another DCEU Reboot Be On The Horizon?

It’s possible and very likely that Warner Bros. Discovery will decide to reboot the DC Extended Universe while keeping separate DC films like Joker and The Batman intact. We may even see an entirely new DCEU with fresh new actors portraying iconic heroes vile villains and other characters regardless of the plans that the upcoming The Flash film were setting in motion.

Of course it will still take some time before whatever Warner Bros. Discovery’s plans for DC’s cinematic universe and other content come into fruition. The current slate of upcoming DC productions will still come out whether you like or not. It won’t be financially responsible if WBD abandoned those films that have already been produced before they’re released they would be at a loss if they did that. Also Walter Hamada is still the president of DC Films his contract is slated to end by the end of 2023 that’s a key factor to consider it’s expected that Zaslav is waiting until Hamada’s departure before he put his plans for DC into effect.

All things considered I think we’ll see this new development for DC entertainment begin to take shape by 2024/2025. Most of us can agree that the DCEU is a mess and the only good DC show on The CW is Superman & Lois. DC is in desperate need of a renovation if they need to reboot everything more or less so that they can have a clearer path to success then so be it.

These animals are overwhelmingly raised on what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the agriculture industry call Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). We call them factory farms. Each CAFO may hold tens or even hundreds of thousands of animals sealed inside in extremely crowded conditions.

In addition to causing immense animal suffering raising this many animals in these conditions does enormous environmental damage. Globally animal agriculture represents 14.5% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. While much discussion is devoted to methane from cows the massive feed-crop production and manure associated with all CAFOs—cattle pork and poultry—are significant contributors to air and water pollution as well as climate-warming emissions.

In the U.S. animals on CAFOs produce an estimated 885 billion pounds of manure each year none of which is treated or regulated by a government agency.

Nearly 50% of corn and 70% of soy grown in the U.S. is produced to feed animals raised in CAFOs. Those crops consume vast quantities of water and require enormous amounts of fossil fuels and pesticides all of which adds to the environmental footprint of the final product.

Despite its heavy environmental impact industrial animal agriculture is largely exempted from federal and state air and water pollution regulations that apply to other major industries just as it is exempt from almost all state and federal animal-protection laws.

With the evidence mounting about this industry’s cruelty and its connection to climate change the ASPCA is working alongside environmental advocates to replace factory farming with higher-welfare pasture-based animal farming and more plant-based alternatives. Learn more:

The Water Air and Climate Impacts of Factory Farming

Factory Farms Pollute Our Water In traditional farming animals distribute their waste as they move which can be beneficial to the land. With industrial operations tens of thousands of animals are housed in sheds or pens which in addition to causing frustration stress and painful ailments for animals leads to massive build-ups of manure. It's estimated that every minute nearly 2 million pounds of excrement are produced by animals raised on CAFOs in the U.S. Unlike human waste manure from CAFOs is not treated and typically gets flushed into underground pits or lagoons that are several acres wide. It is stored there until it is applied as fertilizer on fields. But the quantity of waste produced on factory farms cannot easily be absorbed resulting in over-application and runoff of the manure—and all of the chemicals toxins and bacteria it contains—into local waterways. It is also common for the pits or lagoons to leak break or overflow contaminating groundwater. Animal agriculture is the leading polluter of U.S. rivers and streams the second-largest source of wetlands contamination and the third-largest source of lake pollution. As a result CAFOs have severe impacts on aquatic health as excessive nutrient concentrations from manure such as nitrogen or phosphorus can make water uninhabitable or cause harmful algal blooms. Rural communities rely heavily on groundwater wells for drinking water and the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2000 National Water Quality Inventory found that 29 states specifically identified CAFOs as contributing to drinking water quality impairment. Cleanup expenses from CAFOs have cost municipal water systems over $1.1 billion over the past 10 years.

Factory Farms Are Water Hogs While pollution is a more visible problem the immense water demand from CAFOs has alarming environmental and community impacts as well. Globally agriculture uses more freshwater than any other human activity and about one-third of that water is for livestock production. Private residential water use makes up 5% of total consumption in the U.S. In contrast animal agriculture makes up 55% of total water consumption. In the time it takes to brush your teeth U.S. animal agriculture uses more than 209 million gallons of water. Drinking water for farm animals accounted for water withdrawals of 2 billion gallons per day mostly from fresh groundwater sources and are the equivalent to the amount of water consumed by 20000 households over the course of an entire year. While animals do drink a lot of water in the U.S. up to 98% of the water involved in livestock production was used to grow animal feed.

Factory Farms Contaminate Our Air Raising animals in crowded conditions indoors surrounded by their own waste affects air quality inside the facilities leading to high concentrations of ammonia hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide and particulate matter (small particles that can be inhaled). This in turn impacts animals’ welfare causing issues like respiratory diseases in cattle raised in feedlots and ammonia-induced eye and skin problems in chickens. Airborne contaminants from manure and dust also pollute the air in surrounding communities pushed out of the facilities by ventilation systems in CAFO buildings and vaporized after manure is applied to land as fertilizer. A recent study showed that agriculture in the U.S. results in over 12000 air quality-related deaths attributable to animal agriculture each year. Ammonia and particulate matter from factory farms can cause asthma bronchitis and other breathing problems and long-term exposure to these emissions increases the risk of dying of heart disease cancer and stroke. In addition to inhaling toxins communities near CAFOs are plagued by noxious smells from manure lagoons decreasing quality of life and home/property values and causing serious mental health issues including depression and anxiety.

Factory Farming Is Driving Climate Change While the transportation and energy sectors are often called out for their role in climate change it’s less understood that animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5% of all human-made greenhouse gases. Factory farms emit methane and nitrous oxide which are up to 300 times more damaging as greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. The greatest contributor to overall emissions from animal agriculture is the enormous production and processing of feed crops like corn and soybeans which are the exclusive source of food for pigs and poultry species raised indoors on CAFOs and a significant portion of dairy and beef cows’ diet.

Switch from Beef to Chicken? Not So Fast. Some researchers have pointed out that beef production contributes the most to greenhouse gases and encourage consumers to “eat smaller” by consuming more poultry and fish. EPA data shows that beef and dairy production account for almost 80% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions. But while poultry and some pork have lower production-related emissions simply switching from beef to chicken is not a climate-friendly choice and it does more harm to more animals. Alarmingly it takes 134 chickens to get the same amount of meat as one cow so as consumers swap beef for chicken billions more animals suffer on factory farms. Chicken CAFOs contribute heavily to air and water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through feed production fossil fuel use and manure management. One area where the pork poultry and dairy industries’ environmental footprints equal or outweigh that of beef is in manure management which represents a significant portion of livestock’s emissions. Poultry litter has been shown to contaminate surrounding waterways with excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous causing dead zones and introducing pathogens including antibiotic-resistant bacteria. As this waste is applied to fields the impact is felt in waterways. Poultry products also have a significant environmental footprint because of the reliance on pesticide- and herbicide-laden feed crops in a CAFO setting as opposed to beef cattle and dairy cows who sustain themselves on grass for at least part of their lives.

The Environmental Impacts of Plant-based Food

There is no question that industrial production of meat eggs and dairy take a huge toll on animals the environment and communities near these facilities. On top of subjecting animals to suffering and endangering our health these industries require a staggering amount of our finite resources and produce climate-warming gases. Yet Americans are eating record amounts of animal products—an annual average of 138.4 pounds of red meat and poultry per person—the vast majority of which is from CAFOs. This is simply not sustainable. It is also not feasible or even environmentally beneficial to take all of the billions of animals currently housed in CAFOs and move them to pasture.

Meanwhile resource use and greenhouse gas emissions from production of plant-based food is significantly lower than those from animal-based foods. Despite a few areas where plant-based products have a heavier water or land footprint almost all of the leading ingredients in plant-based products consume significantly less land and water and have greatly reduced greenhouse gas emissions: 29% compared to 57% for conventional animal products.

Nearly one in four Americans (23%) said they were trying to eat less meat in 2019 and that number has continued to climb in later surveys.

Reducing animal products can range from cutting out meat for one or more days a week going plant-based for breakfast and lunch or opting for smaller portions of animal products. Increasing plants in one’s diet may mean swapping in some of the new products designed to mimic meat eggs or dairy or it may mean increasing beans legumes mushrooms and other hearty nutrient-dense plant foods.

The Environmental Benefits of Pasture-Based Foods

Raising animals indoors in intensive confinement is extremely harmful to animals and our environment. Plant-based food can dramatically reduce those harms. But given that the majority of people will continue to eat meat eggs or dairy is there a form of animal agriculture that is better for animals and our environment?

Industry groups are focused on technologies and feed additives that marginally reduce greenhouse gas emissions but this approach does not address the underlying cause of the pollution and environmental damage not to mention intense animal suffering. Pasture-raising animals on the other hand addresses that imbalance: there are fewer animals animals are raised outdoors at densities that meet the land’s carrying capacity more manure is spread across the land and in the case of grazing animals there is less reliance on feed crops.

While raising animals on well-managed pastures can improve water quality and reduce water demand improve soil health and even mitigate climate impacts this land- and time-intensive approach to animal agriculture also has some real environmental limits. To achieve the joint animal and environmental benefits of pasture-based farming we must raise significantly fewer animals annually which means reducing consumption of animal products.

Pasture-Based Impacts on Water Use and Quality Because manure on pasture-based farms is generally not stored in lagoons or pits pasture-based systems have greatly reduced risks of water impairment events since they don’t run the risk of manure leaching into groundwater or runoff into local waterways. Farm animals in CAFOs require significant amounts of water both for drinking and as an input for the massive amounts of grain required for feed. When ruminant animals (beef cattle dairy cows sheep goats) are pasture-raised they rely on grasses that are predominantly rain-fed and store moisture in the soil thus reducing water usage in the system. While CAFOs and grain production deplete water reserves pastures that include a diverse mixture of grasses legumes and broadleaf plants including drought-resistant species can often withstand water shortages. Further benefits to water are gained through pasture-based farming’s reduced reliance on feed crops. Corn and soy are water-intensive products which when grown for conventional feed crops tend to pollute waterways. Soy production has been shown to cause waterway eutrophication (when water becomes uninhabitable due to excess nutrients) from fertilizer nutrient runoff and heavy herbicide application. Most of the herbicides contain glyphosate —which may persist in soil plants and water reaching both surface water and groundwater—potentially changing the soil’s properties and growth and even causing human toxicity. Similarly corn grown for animal agriculture is heavily fertilized for maximum output and the excess nitrogen contributes to waterway eutrophication. Alfalfa also commonly relies on herbicides and pesticides.

Pasture-Based Impacts on Soil Health Grazing animals distribute manure in sustainable amounts directly on the land building soil health and recycling nutrients. The U.S. is losing an unsustainable amount of nutrient-rich topsoil each year in large part because of practices used to grow corn and soy for animal feed. Well-managed grazing returns nutrients to the soil—moderate amounts of manure act as natural fertilizers for the soil. Compared with row crops pasture-raising animals reduces soil loss by as much as 93%. Integrating livestock into crop rotations can control weeds increase yields and reduce fertilizer use.

Pasture-Based Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions Manure distributed by animals on pasture emits fewer toxins and greenhouse gases than lagoon or pit manure storage associated with factory farming. One study showed that shifting pigs to pasture-based systems could realize a 29% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions and a 7% reduction in methane emissions when compared to the emissions of an industrial factory farm. For pasture-based systems to have a relatively beneficial impact on greenhouse gas emissions the animals’ movement and the pasture itself needs to be closely managed. A study showed that farm animal management systems such as “adaptive multi-paddock grazing” have the potential to cut livestock emissions by more than half when compared to intensive CAFO systems. Well-managed grazing -- where animals are moved regularly to allow the pasture to rejuvenate and pastures are seeded with high quality forage that accelerates animals’ growth -- can help restore degraded rangeland and increase soil carbon sequestration (the re-capture of carbon) through plant growth and improved soil health. The Food & Agriculture Organization estimated that improved grazing management practices on current grasslands had the combined potential to trap the equivalent of 585 million tons of carbon over 20 years representing about 8% of livestock supply chain emissions. With reduced demand for factory farmed animal products the conversion of land currently used to grow conventional feed crops into well-managed pastureland could further offset the greenhouse gas emissions of animal agriculture. While conversion of land used for feed crops to pasture could have benefits to the environment other types of land conversion to expand pasture-based farming such as converting forest to pasture has the opposite effect and instead leads to an increased carbon footprint.

Take Action: How You Can Protect Animals & The Environment

Researchers farmers and advocates continue to debate the comparative environmental and animal benefits of eating plant-based foods versus more humane pasture-based animal products. The truth is either or any combination of these two approaches can spare farmed animals from the suffering they endure now on factory farms and reduce our individual dietary impact on the environment. What matters most is that we take some action. It’s not all or nothing but for animals and the environment it’s urgent that we each do something.

The meeting was held at Maria’s by the Sea on Wednesday April 13 and featured remarks from Premier and Minister of Finance Honourable Andrew A. Fahie Minister for Health and Social Development Honourable Carvin Malone and presentations from Director of Strategy at the RDA Dr. Neil Smith and Consultant Ms. Noni Georges.

The meeting was streamed on social media Webex carried live on CBN Radio 90.9 FM and provided the community with an opportunity to learn about Government’s plan to manage waste and provided a forum for feedback on those plans.

As part of his presentation Dr. Smith outlined a number of strategies which included the following:

The emphasis on recycling to reduce the garbage stream by 60%

To use the Pockwood Pond site as the treatment location of waste at the tertiary stage but not for storage

The treatment options at the Pockwood Pond site should allow for 100% redundancy allowing a 24 hour operation

Cox Heath Pockwood Pond or Paraquita Bay were identified as possible options for tertiary stage treated solid waste to be stored.

The identification of sites for reclamation

“We want the community to know that none of these options are etched in stone we have not made any decisions on anything as yet.

That is why we are coming to you to let you know our thoughts and for you to provide feedback on what is presented” Honourable Malone stated. The health Minister further stated that effective waste management has been at the top of his agenda however the impact of COVID caused the project to slow down but Government remains committed to solving the Territory’s waste management issues.

The community can view the meeting on Government’s Facebook page @BVIGovernment and still provide feedback which will be taken into consideration during the decision-making process.

Meanwhile the community is being asked to do their part to keep the Virgin Islands clean and green using the 7Rs of the waste management strategy which includes Reform Restrict Reduce Recycle Return and Rethink how waste products are managed.

Pleading for garbage collection to revert to municipal corporations during Thursday’s meeting of the St Catherine Municipal Corporation Treadways Councillor Sydney Rose said the pile-up of waste across the Old Capital was a crisis.

“This garbage situation is at a crisis proportion. Spanish Town is nasty. Rodents and roaches are all over the place. I think the time has come for the collection of garbage to return to the municipal corporations. I am positive they will do a better job” Rose said.

He was supported by Westchester Councillor Renair Benjamin who urged the corporation to ask the prime minister to declare St Catherine a disaster parish.

Scott took issue with the suggestion but agreed that the garbage collection system was not working in the interest of the people and the town.

“I have personally observed the garbage situation and numerous mini-garbage dumps in different sections of town” the mayor said. “But what we need is the NSWMA to deploy enough resources to clear the entire backlog and to clean all these mini-garbage dumps that have [popped] up in the town.”

Scott added: “What is happening at the Old Harbour Road roundabout with pile-up of solid waste and garbage is a disgrace; they (NSWMA) have the resources and they need to address this crisis” Scott said.

“When you drive on Manchester Street there are several mini-garbage dumps; inside the Number 5 Cemetery; there is one on King Street and I could go on. I hear people bashing me on talk shows about how nasty the town is but when I call NSWMA no one responds it seems to me that no collection is done in inner cities so the people have no other choice but to raise up mini-garbage dumps” he concluded.

NSWMA parish officer Daniel Heaven acknowledged that there was a backlog in garbage collection which he said was largely due to inadequate resources.

He however said that the agency has started doing night collections to clear the backlog.

“The truth about it is that mini-garbage dumps have increased and I have spoken to the public health inspector for Spanish Town to get me an estimate of all the mini-garbage dumps across Spanish Town” he said adding that the agency is now increasing the resources inside the St Catherine capital to ensure that the town centre is kept clean throughout the day.

Sports18 will strive to be India's most-coveted broadcast network by providing fans easy access to a comprehensive bouquet of international and premier sports content"" Viacom18 Sports CEO Anil Jayaraj said.While the channel may receive its own share of traction the launch itself wasn't the only reason why the ripples made waves on Friday. It was the timing of this 'soft launch' weeks ahead of the Indian Premier League 's (IPL) 2023-27 cycle of media rights going on sale that caused the effect.TV18 is the subsidiary of the Network18 Group the mass-media arm of Reliance Industries that was among the first companies to pick up the Invitation-To-Tender (ITT) for the IPL rights in the second week of June.Alongside Network18 American media conglomerate Disney  global e-commerce and content giant Amazon Sony Corp-owned SPNI (Sony Pictures Pvt Ltd) and the Zee Group are among the major players who have picked up the tender document.The BCCI had brought out the ITT earlier this month inviting potential bidders to participate in an e-auction (in the second week of June) for the sale of the coveted IPL rights. There has been heavy speculation over the last few weeks that Viacom18 is all set to enter into a 'massive bidding war' with the above-mentioned global and local players to grab those rights.There is also serious chatter that the value of IPL rights for this upcoming cycle could go way north of Rs 60000 crore given participants in the fray and the dynamics fuelling it.""For the first time they've (Viacom18) dipped their little big toe into these (sports broadcast) waters. The launch of this channel and the timing of it has the obviousness of what is being discussed in hushed tones for a while now"" say senior industry executives.This 'speculation' has much to do with the word doing the rounds that Reliance-backed Viacom18 will go 'all out' to secure the IPL rights. The broadcast-arm of India's largest private limited company is being seen as a ""disruptor"" of sorts by industry-players. With parent company Reliance Industries having major interests in telecom and e-retail the grabbing of IPL rights - one that guarantees eyeballs in India like no other property - is not being seen from the perspective of 'broadcasting' alone.""Cricket like any other sport until now was just content apropos of its popularity and demand in India. A broadcaster bought it at a price and sold it across platforms (TV & digital) that guaranteed DTH / digital subscriptions (viewership) ad revenue and social engagement. Over the last couple of years with OTT platforms consolidating battle for subscriptions resulting in pricing wars e-businesses sprouting and sharing of content becoming a global norm viewership space has seen rapid changes"" say those tracking these developments.Viacom18 can soon be expected to make similar announcements - such as this brand new sports channel - in the OTT segment too giving their existing platforms the necessary boost.""HotStar is a prime example that encapsulates a bit of everything over the last few years. When (former Star India boss) Uday Shankar was heading Star he gave the company the impetus and the direction by creating a platform (HotStar) that was among the major selling points for Disney to start eyeing Fox. Eventually when Disney bought Fox close to 18% of that deal - valued in excess of US$52b essentially the deal-sweetener was Fox's India business"" say industry executives.Shankar and Jayaraj were colleagues when Star India (part of the Disney umbrella now) wrote a winning cheque of Rs 16347 crore to bag the IPL rights in 2017 for the 2018-22 rights cycle.Those keeping an eye on the developments say creating a value-driven platform this time not necessarily from the perspective of 'decking up the bride for marriage' (read: the prospect of a future sale like Fox to Disney) but to engage with consumers pan-India from the standpoint of retaining market footprint alone will once again be at play.Going forward the sale of IPL rights in June offers to take the idea of 'content' beyond the spectrum of just engaging with sport fans. Sport content apropos of traditional linear broadcast or modern-day tech-driven digital dissemination is now being seen as a major catalyst catering to other businesses and guaranteeing more eyeballs across mediums.""The sale of IPL media rights is not about cricket anymore. Cricket is the dessert in an a-la-carte that has other tantalizing appetizers and main courses"" industry heads say. ""You have to consume it all before you get to the dessert"".The channel that got launched is merely the window offering a peek.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvcHJvcGVydHkvZ29sZC1jb2FzdC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1iaWdnZXJhLXdhdGVycy1hbmQtdGhlLWZpZ2h0LXRvLXN0b3AtaGFyYm91ci10b3duLXNob3BwaW5nLWNlbnRyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2UyNTkyNjMwNWZlMzEyOTdmODBkOWY0YTQ5OGIxZTNh0gGzAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGRjb2FzdGJ1bGxldGluLmNvbS5hdS9wcm9wZXJ0eS9nb2xkLWNvYXN0LXByb3BlcnR5LWJpZ2dlcmEtd2F0ZXJzLWFuZC10aGUtZmlnaHQtdG8tc3RvcC1oYXJib3VyLXRvd24tc2hvcHBpbmctY2VudHJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvZTI1OTI2MzA1ZmUzMTI5N2Y4MGQ5ZjRhNDk4YjFlM2E_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside story: How Coast shopping centre transformed suburb,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/property/gold-coast-property-biggera-waters-and-the-fight-to-stop-harbour-town-shopping-centre/news-story/e25926305fe31297f80d9f4a498b1e3a on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvcHJvcGVydHkvZ29sZC1jb2FzdC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1iaWdnZXJhLXdhdGVycy1hbmQtdGhlLWZpZ2h0LXRvLXN0b3AtaGFyYm91ci10b3duLXNob3BwaW5nLWNlbnRyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2UyNTkyNjMwNWZlMzEyOTdmODBkOWY0YTQ5OGIxZTNh0gGzAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGRjb2FzdGJ1bGxldGluLmNvbS5hdS9wcm9wZXJ0eS9nb2xkLWNvYXN0LXByb3BlcnR5LWJpZ2dlcmEtd2F0ZXJzLWFuZC10aGUtZmlnaHQtdG8tc3RvcC1oYXJib3VyLXRvd24tc2hvcHBpbmctY2VudHJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvZTI1OTI2MzA1ZmUzMTI5N2Y4MGQ5ZjRhNDk4YjFlM2E_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvcHJvcGVydHkvcWxkLXVuaXQtY29tcGxleGVzLXdpdGgtdGhlLW1vc3QtYm9keS1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtY29tcGxhaW50cy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzE3MTdkMzk3OWVlNGEzMTYwNGJjZGNmZDEzMzRiNDI50gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJpZXJtYWlsLmNvbS5hdS9wcm9wZXJ0eS9xbGQtdW5pdC1jb21wbGV4ZXMtd2l0aC10aGUtbW9zdC1ib2R5LWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1jb21wbGFpbnRzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMTcxN2QzOTc5ZWU0YTMxNjA0YmNkY2ZkMTMzNGI0Mjk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qld units with most body corporate complaints revealed,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.couriermail.com.au/property/qld-unit-complexes-with-the-most-body-corporate-complaints/news-story/1717d3979ee4a31604bcdcfd1334b429 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvcHJvcGVydHkvcWxkLXVuaXQtY29tcGxleGVzLXdpdGgtdGhlLW1vc3QtYm9keS1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtY29tcGxhaW50cy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzE3MTdkMzk3OWVlNGEzMTYwNGJjZGNmZDEzMzRiNDI50gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJpZXJtYWlsLmNvbS5hdS9wcm9wZXJ0eS9xbGQtdW5pdC1jb21wbGV4ZXMtd2l0aC10aGUtbW9zdC1ib2R5LWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1jb21wbGFpbnRzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMTcxN2QzOTc5ZWU0YTMxNjA0YmNkY2ZkMTMzNGI0Mjk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Stadium Info FANFARE Score: 3.14

Wells Fargo Arena 730 3rd St Des Moines IA 50309

Year Opened: 2005 Capacity: 16110





Iowa Wolves

Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines Iowa is one of three complexes (along with Hy-Vee Hall and Community Choice Convention Center) that comprise the Iowa Events Center.





Located on the banks of the Des Moines River Wells Fargo Arena opened in 2005 replacing Veteran’s Memorial Auditorium as the primary venue for sporting events and concerts in Des Moines. Since 2007 the arena is home to the Iowa Wolves of the NBA G League. The Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League began play in the arena during the 2008 season and the Iowa Wild of the American Hockey League began play in the arena in 2013. The Iowa Chops of the American Hockey League also played in the arena from 2005-2009. In 2016 the arena hosted first and second round games for the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.





Prior to the 2015-2016 season the arena spent $1.6 million on a brand new video board. The HD board (sitting above center court) has curved screens for easier viewing by fans all over the arena.





Food & Beverage 2

Wells Fargo Arena offers food and drinks in the traditional open concourse style. Normal stadium fare is available with very little wait time. Brats and hot dogs along with popcorn and other snacks are your main options with entrees running $5-$10 and snacks $3-$5.





Coke products are served throughout the arena. Also available are a litany of different beers along with wine and mixed drinks. Most items go for $10-$12.





There are other concessions areas but they were all closed on this night. Perhaps for other events with bigger crowds they would be open as well.





Atmosphere 3

In addition to traditional seating there are plenty of luxury suites overlooking the floor along with seats right on the court. Seats are padded and comfortable with cup holders on the back of all the seats. It is easy to find the score as it is available on all four sides above the lower seating bowl as well as above the court on the video board. The video board above the court also shows replays and stats throughout the game. The arena has a nice layout which allows for quick trips to both concessions and the restrooms.





Alpha the mascot spends the majority of the time walking through the crowd but does appear on court to throw a few items into the crowd. The arena floor is much bigger than your typical basketball court. As such there is a big gap between the floor and the seating bowl especially on the baselines. The view from the baseline seats are very good but with the large gap it can be a little distracting.





Neighborhood 5

Located in downtown Des Moines Wells Fargo Arena is near many great attractions and plenty of places to eat and drink. At night all the bridges in the area light up creating an amazing scene with the lights reflecting off the water. Across the river stands the Iowa capitol building which is an amazing building inside and out. In addition the Iowa History Museum and Science Center of Iowa are a few blocks away.





There is no shortage of great places to grab a drink or have a meal before or after the game. Directly across the street from the arena is Buzzard Billy’s. Offering up great Cajun food and plenty of drinks Buzzard Billy’s is a popular post-game stop. The catfish is highly recommended.





Just across the Grand Ave bridge on the corner of 4th St. is Zombie Burger. This ghoul-themed eatery has been getting national attention lately for its unique burger combinations. The food is great and they offer a big line of microbrews to suit any taste.





No trip to Des Moines would be complete without a trip to the El Bait Shop. El Bait Shop has nothing to do with fishing. What it does have is 222 different beers on tap which they claim is the largest selection of American craft beers in the world. In addition they serve some great bar food. This is one of Des Moines’ more popular hangouts and well worth a visit. Whatever your tastes you are certain to find it within a very short distance from the arena.





Plenty of lodging is available downtown. Directly across the street from the arena is a Fairfield Inn and Suites along with a Comfort Inn.





Fans 2

The fans are about what you would expect for an NBA G League team. There are a group of hard cores that make noise follow the game closely and rock their Wolves gear. You also have the casual fans that just come to see a basketball game and another group of folks that are there because their son or daughter is performing at halftime and they don’t particularly care about the game.





Access 5

Wells Fargo Arena is located downtown and sits right off of I-235 making it very easy to access. Parking is available right across the street for $8. You can also park at a parking structure on Fifth and Keo for $5 and take the Skywalk (enclosed area that goes building to building that is very beneficial in the winter). On evenings and weekends metered parking is free but downtown Des Moines is quite popular and open spots around the arena don’t last long. The concourse is very wide and there are no problems getting around. The entire building is handicap accessible. There are plenty of restrooms that are very clean and wait times for concessions are generally very short.





Return on Investment 3

Ticket prices generally range from $18-$36 depending on your choice of seating. The Wolves have quite a few specials throughout the season so you can typically purchase tickets for a cheaper price if you go with their promotions. There aren’t any bad seats as there are no restricted views and even if you are sitting on one of the baselines it is still very easy to see the game and getting refreshments or using the restroom is convenient. With average concession prices and $5-$8 parking you can have a fun night at the game without breaking the bank.





Extras 2

The arena does a good job of celebrating the accomplishments of its tenants. Banners adorn the ceiling including the D-League championship banner that the Energy (now Wolves) won in 2011.





Prior to the 2017-2018 season the Wolves signed a single affiliation deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The team’s color scheme changed to make it similar to their northern partners and the Wolves do a great job of celebrating and promoting that relationship with Minnesota.





Final Thoughts

Des Moines is a great town and Wells Fargo is a nice arena. A pleasant staff and quality basketball round out what is an enjoyable game day experience. If you find yourself in Des Moines be sure to take in a Wolves game.

It is advisable to call your local branch to find out what hours they will be open this weekend if they open at all – but don’t be too surprised if no one picks up the phone. Even if your local branch is closed this weekend you will still be able to access online and mobile banking services or withdraw cash from ATM machines if you need to. If you are transferring money be aware that all operations will not be processed until banks reopen for business on Monday morning.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWNhbWVyYS9uYW1lL2Vkd2FyZC1hbHRtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQyOTQ4ODnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edward Altman Obituary (2022) - Westminster CO - The Daily Camera,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dailycamera/name/edward-altman-obituary?id=34294889 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWNhbWVyYS9uYW1lL2Vkd2FyZC1hbHRtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQyOTQ4ODnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaS5jb20vZmFubmF0aW9uL25iYS9mYXN0YnJlYWsvbmV3cy9oZXJlLWlzLXdoYXQtcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLTc2ZXJzLXR5cmVzZS1tYXhleS1zYWlkLWFmdGVyLWNhcmVlci1uaWdodC1pbi1nYW1lLTEtYWdhaW5zdC10b3JvbnRvLXJhcHRvcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's What Tyrese Maxey Said After Scoring 38 Points Against Toronto In Game 1,"The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Toronto Raptors 131-111 in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series on Saturday and second-year guard Tyrese Maxey had this to say after recording a playoff career-high 38 points in the win.

After trading Ben Simmons for James Harden at the trade deadline there is an enormous amount of pressure on the Philadelphia 76ers to not only win their first-round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors but go deep into the postseason and potentially win a championship.

The 76ers handled things pretty well on Saturday against the Toronto Raptors and if there was anyone in Wells Fargo Arena that was not feeling any sense of pressure in this game it was Tyrese Maxey.

Time-and-time again this season Tyrese Maxey has stepped up in big moments for the 76ers next to their two All-Stars in Joel Embiid and James Harden.

Their first playoff game of 2022 was no exception as Maxey tallied a playoff career-high 38 points on 14-21 shooting 5-8 from three-point range. He also finished with 4 rebounds 2 assists and went 5-5 from the free-throw line in the win.

“It’s a testimony to the work” Maxey said right after the game in response to his performance. “I always tell people the work that you put in when nobody else is around early mornings 6 a.m. late nights it shows when you perform in front of thousands.”

Tyrese Maxey is just in his second NBA season but the young guard has worked vigorously to not only improve his game but prove that he is the final piece to the Philadelphia 76ers’ championship puzzle.

A few weeks back Sixers’ head coach Doc Rivers talked about his young guard’s work ethic stating that Maxey never wants to leave the gym when the team has blackout days and forces players to take a break from practicing so they do not get burned out. Rivers even said that they have had to lock the gym because of him calling it the “Tyrese Rule.”

“We just have to go out here and fight it is going to be a fight every single night” Maxey went on to say. “That’s one down job’s not done… I just go out here and try to do my best to help us win I mean I do not get into all the shenanigans. I show up every day and do my job that’s what I tell my teammates.”

With his 38-point performance on Saturday Tyrese Maxey became the first 76ers’ player with the most points in their first postseason game since Allen Iverson and he also joined LeBron James (three times) and Magic Johnson (once) as the only players in NBA playoff history to score at least 38 points at 22 years 163 days or younger per team release.

Winning Game 1 the Philadelphia 76ers hold a 1-0 series lead over the Toronto Raptors and will host the Raptors again on Monday at 7:30 p.m. ET. on TNT.

X-rays on Barnes' ankle came back negative but Raptors coach Nick Nurse said further imaging would be done Sunday. He gave the same report on Raptors forward Thaddeus Young who left the game in the second quarter with a left thumb sprain.

""It's tough man"" Raptors forward Pascal Siakam said of Barnes' injury. ""Obviously he works extremely hard and he's been playing awesome this season. And I know he was super excited about the playoffs and wanting to be there and play.

""So yeah man we'll see. Obviously we hope to have him next game. But yeah it's definitely tough to see him go down. And I know that it's hard for him because he wanted to be out there with us.""

Barnes was in the lane playing defense when 76ers star Joel Embiid inadvertently stepped on his left foot while driving into the lane. Barnes immediately went down in a heap and grabbed at his left foot visibly in pain and remained down for several minutes while being attended to by Toronto's training staff. He was eventually helped to Toronto's locker room without being able to put much if any weight on his left foot.

Barnes was ruled out for the game a short time later. He had 15 points 10 rebounds and eight assists in 31 minutes in his first career playoff game.

""I thought he was pretty good"" Nurse said of how Barnes played before his injury in his first NBA playoff game. ""I thought he was playing good. I thought he looked confident out there was making good plays. Would have liked him to get a few more attempts at the rim or just shot attempts in general. Geez he put up 15 he was getting to the free throw line I thought he was cutting well made some nice passes. I thought he looked like he belonged out there. For a young rookie in his first playoff game on the road against a really good team I thought he looked like he belonged out there.""

Barnes the fourth pick in last year's draft has been terrific in his debut season and was neck-and-neck with Cleveland Cavaliers forward Evan Mobley for Rookie of the Year honors all season long. Barnes averaged 15.3 points 7.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists in 74 games for Toronto during the regular season.

Young meanwhile left the game after just a few minutes in the second quarter and was quickly ruled out for the rest of the night as well with his thumb sprain.

Young who was acquired at the NBA's trade deadline by Toronto in a deal with the San Antonio Spurs finished with one rebound in six minutes and missed his only shot in his return to Philadelphia where he began his career after being drafted 12th overall in 2007.

The injuries to Barnes and Young were just one of myriad problems Toronto experienced in Game 1. The Raptors allowed the 76ers to shoot 51% from the field including 50% (16-for-32) from 3-point range. Toronto also was outrebounded 39-36 including 10-7 on offensive boards and forced only four Philadelphia turnovers including none in the first half.

And while Nurse was quick to praise the 76ers saying they were the more physical team and outplayed the Raptors on Saturday he also said he thought more calls should have been made against Embiid who had 19 points 15 rebounds and four assists while going to the free throw line 11 times.

""The counter is we've got to believe that if we're legal defensively that they're going to call those"" Nurse said. ""Like we had a couple of times where we beat him to the spot and he bowled us right over and they just let him lay it in.

""I don't care if you're 5-foot-11 and 160 pounds if you beat him to the spot and he runs over it's a foul. I thought he threw three or four elbows to the face. He got called for one. OK. I mean we're gonna stand in there. We just need if we're legal defensively then we've got to have them called or we don't have a chance period. Nobody can guard that guy if they're just gonna let him run you over time and time again.

""We're gonna stand in there and we'll see if we don't get a few more elbow to the face calls and a few more beat them to the spot calls."""

With a 70 per cent market share generic drugs form the largest segment of the Indian pharma sector. Over-The-Counter (OTC) medicines constitute about 21 per cent of the market while patented drugs have a nine per cent share. The country is the world’s largest supplier of generics accounting for 20 per cent of the global exports. Moreover India is the world’s third-largest manufacturer of drugs by volume and the largest exporter of formulations.

These numbers are promising. However India cannot take its position for granted as pharma firms across the globe are targetting new markets in search of growth. Given the shrinking pipelines complex regulatory processes increased scrutiny licence and patent expirations and tough competition from generics manufacturers these firms are scrutinising ways that can get them in the groove. Organic growth strategies take longer to yield results. Companies need to make considerable investment in terms of time and resources as formulations have to pass through several phases including R&D and approval to reach the market. M&A deals present a tempting proposition for pharma companies by helping them quickly reach new markets.

According to “CFO Survey 2021: A resilient India poised to thrive in the new normal” (conducted by Deloitte India) 55 per cent CFOs in the Life Sciences and Healthcare (LSHC) sector agreed that they give priority to M&A deals. Supporting these findings are the M&A deal value numbers that increased to $1.9 billion in H1 2021 from $772 million in the same period last year.

M&A strategies

Two main goals drive most of the pharma M&A deals: (a) maintaining a hold on the market while amplifying the current performance and (b) embracing innovative and disruptive technologies to get ahead of the competition instead of reinventing the wheel. Fulfilling the first goal calls for a defensive M&A strategy while chasing the second one needs an offensive strategy.

The followers of defensive strategy prioritise acquisition of assets to fill gaps in the core portfolio capture synergy for completed transactions and restore “the balance” in financial statements by restructuring portfolios and divesting non-core assets. Those embracing offensive strategy prefer acquiring disruptive and innovative assets and competitors to enter new-growth segments accelerating digital transformation and collaborating with peers.

Based on the findings of “CFO Survey 2021” the table below shows M&A trends across different sectors. More than half of the CFOs from the LSHC sector give priority to M&A activity – the data indicates an almost equal mix of defensive (55 per cent) and offensive (45 per cent) strategies.

These findings indicate that CFOs are still more inclined towards boosting their product and pipeline diversity scale and pricing power. M&A deals can fast-track their companies’ growth. These deals also make a lot of sense for pharma companies as commercialisation of drugs takes considerable time and effort. We have the biggest example right in front of us when COVID-19 caught the world unawares. Although the entire world’s finest brains were at work and governments were ready to give the emergency approval to the most effective formulations to contain the virus it still took almost a year to launch vaccines in the market. The commercialisation process is quite cumbersome − starting from building R&D capabilities getting approvals for formulations conducting trials applying for patents/licences and finally launching the drug in the market.

M&A trends prevalent in the industry

Before we delve into current M&A trends a key change that the world saw in 2020 (the year of COVID-19) is worth mentioning. In 2020 collaboration amongst various pharma players across the globe has increased to leverage each other’s strength to fulfil the unprecedented need for both innovation and keeping up with the huge surge in demand for the existing and new drugs. Global players (such as Pfizer Moderna Astra Zeneca J&J BioNTech Elli Lilly and Gilead) have joined hands with many Indian pharma companies (such as Serum Institute Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Zydus Cadila Biocon Cipla and Sun Pharma) for manufacturing their vaccines and drugs.

That said the changing business environment for pharma companies offers opportunities to use both offensive and defensive M&A strategies to capture unassailable leadership in the market. The following trends were seen amongst companies turning to defensive strategies to safeguard their future.

Making acquisitions focussed on therapeutic segment divisions and brands

Large and mid-sized Indian companies are acquiring the existing divisions of smaller Indian companies as well as those of foreign companies to get direct access to an established product domain in specific therapeutic segments whereas some prefer brand acquisitions to fill product gaps in their portfolios and strengthen weaker divisions. For example Dr Reddy’s acquired select business divisions of Wockhardt to strengthen its presence in the Indian market. Mankind acquired select brands of Dr Reddy’s. Cipla also bought brands Vysov and Vysov M from Novartis AG for India.

Licensing patented products

There are three main types of deals involving the licensing of patented products.

Acquiring exclusive marketing rights: Innovators offer to license their patented products giving exclusive marketing rights to the licensee in the geography for an agreed period. For example Boehringer Ingelheim signed an agreement with Lupin to co-market Boehringer’s anti-diabetic drugs Gibtulio Met and Ajaduo in India. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and Torrent Pharmaceuticals joined hands to co-market the anti-diabetes drug Remogliflozin Etabonate in India.

Inking non-exclusive agreements: Due to the pandemic companies have also entered into non-exclusive agreements to meet the increased demand for certain drugs. Gilead licensing of Remdesivir; Merck’s licensing of Molnupiravir; and Eli Lilly’s licensing of Baricitinib are examples of non-exclusive agreements between pharma companies.

Entering into off-patent licensing agreements: Companies are open to license non-patented generic portfolios as well. Abbott signed an agreement to take over the distribution and marketing for MSD’s generic portfolio in India.

Divesting non-core divisions/brands

Quite a few Indian and foreign companies divest their non-core divisions/brands to focus on their main portfolios. The divestment frees up the resources that can be reallocated to the key brands saving costs related to inventory field force sales and marketing. Sanofi divested its nutraceutical business to Universal Nutriscience while Pfizer sold its non-core brands to Abbott and Sun Pharma. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals also sold its gynaecology division to Integrace; earlier it had divested its orthopaedic portfolio to Integrace.

Companies that have been able to ride the upswing in demand and quickly respond to the changes in the market find offensive strategies a better fit for their growth plans. A few of the M&A activity trends amongst such companies are listed below.

Riding the private equity interest in API niche products and contract manufacturing assets

Private equity investors are looking to leverage Indian pharma companies’ chemistry leadership for direct exports of APIs to global markets along with growth opportunities in the custom manufacturing of drugs and intermediates under the Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS) model.

Carlyle collaborated with Hyderabad-based drugmaker Viyash Life Sciences to jointly set up an integrated generic pharma platform in India. Carlyle has also acquired a majority stake in SeQuent Scientific and a 20 per cent stake in Piramal Pharma. PAG agreed to acquire an undisclosed controlling stake in Acme Formulation (a contract manufacturing and R&D services provider).

Advent acquired a controlling stake in ZCL Chemicals (a specialty API manufacturing unit) and Bharat Serums and Vaccines (a biopharma company).

Investing in biosimilars and biologics

India is one of the leading manufacturers of similar biologics. It has a thriving domestic market with 93 total products approved through 2019. Indian companies collaborate with European and US companies to develop biosimilars and biologics for global markets. Biocon Biologics entered into an agreement with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI working to save lives and reduce the burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries) for cancer biosimilars in more than 30 countries in Africa and Asia.

Biocon collaborated with Viatris (formerly known as Mylan) in 2009 to co-develop a portfolio of biosimilar antibodies and other recombinant proteins along with insulin analogue. Biocon also joined hands with Sandoz to develop manufacture and commercialise multiple biosimilars in immunology. Aurobindo Pharma acquired biosimilar products from TL Biopharmaceutical AG.

Signing collaboration deals focussed on research and development

Foreign pharma companies are targetting Indian pharma players to develop formulations for the global as well as domestic markets. For example MedGenome tied up with the US-based Emmes a Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) for rare diseases. Syngene International and Deerfield Discovery and Development Corporation (3DC) have signed a five-year agreement to jointly advance therapeutic discovery projects. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals signed an agreement with Boston-based APC Therapeutics for the development of a potential cancer treatment drug. Sun Pharmaceutical joined hands with Spanish firm Almirall for the development and commercialisation of tildrakizumab.

Growth supplements needed by the sector

Pharma features in the list of the top 10 sectors for foreign investment in India. Indian drugs and pharma companies have received a cumulative foreign direct investment worth $18.12 billion between April 2000 and June 2021. The government has already started realigning its pharma strategy focussed on nurturing a supportive environment for M&A deals taking targetted policy initiatives and reviewing drug pipelines to accelerate the sector’s pace of growth.

In February 2021 the government approved a Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the pharma sector from FY2021 to FY2029 to attract investments of Rs 15000 crores. It also has plans to allocate $70 million for local players to develop biosimilars and establish medical parks. Steps such as launching National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) to increase access to digital healthcare supporting state-sponsored health coverage programmes and focussing on chronic healthcare will also support the growth aspirations of pharma players. Another aspect that cannot be underrated is lower production R&D and clinical trial costs (almost 50 per cent 87 per cent and 90 per cent respectively) in India compared to developed markets. The Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) also issued a draft research and development policy that aims at creating an ecosystem for innovation by focussing on three areas − creating a regulatory environment facilitating innovation and research in product development; incentivising private and public investment in innovation through a mix of fiscal and non-fiscal measures; and building an enabling ecosystem designed to support innovation and cross-sectoral research as a strong institutional foundation for sustainable growth in the sector.

The right prescription to boost M&A activity and bring the pharma sector closer to its dreams of becoming Aatmanirbhar would involve adapting to the changing market realities by building a robust healthcare infrastructure optimising tax landscape and creating an ecosystem for R&D to encourage innovation in the pharma sector.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbWVkaWNhbGRpYWxvZ3Vlcy5pbi9uZXdzL2luZHVzdHJ5L3BoYXJtYS9zdW4tcGhhcm1hLWdldHMtY2RzY28tY29tbWl0dGVlLWFwcHJvdmFsLWZvci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXJhbmliaXp1bWFiLTkxNTM00gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vbWVkaWNhbGRpYWxvZ3Vlcy5pbi9hbXAvbmV3cy9pbmR1c3RyeS9waGFybWEvc3VuLXBoYXJtYS1nZXRzLWNkc2NvLWNvbW1pdHRlZS1hcHByb3ZhbC1mb3ItbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1yYW5pYml6dW1hYi05MTUzNA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sun Pharma gets CDSCO committee approval for manufacturing Ranibizumab,"New Delhi: In a significant development the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) functional under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) has granted approval to pharma major Sun Pharmaceuticals to manufacture Ranibizumab for the indication i.e. neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).



This approval is subject to condition that the firm should carry out the Phase IV clinical study as per the guidelines for similar biologics.

Further in accordance with the Phase IV study the drug maker is directed to submit protocol for conduct of Phase IV study within three months of obtaining the manufacturing license.

This came in line with the proposal presented by the pharmaceutical major Sun Pharma for marketing authorization for Ranibizumab solution for injection 10mg/ml along with the Phase III clinical study report.

Ranibizumab is used to treat various ocular disorders with abnormal growth of blood vessels such as neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.



Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment directed against human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) which is a glycoprotein implicated in the pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration.

Ranibizumab binds to VEGF-A with high affinity as well as its biologically active forms such as VEGF165 VEGF121 and VEGF110. Notably VEGF165 is the most predominant isoform in the human eye that promotes ocular neovascularization. VEGF165 enhances vascular permeability inhibits apoptosis and causes endothelial-cell mobilization from the bone marrow and differentiation for angiogenesis.



Ranibizumab binds to the receptor-binding site of VEGF-A preventing it from binding to its receptors - VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 - that are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Ranibizumab thereby attenuates endothelial cell proliferation vascular leakage and new blood vessel formation.

Ranibizumab is marketed under brand name Lucentis. Lucentis was developed by Genentech (Subsidiary of Roche) . The company retains commercial rights in the US and Novartis has exclusive commercial rights for the rest of the world.

Last year the Medical Dialogues Team had reported that in India Lupin Limited had received marketing approval for Ranibizumab from the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) on the condition that the drug's specifications be equivalent to the reference product and that the company submit a Phase IV clinical trial protocol within three months of receiving marketing authorization.

At recent SEC meeting for ophthalmology held on 07.04.2022 at CDSCO the expert panel reviewed the proposal presented by the drug maker Sun Pharma for marketing authorization for Ranibizumab solution for injection 10mg/ml along with the Phase III clinical study report.



The committee observed that the firm has submitted head to head comparison non clinical toxicity immunogenicity and clinical efficacy data of the drug in comparison with the reference product for the indication under study.

After detailed deliberation the committee recommended the grant of permission for manufacture of the drug for the indication i.e. neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) subject to the condition that the firm should carry out Phase IV clinical study as per the guidelines for similar biologics.

Further the drug maker is directed that it should submit protocol for conduct of Phase IV study within three months of obtaining the manufacturing license.

With regard to the other indications applied the committee recommended that the firm should make a separate proposal for consideration after grant of marketing authorization of the drug.",,,,,,,,,

The company's recent announcement of Sarver's impending departure comes amid the NBA's investigation into the Suns and Sarver which the league launched in early November 2021 after ESPN published a story detailing allegations of racism and misogyny in a sometimes hostile and toxic workplace during Sarver's 17-year tenure as majority owner. Sarver has denied allegations in ESPN's story.

Sarver has held the title of executive chairman at Western Alliance Bancorporation since 2018 and has held a seat on the company's board which he will also vacate in June since 2002.

""It has been an honor to serve as executive chairman of Western Alliance Bancorporation"" Sarver who also served as the company's CEO from 2002 to 2018 said in a statement. ""I want to offer my sincere appreciation to our employees whose hard work and dedication have allowed us to achieve so much during my 20 years at the company. With the company well positioned for continued success and growth the time is right for me to begin a new chapter. I will always cherish and be grateful for the experiences I have had and the relationships I have made during my time at Western Alliance. I have the utmost confidence in the executive team and the oversight of our highly experienced and capable board moving forward.""

Western Alliance Bancorporation CEO and President Kenneth Vecchione said in a statement in part ""Robert's vision and leadership made the remarkable success of Western Alliance possible. Robert was honest transparent and led the company with integrity throughout his time as a colleague and as a friend to many of us.""

In January as the trade publication American Banker first reported Vecchione told investors on an earnings call that independent directors on the company's board had hired an independent outside law firm Munger Toller & Olsen to help conduct their own investigation ""to evaluate Robert's continued leadership role at the company"" Vecchione said on the call.

""The investigation is being directed and overseen by the independent directors and to be clear is not the result of any allegations related to the company discovered by the Board or the NBA"" Vecchione continued on the call. ""In addition Western Alliance has and will continue to assist the NBA in an ongoing investigation as requested.""

On the January call Ebrahim Poonawala a Bank of America Securities analyst asked Vecchione about the timeline to conclude the investigation.

""This is being handled by the independent directors and their counsel"" Vecchione replied. ""And I'm not really in a position to comment on the scope or duration of the investigation. Sorry.""

Western Alliance Bancorporation did not address the NBA's investigation in its announcement nor did it give a reason for Sarver's retirement.

A spokesperson for Western Alliance Bancorporation declined to comment beyond the statement about the reasons or timing of the announcement.

The Suns declined to comment.

In the announcement Western Alliance Bancorporation added that Steve Hilton most recently the director of its board of directors would also be stepping down from his position in June.

Hilton is a minority Suns owner and like Sarver has been part of Western Alliance Bancorporation since 2002.

The company's announcement regarding Sarver came last week one day after the NBA's board of governors meetings concluded in New York City which league sources say that Sarver attended.

When asked about the state of the NBA's investigation following the board of governor meetings NBA commissioner Adam Silver told reporters that it remains ongoing.

""I mean these types of investigations do take a lot of time"" Silver said. ""You want to ensure that you gather all the facts and you also want to ensure that you protect the rights of the accused. And so we want to err on the side of being very complete. So we're certainly closer to the end than the beginning. But it's hard to put a precise timeline on it right now.""

The NBA's investigation has been led by the New York-based Wachtell Lipton law firm.

The top-seeded Suns who finished the regular season with a franchise-record and NBA-best 64-18 mark are slated to begin their postseason run this Sunday in Phoenix against either the New Orleans Pelicans or the LA Clippers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIyL2Fwci8xNy9mYWNlYm9vay1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMtYXMtcnVzc2lhLXN0ZXBzLXVwLXByZXNlbmNlLWluLXVuc3RhYmxlLXdlc3QtYWZyaWNh0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjIvYXByLzE3L2ZhY2Vib29rLXN0cnVnZ2xlcy1hcy1ydXNzaWEtc3RlcHMtdXAtcHJlc2VuY2UtaW4tdW5zdGFibGUtd2VzdC1hZnJpY2E?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook struggles as Russia steps up presence in unstable west Africa,"Facebook is struggling to contain pro-Russian and anti-western posts that are contributing to political instability in west Africa investigators and analysts have said.

The platform which has expanded rapidly across the continent in recent years has made significant investment in content moderation but still faces enormous challenges in curbing deliberate disinformation campaigns. One major area of concern is the strategically important Sahel region which has suffered a series of military takeovers over the last 18 months.

Campaigns on Facebook appear to have prepared the ground for many of the coups pushing an anti-western pro-Russian agenda that has undermined governments. The efforts are similar to the “hybrid warfare” campaign launched by Moscow in Ukraine and elsewhere.

A report by investigators from the Digital Forensic Lab a global network of digital forensic researchers run by US-based thinktank the Atlantic Council reveals how pro-Russian Facebook pages in Mali coordinated support for anti-democracy protests and the Wagner group a controversial Russian private military contractor that was invited into the unstable country last year after the overthrow of President Bah N’daw by the military.

The US and others have alleged that Wagner is funded by the powerful businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin who is closely linked to Vladimir Putin. It has a growing presence in Africa and its mercenaries have been deployed in Mozambique Sudan Libya and in Central African Republic where Wagner group fighters committed human rights abuses while fighting alongside government forces against rebels according to a group of independent UN experts. Prigozhin and the Kremlin have denied any knowledge of Wagner.

Western officials described Wagner as the “thin end of the wedge” and a “Trojan horse” for a Russian effort to extend its influence covertly in resource-rich and unstable parts of the continent. Earlier this year France announced that it was withdrawing thousands of troops from Mali ending a near decade-long effort to fight Islamist insurgents from bases there. The Wagner group has deployed between 400 and 600 fighters trainers and support staff to Mali and appears to have already launched offensive operations against extremists.

In early April Human Rights Watch reported that suspected Russian mercenaries had participated in an operation with Mali’s army in March in which about 300 civilians died. HRW did not mention Wagner specifically.

The DFR Lab identified a coordinated network of five pages pushing narratives that promoted Russian intervention in Mali while disparaging the west and France in particular. The pages have published nearly 24000 posts and are followed by more than 140000 accounts.

In September 2021 the pages of the network began promoting Wagner as an alternative to the French forces. Pages in the network frequently posted identical content often less than 20 seconds apart the DFR Lab found.

In a second report DFR investigators found that pro-Russian content spread on Facebook in west Africa in the months before the military takeover in Burkina Faso in January. Hours after the coup there demonstrators in Ouagadougou the country’s capital chanted pro-Russian and anti-French slogans.

Independent fact-checkers labelled several posts as misleading including a pro-Russian page that repurposed images of apparently well-equipped hobbyists in combat gear as Russian soldiers.

The DFRLab has an ongoing partnership with Facebook to independently monitor the platform for disinformation campaigns with a particular emphasis on election interference and receives funding from Meta.

Facebook declined to take down the pages described in the reports when alerted saying that though posts were clearly part of a coordinated effort they did not appear to be a front for unidentified users and so “inauthentic”.

Many posts that breached Facebook’s moderation polices have been labelled as false or misleading after being investigated by third-party fact-checkers a spokesperson said.

Toussaint Nothias research director at the Digital Civil Society Lab of Stanford University who has worked extensively on Facebook said the decision was surprising and underlined the big challenge of effective content moderation.

“The boundary between inauthentic and authentic coordinated behaviour is very tricky to manage. Authentic coordinated behaviour can often resemble social movements and determining when this behaviour is harmful depends largely on the context and standpoint” Nothias said.

A spokesperson for Facebook’s owner Meta said the company took the problem of coordinated campaigns seeking to manipulate public debate very seriously and was taking aggressive steps to fight the spread of misinformation in Africa as elsewhere.

“We’ve built the largest global third-party fact-checking network of any platform and in the last few years we’ve more than doubled the number of countries we cover across the continent” the spokesperson said. “While nobody can eliminate misinformation from society entirely we continue to consult with outside experts grow our fact-checking program and improve our technology to tackle it on our services in the most comprehensive and effective way possible.”

Facebook has moved repeatedly in recent years to take down hundreds of “inauthentic” accounts targeting Africa many linked to Moscow.

In October 2019 Facebook took down three networks of accounts linked to Prigozhin. The accounts were actively seeking to influence the domestic politics in eight countries: Madagascar the CAR Mozambique the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ivory Coast Cameroon Sudan and Libya.

In 2020 Facebook targeted a second Russian-led network of professional trolls outsourced to Ghanaian and Nigerian operatives.

The DFR report on the recent Mali accounts – and Facebook’s decision not to take down the network – underlines the risk of actors exploiting loopholes in the company’s policies.

Experts say influencing efforts have become more sophisticated and are likely to involve hiring individuals who will push a particular narrative. This makes it much harder to establish whether such operations are “inauthentic” and thus breach Facebook policy.

“It’s not bots any more. The major [social media] firms are very good at identifying bots … There are real people behind the accounts.” The trend has been a tactical shift for Prigozhin-linked operations. Local operators offer a better understanding of the context on the ground and a level of plausible deniability” said Shelby Grossman a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory.

Jean Le Roux author of the new DFR report said those behind the most recent networks could have been people in Mali who were genuinely supportive of Russia’s efforts and anti-French or members of a “franchising operation using locals who know the slang the vernacular”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3RoZXdlc3QuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3LWFwcHJvYWNoLW5lZWRlZC10by1kaWdpdGFsLXNraWxscy10cmFpbmluZy1hbWlkLXRlY2gtd29ya2VyLXNob3J0YWdlLWV4cGVydHMtc2F5LWMtNjM2Njg4M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New approach needed to digital skills training experts say,"Western Australia could become a world leader in tech but experts say the State’s success will depend on whether businesses can find more effective ways of delivering digital skills training.

She backed her top spot off with a third-place finish as part of the 4x1 lap relay team.

West Norfolk Sportshall winners (56065003)

Norfolk teams had cleaned up at the regional finals last month at the UEA and once again they really stepped up on the big stage at a competition which produces a vibrant atmosphere and a good level of excitement and enthusiasm.

West Norfolk had five youngsters selected to represent the county based on their performances through the rounds.

Under-13 girl Johnson and Mia Lesniak Under-13 boys Charlie Broad and Finley Morby-Jones and Under-15 boy Thomas O’Neill.

Unfortunately O’Neill had to withdraw due to an injury he picked up the week before.

Mia Lesniak was seventh in the Under-13 girls shot competition with her marvellous final put of 7.27m in the fourth round.

Charlie Broad had a fantastic 4th place in the U13 boys Shot narrowly missing out on a bronze medal by just 5cm.

His furthest effort of 8.34cm came in the last round.

Teammate Finley Morby-Jones finished just behind Charlie in 5th position with 7.72m effort in round 2. Broad was also part of the 3rd place 4x1 lap relay team.

All four of the West Norfolk athletes finished the day with medals as the Under-13 boys team were crowned national champions whilst the Under-13 girls finished second as national runners up.

In the other age categories the Under-15 girls won the national title.

The Under-15 boys finished just outside the medals in fourth place with some valiant individual performances.

The finals closed the book on Sportshall athletics for another season and shows yet again that grass roots athletics is going strong with some impressive performances by young athlete.

These athletes will go forward to the outdoor season at club and county level and look to build on all they have achieved.

It is so good once again to see representatives from West Norfolk earning selection.

Thanks as always must go to the organisers officials athletes parents and volunteers who make all these events possible.

If you are interested in joining in as a volunteer becoming an official or as an athlete from ages 8-88+ take a look at the West Norfolk website for further details at: https://westnorfolkac.co.uk/index.php/about-the-club/"

Update 4/19: Newberg City Council voted to approve the plan; only Councilor McBride abstained stating he wanted the citizens of Newberg to vote on the plan.

Update 4/26: The Advocate has now been informed that Newberg Oregon resident Bill Rosacker has formed the Choice for Newberg campaign measure to gather signatures from residents who want to see the Urban Renewal Plan put onto the November 22 ballot allowing Newberg residents to decide on if the new taxing district should be created that will divert tax money to this new urban renewal project. The Choice for Newberg campaign organizers have roughly one month to obtain the 1610 signatures needed to place the measure on the ballot.

Tomorrow on Monday April the 18th Newberg City Council will vote on whether to implement the Urban Renewal Plan its committees have been working on for the past several years. I expect that it will be passed. Per law if residents wish to oppose the implementation of this plan they will have 30 days to gather several thousand signatures from local voters in order to put the decision of whether to approve the plan to a vote in this coming November’s election season.

This article is intended to educate residents of Newberg Oregon about the proposed Urban Renewal Project which the City Council is as of this moment set to vote in favor of next week. While this article contains my personal opinions and viewpoints about the project my opinion is based on numerous facts which I will lay out in detail in this article. I believe there is sufficient information provided in this article for others to form their own opinions. But I will not reserve my opinion on the project as I see enormous problems with it.

As I see things there are significant downsides to the Urban Renewal Project and I see zero benefits to the City and its residents. None.

I am not saying this to be hyperbolic. I think the entire proposal is ill-conceived and poorly constructed.

I will break down each of the major problems I see with it.

What Is the Newberg Urban Renewal Project and Why Do I Hate It?

The Urban Renewal Project consists of about 500 pages of documentation and contained within those pages are proposals for everything from building new infrastructure (water electrical sewage roads etc.) for the so-called Riverfront Master Plan to the so-called ‘Newberg Downtown Improvement Plan‘ which will among many things rezone the downtown Newberg area to permit the demolishing of old historical homes from the past 150 years to replace with tiny home villages and apartment complexes as well as permitting “car camping” (stealth camping in vehicles) in neighborhoods. This summary is by no means comprehensive of everything contained within the plan but I will say for certain that I strongly believe Newberg will be an entirely different town if this plan is implemented and it become more like Portland in the worst way possible (overcrowding establishment of ghettos a significant lack of parking space for most home owners and businesses city policies that only benefit special business interests and tourists etc.). It is that dramatic of a proposal. I believe if its drafters were being honest they would just call it the “Portland-ize Newberg Project”.

A substantial part of the plan is a so-called Vertical Housing Development Zone which the plan creators claim will result in the creation of “affordable housing” by usage of State Statute ORS 307.841-307.867 which allows Cities and Counties to come to agreements with various taxing jurisdictions to grant 10 year partial property tax exemptions for new mixed use developments.

I view the Urban Renewal Project as an extension of the other zoning ordinance changes the Newberg City Council is making (such as allowing “car camping” in suburbs and tearing down historical homes in downtown Newberg and replacing them with tiny homes and apartment complexes) that are intended to dramatically change the landscape and culture of Newberg to be less traditional small town Americana and more aligned with the current trends of social experimentations popular with Democrats.

The Problem with Newberg Housing Market In a Nutshell

The problem with this plan is that taxes and fees (such as System Development Fees which is so complex an issue in Newberg it deserves its own dedicated article) only partly contribute to the sale price of houses which is why old and decrepit houses in Newberg are also selling for astronomical prices despite having been constructed decades ago. The cost of constructing new housing certainly does require developers to sell homes for close to half a million dollars or more but it doesn’t change that the market price of homes is very high due to a purchasing trend created by out of state landlords — a trend which this plan does not account for.

The reality is that Newberg City Council has no control over how developers will price the homes they sell; as an example the Crestview Crossing development across from Providence Hospital was also pitched to the city as a mixed use development with housing and commercial. Many believed the Single Family homes would be affordable for local residents. However I have confirmed from the brokers selling these new Single Family homes that the units are selling for $400000 to $550000 each.

This is what the “Single Family Home” units in Crestview Crossing are

This is the type of housing that will be constructed in the “Urban Renewal District” and the price point this housing will most certainly sell at will also likely be $400000 to $550000 or more. This is obviously because that is what the present market price for homes is. This type of housing is most profitable for the developers to build in Newberg because there are many who will purchase them. I believe one of the contributing factors is because many of these homes are purchased by Californians as vacation homes which they rent out on websites like Airbnb to wine tourists when not using them. This is also true for many of the newly constructed apartment units as well. Anyone can confirm this by simply browsing Aibnb listings within Newberg city limits or listings on similar vacation rental sites such as Vrbo. You will see many homes and apartments originally built for local housing are now advertised to out of state vacationers.

An example of one of the historical apartment housing properties in downtown Newberg that was converted into vacation rentals is Yamhill Flats which sits across from Newberg City Hall on N. Howard Street.

Yamhill Flats is owned by Yamhill Development Corporation which is owned by Portlanders Susan and Frederick Passmore. The units are managed by Megan Carda via her company Lifestyle Properties Oregon. The apartments are advertised as “guest suites” and exclusively rented to wine tourists.

Yamhill Flats is not alone in this; my research indicates all of the studio apartments on Main Street Newberg have been converted into vacation rentals as have many of the homes in the historical parts of town with rates as high as $150 to $350 a night. There are also several apartment units around town which are subleased to tourists.

You’ll also note these property owners charge a higher price than what it costs to rent a hotel room even if what they are offering is only one bedroom in a house. This is also what is being done with many of the tiny home villages developed in the surrounding area as well. I have identified several “tiny home villages” which are advertised as vacation rentals for wine tourists and are not at all priced for local residents. In the case of Yamhill Flats they are expressly advertised as ‘historic flats’ as a central selling point. The whole point of these rentals is for tourists to vicariously experience what small town Americana wine country is like.

This is also the case with the overwhelming majority of RV parks within a half hour drive of Newberg; they are catered toward vacationers. Many RV parks now prevent long-term stays and charge high prices (easily over $1500 a month). Several of the RV parks near Newberg that once permitted residential long-term living and charged affordable rates have been acquired by new owners and converted into resorts where guests cannot even park a trailer and can only rent out existing “luxury” trailers owned by the park at high vacation rental prices. This is problematic as RV trailers and motorhomes were once an excellent way to allow for low income housing in the area and the transformation of these RV parks into strictly vacation rentals has eliminated a great deal of affordable housing in the Williamite Valley. However since these ownership changes there are now very few local RV parks which actually permit long term rentals and charge prices locals can afford.

I believe the wine tourism industry is one of the main things driving up the cost of housing in Newberg and it is a problem that simply building more housing is not going to resolve because the only thing this achieves is creating more units for investors to scoop up and rent to wine tourists. Unless they are going to build land use restricted and rent control housing there is no way for the City to prevent this trend from continuing with any new development. And the issue with rent control is that it means landlords cannot afford to invest into maintaining their properties as inflation and price increases of labor inevitably drive up property maintenance costs above what rent control policies limit their income from the properties to. This is why rent control districts inevitably transform into ghettos.

The reality is that the average resident in Newberg only earns $28000 a year and the median household income in Newberg is $56910. The reason for this is obvious; aside from A-dec and retailers the main employer of Newberg residents are the wineries. Wineries pay the average employee minimum wage or close to it. Their labor needs are most intense on a seasonable basis in Autumn and all other times of the year they primarily employ warehouse workers bartenders and waiters. While the wineries generate enormous money from out of state customers they give very little back to the local market in way of wages. This would not be a problem in pre-2000s Newberg as the Willamette Valley has always been dominated by seasonable agricultural work on farms — the problem is the wineries attract wine tourism which the orchards and dairy industry did not.

Due to the wine tourism the local housing market has transformed into the lodging market for the wine tourism and this has dramatically skyrocketed the price of housing for local residents beyond what the majority of people who grow up in the area can afford. Worse as orchards corn fields berry bushes hay fields and livestock farms are transformed into vineyards it actually makes it harder for people to find year-round employment working as a farmhand which has created enormous difficulty for small mom and pop farms to hire labor when they need it because people who would have worked year round for numerous farms as the labor (per the busy seasons for their crop or herd) instead move away work in a winery warehouse or get a job in some other industry so they have sustainable income year round.

Many retail employers have complained about labor shortages in Newberg but these employers are offering minimum wage and slightly more than it as pay. The brutal reality is that as more local housing is converted into tourist lodging fewer and fewer people can afford to live in Newberg on minimum wage. And so it is no wonder that more and more people are not taking these jobs and instead moving away to more affordable areas.

To be blunt the vast majority of residents in Newberg can barely afford the average market price of $1500-$2500 a month rent for an apartment and can only dream of obtaining a mortgage for a newly constructed $450000 home in Crestview Crossing with no backyard. Consequently I doubt these homes will be sold to local residents. The average resident in Newberg cannot compete with wealthy out of town investors seeking to capitalize on the wine tourism and who work through local brokers and realtors to manage their portfolio of properties — many of whom by the way are Progressive Yamhill members.

In order to secure a mortgage of around $450000 assuming that you have no debt and a good credit score you would need to put down roughly $90000 to secure an estimated 3.12% interest rate — your monthly payment for a $450000 home would be about $1903. That means your annual income would need to be around $70000. As mentioned previously the median household income in Newberg is $56910. Again this is the median HOUSEHOLD INCOME not individual income. Median household income represents what the average two people living together in a household bring in. These statistics mean the average couple in Newberg earn $56910 a year together. And it is below what is needed to purchase a home or even to rent many apartment units in town.

Bear in mind interest rates are rising. I doubt a 3.12% interest rate will be an option for most people purchasing a home in Newberg in the future.

In my personal opinion the only way that affordable housing will be created in Newberg is when new businesses move to the area that offer good paying wages to local resident workers so that local residents can compete with these wine tourism investors in the housing market. I am not talking about just a couple hundred new good paying jobs either; Newberg needs multiple employers to bring thousands of good paying jobs to the area. To my knowledge there is NO company that has any intentions of establishing something like a manufacturing plant or software development firm in the proposed Urban Renewal District development. To my knowledge the City Council has never attempted to even attract one during these six years of planning. I have seen no evidence of the City having any conversations with anyone to bring more jobs to Newberg. The only thing they have done is talk to land developers who want to build housing and consultant firms that will give the City Council whatever math they want to make their lofty ambitions sound good on a drawing board.

In my research the only companies who have interest in the Newberg Urban Renewal project are land developers who will construct small warehouses and “single family dwelling” homes like those constructed at Crestview Crossing. The Newberg City Councilors who favor this plan appear to have a ‘Field of Dreams’ mindset claiming that good paying jobs will come if the City picks up the bill to build the infrastructure to develop the lands around the old paper mill site but there is NO evidence that any employer wants to do such a thing. Real life is not a Kevin Costner movie; any experienced entrepreneur knows that before you start any project you should validate the market by identifying real customers. Until there is someone like Intel who wants to build a facility to provide good paying wages to residents so they can afford $1500 to $2500 apartment units and half a million dollar homes there is absolutely zero reason to build any infrastructure because the City has no idea what the needs of an employer like that are. You don’t know what they want to see specifically and so you may build something that will turn them off from the site.

When companies like Amazon Intel and so forth build a location they will reach out to a city and negotiate terms telling the city precisely what they need. Quite frankly it is idiotic to build infrastructure when you have no idea what the needs of the commercial manufacturing plants might be. The City should have first found several large corporations willing to bring good paying wages to Newberg residents before ever planning this district and they have wasted tax payer money and time on a pipedream that if it should ever be built will most likely have all of its commercial zoning changed to “residential mixed use” which translates into housing and a few retail storefront spaces. There is precedence for this because Crestview Crossing was originally zoned for commercial use only and the use was changed to allow for half a million dollar condos to be built when a land developer came knocking. Consequently there is no reason to think this City Council won’t permit all of the planned commercial areas to be turned into housing.

Additionally I am concerned about permitting the construction of tiny homes in Newberg’s historical areas. Century old homes could be demolished and I think most certainly will be. People from out of state will purchase homes with no attachment to the city who will demolish them and seek to maximize their profit. This means construction of multi unit dwellings on what are presently single family dwelling lots. I mean think about it — if your goal is to rent out to wine tourists you can rent a tiny home for the same price as an entire normal size house. Demolishing a historical house in downtown Newberg and constructing a couple trailer houses on the land will maximize your profits; you can easily build four or more tiny shed homes on any of these sites in downtown Newberg. I have lived in cities like Austin Texas and Los Angeles California; I have witnessed this happen. They do it in Portland as well.

Aside from changing the landscape significantly logistically the issue with demolishing single family homes and constructing apartments and tiny home villages is that these historical areas do not have sufficient parking. We can already see this is a problem around the old Central School Building in downtown Newberg; there is not enough parking for the center to be used to hold so much as a county commissioner debate. People who visit the building take away the parking spaces on the road from those who actually live in the surrounding homes. The roads are also not designed for the amount of traffic because the area was created to be a school and suburb. The building was not designed to be a “cultural center”; it was designed as a school in a small town and it offered almost no parking at all because it was unnecessary. Most students and teachers walked to school because they lived right down the street. Because the old school building is now being used to host people from around the city and surrounding areas it has created parking space issues for local homeowners — many of whom do not have a driveway for their house. This parking issue will become a problem in other historical suburbs in Newberg if houses are demolished and replaced with tiny home villages and apartments.

Now I realize there are very libertarian minded people in Newberg who believe that people should be permitted to do anything they want with a piece of property but the reality is that cities are communities and if city planning is anarchy then the whole community becomes dysfunctional and it impacts everyone’s lives. The reality is that at present the majority of children who grow up in Newberg will not be able to even afford to rent an apartment in Newberg because when they become adults there will be no jobs paying enough for them to compete with wine tourists for lodging. This is a significant problem.

“Tiny homes” is a cool sounding term but let’s be honest about what these actually are in their construction; they are a shed with plumbing. You can’t raise a family in a shed with plumbing and so families are not the people who are ultimately going to be in this kind of housing. Instead these units are just going to be wine tourist rentals and it’s not going to improve the housing market for locals. It’ll just make it even worse.

Demolishing good single family homes to create yet more lodging for wine tourists is the last thing Newberg needs right now.

The Elephant in the Room — The Old Paper Mill Site

Before I finish out my criticism of the core of the plan I need to mention the old paper mill site.

What Happened to the Paper Mill?

Newberg’s economic growth has traditionally been spurred by locally owned farms (primarily hazelnuts / filberts) and the paper mill. The paper mill has had multiple owners but existed for 80 years until in 2015 it was sold to WestRock a company that owned other paper mills. WestRock claimed it would continue operating the mill but promptly fired all of the more than 200 workers. WestRock then hired teams of scrappers to drill massive holes and otherwise destroy the heavy machinery used for papermaking and then re-listed the mill on the market with the stipulation that the new owner would have to scrap all of the heavy machinery. Sources say the drilling of holes into the equipment caused large amounts of chemicals to leak into the soil. Unfortunately a union lawsuit accusing WestRock of destroying capital equipment and curtailing production to drive up prices was dismissed by the U.S. Justice Department.

For a more comprehensive look at what WestRock did you can read the article ‘Corporate Vandalism’ on NW Labor Press. In the article Greg Pallesen president of the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers union told NW Labor Press “Those mill jobs paid $28 an hour plus benefits and they’re the type of job that the Newberg area won’t likely see again.” The article discusses the claims that the paper mill had been intentionally purchased by WestRock in bad faith with the intention of removing a competitor paper mill. In the article Pallesen said he attempted to broker deals to sell the facility and reopen the mill but WestRock was not interested.

Then in September 2020 WestRock through its broker Phil Higgins (a Progressive Yamhill member) sold the mill and its damaged equipment to St. Louis Missouri-based scrapping company Commercial Development Co. Inc. who is presently in the process of demolishing the facility for its materials to be sold as salvage. According to the February 8th 2021 Newberg Graphic article Mill Demolition Underway Commercial Development Co owns 120 acres of industrial land four acres of multifamily residential land and 1.5 acres of commercial land located within state-designated opportunity and enterprise zones primarily south of the city limits.

The old mill site has been reduced to rubble its materials sold off as scrap and salvage. It is unknown what the cost of environmental cleanup of the contaminants will be.

The current Progressive Yamhill controlled City Council has been trying to incorporate this former paper mill land in its “Riverfront Master Plan”. The idea is to develop a tract of land along the cliff between the Newberg-Dundee bypass and the Willamette River. This tract would be a mixed use commercial residential and recreational zone that abuts the mill property on the east.

The problem with all of this is that the soil will require clean up; not just at the mill itself but surrounding areas including along the river. I have seen no evidence there has been a study on what it will cost to do this cleanup. So I find it to be irresponsible of the City to develop this plan with no idea of what the cleanup requirements and costs will be for a new developer of the land.

In fact recently City of Newberg purchased the water rights from the mill property portfolio for $3185432.00 and they made this determination without having first conducted any kind of study into whether the river area is contaminated and what the cost to clean it will be. Additionally sources have told me sulphur was stored near a bridge on the mill property. I do not believe any environmental studies were performed prior to this purchase either. (Update 4/22: I have located an EPA assessment in 2020 of the mill property water site that shows it is contaminated with sewage that impairs its use for recreational activities. The EPA page for the site shows it has had no other testing for other kinds of pollution.)

Several sources familiar with the operations of the mill site have informed me that it was common practice to dump chemicals such as lacquer thinner and various oils onto the mill site and surrounding areas to kill weeds and that chemicals were often dumped into the railroad tracks to dispose of them. The paper mill site also had large mixing tanks that had asbestos in them and which were busted up by WestRock. Obviously anyone living in Newberg can go by the old mill site right now and see that the old site has been demolished and all of the various materials — including asbestos — has dispersed itself into the air and surrounding areas. All of this will require cleanup in the future and to date no studies have been conducted on what the cost of cleaning the environment will be. Instead all the City of Newberg has fixated on is how they are going to build a bunch of high cost housing and shopping centers for the wine tourists along the possibly contaminated river front area.

I do have some idea of what it might cost to clean though because the old Blue Heron Paper Mill site in Oregon City is presently being demolished and transformed into a Riverfront mixed use development site which is similar to what the Newberg Urban Renewal Plan intends to do. In May 2016 Oregon City received a $600K EPA Grant to cleanup the site and last year the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde (the owners of the site) received an additional $800000 grant from the EPA for additional cleanup. Just from these two grants that is $1.4M spent cleaning a similar paper mill site and surrounding areas that were contaminated by it. We can expect the cleanup of Newberg’s paper mill and its surrounding properties (such as those which are planned to be developed into housing) to require a similar cleanup but again the City has commissioned no study into what the cleanup costs will be.

The Mill Site Could Be So Polluted No Construction Is Permitted

One of the major problems with having no study is that the site and surrounding areas could be so polluted no construction is permitted for decades. Newberg already has a site that was deemed so polluted no construction was permitted for a decade this site being across from City Hall. Around 2005 a demolished car dealership was deemed polluted by leaky oil collection cans stored in its basement and that property now sits as a vacant lot across from City Hall as a “brown site”.

The “brown site” across from Newberg City Hall currently used as a dog park.

As such the City is perfectly aware that contaminated land can prevent construction and yet no studies have been done into whether this grand plan to develop a probably heavily contaminated area is even going to be permitted in the first place. But they are more than willing to commit hundreds of millions of your tax money to this pipedream project that could be blocked by the state and/or EPA.

How Does the Urban Renewal Project Work And Why Its Funding Structure Is Gambling With Public Money

An Urban Renewal Project is a kosher term for a special tax increment financing district which is what its technical term is. In fact on the City of Newberg’s page for the project it is referred to as a tax increment financing district in the website URL of https://www.newbergoregon.gov/planning/page/urban-renewal-tax-increment-financing-newberg.

Generally the term ‘Urban Renewal Project’ is the way in which these types of districts are dressed up to make them sound more appealing to residents as if the creation of these districts will result in ‘urban renewal’ which is a vague term that could really mean anything but sounds pleasant at face value.

While the document makes the math sound complicated by getting into the weeds the simplest explanation is that all of the various special taxing districts within City of Newberg limits (Fire Department public schools police Chehalem Parks and Rec etc.) will have their current tax rates collected from Newberg residents locked at the rate they presently are receiving from Newberg residents. This lock will be for 30 years. This does not mean the tax increases stop though; instead the tax rate increases these districts are projected to receive for the next 30 years (the rates would have organically increased over time to accommodate inflation) will instead be diverted to the Newberg Urban Renewal Project for the next 30 years to cover the costs of this new district. This is why the name ‘tax increment financing’ is the more correct term for this type of taxing district because it finances itself from the increases to tax rates that would occur regardless whether it was created or not.

There is of course a very obvious drawback to this kind of district which is why I dislike the term ‘Urban Renewal Project’ for it; the reason tax rates increase over time is largely due to inflation and so inevitably if you take money away from the other districts and government agencies they are going to need a new tax bond or some other kind of fee to be increased (such as a water bill or sales tax) to compensate for the deficient that has been created by the new tax increment financing strategy / Urban Renewal District.

To be crystal clear; the City of Newberg is seeking to pass a resolution that would take future tax money AWAY from other districts such as the school district and other government agencies such as Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue. These other districts will lose this money and the City of Newberg’s new tax increment financing district will obtain it. The City of Newberg has no ability to stop these other districts and government agencies from increasing their fees to compensate for this loss by passing new bonds increasing fees or anything else they decide to do in response that will ultimately result in the amount of money residents pay for these services to increase far beyond what they would have paid if the Urban Renewal taxing district was never created in the first place.

While these tax increment financing strategies for “Urban Renewal” have become popular they generally fail to deliver on their promises. A study Improving Tax Increment Financing (TIF) for Economic Development reviewed more than 30 studies of tax increment financing districts over several decades concluding that “in most cases TIF (tax increment financing) has not accomplished the goal of promoting economic development.” (An article published on the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy delves into more detail about the study if you wish to read more about it).

As previously mentioned concerning Crestview Crossing there is no way for the City to ensure the housing that is created in the proposed district will be affordable for local residents nor that it will only be sold and/or leased to local residents. What is almost certain to occur is a continuation of the present trend of Californians who view Newberg as a new Napa Valley to scoop up the homes for either retirement or vacation rentals. I have seen nothing in the documents that would prevent this.

In fact there is nothing truly permanent about the plan other than the diverting of taxes away from other districts and agencies; a future City Council could change the plan so dramatically the money is never spent to build any infrastructure at all. With the plan proposed for 30 years it is unlikely some of the councilors will live to even see its completion. A new City Council could decide to change everything about the plan whenever they want and spend the money for many other purposes.

Borrowing against a future increase in property values is gambling. Newberg is in a bubble right now and it is possible the market could crash. This is not a fiscally responsible city planning and management plan that has fully considered how the market may change over a 30 year period.

I view the Urban Renewal Project as an extension of the other zoning ordinance changes the City Council is making that are intended to dramatically change the landscape and culture of Newberg to be less traditional small town Americana and more aligned with the current trends of social experimentations popular with Democrats.

Who Is Responsible for the Newberg Urban Renewal Project?

As I mentioned before I believe the Urban Renewal plan is a pet project of Progressive Yamhill members. I believe this for several reasons.

The November 15 2021 Newberg City council meeting agenda packet covered Urban Renewal committee re-appointments. The names of members of this committee I have highlighted are associated with Progressive Yamhill and its subgroup Newberg Equity in Education (NEEd) either by being actual members themselves or married to one.

Other documents show a list of people involved in the planning of different parts of the plan who are also affiliated with Progressive Yamhill such as this acknowledgement sheet on page 2 of the Riverfront Master Plan presentation

(Bear in mind these are only those whom I have been able to identify direct connections to Progressive Yamhill by reviewing the internal communications of its private Facebook group and its membership roster which I discussed at length in a previous article. There are some people who posted into the group using obviously fake Facebook profile names and the identities of those accounts are unconfirmed at this time.

I would also like to point out that several sources have informed me that non-Progressive Yamhill associated people are often added to City of Newberg committees with the intention of creating the token appearance of non-partisanship but the input of these unaffiliated individuals are rarely considered with the same weight as those associated with Progressive Yamhill.)

There are other Newberg city employees with involvement in both the Urban Renewal District and Progressive Yamhill such as Shannon Buckmaster who I previously mentioned in the article Newberg City Council Spends Covid-19 Recovery Funds On Progressive Yamhill Members’ Private Businesses.

Lastly in case a reader still has any doubts that the Urban Renewal Project is closely associate with the agenda of Progressive Yamhill in reviewing the internal discussions of the private Progressive Yamhill Facebook group I located several posts concerning the Newberg Urban Renewal Project.

As an example this is a thread within the Progressive Yamhill group from August 2nd 2021 where Newberg City Councilors Stephanie Findley and Elise Hollamon used the Progressive Yamhill group to manipulate public perceptions. It is clear the intention of this thread was to organize an astroturfing tactic in order to gaslight residents– gaslighting being the creation of a feigned appearance of spontaneous grassroot support for an agenda when in reality it has been coordinated by the Councilors themselves who represent the City government. You should also note that former Newberg City Councilor Elizabeth Curtis Gemeroy is also involved in this discussion of creating an astroturfing campaign

As a note Findley assumed the urban renewal district would be on the November 2021 ballot because the Yamhill County Commissioners stated they would only support the annexation of county land for the proposed project if the residents of Newberg voted in favor of the plan. Since this thread the City of Newberg has removed the land they wanted to the degree they no longer require the approval of the County as a means of preventing the district from being voted on by residents.

Findley is also incorrect that adding such a vote to the November ballot would cost the tax payers heavily; it is special elections such as the recalls Progressive Yamhill members such as herself helped organize against Newberg school directors Dave Brown and Brian Shannon and Yamhill County Commissioner Lindsay Berschauer that each cost taxpayers $60K to $120K to hold. Allowing the residents of Newberg to vote in November on the Urban Renewal Plan would not cost the tax payers more as the ballots are being printed mailed and counted regardless due to the election that will take place.

I would also like to point out that one of the posters in the thread Shannon Eof is a Board Director for Newberg Habitat for Humanity as well as a member of the Newberg City Council’s Affordable Housing Committee.

In Conclusion the Newberg Urban Renewal District Is A Dumb Idea That Will Not Bring Good Paying Jobs to Newberg

The Urban Renewal District Plan is yet another example of how the Progressive Yamhill controlled Newberg City Council is mismanaged. Just as they squandered the federal covid-19 money to reward their members instead of spending it in a practical way to help the city return lost jobs to the area (such as were lost from the paper mill closure) they are now going to waste hundreds of millions of tax money developing the very last pieces of undeveloped property in Newberg that could be used for commercial development. And I believe what the result will be is the construction of a bunch of pretty houses and apartments that will not be rented out to locals but instead subleased to wine tourists just as many existing properties of this type are right now.

While they claim the plan will bring good paying employers to Newberg they have not identified any company that is going to do this and so they have no reasonable reason to believe any such employers will come.

An important part of any business plan or proposal is validation of your customer base verifying that there will be customers for the business you wish to start. While a city is not a business there are parallels. The City is claiming that it wants to spend millions of dollars to build infrastructure that will attract new employers who will bring good paying wages to Newberg residents. However the City has not identified a single company that is going to bring these jobs. All it has done is dream up an enormous infrastructure project hoping that maybe someday someone from somewhere will bring jobs to Newberg. And it has spent a lot of money hiring consultants to create a bunch of Power Point decks and some fuzzy math to justify its dreams.

If you view the City’s idea in terms of a new business proposal there are no “customers” for the industrial area they want to build infrastructure in; there are only land developers who make money by developing the land on the taxpayer dime to build a Field of Dreams that maybe someone might someday want to start a business in. So naturally of course the local land developers want the City to hire them to construct the infrastructure in the Urban Renewal District because it means a big pay day for them without having to first find a customer like Intel as they would otherwise have to do first.

This is why I say the Newberg Urban Renewal Plan is idiotic. You’d have to be an idiot to believe if you just spend millions of dollars then customers will just magically appear. It is that kind of mindset that causes most new businesses to fail and it is also the reason most Urban Renewal Plans fail too.

Even business plans with identifiable customers who have sales orders for a new product even those business can fail. The City has not done the bare minimum required for its planning to be a sound business plan which is identify who your customers are going to be by actually getting a commitment from them that they will be your customers.

Furthermore if the City found a company that would bring good paying jobs to Newberg that company might even be willing to contribute to the construction of the infrastructure and such a costly tax plan as proposed here might not be needed at all. The City has no idea because it has had no conversations with any employers of the scale needed to provide the kind of jobs Newberg needs.

The City should not gamble with the tax payer’s money on this pipedream diverting funds from other districts and agencies whose services are already here to pay for a moon shot. The City does not even know what these future employers from Far Far Away Land will require in a new site. How can you possibly build new infrastructure for a new business when you don’t know what the infrastructure needs of the business will be? You obviously cannot. For all we know some company that wants to power their entire building on something crazy like wind mills or water turbine generators might want to move to Newberg. Maybe a core part of their business strategy is an airstrip. Maybe they will want to deliver their products by river barge. Maybe they will only build a site in Newberg if a dozen of the vendors providing them services also move and those businesses will all have special unique needs as well.

We have no idea what any future major employer will want in a site because there is nobody like that wanting to build a site in Newberg yet. The smart thing to do is not to build unnecessary infrastructure that may turn employers away and instead find a company of that scale and ask them what they will need to make a commitment to provide jobs in Newberg. That is what a real urban planner does.

It seems to me the people who drafted this proposal believed their job was to make the City Council happy that the client was the Councilors and the task was to materialize their pipedreams. But that is not who the customer of a new infrastructure proposal is; the customer is the businesses you want to do business in the new development. That is who you want to bring the jobs. The City Council is not providing the jobs and therefore they are not the customer for the infrastructure project. I can’t believe I actually have to write this paragraph in this essay because it’s so obvious to anyone with even a little bit of business experience. I’m horrified that so much money and time has been spent into a plan that has no idea who is going to bring the jobs to Newberg and that the City Councilors who favor this plan feel so self-righteous about this idiotic mess. They have no idea what they are doing at the helm of the ship and are steering the city into treacherous unknown waters.

The City should find several huge companies that are going to bring good paying wages to Newberg residents — wages that will permit locals to afford to live in Newberg for the next 30 years. We can’t stop the wine tourism; it’s going to be here for as long as the fad of winery tours is around. So instead we must evolve and bring good paying jobs to the area so that residents can compete with wine tourist dollars when seeking to buy a home or rent an apartment. There is no other solution. Perhaps if more Progressive Yamhill members were real entrepreneurs and they had less members whose private businesses are subsidized by grants they would better understand how the private sector works and how to resolve a housing crisis that was created in the private sector. People who rely on the government to subsidize their business apparently don’t have the common sense to understand the simple truth I have said in this article; you must validate a market first by identifying customers before you commit money to a new project. The Newberg Urban Renewal Project proposal is a business plan that has no idea who the customers (i.e. those who will bring new jobs) will be.

To be clear it does not matter if I like or dislike the wineries. The wineries aren’t going to leave and the wine tourism is not going to stop anytime soon. Californians are not going to stop coming until the housing bubble bursts. This is the reality of the local market and the City must wisely manage its resources accordingly to react to it which it has not done. While I certainly believe the wineries are beautiful to visit and I enjoy drinking their wines the reality is that the wineries have undeniably had a negative impact on the housing market for local residents which has not been accounted for. But it’s not the wineries responsibility to fix these problems; it is the local cities responsibility to adapt their urban planning to ensure the housing market remains stable so that local people can afford to live in their cities.

That said the problem will not be solved by building a Field of Dreams such as what the City of Newberg is proposing here. The City should have spent the past six years trying to find several large companies to bring better paying jobs to Newberg so that local residents can be competitive in the housing market against out of state money instead of squandering money and resources on the Newberg Urban Renewal District Proposal and its pipedream of nonsense speculations.

The City of Newberg is supposed to serve the interests of the residents of Newberg. Not the out of town wineries vacation rental owners wealthy tourists and land developers. Not the special interest of a small number of residents whose businesses benefit from the out of town interests. The City is supposed to serve the interests of the local residents as a whole. I do not believe the majority of residents will benefit from this plan; it will inevitably increase their taxes and fees paid while providing no benefits to them for this increased expense. It overwhelmingly benefits those who do not live in Newberg and whose money will not translate into increased wages for local residents.

I am absolutely against Newberg’s Urban Renewal District Proposal and I believe the residents of Newberg should be permitted to vote on whether it is passed or not. The Progressive Yamhill controlled City Council should not decide this matter without the support of those whose lives this will negatively impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s over? I was 30. What a brutal business’: pop stars on life after the spotlight moves on,"In her classic memoir Clothes Clothes Clothes. Music Music Music. Boys Boys Boys Viv Albertine recounts not only the time she spent as a punk during the 1970s in her pioneering band the Slits but also documents her life after the band had ended. This is unusual. Most music books don’t venture into this territory tending to stop when the hits stop thereby drawing a veil over what happens next. The unspoken suggestion seems to be that were it to continue the story would descend helplessly into misery memoir.

“The pain I feel from the Slits ending is worse than splitting up with a boyfriend” Albertine wrote “This feels like the death of a huge part of myself two whole thirds gone … I’ve got nowhere to go nothing to do; I’m cast back into the world like a sycamore seed spinning into the wind.”

I loved Albertine’s book and it was this one paragraph in particular I think that propelled me into writing my own book on this very subject: the curious afterlife of pop stars. I wanted to know what it’s like when that awkward next chapter begins where anonymity replaces infamy and the ordinary reasserts itself over the extraordinary. The life Albertine forged for herself after punk was complicated as life tends to be. She returned to education studying film; underwent IVF; and endured both illness and divorce. But she never fully let the music go because musicians mostly don’t; they can’t. I finished her book convinced she was a hero.

But then perhaps all pop stars are? They’re fascinating individuals compelling and gifted not short of self-confidence and yes occasionally a little odd too. Artists may not always be the best people to operate the heavy machinery of adulthood but they remain tenacious driven and inspirational. They dared to dream and then went out and made that dream come true.

But falling back down to earth in this business is an inescapable certainty. Like sportsmen and women they peak early. A songwriter once told me citing Bob Dylan that “artists tend to write their best songs between the ages of 23 and 27”. Despite his enduring success Dylan has suggested he couldn’t write the songs he wrote in his 20s in his later years at least not in the same way or with the same instinct largely because after that early momentum has fizzled out things settle down into simply the thing that you do with all the humdrum ennui associated with that. So what’s it like I wondered to still be doing this “job” at 35 and 52 and beyond? What’s it like to have released your debut album to a global roar and your 12th to barely a whisper? Why the continued compulsion to create at all to demand yet more adulation? Frankly what’s the point?

Do I unashamedly want to still be one of the biggest artists in the world? Yeah I do Robbie Williams

And so armed with a batch of potentially indelicate questions – because who likes to discuss failure? – I began to reach out to musicians from various genres and eras those who hadn’t died young but were still here still working to ask them what it was like in the margins.

A great many never bothered to respond. Others enthusiastically agreed only to later bail out. The guitarist from one of America’s most stylish modern rock acts someone whose skinny jeans no longer fit quite as well as they used to was initially keen but cancelled at the last minute because his manager informed me “his head just isn’t in the right place to discuss this right now. It’s a difficult subject.” Those who did speak however – 50 in total from Joan Armatrading to S Club 7; Franz Ferdinand to Shirley Collins – were endlessly revealing and candid in a way they would never have been at the peak of their fame. I sensed they enjoyed the opportunity to talk again to be heard above the din of Ed Sheeran and Adele and Stormzy. All were humble replete with wisdom resolute. (Many were divorced too; at least one was high.)

They’re the true Stoics I realised. We could learn a lot from them.

Each individual story in popular music has a common beginning. Because in the beginning all is gravy. In 1987 seemingly overnight Terence Trent D’Arby became the most arresting new pop star of his generation. To hear him sing songs such as If You Let Me Stay and Sign Your Name was to bear witness to the art of aural seduction; the knees buckled. He became terribly famous terribly quickly. He was 25.

“I wanted adulation and got it” D’Arby tells me almost 35 years later by now working under the name Sananda Maitreya “but I had to die to survive it.”

If his ascendancy had the stuff of legend about it then so did his demise. Like Prince before him he began to feel himself capable of anything each new song he composed a masterpiece. His record company felt differently – it wanted hits not ornate rock operas – but D’Arby was not someone easily restrained. And so in pursuit of his muse he spent the early 90s reportedly living the life of a tormented recluse in a Los Angeles mansion. When I speak to him – which takes six months to arrange – he suggests he was grateful to move on “from such excess and artifice. I didn’t give a fuck about it then and even less about it now that memory has been kind enough to allow me to forget most of it.”

Prince had died Michael Jackson too. D’Arby was still here albeit with a name change – prompted by a dream he had in 1995 – to help him better bury the past. Today Maitreya lives in Milan is happily married with young children and writes records and produces his own music which he releases on his own label behaving as he damn well pleases. In 2017 this meant issuing a 53-track album with at least one song dedicated to a first-hand experience of impotence. “I’m a fellow who likes to drink and smoke/It used to once hang down to the tops of my shoes/Now all I’ve got is these limp dick blues.”

The question of whether anyone is listening any more doesn’t seem to trouble him unduly. When I ask what if anything he misses from the old days he replies: “I miss the unbridled bold naked stupidity of youth’s vibrant electric hubris.”

During the same era Kevin Rowland found himself in a comparable position. “I’d been too confident too arrogant” the Dexys Midnight Runners singer says. “I thought everyone would hear our new music and go: ‘Wow.’”

The fact that they didn’t not any more left him bewildered. Dexys were one of the more brilliant bands of the 80s with a slew of hits several No 1s and an eternal classic in Come On Eileen a song legally required to be played at every wedding disco on mainland Britain ever since. But by the end of that decade Rowland wanted to develop his craft and leave boisterous singalongs behind. His label and quite possibly some members of his own band simply wanted more of the same. It wasn’t broke so why fix it?

But Rowland tells me “I just knew that I couldn’t write the same songs again and so I never even tried.” Their new music took on an increasingly introspective tone mournful and ruminative; not ideal for radio in other words. The band were dropped they split up and the singer found solace in drugs. Whatever money he’d made was soon lost and before a stint in rehab came the need to sign on: a profound humbling. At the dole office his fellow unemployed recognised him and broke into a rendition of Come On Eileen half hoping he’d join in. “I could have done without that” he notes.

The passing of fad and fashion is rarely the artist’s fault. In a 1997 piece for the New Yorker the American essayist Louis Menand suggested that stardom cannot last longer than three years. “It is the intersection of personality with history a perfect congruence of the way the world happens to be and the way the star is. The world however moves on.”

To her credit Suzanne Vega tried to move with it. It was 1990 and by this stage she’d enjoyed huge success for three years. This was no mean feat because her unadorned acoustic songs stood in direct contrast to the more brash preoccupations of pop in the 80s a time when Madonna ruled. “But by 1987” Vega recalls “every door was open to me every gig I did sold out.”

View image in fullscreen Suzanne Vega realised her star was waning when her record company stopped sending cars to pick her up at the airport. Photograph: Lynn Goldsmith/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images

And so in 1990 she announced her most ambitious tour yet. Rather than her usual requirements of an acoustic guitar and a single spotlight she now had “a set designer trucks and buses a crew a backing band; catering a backup singer a woman to do the clothing. This was a big deal for me.”

On the tour’s opening night in New York the venue was just a third full. “I thought: ‘Where’s the rest of the audience? Maybe they’re still out in the lobby?’”

There was no rest of the audience; they’d already moved on. Vega herself had done nothing wrong here but rather done things a little too right. The industry had taken note of her earlier success reminding them of the marketable power of a singer in touch with her emotions and so had invested in a new batch: Sinéad O’Connor Tanita Tikaram Tracy Chapman. These artists rendered the scene’s godmother abruptly superfluous.

Vega’s tour haemorrhaging money was cut short. When she arrived back at JFK she looked out for the car her record label would always send to collect her. But there was no car. Not any more.

“I took a taxi” she says.

But Vega like Maitreya and Rowland didn’t throw in the towel simply because others had come along to steal her thunder. She simply and by necessity pivoted towards cult status which at least came with the safety belt of a loyal fanbase that still sustains her today. There are benefits to staying in your lane. “Would I like another hit?” Vega wonders. “I wouldn’t say no but I’m not going to chase it.”

The writing on the wall is only easy to read in hindsight. At the time it’s all a blur. I approach the wiliest of pop provocateurs Bill Drummond of the KLF an act that at the height of their success in 1992 disbanded and then deleted their entire back catalogue with the sole intent of swiftly disappearing up their own fundament. When I ask him what an artist should do once the spotlight swings elsewhere he writes me a play – or rather two “in case the first one’s shite” he helpfully explains. The plays reference Prince and 80s hitmaker Nik Kershaw and the way both leaned on the public’s endless appetite for nostalgia in order to stretch out their careers. Drummond prefers a more flamboyant gesture: the very moment any singer fails to crack the Top 40 they should offer themselves up for sacrifice. “The failed pop singer will be given the choice of a noose hanging from a gallows or a razor-sharp guillotine” he writes.

This may well suit self-sabotaging provocateurs but other artists have less appetite for creative suicide. It is true though that a future of looking back of existing solely on nostalgia is a creative cul-de-sac an eternal Groundhog Day where China in Your Hand is No 1 for ever. Steps should be taken to avoid such a fate.

When Mancunian stalwarts James for example split in 2001 frontman Tim Booth moved to northern California where he became a shaman and studied the practice of “consciousness expansion”. He only rejoined the group on the condition that they wouldn’t become a heritage act “which for me is the kiss of death”. After singer Róisín Murphy had navigated the end of her pop duo Moloko and then attempted to steer an idiosyncratic solo career with a determination Orson Welles might have admired she moved to Ibiza to focus on two things: motherhood and the Mediterranean. “Sometimes it’s nice to just relax you know” she says.

Billy Bragg realised he needed to take a pause from his career in 1990 once Margaret Thatcher had been toppled. Bragg’s antagonism towards the former prime minister had been his whole raison d’être after all. With her gone what then? “It was time for a rethink” he tells me. He got married and had a child and later eased himself back into music by then sporting a beard and plying the kind of alt-folk that would allow him to both age gracefully and bring his fans – who were also ageing – along for the ride. Occasionally he writes comment pieces for the Guardian largely to keep the spark alive. He still pops up on picket lines too. Why? “Because I’m Billy Bragg that’s what I do.”

If all bands crave headlines in their early days then So Solid Crew achieved all the wrong ones. It became increasingly easy to overlook the musical achievements of the first UK garage act to break through into the mainstream back in the early 2000s because what happened off stage became far more compelling. Several live shows were blighted by violence while members G-Man and Asher D – the latter to find fame later as the Top Boy actor Ashley Walters – were arrested for possessing handguns. Once So Solid imploded its sole female member Lisa Maffia a single mother needed to start earning again as she’d spent everything she’d accrued. “Three cars in the driveway so much jewellery clothes in abundance! Limousines!” she recalls. She launched a short-lived solo career record label and clothing line but her “brand” appeared in terminal decline. So she started her own booking agency with herself as the sole employee calling up clubs across the country masquerading as the personal assistant to one Lisa Maffia formerly of So Solid Crew now an international solo star and occasional fashion designer. Her PA “Celine” was tasked with asking clubs’ management if they’d be interested in a personal appearance.

“The bookings came in almost immediately” Maffia beams. “I hustle. Never been afraid to hustle.” She now runs a beauty salon in Margate.

Maffia has achieved what many former pop stars don’t and what Albertine for a long time couldn’t: replacing one satisfying career with another. The majority find themselves instead with an embarrassment of yawning time on their hands: how to fill it?

Some I speak to use that time as an opportunity for personal growth. David Gray and the Darkness’s Justin Hawkins discuss the growing conviction that they might have autism and ADHD respectively both convinced this played a key part in the art they made. “I love upheaval I love emotional disasters and mismanaging every relationship I’ve ever had” Hawkins suggests which sounds less like introspection than a robust embracing of who he is sod the consequences.

When the Boomtown Rats abruptly reached their dead end in 1985 singer Bob Geldof wasn’t happy. He felt they still had so much more to offer but it was Duran Duran’s turn now. Geldof slunk home drew the curtains “and I thought: ‘That’s it? It’s over? Had the best years of my life already passed? I was 30. What a brutal business pop music is.”

View image in fullscreen Despite everything he achieved with Band Aid and Live Aid Bob Geldof still hankers after the musical success he had with the Boomtown Rats. Photograph: Lynn Goldsmith/Getty Images

It was during a quiet night in – when by rights he should have been straddling a microphone stand on a stage somewhere glamorous and crucially far away – that he happened on Michael Buerk’s report from a famine-ravaged Ethiopia on the news. This gave him an unexpected new focus but here’s the thing: even after feeding the world and later a hugely successful career in business (launching the TV production company Planet 24; investing in tech) all Geldof wanted to do was to go back to music. In 2020 the Boomtown Rats average age then 66 released a new album.

“In my passport my profession is listed as musician” says Geldof “not saint.”

The Boomtown Rats reformed because bands do. It’s practically mandatory. When Tanya Donelly of 90s US indie darlings Belly quit after winning a Grammy (and promptly suffering burnout) she craved normal work and became a doula. When 10000 Maniacs’ Natalie Merchant grew tired of being a marketable commodity she quit for the quieter life of a solo artist and was then duly horrified when her debut album 1995’s Tigerlily sold 5m copies because “then came the treadmill again”. The next time she tried to retire she did so more forcefully and now teaches arts and crafts to underprivileged children in New York state. “I look at people like Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney” she says referring to the way both legends continue to tour “and I think to myself: ‘If I were you I’d just go home and enjoy my garden.’ It’s a question of temperament clearly.”

View image in fullscreen ‘I look at people like Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney and think: If I were you I’d just go home and enjoy my garden’ says Natalie Merchant of 10000 Maniacs. Photograph: Getty Images

And yet just as Donelly would ultimately return to her old band Merchant is also entertaining the idea of new music. “Maybe” she says. “My daughter is off at college now so I do have more time to myself … ”

But why? Why do they all come back? Perhaps because nothing else compares. It must be nice to be quite so loudly loved.

Even those who were scarred by their experiences still curiously hanker after it. Child reggae stars Musical Youth were a ray of early-80s sunshine when their single Pass the Dutchie sold 5m copies around the world. Once their fame elapsed and it did so with breathtaking speed one member Patrick Waite developed drug problems turned to crime and died of heart failure at 24. Another Kelvin Grant became a recluse; singer Dennis Seaton a born-again Christian. “It saved me” he tells me. Now in his mid-50s and a father of four Seaton is the chairman of the Ladder Association training committee alerting builders to the dangers of working at altitude without sufficient protection. “Which is funny I know” he shrugs as if the idea of a former pop star now doing an ordinary job boggles the mind. At weekends he still tours nightclubs to sing his famous song to crowds of people who want nothing else from him and are simply grateful to be in his orbit. “To have touched so many people let me tell you is humbling” he says.

Robbie Williams sums it up well. “I felt very driven in the early days in competition with the world and with myself.” He remains a big draw of course but 30 years in he’s no longer guaranteed hits and is now more likely to be playlisted on Smooth Radio than BBC Radio 1. But that sense of competitiveness never fully recedes. He tells me the new songs he is writing are sounding like David Bowie and Lou Reed experimental and avant garde “But do I unashamedly want to still be one of the biggest artists in the world? Yeah I do.”

And so he and so many like him linger in those margins watchful for other opportunities biding their time. They judge TV singing competitions and appear on reality shows and wait for the world to turn slowly on its axis to bring them back into fashion. Eventually everything comes back into fashion.

The midlife pop star’s best virtue then is patience and the conviction that the best might be yet to come. “I’ve had an interesting first half of my life” Williams notes. “I’d like an interesting second half too.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ras Al Khaimah one of the smaller and lesser-known of the seven emirates said earlier this year that it planned to make laws about gaming in some resorts. On the same day Las Vegas casino giant Wynn Resorts said it would build a resort approved for gaming or gambling on a man-made island.

The announcements could mark an important moment for the Gulf a part of the Middle East that has traditionally had stricter Islamic rules. Gambling has long been off-limits.

Currently those seeking to gamble go to the likes of Lebanon's Casino du Liban or some Egyptian hotels.

Yet times may be changing.

Two people with knowledge of the issue told Reuters that gambling in some form would be permitted in the UAE. But they added it would be up to each emirate to decide whether and how to make rules about it - similar to how Sharjah does not permit alcohol sales unlike other emirates. They also said the policy change would happen soon without providing an exact date.

Casino and hotel companies that have moved into the UAE could benefit should Ras Al Khaimah make the way for other emirates to follow.

Caesars Palace which opened in Dubai in 2018 and is the only one of American giant Caesars Entertainment resorts without a casino told Reuters that it would examine any possibility of offering gambling in Dubai.

About 10 km along Dubai's coast from the Caesars resort digging has begun on another area to support a new resort by Las Vegas gambling company MGM Resorts International.

When asked whether it would consider introducing gaming at the resort MGM said ""gaming has not been part of the planning and there are no updates to our plans.""

The UAE government media office as well as the media offices of the emirates of Dubai Abu Dhabi and Sharjah did not answer requests for comment on Ras Al Khaimah’s plan to permit gambling and whether they planned to make similar changes.

Competition

The possibility of gambling plays out against a situation of strong competition in the Gulf with the UAE competing with Saudi Arabia to become a popular destination in a part of the world moving away from oil.

The UAE where foreigners make up 90 percent of the population has already moved in other areas to keep first mover advantage over Saudi Arabia.

The Emirates changed to a Saturday-Sunday weekend this year to move closer to international markets. A Friday-Saturday weekend is common in many Muslim nations.

In the past 18 months the UAE has made legal changes including decriminalizing alcohol use and situations in which unmarried people live together.

The country has also found ways to offer some games of chance.

In 2020 it started a national ""Loto."" Players bought a ""collectable"" picture of a UAE scene such as the Burj al Arab hotel for $9.50. The buyers were entered into a draw. Now players seeking to enter the draw buy a bottle of water to be given to a charity to win a top prize of 10 million dirhams.

The game is considered acceptable under Islamic law because there was an ""exchange of value"" in the purchase of the collectable or bottle.

Unclear path

Ras Al Khaimah stressed that its laws being developed by the recently created Department of Entertainment and Gaming Regulation would push for responsible gaming.

The Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority did not answer Reuters questions about how its plans would work alongside the federal laws against gambling.

Vitaly Umansky a gambling industry expert at the Sanford C Bernstein investment company in Hong Kong suggested that gaming in Ras Al Khaimah would likely be limited to foreigners.

You probably don’t think of Pennsylvania but perhaps you should—especially if you live on the East Coast and are looking for a nearby destination!

“With its diversity of offerings Pennsylvania is a great place for a honeymoon” says Michael Chapaloney. “We have options for those looking for museums but we also offer fantastic—and very accessible—outdoor destinations that are paired with luxury.”

Meet the Expert Michael Chapaloney is the executive director of tourism for the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development.

That variety is precisely what makes the state such a delightful albeit unexpected option for a post-wedding vacay. From the world-class cultural centers and restaurants of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia to the shoreline of Lake Erie to the serene woodland settings of the Laurel Highlands and the Pocono Mountains there’s an option for every kind of traveler.

Read on for what to know when planning your honeymoon in Pennsylvania including average cost unique and seasonal attractions and the best hotels and resorts in the state.

Pennsylvania Honeymoon Cost

The cost of a Pennsylvania honeymoon will vary greatly based on duration accommodations activity choices travel methods and more. Accommodations can range from around $50 to over $1500 per night. In Pennsylvania you’ll pay a state tax of 7% on your hotel room plus an additional tax depending on the city or county you’re in.

Unique Pennsylvania Attractions

Per Chapaloney Pennsylvania is home to 22 ski resorts and 21 state parks. Additional bucket list-worthy sites in the state include:

Pennsylvania Honeymoon Ideas by Season

Winter

Now’s the time to hit up one of those 22 ski resorts which are predominantly located in the Pocono mountain region of Northeastern Pennsylvania and in the Laurel Highland region of Southwestern Pennsylvania. “Our mountains are great to learn on” says Chapaloney who notes that dog-sledding and snowshoeing are also popular winter activities in the state. “If you’re going to try something new like skiing together Pennsylvania is definitely the place for that experience.”

Spring

With gardens such as Longwood Gardens and Chanticleer the countryside of Philadelphia is the place to be come spring. Hershey Pennsylvania—home of you guessed it the headquarters of Hershey Chocolate and Hersheypark—is also an excellent springtime destination. “They call it ‘the sweetest place on earth’ for a reason” says Chapaloney who suggests visiting for golf the manicured gardens and the decadent spa at Hotel Hershey (more on that later.)

Summer

Come summer you really can’t go wrong in any region of the state. If it’s a waterfront destination you’re after head northwest to Lake Erie and visit Presque Isle State Park Pennsylvania’s only “seashore.”

Fall

“Vermont gets a lot of credit for their fall foliage but Pennsylvania actually has a longer season and more diversity of trees” says Chapaloney. For the best leaf-peeping opportunities visit the Pennsylvania Wilds in the north-central part of the state for long scenic drives and the chance to see wildlife in its natural element. You can also head to the Laurel Highlands or the Pocono Mountains.

For all electrical utilities R is the first letter of the alphabet. Reliability keeping the lights on comes before A affordability.

Colorado’s utility regulators soon will decide the role of Comanche 3 the state’s youngest but most unreliable coal-fired power plant in ensuring reliability and whether more natural gas generation will be required.

Xcel Energy the operator and primary owner of the 750-megawatt coal plant wants to keep the plant operating on limited then seasonal-only terms until 2034. It says the plant will meet peak demands during winter and summer. Several state agencies plus other groups have concurred.

Evidence for Comanche 3 serving this purpose is thin. All fossil fuel plants must occasionally be idled for repairs and maintenance. Comanche 3 has been first in this class. A 2021 report by the Public Utilities Commission staff found the coal unit from 2010 to 2020 “had the lowest availability” of all of Xcel’s coal and gas-fueled units in Colorado.

Comanche 3 was down for most of 2020. It’s down again this year and until June at the earliest it won’t be generating any more electricity than a solar panel at midnight. At least the solar panels that now surround the plant on the edge of Pueblo generate electricity when the sun shines.

This should provide no comfort to Xcel customers in Grand Junction or Denver Sterling or Alamosa who expect air conditioning if temperatures soar to 116 degrees as happened in Portland last summer.

In a March meeting two of the three PUC commissioners reported seeing no good argument for the plant operating beyond 2029. John Gavan the commissioner from Paonia was adamant in that. Megan Gilman the commissioner from Edwards was more inclined to kick the decision down the road until next year. Eric Blank the chair of the PUC who is from Boulder observed that requiring the early retirement would in effect make the PUC responsible for ensuring reliability.

What may matter immensely is that Comanche 3 still hasn’t been paid off.

How different from just 18 years ago when Comanche 3 was approved unanimously by a different set of PUC commissioners. Utilities and their regulators in 2004 saw a future that looked much like the past giant coal plants gobbled coal from mines in Wyoming and Colorado. The plant that PUC commissioners approved was expected to continue operations until 2070.

Winds of change were even then picking up. Colorado Green the state’s first wind farm had begun operations between Lamar and Springfield earlier that year. That November voters approved the state’s first renewable portfolio standard. Xcel easily met that initial 10% requirement years in advance of the deadline.

Today Comanche 3 looks like a billion-dollar blunder. If ensuring winter lights or summer chillers is the goal the relative grandfathers of Xcel’s coal-burning fleet Hayden 1 and 2 completed in 1965 and 1976 respectively might be better options for ensuring reliability. They’re currently scheduled to close in 2027 and 2028.

Xcel and other Colorado utilities now say with confidence they can achieve 80% carbon-free energy by 2030. Nobody however claims complete confidence in existing technologies and business models to go even higher than 90%. Holy Cross the electrical provider for the Aspen and Vail areas has a goal of 100%. Inconveniently it also owns 8% of Comanche 3. CORE Electric Cooperative which serves Castle Rock and other south-metro suburbs and exurbs owns 25% of the plant.

Xcel wants more natural gas generation to ensure reliability. This could potentially result in the better part of $1 billion in new infrastructure. But would those assets be stranded by new technology in another 20 years?

A decision may not be immediately necessary. In 2016 the last time Xcel submitted a plan to state regulators it also wanted a ton of new natural gas generation. When it went shopping it got bids for renewable generation in late 2017 that dropped jaws across the nation. The economics of renewables had become compelling.

Now reliability remains a concern but many ideas are percolating. Homes will likely become energy sources the batteries of electric vehicles supplying household needs when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. The grid increasingly will be two-way and with dispersed energy sources. Today’s electric grid that relies on a few big coal plants in a decade will look as quaint as a desk phone from … well 2004.

By late next year we’ll have a much better idea whether new natural gas plants will be needed for reliability. As for Comanche 3 if it were a car it’d already be in the automotive graveyard.

Plante was joined by a cast of mostly junior varsity players on the ice for the Hawks’ 7-3 loss to the Wildcats after the rest of the squad was exposed to COVID-19 during their Section 7A semifinal game against Virginia/Mountain Iron-Buhl.

Plante a Minnesota Duluth commit was eligible for the game because of a shoulder injury he suffered against Duluth East earlier in the season and hadn’t played in the section tournament.

Despite a herculean effort from Plante Dodge County’s Brody Lamb a Minnesota commit scored six goals as the Wildcats eliminated Hermantown.

Plante’s shoulder wasn’t 100% healed for the game but Hawks’ coach Pat Andrews said he played an “ungodly” amount of minutes — more than 40 of the 51-minute game.

“As a mom I was really concerned about that” Zam’s mother Kristi Plante said. “I went into it with a pit in my stomach knowing that he wasn’t at 100% but knowing he was going to give it his all because it was just such a tough time for the team.”

In the Xcel Energy Center locker room in St. Paul Plante made it his mission to return to the team this season and bring a state title home.

“It was unbelievable what he did in that state quarterfinal last year against Dodge County” Andrews said. “He was phenomenal and the whole state got to see it. He took it personally that he had let us down and I couldn’t have been more proud of anybody. He didn’t let us down at all — he gave us a chance but he felt like he let us down because he’s so competitive. So his goal coming back was to win a state championship.”

Plante and Hermantown returned to St. Paul last month for the state tournament — varsity squad in tow — and picked up the three wins they needed to bring the state championship home.

Plante led the Hawks with 24 goals including the final two goals in Hermantown’s 3-2 win over Warroad in the state championship game and now he’s added Duluth News Tribune All-Area Player of the Year to his growing list of honors.

Hermantown certainly returned a supremely talented team — which included fellow UMD commit and All-Area first-team selection Ty Hanson as well as second-team members Beau Janzig and little brother Max Plante — but the 2021-22 season was anything but a coronation for Plante.

“Zam’s compete his hard work is through the roof” Andrews said. “He worked really hard to get himself back. He played in the Hlinka Gretzky Cup over in Europe last summer for Team USA and did really well…he was playing tremendous hockey when he got back last November and then the third game of the season he gets hurt again.”

After a highlight reel goal to top Benilde-St. Margaret’s in the Hawks’ season-opener Plante suffered another shoulder injury in the his third game against Wayzata.

“I was coming off the ice against Wayzata and the bench started going crazy” Max said. “Then I looked behind and Zam’s sitting there on the ice and he’s just mad and you know something’s up.”

Initially thought to be season-ending Plante’s injury didn’t require surgery but it required a more than month on the bench and a lot of rehab.

“I was like it’s already happened the only thing you can do is try to get better so when you get the opportunity to come back you can be the best you can be” Plante said. “It really sucked and I was down for a little bit but the guys definitely helped me get back up and get back out there.”

Kristi herself a standout basketball player at Duluth East and UMD said while it’s never easy to see your child go through an injury there was a benefit.

“As an athlete you learn a lot being hurt being on the bench and not able to play” she said. “It motivates you more but you also see the game from a different standpoint.”

Plante listened to his doctors and did the things he needed to do to come back not just 100% but perhaps better than before and while he was sidelined something else happened.

“Once he found out that he would be able to come back he dug his heels in and worked his butt off to come back” Andrews said. “In the meantime our whole team got better because everyone had to step up. So now Zam came back to a team that was better and he was motivated and I think it showed at the end. It wasn’t a Plante victory it was an entire team victory.”

‘It’s all I can remember’

With a Stanley Cup winner for a father current UMD assistant head coach Derek Plante and legendary Hermantown coach Bruce Plante for his grandfather hockey has been a part of the fabric of Plante’s life.

“I don’t remember a time where I wasn’t into hockey” Plante said. “That’s what I remember doing … I was born in Germany because he was playing hockey and my life has kind of revolved around hockey since the day I was born. It’s all I can remember.”

Kristi said she and Derek were living in a few different apartments when Zam was first born but right away he had a hockey stick much to the chagrin of some of their neighbors.

“I remember in the apartment buildings the people below us had a couple of comments because they could hear the stick tapping underneath from where we were” Kristi said. “He’s grown up with it it’s really all he’s ever known — he was definitely born into it.”

Andrews said Plante is clearly gifted but the natural ability he was gifted with is not the reason he’s developed into one of the top hockey prospects in the state.

“He is naturally talented but it’s not natural talent” Andrews said. “He absolutely works his butt off he absolutely competes and has worked his skill set through the roof. His hockey IQ is through the roof but that is literally a result of the amount of time he spends watching and playing hockey. What you see on the ice is the result of a tremendous amount of work and effort and pain and blood sweat and tears.”

Sometimes Plante’s competitive streak means he is demanding of his teammates and coaches but they know he holds himself to the highest standards Andrews said and the competitiveness becomes “contagious.”

“They understand that Zam is a generational talent and they want to be around him they want to play with him” Andrews said. “I know they all want to get better and Zam makes them better. Good players want to play with the best players and it doesn’t get much better than Zam.”

Plante said sometimes he offers “constructive criticism” but it’s always with an eye toward improving and lifting up his teammates never to tear them down. He also acknowledged their role in what he and the team have achieved.

“I couldn’t be here without the guys helping me every day pushing me to be better” Plante said. “When I got hurt at the beginning of the year they helped me get better as the season went on. When I got back they helped me get to the best I can be so at the end we’re state champs. That’s all I could ask for.”

Rochester MN (KROC-AM News) - The Rochester City Council is being asked to consider whether Rochester should issue Municipal Identification Cards.

The Rochester Public Library will be making a presentation to the elected officials during the City Council Study Session Monday afternoon. According to the meeting's agenda the proposal was brought to the public library by the Southeastern Minnesota Interfaith Immigrant Legal Defense organization.

Rochester city website Rochester city website loading...

The presentation indicates federal law allows city governments to issue their own identification cards and ""do not have to consider the immigration or criminal status of an applicant before doing so."" New Haven Connecticut has the distinction of being the first city in the nation to issue municipal ID cards in 2007. Northfield became the first Minnesota community to issue municipal identification cards last summer.

Under the proposal applicants would have to produce two pieces of documentation to prove their eligibility. One would have to come from a list of Primary ID Documents:

Minnesota driver's license or ID card

Passport issued by the US or another country

Minnesota Tribal ID card

Permanent resident card or so-called ""Green Card""

W2

The second document could come from a list of secondary IDs:

A Drivers license or ID card for any state

Social Security Card

Certified Birth Certificate from any nation

Certified Marriage Certificate

Certified Secondary or Post-secondary School Transcript

If an applicant did not have any of those documents they could also present a proof of residency document that is dated within 30 days of the application:

Utility Bill

Employment Pay Stub

Insurance Bill

Federal or State Income Tax or Refund Statement

Written Verification of Residence From Homeless Shelter Hospital or Social Services Agency

If the plan is approved by the City Council it's anticipated Municipal ID Cards issued by the public library could be used to access municipal services such as the public library. It's also anticipated that could be used by people seeking access to services offered by Olmsted County and picking up mail.

Supporters say pharmacies may also allow their use in picking up some prescriptions and some banks may allow for the caching of checks by a person presenting a Municipal ID Card. The presentation to the City Council also touts them as a low-cost and low-barrier solution for people with disabilities and those ineligible for a driver's license. It also contends the program could improve relationships with law enforcement agencies and build shared civic pride and community identity.

PAUL Minn. (AP) — Jared Spurgeon scored his second goal of the game 1:05 into overtime tipping a shot from Kevin Fiala to send the Minnesota Wild to the playoffs with a 5-4 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Sunday.

Fiala Dmitry Kulikov and Matt Boldy also scored and Marc-Andre Fleury made 26 saves to help Minnesota wrap up its 12th playoff berth.

The Wild have 101 points one behind St. Louis for second place in the Central Division after the Blues beat Nashville on Sunday. The Predators and idle Dallas have 91 points as the top-two wild card teams.

""We almost got what we deserved tonight"" Minnesota coach Dean Evason said. ""We were very fortunate really to have success in that game. We talked after the game that it's rare that we even talk about this anymore. So it has to be a one-off. For the most part here now for a long time we've played the right way.""

Rudolfs Balcers Matt Nieto Noah Gregor and Nick Bonino scored for San Jose. The Sharks trailed 2-0 midway through the first period then nearly stalled Minnesota's playoff bid for a day.

James Reimer stopped 23 shots for the Sharks. They are winless in their last 10 games and were coming off a 2-1 loss in Dallas the previous night. Six of the losses have come by one goal three in overtime and one in a shootout.

""It's frustrating"" Nieto said. ""I'm not going to lie. It sucks but we have to find a way to end this thing.""

The Wild controlled the ice early looking like a team headed to the playoffs against the struggling Sharks.

Kulikov scored his sixth goal of the season after Fiala skated across the slot and gave the defenseman a drop pass. Just 1:25 later Spurgeon sent a shot from deep at the corner blue line through traffic to beat Reimer.

Balcers scored his 10th goal before the end of the first with a wrist shot. Thomas Bordeleau making his NHL debut for San Jose recovered the puck and passed to Balcers for his first career assist.

Nieto tied it 1:19 into the second with his sixth goal.

Minnesota took another lead on Boldy's 14th goal but the Sharks answered again when Fleury gave up a rebound right in front and Gregor was there to score his fifth of the season.

""We were happy with our first"" Spurgeon said. ""And the second I thought we were just trying to do too much and being too fancy. I guess you could call it soft. Just trying to make plays that weren't there and fed right into their game and then gave them some life. So obviously talked about it between the third that that's not going to work come playoff time and we got to sort of shore it up here.""

After Bonino gave San Jose its first lead 1:37 into the third Fiala tied it by deflecting a shot from Jordie Benn as he was leaping in front of Reimer.

Fiala added three assists including one on Spurgeon's game-winner. He has six goals and six assists in his last six games.

""It's always nice to make the playoffs"" Fiala said. ""We're here right now but it's nothing. It's regulation and we have still seven more to go. And still the second place still the home advantage there we want to take. And from there it starts. The playoff is not here yet.""

Fiala appeared to make contact with Reimer's glove as the shot was deflected in. Sharks coach Bob Boughner said the team considered challenge Fiala's goal but felt Fiala was out of the crease and wasn't sure if the call would be overturned.

In the end it was another one-goal loss.

""It's crazy how close we are on a lot of nights"" Boughner said. ""I've never been through anything like this as a coach or as a player losing this many games. ... It's our job to try and draw on the positives especially with nine rookies in the lineup tonight is trying to provide a lot of teaching at this point of the season.

There's a lot of good going on and you'll never see it in the win-loss column right now.""

BORDELEAU NOT ALONE

Bordeleau the second-round pick in the 2020 draft by San Jose became the 18th rookie to suit up for the team this season a new franchise record and tied for the ninth-most in a single season in NHL history.

The 20-year-old signed a three-year contract Saturday after playing with the University of Michigan this season where he had had 11 goals and 25 assists in 36 games.

ADDING ON

Minnesota with a six-game point streak continues its run at franchise records. The Wild reached 47 wins and 101 points this season. It's the most points in team history after 75 games and the fifth time in history they've surpassed 100 points.

Minnesota is two wins and five points away from its franchise records sent in 2016-17. The Wild are 15-2-4 in their last 21 games and lead the NHL in points since March 8.

The restrictions by McLean and Mercer counties both in the heart of North Dakota coal country came as concerns mounted in 2020 that Coal Creek Station North Dakota’s largest coal-fired power plant would be shuttered and see much of its electrical generation replaced by wind turbines. McLean County first adopted zoning restrictions making it harder to connect to a valuable transmission line tied to the coal plant while neighboring Mercer County followed up with a two year moratorium on new wind projects.

While North Dakota leaders rallied to find a new owner for Coal Creek Station and rescue the plant from shutting down coal advocates and renewable energy companies have been hard at work negotiating new policies for wind development in coal country.

McLean County which is home to Coal Creek Station is slated to hold a hearing Monday April 18 on amendments to its zoning rules that could roll back restrictions added two years ago. A draft proposal has been workshopped by county officials and a Virginia-based clean energy company looking to build the state’s largest wind farm near Coal Creek Station.

Just over the Missouri River Mercer County has already adopted a new ordinance laying the groundwork for local wind policy ahead of an expiration date on the county’s wind moratorium early next month.

But the decision by Mercer County officials came as a surprise to a group of wind and coal industry stakeholders who had been collaborating to develop a new ordinance for the commission. A Facebook post by the grassroots group Faces of North Dakota Coal which is part of the working group collaborating with the wind industry in Mercer County called the decision ""the worst possible"" outcome and said it ""ensures that this 'political football' won't go away anytime soon.""

A tale of two counties

Both McLean and Mercer counties are located on top of vast stores of lignite coal have advantageous conditions for wind farms and are hubs for valuable transmission lines whose space for new energy generation is tight.

In McLean State's Attorney Ladd Erickson the architect of the county's wind restrictions has been fielding input from local groups and renewable energy companies to craft new rules for renewable energy development.

Earlier this year the terms of the Coal Creek transfer between its current owner the Minnesota-based Great River Energy and incoming owner the Bismarck-based Rainbow Energy Marketing were amended to include plans for a 400 megawatt wind farm near the power plant in McLean County. A project of the Virginia-based Apex Clean Energy the development would be the largest stand-alone wind farm in North Dakota.

McLean County commission chair Steve Lee said the Apex project is estimated to require tens of thousands of acres. While local officials aren’t looking to impede the large project Lee said they want to pass an ordinance that accounts for the sentiments of both landowners who want turbines on their property and those who do not.

“There’s a balancing act” he said. “We want to protect our property owners and their rights but we certainly don’t want to jeopardize Coal Creek Station.”

According to a working draft of the proposed new amendments supplied by Erickson McLean County and Apex are in agreement on much of the contents though several unresolved items remain. Those include one provision that would allow county officials to reject a permit application if the project could have a “material adverse impact” for property values agriculture or wildlife another provision requiring a wind developer to have buyers for their power prior to permitting and a third provision allowing the commission wide latitude to deny project locations by creating ""avoidance"" areas.

In comments submitted ahead of Monday’s hearing Apex said it has “significant concerns” about the provision allowing the county to designate these ""avoidance"" areas. Wind farms require years of planning analysis environmental studies and regulatory hoops and the company said “it is essential” for local requirements to be clear “up front and equally applied to all projects.”

One of the major restrictions applied by McLean County two years ago was a one mile buffer from the Missouri River and its reservoirs for turbines and power lines a provision that blocks wind farms needing a way to connect to the transmission line over the water. The proposed amendments retain that rule but provide an exception for transmission lines “that must cross” the water.

Erickson declined to comment for this story ahead of Monday's hearing. After the announcement of the Apex project the McLean County state's attorney said local reception for the wind farm remained to be seen.

“Some areas might be receptive and some areas not. I think it’s all gonna be about the location"" he said at the time.

The path forward for wind is less clear-cut in Mercer County where the moratorium is set to lapse next month but recent actions by the commission have left wind and coal industry stakeholders confused and unsure of next steps.

County commissioners there voted 3-2 last week to adopt a new ordinance laying the groundwork for a local wind policy if the moratorium is allowed to expire. Commissioner Gene Wolf who backed passing the ordinance said the county needed to stop ""kicking this can down the road"" and get rules into place before the moratorium's expiration date. Changes could be made later to finalize the ordinance he said.

The county’s decision came as a surprise to a group of coal and wind industry representatives who had been collaborating to develop an ordinance agreeable to both sides. The working group which Mercer County commissioners designated last July to tackle several areas of contention in the zoning rules included representatives from Faces of North Dakota Coal and NextEra Energy which is pursuing the proposed Garrison Butte wind farm in Mercer.

Faces of North Dakota Coal member Mark Pierce said the county’s decision to move forward without their task force's input felt like the “carpet was pulled out from underneath” them. He said that while the coal advocacy group and the wind industry don't see eye to eye on everything they were making headway and had ironed out most of their disagreements.

The ordinance that Mercer County passed has numerous gaps and errors Pierce said and is “effectively a ban” on new wind farms in the area. He added that if the county uses the newly passed ordinance to develop its long-term wind policy as several commissioners have said they intend to do it will result in a “procedural quagmire.”

The day before the Mercer County commission passed its new rules representatives from Faces of North Dakota Coal and NextEra sent a joint-letter to the commission asking them for a 60 day extension and urging them not to pass a different ordinance. The May expiration date on the moratorium wasn't a pressing deadline they added since they were not aware of any wind projects that would be imminently filing for permits in Mercer County including NextEra's.

Clay Cameron a project developer at NextEra Energy and Mark Pierce a member of the grassroots group Faces of North Dakota Coal told Mercer County commissioners on Wednesday July 7 2021 that they would collaborate to hash out differences over a local policy governing new wind development in the county which is currently under a wind moratorium.

Mercer County Commission Chair Travis Frey said he supports the county reopening for wind development but stressed the importance of preserving landowner coal sector and tourism interests at the same time.

“Is it going to be the easiest county for you to have a wind farm? No” said Frey. “We’re just saying that if you’re going to be part of this community we’re not going to trade coal for you.”

Frey voted against passage of the new ordinance last week but he said he thinks it's a good document to work from as the county continues to craft a longer-term wind policy. He added that the commission tasked the NextEra and Faces of North Dakota Coal representatives with a narrow task of finding resolution on two sticking points but the two sides came back with separate edits on the entire ordinance.

Remaining points of disagreement in the new ordinance include two provisions that would require a wind developer to show that they have a buyer for their power within six months of approval and that they include an agreement with grid operators to connect to the grid in their permit application. In a red-line document supplied by Frey NextEra asked that both of those provisions be struck from the ordinance entirely.

Pierce said that while he supported the moratorium in Mercer County two years ago he viewed it as a short-term solution. The reality is that many people place a premium on the green energy produced by wind turbines and his county has the opportunity to create a “blueprint” for how coal and renewable energy can work together.

“A wind ordinance that nobody likes in its entirety"" but which provides a road map for the two industries going forward ""probably will end up being a good ordinance” he said.
